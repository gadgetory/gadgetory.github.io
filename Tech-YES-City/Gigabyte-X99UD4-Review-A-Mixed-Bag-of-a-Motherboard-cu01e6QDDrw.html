good run it's not the gigabyte
welcome back to take est belated general
is brown coming back to you guys today
with a video about the x99 gigabyte UD
for this motherboard is definitely one
of those motherboards that looks good on
the surface but when you start taking a
close look at this motherboard you
realize that there was a lot of things
that gigabyte could have done a lot
better to make this motherboard a winner
in my opinion but anyway let's talk
about this mixed bag today we'll quickly
look at what's in the box and then we'll
look at the features until mic test for
you guys look at some power consumption
figures then we'll move on to a
conclusion so soon as you have the
unifor you'll notice that it is boxed
extremely well and in some ways I'd say
it's - a box - well and this is one of
the things straight away that I noticed
with the unifor it seems like this time
gigabyte have really gone and spiced up
the cosmedix
not just with the box but with the
motherboard and everything else and it
feels like and this is gonna be the main
theme of this review it feels like
they've done that at the cost of
functionality and that's my biggest
gripe with this x99 new d4 is the fact
that gigabyte have spiced everything up
cosmetically but at the expense of
taking away features which I feel our
necessity on an enthusiast grade
motherboard so as soon as you get the
box you'll notice straight away that
there's things like braided SATA cables
there's a solid sli connections there
for 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 Way SLI as well but as soon
as you take the motherboard out of the
actual sleeving you'll notice that it
comes up it's actually a nice looking
product as you see here we've got an
ultra durable heatsink up the top here
and then you've got the gigabyte
heatsink down the bottom here with it
when they're kind of going with the
orange black and silver theme and it
honestly doesn't look too bad like
cosmetically this thing looks pretty
good I think it looks like a mid-range
motherboard especially on the enthusiast
line and it certainly performs above
that when it comes to the vrm solution
so looking at the vrm solution here
we've got an eight phase-- power design
with two phases being for the left 4
dims and 2 phases being for the right 4
dens and then you've got four phases
dedicated to the CPU itself and so this
is an interesting thing right most of
the other competitors are going with 12
5
power designs which generally have eight
phases dedicated to the CPU and one
thing I've noticed with this CPU with
this vrm sorry is when it's delivering
power to the CPU it does it a lot better
than the competitors are doing it like
the as rock and the MSI that had come
through here this vrm I mean the whole
thing the whole motherboard and the CPU
have clocked at the same speeds at the
same voltages used up about 40 to 50
maybe even 60 watts less than the msi
x99s ROK x99 so gigabyte definitely know
what they're doing when it comes to
implementing a VRM this one's got 60 amp
chokes on there I mean there's some of
the best in the business there they've
got decent MOSFETs again I always put
good MOSFETs on their boards as well as
solid 10k rated capacitors as well and
now another thing about this board is it
does feel really solid so we'll look at
over the side here they've gone with a
gray and black theme for the dims there
and looking at the top here we don't
have many connections we've only really
got the 12-volt CPU pin connection there
which I would like to see it on the
other side of the board I think that's a
better spot it was actually pretty hard
to get to it here over the right side of
the board but moving down there we've
got a ATX 24 pence leave connection
there we've got our 10 SATA ports there
was six of them being able to be in raid
configurations the for not being able
there you've also got a solder Express
port there on the side
moving down the bottom here we've got
our front panel connections there for
our power HDD lights and stuff like that
and another thing I will say about
gigabyte is they've done with a smart
design on the connections I like the
fact that they put the USB front out on
the bottom of the motherboard this is
actually a really good spot I think the
best spot besides that you've got more
front USB 2 front outs there and also
looking at the fan connections there it
looks like we've got five faring
connections in total to being cysts CPUs
and three being system fans as well so
as we go through the connections here
we've got a TPM connection ace auxilary
4 pin connector there which is in a
really nice spot and really concealed I
like that again that's another good
design with this motherboard moving over
here we've got front panel out audio
options there and then moving up here
we've got a total of
PCI Express lanes of 416 speed lanes
there and three minis there so PCI
Express one speed slots there in the
middle of the board we got an m2 status
spot as well as a PCI mini slot as well
so they've definitely given you all the
connectivity you need as well as the
fact that the PCI Express slots are all
evenly spaced out as well so this board
will I think support up to four-way SLI
or crossfire really good board in that
regard though you will need a 59 30 K or
a 59 60 X the 5820k will not support
four-way SLI just keep that in mind so
moving down the board here we'll see
we've got a dual BIOS here and this is
my first problem with his motherboard
there's no selection switched for it so
you can see here they've got a fancy led
on this heat thing that put LED trace
lighting on the right here that put blue
LEDs on the back they've even gone to
the lengths of putting white LEDs on the
rear of the motherboard but they've
failed to put in a simple thing like a
switch for the boss they've also missing
a clear CMOS switch which I really do
think is a convenient thing to have on a
motherboard save you're getting the
screwdriver and hitting the board every
time but that's something that I feel
they could have instead of putting all
these fancy LEDs on here they could have
simply put in those two switches and I
would have been a lot happier so let's
look at gigabytes audio amp up
technology when I put this through the
hoops man it didn't do as well as the
extreme six for example I feel like this
is where I'm disappointed with all these
LEDs and I'll keep going on about that
because the mic in that was pretty good
and I'll do a tester on that later but
the line in that started producing noise
after a volume level of 80 which I've
never had that on a motherboard before
they've always I've always been able to
turn them up to 100 and there's been no
noise on the line in this introduced is
noise on the line in when we look at the
audio out there again crosstalk levels
that are similar to that of a 50-dollar
motherboard I was surprised I was like
what this is not a good experience it's
a loud experience but it's not a good
one the bass roll-off was also a little
bit bigger than the extreme six as well
so that's something that gigabyte might
want to think about instead of putting
fancy LEDs on maybe they should put
better caps on and give you try and give
the the customer a better audio
experience that's one thing I'm
disappointed about function they've gone
with cosmetics over function which makes
me disappointed so looking at the rear
of this motherboard we got two ps2 ports
which is actually interesting I don't
know anyone who ever uses a ps2 mouse or
even if you'd want to use a ps2 mouse
but appears to a keyboard slot
definitely a good thing we've got four
USB to ports there we've got four USB 3
ports with the bottom one here being
dedicated to gigabytes auto flash so if
you plug it in you don't even need a CPU
in there you can flash the BIOS that's
actually a pretty good feature I like
that below that we've got two more USB
three out there and a Intel and I see
there the i21 8v really good one of the
best onboard and I see as you can get
here we've got a 7.1 channel HD audio
out here with a mic in your standard
audio out and line in there and then
your analog connections in an optical
out so you'll notice that there is no
clear CMOS which I'm disappointed about
even the x99 from em aside the budget
entry-level x99 board had one of these
so ed let's move on I'll take a quick
look at the BIOS which is actually
pretty impressive and we'll talk about a
problem with that as well then we'll
move on to the mic test ok so here's a
quick look at the BIOS there's three
different modes you can choose from that
it also scales to 1440p as well myself I
like the classic menu as I'm just quite
simply used to it and everything I know
where everything is and I know all the
settings from the past but there's just
so much detail in this BIOS there's so
many things you can do that you probably
couldn't do it another bias as well
however yeah and amoenus profiles and
everything like that but it's just a
really feature packed BIOS I really do
like it and I am pretty impressed by it
as well so good thing from gigabyte here
okay so let's talk about the onboard
audio solution quickly and just like the
Xtreme six well I'm actually going to
use the extreme six for this example but
I'll play you guys a clip quickly from
some of my previous recordings on the UD
4 directly from the motherboard line in
so if you've been on the PC for a while
you may have experience with a thing
called a gaming headset and if you're
even further into the audio
well you may have experience with the
thing called an audiophile grade can now
the latter is in my opinion clearly
better than the former that is gaming
headsets just simply don't match up to a
good audiophile grade can and as you can
see there that was done at 30 DB at a
volume of 30 or 50 sorry and there was
absolutely no noise or pretty very
little noise coming into the mic in so
gigabyte with the UT for they've done a
really good job in pretty much the same
as the as work extreme sticks on the mic
in and that it introduces little to no
noise let's talk about the audio out
though that was something that I think
needs a little bit of work it was
extremely loud I'd say about two times
as loud as this three times as loud as
most other onboard audio solutions so if
you want to blow up your eardrums this
onboard solution will be for you but I
thought that the crosstalk levels were
pretty bad it'd be similar to what some
of the cheapest motherboard solutions
i've heard the as well as the bass
roll-off that was a little bit bad as
well though the line in as well
something with the line in is that after
volume levels of 80 on the input it
would introduce noise as well which was
surprising so something I'd like to see
them do is improve a little bit on the
onboard audio especially when they got
things like this led beat phase which
I'll quickly show you guys
so as you can see there it's basically a
frequency where it responds to and will
light up these fancy lights I wish they
could have taken that away and put that
sort of money into better caps and a
better onboard audio solution itself so
there you know that fancy fancy lights
it really doesn't like I don't know
who's going to be showing their
motherboard at a party you know maybe a
cool stereo system that might be cool
but an onboard audio solution I don't
know why there's fancy LED lights on it
anyway so the on board early solution
could use a bit of a touch-up I think
though what you're hearing now is pretty
much indicative of what you will hear
from the gigabyte u d4 if you plug a
microphone directly into the mic in so
anyway let's move on now to some power
consumption figures we'll look at as
well the performance figures as well so
now when it came to power consumption
this motherboard did really well is the
most efficient motherboard that I've
tested out of the whole x19 I'm other
wars that have come through here really
efficient does a fantastic job 320 watts
on a bronze rated power supply at 4
gigahertz it's about one point one one
volt and so you can see when we contrast
that to the x99 extreme 6 in the msi sli
plus off the top of my head there are
about 370 380 watts so there definitely
was is definitely have a more efficient
vrm solution it definitely stayed really
cool and it didn't even hint of I've
never heard I haven't heard any stories
of them blowing out yet so you might
definitely know what it definitely not
they're doing when it comes to
implementing a vrm solution that's one
thing that we can we all know about
gigabyte but other than that the
performance figures when I compared a
Cinebench score to the extreme 6 it lost
by a little bit it's very marginal you
could put that down to variants it does
not matter at all these were the exact
same clocks with on the memory and the
CPU so nothing to be in terms of
performance there's no difference
between this and the extreme 6 in terms
of just the motherboard itself so anyway
that being said let's move on now to a
conclusion where I'll talk about this
mixed bag of a motherboard and I'll let
you guys know what I think and some
final thoughts let's move on
so we conclusion what can I say about
the gigabyte UT for welcome mixed bag as
you guys known from the intro and that's
a mixed bag because the vrm solution is
you guys saw it's one of the best there
is I mean you look at there's power
consumption results that's impressive
right
beats the competitors not by just a
little bit by a significant amount in my
opinion so they know what they're doing
when it comes to implementing a vrm
solution really good job that ran cool
and quiet
the overclocks when the BIOS wasn't
crashing the overclocks were perfectly
stable over clapping this thing and the
features in the bus was a breeze it was
really good I liked what I liked
gigabytes BIOS basically there's all the
features you could ask for same with the
asrock as well but when we moved on to
other things like the onboard audio
solution it disappointed me you know
that the crosstalk levels were pretty
high the line-in introduced annoys the
and alls it was it was just this really
loud volume and it wasn't a good it was
quantity over quality basically there
was things missing like the clear CMOS
button there was things missing like the
file selection switch which I believe in
necessities on an enthusiast line
motherboard looking at the other
connection points though though really
good the whole board was really good in
terms of the connectivity things were
really placed out well they've gone with
a matte black look as well which is not
bad and I'm glad to report that this
board does not get contaminated as well
so if you've seen my MSI motherboard
that got contaminated this one's got the
right it's been done right basically
matte black that done that's done right
this won't get contaminated anyway
looking at other things on this
motherboard yeah it's got these LEDs
which I mean they do look good but the
fact again if the onboard audio was good
and the BIOS did not crash then this
motherboard would be getting recommended
if it had those buttons as well
functionality and cosmetics okay but
they've gone with cosmetics over
functionality and that's my biggest
crime with the gigabyte UD 4 I would
have liked up to him get rid of all
these fancy LEDs and give us a better on
board OD solution a BIOS selection
switch a clear CMOS and then the BIOS
that doesn't crash and that's the reason
I gave this board a long time before I
reviewed it and I simply can't recommend
because it still crashes and so if
you're getting a x99 CPU like a 5820k
and you're overclocking it and it starts
crashing you might think that something
else is wrong but it's actually the
motherboards fault in this case a lot of
people are messaging me like hey my
gigabyte advisor crashes for me it
started crashing alot but then I
upgraded to the f10 BIOS and that seemed
to evade only crash maybe at once every
two weeks but it's still it's
unacceptable for an enthusiast line
product and so the reason I gave this
board a good chance but it kind of
failed me in a few more ways than one
and it's all these little things that
add up together to make it not so not a
real big recommendation here anyway so
if you guys want a motherboard that
works I'd probably be going with the
asrock series of motherboards they've
done a great job on the x99 line I mean
they don't look as good as the
competitors in my opinion but they the
function is just there these things work
everything makes perfect sense with the
asrock motherboards as opposed to this
time around I'm just left scratching my
head I mean if the boss worked and the
onboard audio was better I could give
this a recommendation but it's just
those two things together it just really
lets this motherboard down so no guys I
hope you enjoyed this review if you did
please give it a thumbs up if you have
any questions about the gigabyte x99 ut4
then please leave a comment in the
comment section below and i'll catch you
guys with the review or a tech video
very shortly peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
