files into one build you get the Rotten
Tomatoes
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
video on a project that sort of has one
fail in one area and then another fail
in another area and then another failing
of the area and we mix it in for one
gaming pc which is by far some of the
worst value-for-money that i've done
today
however it can still play games and it
still does show decent performance so
with that being said let's get on with
the prices of these parts then we'll get
on with the cleanse the building then
the benchmarks
you
so there it is for you guys the
benchmarks speak a thousand words and
then some and we had here just one build
that was completely fail especially when
I compared it to some of the other
builds that I've done in the past
notably the $200 Dark Souls 3 PC which
would have slaughtered this thing in
every single benchmark notably GTA 5 as
well now one thing about this benchmark
and one thing about this rig is that I
couldn't overclock it as much as I'd
like to because when I started
overclocking it I started getting into
problems and I spent hours and hours
going what could it be
is it the motherboard is it the CPU and
I realized that it was actually the
memory I had been sold 800 megahertz
memory that was actually 667 megahertz
memory and now on this platform it is
crucial that you get some good memory
especially if you want to overclock this
platform and what that a meant was that
I could only overclock this thing around
10% now which meant that the overclocks
was severely limited on this platform
though the problems didn't stop there
the motherboard itself had severely
limited options when it came to
overclocking especially on that FSB
termination voltage and also on the
Northbridge voltage I was surprised the
way what happened here but also not only
that the first dim slot wouldn't
recognize more than one gigabyte of
memory so I kind of had this problem
where we only had seven gigabytes of
usable memory yes I did try very
cleaning that dim slot try putting in
different memory tried switching over
memory even stuff that wasn't the eBay
stuff and it just wouldn't recognize
over 1 gigabyte which is kind of
unfortunate and then we had the water
loop which was mediocre at best I mean a
good air cooler on the CPU would give
you exactly the same result and if I was
buying a used air cooler like I have
done with a lot of my builds I would
have got much better price performance
the GPU however did sport some decent
temperatures there with this water
cooling loop and I'm kind of glad that
that was the area where it kind of gave
a big advantage even though I was
limited by the 6970 and that it wouldn't
go past 900 50 megahertz without
crashing however in hindsight I'm
actually really glad I did this build
because I got to throw in all the fail
together to make something that actually
still works and then even though it
doesn't play the latest titles at the
best frame rates it still plays some of
those really popular titles to date at
decent framerate so I'm happy with that
though I
would have loved to have overclocked
this thing especially to higher levels
to see how would perform in those latest
titles and I am confident that it could
play GTA 5 better with lower settings
and higher overclocks
though we'll save that to another day
when I get a LGA 771 again and a better
motherboard and definitely some better
memory in though ultimately in the
future when you're telling your kids
those epic tales of how you built those
gaming pcs that were just awesome value
for money this is that PC that just gets
locked in the shed and you never tell
anyone about it it's the one that got
away so you guys if you enjoyed the $220
rotten tomato then you know what to do
drop a comma in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you soon as I
can and if you liked this video be sure
to hit that like button and I'll catch
you in the next tag video very soon
peace out for now bye
well well I guess the Microsoft economic
keyboard is in drum proof
Oh
Oh Braco this bit bed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
