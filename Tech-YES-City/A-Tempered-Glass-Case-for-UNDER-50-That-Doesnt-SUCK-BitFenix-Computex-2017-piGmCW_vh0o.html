Brian coming to you guys today with the
coverage of the bit Phoenix boots and
they do have some new cases on display
here so we'll take a look at them and
also address some of the other cases
that are on display here to 2017
Computex coverage for tech yes City is
brought to you by MSI and course there
for a limited time only you can get a
free copy of Ghost Recon wildlands luxe
edition with any purchase of animal
products click the link in description
below to find out more so here I am guys
I am joined by Oliver from BitFenix how
you doing man I'm good thanks thanks for
coming here
I do I was just about to say yeah his
voice sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger
so here's the Taiwanese Arnold
Schwarzenegger guys get to the trumpet
man get to the chopper I'm getting run
off with one of these cases and get to
the chopper
so behind me here we have a new concept
case this is the ENSO showcase so would
you want to tell us a little bit more
about this case what's inspired this
case and what to look out for in terms
of pricing availability sure I'll do
that so as you can see here what's
getting here is our first is the
addressable object B so you've seen that
around a lot lately in the market but we
have a little different approach because
in the end most of the rest of our GP
components out there you have to have
another Gy for it so another software so
you'll end up with three four five
different software's which MVN is not
really convenient for the end user so
what we're doing here is basically we
have one controller in the back to
control this kind of lighting with
different free air program modes but
then we're also working with us for
another lighting solution with our Sora
with the latest high-end board so you
can direct the controller just with
their software so you don't need an
additional software so another thing
I've noticed about this case now is the
support for an extended ATX motherboard
now the size of this case is really a
mid-sized tower case like actually let's
say dared say a little bit smaller so
really nice fitting there but you want
to tell us a little bit more about that
yellow right now we have inside the
Cross f6 of three monstrous lounge at
the beginning of the competence um
this is a pretty huge car I mean you
know you know the hours XR the associate
Xtreme cards so it does fit inside and
even with the cattle management you can
get it done if you get a bigger board
than that the cattle management might
get a little crampy but apart from that
you don't have a problem and also with
the longer graphics card as you can see
we have a 1080 1080 inside and it does
still without any problem even with the
water cooling solution so there it is
guys the Ensler's showcase when can we
expect this thing to market and what
price well we do expect to have this
thing end of q3 or latest beginning of
q4 so for the Christmas season it should
definitely be available the market price
were targeting is roughly around 79 USD
that's a pretty good price considering
it's got tempered glass and it's got a
unique design on its own
yeah well we still want to make a
affordable option for all the gamers out
there for all the people that do value
and to appreciate the RGB lighting and I
think this is a very good option for
that one it's also got the enclosed
power supply shroud there so very sleek
let's move on to the next one so now
we're over at the second new case coming
out of compacts with Arnold and we're
looking at the black and white thin
bezel that Nova tgs that's something you
guys are focusing on now very clean
aesthetic well the number itself
actually was launched a couple of years
back so and a lot of people might have
seen this front panel before what we did
was actually to just upgrade it so we
took the same front panel we did some
small improvements and the body itself
but as the name says the biggest
improvement basically is the tempered
glass so we are talking about a pretty
entry-level case so it's a more of a
budget solution but we did want to offer
like the latest standards were the
tempered glass because you know it
people have been crazy about that and it
does look way better than with acrylic
panel on the side so will though
definitely need you'll have to have
clean cable management in it as it is
kind of like an all see-through design
but with that if you can get it right it
will definitely look really good is
there terms of pricing and availability
what can we expect on this model
well first regarding the color
management of solve of
right now this is the set we're at it's
a final sample we are still trying to
figure out some ways that at least you
can maybe either cable itself or cover
it with some kind of I don't know skin
on the tempered-glass we'll see about
that it's not final yet as I said but
availability is like basically around
August I believe and the MSRP will be
around 49 USD so it is a very very good
solution I believe for the people on a
budget who wants to have tempered glass
on the case okay so how much was that
again it's going to be 49 USC $49 with
tempered glass and it looks this good I
think this will be a hit what about
available when can we expect this thing
to hit the shelves it's going to be in
August probably around the end of August
I believe okay I definitely want to take
a look at this thing when it hits in
August guys what he tell us what you
think about this one but thanks for your
time
Oliver aka Arnold brother love your work
so I'm now looking at a very unique case
this is called Pandora so we can see
here curved tempered glass all round the
case so BitFenix want to show with this
concept that they can do curved and they
can do all tempered glass and the size
of this thing isn't too big as well but
there is no pricing and availability yet
it's very early in the concept stages so
let us know if you guys like this case
or not so I'm over at the section where
they are displaying their portal cases
and they have this in four different
variants so black or white but within
those variants themselves they have the
option for the top windowed panel now
I'm surprised because I saw this case on
Edie from tech sources video and in
person it actually looks even smaller
than it did on that video so actually
surprising how small this thing is yet
it can still fit all the options you'd
want out of a custom desktop PC in a
mini ITX form factor so I will be
definitely doing a build on the channel
with this case and I look forward to
bringing you guys at that video so
that's all for the BitFenix booth in
2017 for Computex let me know in the
comment section below what was your
favorite case on display here and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
