new deep cool matrix 70 which we're
going to be doing a full-fledged 4k
video editing PC on now this just isn't
any overpriced 4k video editing rig
where money's no object I've actually
done this with a budget in mind using
all the best value parts that you'd want
for something of a caliber of editing 4k
videos now I picked this up on a bargain
32 gigabyte kit of twenty eight hundred
megahertz memory and I'll put the link
for a lot of this stuff in the
description below we've got a 240
gigabyte SSD 2 terabyte hard drive x3 no
9 as rock fatality motherboard 12 core
24 thread 29:20 acts 850 watt power
supply and an r/t X 27 t has 8 gigabytes
of vram and is a pretty good choice for
video editing
now deep core did send in this matrix 70
and also their 240 Pro ants and fans
which you can add those two elements in
if you wish to go with the deep cool
look but this case in particular is
going to be the main focus we saw this
earlier in the year at CES in its final
form it's coming at a 75 US dollars in
Australia about a hundred and nineteen
Aussie dollars now this case at its
price point compared to the competitors
options wants to offer quick release on
the front panel the back and also the
side where you can easily quickly clean
your filters and inside and change parts
if you need to do that you can just
detach it via two screws at the top on
the side and at the rear two screws on
the rear the back panel had no problems
that can sort of hang freely if you
leave it but the tempered glass side
panel here had some sort of low rider
issues where it was hanging out very far
and I was really worried to the point
where I left it there for about 20
seconds and it fell off completely so if
you are getting one of these cases I
wouldn't leave this tempered glass panel
hanging around I just take it off and
not rely on the sort of quick release
open feature where you can have that
winged look and you can mount at the
front of the case three 140 ml fans or a
360 ml rad and at the top you can do the
exact same thing in terms of graphics
cards you can support up to a 380 ml
long card and the case also supports
extended ATX
boards and just a quick interlude this
hard drive cage has seriously been
banged up and shipping I mean I'm lucky
the tempered glass isn't busted if you
guys didn't know the last deep cool case
that I got sent in the mail had broken
glass everywhere it just came pre
shattered I'll put the link to that
video up here if you haven't seen it
already but I don't know deep cool
you've got to use a different shipping
carrier because this is the second time
in a row that a product has come damaged
I'm guessing that side tempered glass
lowrider aspect as well
as a result of the damage and chipping
but anyway I'm sure your luck is not
going to be as bad as mine we've got
four SSD drive mounts here and also the
option to mount an additional two 2.5
inch drives down in the cages or two 3.5
inch drives the power supply mounts in
through the rear here has its own
separate dust filter and speaking of
dust filters you get detachable dust
filters at the front and also the top of
the case and lastly the deep cool logo
down the bottom is transparent so you
can mount some RGB LED strips behind
that if you wish for it to light up with
that said let's put together this whole
rig and see how it turns out and we'll
also be testing the temperatures of this
case with the side panel on vs. off very
simple test to do to see if the airflow
is good and with that said we're going
to be mounting 3mf 120 s's at the front
of this case which nowadays is the
classical enthusiasts set up three fans
here radiator at the top and also one
fan exhausting at the rear
so here we are now at the next day with
the matric 70 and this honestly took me
so much longer than I'm used to spending
on a PC build the reason being is we've
got so much RGB cables to route at the
back so this is my first complaint I
guess is if you're using three deep cool
fans at the front coupled with their 240
Pro then their hub only has five inputs
for the fans so I ended up having to use
two hubs for the RGB fence and it just
ended up being two different connectors
to control the RGB it was seriously a
bit annoying when it came to all these
cables and having to manage that and
then also zip tie them a couple with the
fact that I've got to use two
controllers now if I want to control the
RGB itself because of the case in how
perform will get onto some test very
soon but first off I did manage to test
out the 240 Pro there all-in-one cooler
and this actually really surprised me I
came into this thinking this would be
another mediocre deep cool water cooler
which in the past I thought their air
coolers have performed a lot better than
water coolers but this honestly kept up
with the age 59 Platinum RGB and that's
my favorite all-in-one at the moment and
that's a 2 80 mil with 240 ml fans this
is a 240 ml solution did very well when
I tested on the 9900 kf5 giga it came in
at 98 degrees and the noises were very
well controlled but here's where the
noises differ a little bit to the h 159
Platt which has its own included
controller for those fan speeds which is
automatically controlled this here you
have to use your motherboards PWM so
noises and fan speeds are going to
differ depending on what fan settings
you have set in your motherboard but in
terms of the actual cooler and the
performance it did extremely well but
here's the kicker though on a m4 with
the test I'm doing here I'm actually not
really going to recommend it because the
block size is way too small for a m4
CPUs it's probably covering half the CPU
at best but it's fine with a 12 core and
you will get away with it but if you're
stepping things up to a 16 core or the
24 32 cores then I would recommend
getting a
cooler with a bigger block that covers
the whole CPU area but in terms of the
cooler itself they have made the right
improvements in the right direction they
tell me it's got a three-phase motor and
zouk Onan ceramic bearings and also
internal dynamic pressurized control
very fancy terms but at the end of the
day I just like to sit down do the tests
and the numbers will always speak for
the product itself and so the 240 pro is
actually pretty impressive that does
come in at 120 USD and 174 AUD so you
will have to like the look of this
cooler because there are options out
there that do come in a similar price
point and do provide lower noise like
the H 115 IRG Platinum for example
that's still my favorite all-in-one the
noises are just that little bit quieter
especially on full fan speeds but lastly
now with this case we're gonna run some
tests while the side panel is off and
then put it back on while we're playing
games and then check the before and
after temperatures which is the most
important thing to see if this case has
been designed properly
so we just finished up testing the
temperatures of this case in Apex
legends and the GPU temperatures mainly
which is what we're focusing on
I set the fan speeds manually to 80% and
with the side panel on it got up to
sixty degrees while playing games in a
26 degree ambient environment and then
with the side panel off it went down to
55 degrees so it's a case that is
mediocre in terms of its attributes for
cooling down your components inside I
guess was that said it's more of a bling
orientated case but it's still far from
the worst if you guys watch my $500 PC
recently you would have seen the
temperatures there we're about 10
degrees with the side panel on versus
off so that was pretty bad this one here
is about 5 degrees some of the better
examples like the f5 40 for example the
temperatures actually decrease when you
put the side panel on because it allows
it the airflow to get directed from the
front out through the rear in a channel
and when you take the panel off that
channels disrupted but regardless of all
that this case is coming in at 75 USD or
at least that's what I can find it for
from B&amp;amp;H photo I think it's gonna be
released right around when this video
here is released in Australia I think
it's a hundred and nineteen Aussie
dollars and both these prices I believe
don't come with any RGB fans you just
get one fan at the back of the case and
the gets the distinguishing factors here
from other cases is that glass panel
above the power supply that sort of is
actually a nice addition I don't mind it
I thought it was a little bit tacky then
I started building it and I realize it's
actually handy for putting in modular
power supplies and routing your cables
and then after you install it if your
graphics card has some lighting on it in
the case of this r-tx 2070 Galax card
does have the under glow and it does
reflect off the glass at the bottom
quite nicely at the front of the case
however the dust filter needs to be
changed it's one of those tacky ones
that sort of has the clips on the edge
and it blocks air flow I thought you
meant to have the dust filter in front
of your fans but in this case it's
behind and I do believe it actually
affects air flow as we saw with those
temperatures but having the dust filter
behind does allow these three fans at
the front to shine through and look
really good in terms of
Ling so I guess that's a trade-off Jenna
the dust filters up top and down bottom
they're very easy to remove I do like
those styles so I wish they implemented
that at the front of the case and in
terms of airflow coming in from the
front it is a little bit weak I'd like
to see them and prove that but you can't
alleviate that a little bit by just
pressing the button and opening that up
but you're still going to have the front
hanging out if so and the last thing I
liked about this case was the top power
buttons and input outputs had a nice
glow ring around all the ports
themselves this was actually a nice
touch I thought that and also the glass
above the power supply where two good
additions implemented with the matrix 70
but on that everything was really
straightforward with this build very
easy to build in despite having a lot of
cables and being very time consuming it
wasn't difficult to get it all done so
to speak and there was no real sharp
edges or anything that was intrusive so
solid build quality solid case but it
does leave a little bit to be desired in
terms of a mid-range build it's pretty
good for that but if you're going for
real high-end components and you need
really good airflow most to consider
something else but at the same time this
case is only $75 or at least it's meant
to come in at $70 I think that's what
the matrix 70 stands for for me
personally though I did like the matrix
55 with three RGB fans up front I
thought that was hitting really hard for
the price point this has a little bit of
a different aesthetic with some
additional features over that and it
depends if you want those features and
if they're worth the money or if you're
going for a non overclocked building you
like the aesthetic of this case and I
can recommend it but if you are going
for a high and build with like a 20 80
TI for example and overclocking CPU and
GPU then I would recommend going for
something with better airflow guys
that's about it for today's review of
the matrix 70 if you enjoyed this one -
be sure to hit that like button also I
will say probably the most impressive
thing to come out of today's video was
actually the captain 240 pro cooler the
all-in-one that's made some significant
improvements over the previous
generation deep cool all in ones of
course the support and the block size 40
r4 could use some improvements in my
opinion but besides that there's only
some little things to fix up and I think
deep core will be
on top of their game in terms of these
mf1 20s if you want to get them I'd
really only be getting them for the
looks in terms of airflow they're not
that great and lastly although I'm
controlling this via the controllers it
does have five volt addressable RGB
support from the motherboard so if you
don't want to use a controller then you
can use the 5 volt header in this case
the x3 now I bought a heavier actually
didn't have one of those headers on
board so I did have to use the
controllers but the good thing about the
hardware is that there's no software
that won't eat up any resources but all
that aside let us know what you think of
the deep cool matrix 70 and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon he's
out for now BAE
