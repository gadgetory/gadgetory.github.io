week of tech deals and that's about it
welcome back to text to do this breakup
it to you guys today with another
episode of international tech deals now
before we get on with this episode and
the deals I will say be careful of what
country you live in and the import taxes
associated with that country now put in
the links in description below where you
can check roughly how much it'll cost to
get some of this gear imported into your
country but with that being said let's
get on with the first deal here we've
got the UNIX UHD 3216 our 4k monitor
it's 32 inches big so it'll be able to
double down as a TV and the best thing
is it's free sync as well and it's IPS
and even better it's 370 us plus thirty
dollars shipping brings it to a total of
four hundred dollars shipped
internationally for you next up here we
have the 25 inch 1080p 21 x 9 monitor
from LG this has got fifteen percent off
so it's going for a 170 bucks but also
on top of that you can get it $34
shipped internationally so it brings it
up to about two hundred dollars wherever
you live in the world though if you're
in the States you'll get it for a little
bit cheaper which makes it a pretty good
deal for not only international peeped
but also people in the States now the
next international deal we've got up
here is a cpu cooler this is a 120 all
in one goal for 40 bucks plus fifteen
dollars ships so if you ever wanted to
go straight to the source for all in
ones then this is it fellas you'll be
able to get this for $55 shipped to your
door and should be able to perform
pretty well on four core cpus so now
we're moving on to the US of A and we
got up first year the deep core gamer
storm captain 360 X CPU all-in-one
cooler now as the name implies it is
360ml long and also comes with three
fans are the best thing it's a hundred
dollars so you get saving forty dollars
and we'll be able to cool those high TDP
CPUs like the six cause a cause and even
the ten core cpu from intel next up here
we got the corsair vengeance k60 five
compact mechanical gaming keyboard now
this has gone for 50 bucks we had in a
previous episode and it's up here again
now it's only got another five days
before it's in stock again but for fifty
bucks you're getting genuine cherry MX
switches you've got that corsair brand
high quality keyboard and what more do
you want from a keyboard for that price
now going back to monitors with a HP 27
inch IPS backlit monitor gone for a
hundred and forty bucks c710 dolls and
now if you're using some super sampling
you can just tell your friends it's a
1440p monitor even though it's 1080p
just tell them look guys gotta 1440p
monitor with super sampling you then if
you're looking for a deal on the grand
scale with the RX 470 here go on for a
hundred and eighty dollars and then you
get a fifteen dollar rebate card so you
get it for 165 bucks and you also get a
free hit man with the purchase so bang
this guy can come over and slay your
graphics card for you then going all the
way over to the UK we've got first up
here the deep cool inept win this is
going for 30 pounds so half price
massive cooler will do a really good job
of cooling a lot of different CPUs out
there and 4 30 pounds fifty percent on
bringing the bargain next we have for
the people in the UK is a 600 watt power
play goal for around about 41 pounds so
you'll save twenty four percent great
for a new build great wattage gray Tampa
John that 12 volt line now if you
haven't used the mechanical keyboard
before then you can get one for 28
pounds saving forty percent on a vic
talk now this uses blue switches and
it's a 10 keyless design but for 28
pounds if you haven't tried a mechanical
keyboard yet then this is a great entry
point now moving on to some deals for
aussies this is actually coming from
newegg common since they shipped
directly to australia you can pick up an
RX 474 245 box and this is the red devil
everyone's been telling me how good
these graphics cards are this one's over
clocked out of the box 245 bucks get
your money out get your Ozzy's out and
get on this deal now if you need some
memory for a new pc build them for a
hundred bucks you can get something
ready for your next Zen platform this is
16 gigabytes for a hundred aud freakin
decent deal for the money and then last
up for the deals in Australia we've got
the ergonomic chair that I did a review
on this thing's still 119 bucks the
black one that went up to 140 bucks but

colors for 119 bucks you can get this
