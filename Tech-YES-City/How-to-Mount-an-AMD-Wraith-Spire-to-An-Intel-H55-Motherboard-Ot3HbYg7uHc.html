your wallet and you're putting together
a use PC that you just hustled and
you've built a rise and PC in the past
and you've got a spare Wraith spire
cooler very odd scenario I know but you
don't want to go out and buy a new
cooler master 212 because that'll add to
the cost of the build so there is an
option and that is mount the Wraith
spire to your existing intel page 55
motherboard like I've done here so
today's video is gonna be a little bit
of a hack it's also gonna be a little
bit of a story because I know everyone
loves a good story ok ok well the dust
was really thick anyway let's get on
with it shall we
welcome back to tech yes City there's
Brian coming to you guys today with a
video on how you could mount your
existing Wraith spire cooler to a CH 55
motherboard or even they might even fit
the LGA 1155 Zoar 1150 ones or 1150 s
I know Intel released a lot of different
sockets basically around the same amount
of pins but they do indeed have a slight
variations to the way they mounted now
this bracket here is from an actual kit
I believe and it's got the linings up
and this is how I realized it may have
worked in the first places because I
lined this cooler up here with the
Wraith spire this is actually just a
small one I've already mounted the race
spoiler and a previous build it it'll
put the link up here but this here
actually lined up pretty well the
existing holes for the fan and now what
I think's happened with this cooler is I
think Coolermaster have been licensed to
make the coolers for AMD I know they did
on their Radeon graphics cards in the
past and cool must have actually been
making coolers for a while so the mould
would have been made back in the day and
I've actually had experience with a
couple of these cool monster coolers
already they're actually pretty thick
they're of high quality and they do a
pretty good job of cooling and now my
first experience was actually on an LGA
1156 motherboard where you could screw
down one of these coolers so I believe
they've even possibly used the existing
mold of these coolers and just adapted
them to add the AM four screws for the
new Rison CPUs so you've got these
existing holes here that now if you go
out and get some self-tapping and put
washers on them make sure you use
washers that are non conductive then you
can easily mount these coolers by just
literally screwing him down from behind
and matching up the holes now in the
case of the motherboard I had it was an
asrock age 55 motherboard and you could
only mount it on the diagonal because it
didn't line up perfectly
however diagonally mounting a cooler is
still better than not mounting it
properly at all you'll still get a
really good connection in the case of
this intel cooler it only weighs a
hundred and eighty grams so it doesn't
have a lot of cooling potential at all
and in fact I used it in a previous
video where I could only really get to
see if you up to around about 3.5
gigahertz and this got it up to 3.8 Giga
so there is a difference because this
cooler will not this exact one but the
red spire is closer to 400 grams I think
it's about 420 grams so you're getting
literally like 2.5 times better the
cooling potential out of the race buyer
then you would out of this Intel cooler
now another thing as well it's got a
copper base and this is an interesting
thing about this cooler because it's not
permanently attached to the actual
aluminium on the cooler so it's got the
copper base but when I hammered it down
and this was because the standard height
of the Wraith spire was actually hitting
the capacitors and this was causing and
not to cool properly I was getting like
immediately 90 degrees out of the box
and so I got a hammer to it and I banged
it down I noticed the actual aluminium
around the copper heat base was actually
falling down so it isn't permanently
attached so there are a little few
weaknesses on this cooler but it still
did a fine job again 3.8 gigahertz on
hate 55 motherboard in less than ideal
ambient temperatures which are above 25
degrees it basically until he gets the
wind to hear there temperatures are
always gonna be above 25 degrees but
anyway back on topic the raise spire
especially compared to these little
coolers here from Intel they do do a
better job of cooling and they do remain
quiet off so if you do want to mount
these now as I said before go get
yourself some self-tapping screws and
also you may wish to detach these
original screws here on this cooler and
so you just do this by getting a pair of
pliers and then literally just tearing
them off and then you can begin to mount
this cooler onto your motherboard but
anyway what about the screws themselves
well you do have to use specific screws
I'd say anywhere from 20 to 30 mil and I
would recommend getting self tappers
unless you want to pre drill out the
holes yourself in the actual cooler the
thickness of the screws themselves I'll
put that in the description below for
you guys but I had just had these four
screws lying around in my screw jaw
I've literally been over the years
collecting screws from all walks of life
so I'll put the details in the
description below for what screws you
should be using but after you've done
that you just self tap them in but one
thing to be careful of is make sure you
don't cross thread the actual screws in
going into the cooler
and also if you're screwing it in it
a bit of a hard fit so if you're bold is
getting threaded as well on the top make
sure you don't go too hard and actually
break the screw because you'll then just
be wasting a lot of times so what I'd
recommend doing is if you're coming into
a bit of a trouble maybe have a few
extra screws laying around and then just
unscrew that screw and then try a
different screws so yeah and if you also
mounted on a diagonal it's still gonna
do a better job than cooling than this
intel cooler as I said before I could
only get this thing to max out around
3.5 7 gigahertz I think it was this
thing got it to 3.8 gigahertz and I
believe hotter ambient temperatures so
it does give you a little bit of a boost
to performance even on the diagonal
mount and it of course does have the
novelty factor of looking a lot cooler
than a stock intel cooler anyway guys my
monitors in the background they switched
off automatically after a 10 or 15
minutes or something like that so if you
guys enjoyed the video then make sure
you hit that like button I have also
heard of people mounting the wraith max
with the LED lights on intel
motherboards so you can do a lot more
with these coolers and of course you can
spend a bit more money if you wish to go
for a pro setup this is more or less a
basic hack if you're on a budget and you
actually legitimately want to use this
cooler to get better gains which is what
i used it for an abrasive budget build
so hope you guys enjoyed today's video
make sure you hit the like button if you
haven't already and i'll catch you in
another tech video very soon also yeah
i'm just trying out these monitors
behind me because getting the right
height and then we're gonna wall mount
them might even do that later today and
then start fixing up this studio making
it look efecto and I'll catch you on
another video very soon peace out for
now bye
the list of so the cooler itself does
Google but so but anyway back on topic
but anyway back on topic but anyway back
on topic but anyway back on topic but
anyway back on topic but anyway back on
topic but anyway back on topic but
anyway
back on topic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
