lounge and I am joined here by kev how
you doing man I'm doing great Brian how
about you yeah pretty busy been pretty
busy and pretty crazy as well the
Internet has real big real big problems
yesterday so yeah yeah do you want to
sort of explain to the fans who I am why
were a day late yes I was late I was
late a little bit late to begin with but
then after that we getting the show on
track and mine and that just crapped out
so yeah that was that and then I spent
all like half of yesterday calling them
up and I was like okay can I get this
done this done and can you get my
internet back please and they're like
okay we can do that so finally it came
back up like pretty about 5pm so yeah
that was a that's Australian internet
for you man it's it's pretty it's pretty
bad it is pretty bad people in Oz will
attest to that they'll know that it can
get pretty bad so and always happened it
always happens to happen on a Monday as
well like I don't know what it is so the
habits is it I have been so fine how
about yourself dude what's been going on
ah not much roundest uh oh it through
the 1080 TI testing did that showdown
that was really fun I will be talking
about 1080i but more in this episode and
yeah and looking forward to i'll be
doing some more rice and testing soon
different motherboard higher speed
memory and a few other changes there so
i sort of want to revisit it again and
aunt istic with a few different things
out there and see how much of a
difference it actually makes so i think
that'll be a really fun also give any
plans to do any rice and retesting yeah
definitely i'm just going to wait for
the official word kind of thing you know
what i mean like the once the updates
have been applied where smt is giving
the same results as smt off you know
what I mean yeah so once that flows
through that's what I think I'll do my
retesting because you don't want to have
to disable S&amp;amp;T and I
and I don't want to put up like I don't
want to deal with comments like disable
SNT and disable this and reenable
businesses it's just like knowing if
you're buying this product you shouldn't
have to do that anyway out of the out of
the box exactly yes I've been waiting
for a retest as well I'm still going to
do the overclocking tutorial I actually
just got the asrock Tai Chi in as well
oh nice yes I'm going to be doing a
whole actual I might even change over my
whole works they did promise my viewers
as well and we just got 180 k subs two
guys thank you guys so much that's
awesome i'm going to be giving away my
1700 x that i got it for review see you
guys yes someone's going to be getting
that because i don't need it yeah i'll
be getting another rising cpu into so
you know wise will give it away to the
viewers man the guys who support me you
guys awesome thanks you guys so much so
we just hit 180 k and i will hopefully
asrock when that's all i'm talking at
the moment together give a big giveaway
going so we can give away a whole system
risin and maybe I think sapphira maybe
even interested in joining so they'll be
getting into graphics card new cpu
everything so that'll be huge I'm
looking forward to I'm working on that
don't don't push me to it but like I'm
working on getting all the stuff
organized so that'll be awesome
someone's going to be a winner yeah yeah
that's good yeah no I mean that that's
the whole thing at you I do is my
channel libris often as well as give
back to the fans because I mean
Deadlands oh who are support you so I
think it's only right that um you know a
few spare tech parts and stuff like that
you send them out some because you know
they're like yeah eat where you are all
the other guys to put you exactly
without viewers yeah but nothing we're
not even a channel like you know I
wouldn't be making content so yeah take
care of use they got you back I know my
viewers got my back man they're awesome
especially with all the recent stuff
going on so thank you guys know thank
you guys so much you guys are awesome so
so many nice comments as well really
loving it so that's that we've got the
giveaway coming and also yeah the as for
the tuning guide i will do the risin
tuning guide once i see i want to get
the other cpu in which is coming in this
week and then i want
and see how that overclocks and I'm
hoping for 4 gigahertz so if I give that
a 4 gigahertz then I can talk about a
little bit because you know would have
had one that goes up to three point
eight five four years I can kind of find
those sweet spot settings and just
recommend them to people like okay yeah
here's the settings that are kind of
going to be guaranteed and then from
here we can go hit from here sort of
thing yes sir yeah that's right yeah
amen so anything because I got to let
you talk no no no just reading through
the chat everyone was talking a little
bit about the rise of the Tomb Raider
benchmarks since a a few people out
there have been saying that that
benchmark is inconsistent I was going to
make a whole video on that topic but i
decided not to because i didn't really
want to right now but I from my own
testing I ran the rise of the Tomb
Raider benchmark three or four times
with the same resolution all the same
settings to see how much discrepancies
there were between the different
benchmarks and honestly it's at 1080p
with a 1080 you see maybe you know two
or three frame discrepancy each time was
not much yeah it's very very minor so I
don't know why people are saying that
the rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark
has big discrepancies in an i spoke to
steve from hardware on box and he
confirmed it we made that and you can
probably confirm it as well Brian that
it tends to be very consistent we don't
run benchmarks usually if they get very
inconsistent results as one of the first
things you check when you go to add a
benchmark to your benchmarking suite for
your different videos is that you check
that it's consistence why I don't run a
GTA 5 because I'm in my testing I found
it to be a little bit inconsistent at
least the can benchmark in GTA 5 was but
the the rights of the tomb raider one
seemed fine 1080p 1440p porque
high settings low settings seem pretty
consistent to me I mean I didn't find
anything wrong with it so I don't know
what other people are complaining about
yeah I was hitting two percent two
percent variance that's how I averaged
it on the rise of the Tomb Raider that's
very accepted yeah I would agree with
that yeah yeah I would agree with a so I
don't know people claiming there was
like a ten percent difference I don't
know what you guys are doing but I've
never seen that so you know I wouldn't
added it to my benchmarking sweet if I
saw this discrepancy they're just
cooking bacon you know on the computer
and temperature's going up we go we got
repairs here yo yeah so that's um that's
an interesting thing to note but on that
note should we talk about this aim d
community update this is a very new very
very hot topic to talk about so
basically all you need all you guys need
to take from this article as it goes
into the thread scheduler oh so this is
your Oprah just this coffee is too good
drinking out of ja ja ja ja is good CF
judge us good stuff eh yeah um say
basically yet the windows are scheduled
our people were saying that the reason
why risin was having trouble was because
of the scheduler and PC perspective ran
an article saying that basically that is
not correct from their testing and now
AMD have in this latest community update
have also said that AMD believes that
the windows 10 schedule is operating
properly for Zen and we do not presently
believe there is an issue with the
scheduler adverse adversely utilizing
the logical and physical configurations
of the architecture and they go on to
say the performance Delta's between
Windows 7 and Windows 10 on AMD risin
basically they're saying that's nothing
to do with the scheduler and that that
is to do with the software architecture
differences between those two operating
systems so what we take from this
and well maybe you want to say Brian
because this is something actually
called a while back in the PC
perspective article which is that the
same as what we were just talking about
with the scheduler there were two graphs
they did which were the ping times
between the logical cores of the 59 60 X
so that has really CPU and the ricin
1800 x and something uh Brian said a
while back was that it it seems like a
jewel CPU so do you want to elaborate a
bit more than that oh yeah I mean it's
actually really cool because one guy who
was insulting me he came back and
apologized man that's all good like I
really appreciate that it takes a real
man just as you know say a man of steak
I'm sorry that's like that was really
cool I really but there was other people
you know who called me a freaking idiot
blah blah blah biggest you know d head
on the on the planet don't know what
you're talking about I mean guys it's
like it was just me using this you know
me taking a look at things and just
giving an opinion whether it was right
or wrong and I mean in hindsight it was
right whether the my opinion was right
or wrong it's like you don't have to
bash me for having an opinion like isn't
that now we grow as a community people
have opinions and then things get tested
and then we yeah so anyway that aside we
can see here that yeah there is indeed
two different dial nap feet on that PCB
or on that little CPU that's going into
the socket and unless of course it's the
Xeon example was exaggerated it was of
course massively exaggerated but yeah
the principal's still there you got two
separate died and they have to cross
talk if it can be okay with each other
and so that creates latency and it
creates problem and that's a problem for
gamers especially for game productivity
you're not going to notice it in
productivity that's where you know
that's where Zealand shine as well
Zealand's do extremely well on
productivity that well especially the
programs that can take advantage of all
the threads and so you've got this
dilemma we've got proactivity versus
gaming we're gaming needs that real you
know on the fly it cleans are constantly
changing there's always you know varying
workloads when
gaming so this kind of latency it could
be a problem I mean it could be a
problem as well as just cautioning how
is it going to spell out in two months
time can they get the optimizations
fully up to par can they really really
nail it that remains to be seen we can't
see that as a definite because i don't
know i mean i'm sure you probably don't
know either can we see that as a
definite and no no we can't there's
still a lot up in the air right now but
the other thing to mention is looking at
the latency look at the difference there
when it's crosstalking obviously we see
it jump up quite a bit but look at it
just normally compared to the 59 60 X
when it's just the physical and logical
course that that is quite they drop down
from 80 to what sets hovering like about
40 it looks like yeah so it looks
fantastic if what if you were disabled
one of these CCX units just have four
chords that'd be fantastic yeah again
may be really good for gamers I think
gamers are really looking forward to
that for core and if and they want I
guess that's the biggest question I
don't know I mean are they going to
disable two cores on each of the die or
they going to just release one died on a
PCB what are they going to do with the
risin are three CPUs that remains to be
seen really interesting I'm looking
forward to it I'm sure you're looking
forward to a to keV yeah yeah no
definitely um thats all i mean as Brian
said before it's all a bit up in the air
right now so except see but but what we
can save from taking from what AMD
themselves have said they are saying
that the windows scheduler is not the
problem and based off the pc perspective
article as well everyone running to that
saying that is the big problem it
doesn't appear to be an AMD themselves
as saying that is not an issue but
further on in the AMD article we see the
temperature reporting so this was
something that caught a lot of us by
surprise and this explains it quite well
so basically the reported temperature
oftentimes is higher well they saying is
higher by 20 degrees than what the air
true Junction temp actually is so SI
reported 58 and the truth 38 and that is
because of the offset for the fans which
is quite the interesting yeah I was
quite surprised that they did that and I
was sort of surprised s I mean maybe I
just wasn't reading around enough before
it but I thought I tried learning as
much as I could about rising and before
I did all my videos and that and I
didn't find this information anywhere
did you Brian to do we were of this
temperature now the good thing that well
the thing is that the great thing about
it is look at the are seventeen
seventeen hundred it's got no problems
again I mean to the are seventeen
seventeen hundred you get just as good
overclocks this is what from what we're
seeing you get a included heatsink with
it bonus and you get proper temperature
reporting I mean what what's the point
of buying an 1800 or 1700 x yeah unless
you know unless you're a turbo new yeah
oh yeah that's what I mean that's the
point is this could make so um yeah I
said that in my video you guys should
just go for the 1700 but then people
came back to me and said I you know
Kevin not everybody overclocked since
you know so for those people yeah sure
maybe look towards those ones but even
then honestly you'd have to weigh up is
it really worth it for just that extra
clock speed even if you don't want to
overclock you have to judge that for
yourself beer so basically it raises the
temperature sup which some I mean you
could make the jump to saying that kb
lake has brought this upon them because
obviously with such higher temperatures
um fans are going to be you know fan
curves from the fault will be a lot
higher and maybe they did it for that
reason but yeah I don't think it's this
is just a funny little thing that I
thought was quite interesting so if you
have a 1700 x 1800 x and you've been
doing stress tests and stuff and going
like wow why is these why these temps so
damn high
yeah that there is an offset for it
that's why if you have a 1700 there is
no offset so whatever temp you're seeing
is that the temp you're getting the you
know that is the true temperature so
yeah well that's quite interesting
that's what they say Sankey controls
differing from T Junction and T
junctions the true temp so you have to
go with that says I mean I in hardware
monitor i was getting what looked around
about right for temperatures because AMD
temperatures are usually lower than
intel cpus just the way they report them
so yeah I mean you've got to factor that
into account so have they done that
again so also the interesting thing is
with the power plans we got super chat
on to go I think we got a five dollar
donation thank you very much that was
awesome yeah yeah he's asking about the
charger cup oh okay what did he say
about the jar jar here's the j joshi i
just saw something about jaja sir okay
are we well judge I've guys if you
donate money I'll put it towards Jar Jar
we'll get him some bling I'll get into
my gb LEDs I'm serious there so yeah
they've got the power plan here they
recommend turning it on high performance
power I mean that's out of the gate
that's how the hellish how you should be
running risin at the balance when I was
doing my testing I turned it on high
performance straight away so yeah
apparently it turns off quite lacking in
Suffolk that's did that yeah I think
most of us do that automatically for any
PC anyways where it was Intel AMD I
always would put it on high point
especially when I do gaming laptops you
would notice a bit there um yeah you're
right just the core parking which you
run you about but maybe the fast
frequency change I may be few people
didn't know about that as well okay well
i see i like to manually overclock in
the p state so I'm going to bring out a
guide that's really that raw manual
overclocking and it's still going to
have down clocking in power savings as
well so I'm getting to the bottom of
that it seems pretty similar actually to
a m3 in one respect and I'll talk about
that in the guide there is there is a
similarity there for sure but yet that's
that's that guy's and then there's this
article here from PC perspective which
is really cool like I really like some
of the in-depth testing they're talking
about and they basically go on to say
that this scheduler is actually fine
already in Windows 10 yes I mean I kind
of I'm wondering because when you turn
off smt you do get legit gains in some
games so yeah well that's what they said
at the bottom of the AMD blog they were
saying that generally you should see a
neutral or positive benefit from smt we
see this neutral possible behavior in a
wide range of titles including karma 3
battlefield one mafia three watch those
two sips x4 on a hitman murs Edge
catalyst subdivision and villains and
they said for the remaining outliers and
the again sees multiple opportunities
within the code bases of specific
applications to improve how the software
addresses Zen architecture so basically
they're saying they want to improve the
games understanding of the court and the
cash topology so that's really good so
this is something they are aware of and
smt in the future you definitely want to
disable because this thing it should
either be exactly the same with smt on
recency off or it should the game should
perform better with smt on which makes
sense because as myself and Brian have
said it makes no sense of your guide on
productivity and gaming you're not going
to turn off smt go play your games
resize you to turn it back on edit your
video restarted again turn it off and
then go back and you know play some more
games or something so it makes know
you've gotta restart it twice for us
well thing is you gotta restart to what
you'd restart disable this until you
restart again and can make it it's just
too yeah exactly just the absolute waste
of time so but in the article busy
perspective they said that the it's it
is appearing to act more like a to saket
system so like a non-uniform memory
access so to it to a degree and that's
there to a degree exactly so how their
new Infiniti fabric works compared to
Intel the dual socket systems for
example remains to be seen but it's
still it doesn't matter as long as
and this is the thing right as long as
the real world performance is there like
a it doesn't matter what design they're
going with if people can get smooth good
frame rates out of these CPUs in games
and they can do their productivity
that's all that matters yeah so so yeah
and raisins is looking like it's already
doing a pretty good job of that
especially the r7 1700 mean for three
hundred and twenty-nine dollars
incredible value for money I don't think
anyone's going to dispute that or
whatever you know ensure the 7700 k is
beating it at the moment in a majority
of titles but again the r7 1700 is a
really good cpu and I don't think
anyone's going to argue that or I'd like
to know who would argue that because
it's doing really well in productivity
and it's kicking ass so yes they're not
to lie and gaming it's doing really well
too it's just that it's not as fast as
the 7700 k that's all and that's all the
7600 yeah but it's at that it was what
we predicted is that Intel with the
fewer course and very fast quad-core
switch is something they've been doing
for a long time guys like think back to
way back um they I think they realize
they struck gold many years ago with
that that sort of design in terms of
what works well for gaming and so of
course that's going to be good and as I
said in my video if you're just purely
going to be gaming you're not going to
be doing any productivity whatsoever
then you're probably going to be best
off as of right now things always change
in the future but we have to talk about
right now guys um the 7600 k is still
solid it's cheaper than 1,700 hey maybe
these are quite as hexa-core and
quad-core rice and chips will change
that but as of right now the 7600 would
be the one to go for if you are I with
your game I would savour I would dare
I'd say competitive gamer that's about
it like I'd say even if you're a gamer
you've do you choose you know what I
mean I'd say for competitive games like
people who really need the blistering
edge highest frame rates possible you'd
want to go with the cabbie lake CPU but
other than that I'd say the mature
already a game is might want to think
about going with the l7 1700 it's a
great vacation yeah I mean it's more
expensive here by like two hundred
dollars so sort of a harder pill to
swallow although they kinda is upset
maybe a little bit with the motherboards
choices but it if you're someone who's
does productivity and games then one
hundred percent go towards rising
because you'll get a hell of a deal and
if you're just doing it works you just
have a workstation then again I go
towards rising as well and get yourself
a good like a 1700 and that'll be
actually excellent for all your work
station stuff all of our productivity
testing has shown it to be everybody is
all the channels out there when you look
at the productivity scores they're
phenomenal yeah in terms of value for
money so yeah if you're building a work
station anytime soon guys and here you
definitely want to be looking at rising
because they don't you you do very well
from a vapor of value for money
perspective especially if you're a small
business owner and you have to buy quite
a few of them I would definitely go
towards that save the money over broad
oily what would you pick judge a mixer
pinky MP Oh God if my ears could keep me
um he wants to go the risin see Bieber
oh that yeah it is really good and it
will get better and woo what we're gonna
talk a little bit more about the other
ones yeah and that's it that's not think
that's that argument as well like the
7700 k is beating the Broadway League
lineup as well so that's the thing right
of course yeah sure again we got to wait
for those r 3 and r 5 cpus to really
have a look at that only gaming segment
for cpu recommendations so that thing's
the 1600 x will still kind of hit on
that because I mean rumored the 6800
gain 6850 k our six core made for a sort
of work station partly workstation use
and there have been quite good so I
think maybe the 16 those six core Orizon
fives might do the same sort of job a
like just cheaper yeah there's someone's
rain wanting a real cheap sort of
workstation um and they
go towards them as well I pulled up an
article here from OC 3d and they're
saying that yeah the I mean all the
skills are going to be overclockable
which is great but the Orizon our files
will be released in quarter to 2017 so
we're not really sure on the r3 yet
which a lot of people are looking out
for two so r 5 and r 3 are looking like
there's a lot of eyes on those cpus and
so yeah i'm really looking forward to
that so the price is still kind of the
exact pricing still can't remain seen
but damn man UK you guys get ripped d
319 pound 47 1700 and slate 329 USD poor
guys yeah pretty rough eh yeah I think
that's that would be my my prediction
right now is that I think the rising
faiz the six cores will fill that the
similar sort of void that the rice and
Simmons do in the workstation and gaming
thing in the rise and threes will be a
very much aimed at gaming but from what
I've seen so far so come pretty good
there i getta lookin pretty good there
1600 x against sync things like the 6850
k and multi-threading tests yeah but i
still think that's an invalid comparison
though i will point that out there
compared it to a 6850 k let's not exalt
let's not ignore the 6800 k which is
much cheaper than a 6850 k and as for 28
pcie lanes verses 24 that's a much more
valid comparison I don't know why
they're competitors or 68 there's no
reason to compare it to a 60 a 50k
people who buy that cpu want those extra
pcie lanes end of story so I yeah i
think when i saw that comparison i was
kind of scratching my head i might come
on guys that's a bit you know bit pious
and nike harrison so yeah the 1600 kate
is it is a little bit and the 1600 k is
still a pretty decent cpu like you know
6800 k was that sort of balance between
work station and gaming it has i've got
one now running in my main rig it's 4.2
gigahertz stable 24-7 thing is really
good it's a really good cpu
yeah the risin would be better the
awesome so many hundred would be better
for productivity but for gaming this
thing edges it out yeah yeah no you're
exactly right so that's it it is a good
point to make but i will be quite and
sit in here in new zealand there's
already a two-hundred-dollar price
difference between the 6800 k and the r7
1700 really um yeah it's about seven you
pay about seven hundred dollars for a
6800 k and you it cost you about five
hundred dollars for the 1700 and also
there's a big discrepancy in the
motherboards x99 as you know Brian ah
the cheapest to buy um so I mean you
probably can't get some deals that we go
use in that but I mean as far as brand
new um you that the rise and
motherboards are a lot dayum for i
should say motherboards are a lot
cheaper on average than both Z 270 and x
99 but are they though are they much
cheaper than a Z 270 I'm from what I'm
seeing a be 350 s a brother be 350 a
year the be 350 s are hitting hard but
the actual x3 70s are kind of obscene
seen the pricing especially your
knowledge they're kind of in ways
similar to a Z 2 70's yeah they're
getting up but I mean it's that that's
its own argument of what you know is it
is it really worth it for a lots of
people to get the x 37 e um where the be
350 band seems that seems like a pretty
good deal yeah I do agree with you this
is uh yeah I'm just looking at some
pricing now between the X 370 and the Z
270 um there isn't a huge discrepancy
but with the be 350 + Z to 70 then
you're seeing a bit of a but that's what
i want to see I one of those up to 52 so
there's you could go down to that as
well if you want to add that into the
argument but even then it seems that's
not overclockable favor well I want to
check on the baby 50 honest see I want
to get like I've got the Tai Chi and now
which is a really good ex 370 board I
want to get in a really good be 350
board and then
see if the overclocking makes a
difference like this test that I want to
really do that are great for the end
user and will tell them okay go with
this in this situation go with that in
that situation that's what I want to get
to the bottom of I just want to do that
trial and error that's what I'm good at
trial and error test things out and then
I can make my recommendations based off
that that's sort of the testing I like
doing so I do want to get in to be 350
that is sort of like Harold as the be
350 to get and then I want to pit that
against the X 370 to get and then see
what you think that a recommendation
especially with the AAA so we're here no
I think a lot of people other thing a
lot of people are sorry i just say i
think a lot of parents in there and my
next a lot of rising testing will be
done with a be 350 motherboard most
likely although i cannot confirm at this
stage it will be with a gigabytes gaming
three so that will be quite interesting
but from what I've seen and read so far
and I guess you can comment on this as
well Brian the b3 50s do seem like
amazing value in terms of how much you
pay to what features and stuff you get
yeah with the motherboard that's right
that's what I was predicting the be 350
would be that sort of just what you want
if especially if you're a game or even
if you're like doing you know single and
user work sort of thing it's sort of
like this it's like the singles
motherboard you know as opposed if yeah
yeah maybe making a business at home or
whatever you might want to go with an ex
370 or whatever but these be 350 just
seems like it's for the solo user you
know Han Solo as there you go on I said
but we got here the Vega 4096 stream
process 8 gigabytes of hbm memory
apparently according to a see soft
Sandra benchmark that was released here
so that's pretty interesting I mean that
these are kind of like the specs that we
thought Vega would have and it's looking
like it will have these specs so yeah
what do you think about this um well
yeah we it's still sort of early times
right now what we thought 4008 extreme
processes that if you guys can remember
back is the same amount as we got on the
fury x
that's kind of good to see eight gigs of
HP m2 memory that's also good there if
you guys do not know although i think
most you guys would understand what hbm
is um I think that will make a big
difference as although GDR 5x with
things like the 1080 TI are getting
pretty fast now 11,000 megahertz it's
you know how long there's a lot of
memory bandwidth there mean I'm not sure
how much better it could be with HP em
to ya I mean dare I say that hbm is more
for productivity and when you're using
you know opencl and whatnot but when it
comes to gaming I mean they're the GDR
5x is already out there getting more of
it on a now a 10 a TTI but the HBM I
don't think that's the biggest selling
point with the graphics card I think
this you know how fast the stream
processors are and that 40 nanometer
node is going to be the selling point
how much of a difference is there versus
the fury which you know has the same
amount of stream processors how good is
it overclocked there's all these
questions that people want to know how
good are the driver updates how good at
this and that so what are we going to
see out of this thing how's it going to
compete against the 1080 TI now which is
out there in the wild so really
interesting times coming ahead I can AMV
do it can they do a rising can they be
competitive you know what I mean can
they really bring it think because they
I mean they are competitive with the RX
for 70 in our X 480 but they've got no
competition at the motor for the 1070
1080 and now the 1080i yeah yeah I think
that's my prediction right now from all
the specs I'm seeing and everything else
is I think they're the top end Vega chip
which will be the Vega 10 i believe is I
think that will come in between the 1080
and 1080 TI and I suppose you could say
/ Titan XP but I could not think
anyone's buying them anymore um since
the 1080i came out so I think it'll come
in there I from what I'm seeing so far I
don't think it will dethrone
video as the GPU king that GP 102 um GPU
is just phenomenally powerful so I think
they'll have a hard time trying to
dethrone that but yeah to be competitive
with the 1070 1080 yeah sure I would 100
believe a one hundred percent believe
that judging by these specs it's it
really should be able to hit nvidia in
that area and that's an engineer he
wants a hit as well the 1070 is a very
popular graphics card so is obviously a
1060 but your it have the arts free
competing against that so to get in and
try take some sales away from nvidia in
the 1070 area and would be very good
from a money-making perspective from AMD
yeah be awesome so I wonder how it plays
out with vr and stuff like that too so
be an interesting car to lay your eyes
on we're looking at computex yeah that's
about when it's going to be released so
yeah something sometime around there and
I'm not also I'm not saying that the
gddr5 X will have more memory that the
1080i we're more on bandwidth memory
bandwidth then Vega if it's running hmm
too but it is quite hard to say right
now but from everything I've read it
does look like the Vega card will have
more memory bandwidth but again at the
end of the day how much is I don't want
to say too much but how much is really
that necessary and how much of
performance is more just about straight
up roar GPU horsepower you know we can
talk a lot about the memory and stuff
and but in terms of gaming I'm not
talking in terms of productivity but
just purely gaming and it's that raw GPU
horsepower you really want would you
agree with that Brian or yeah yeah
exactly you do want that and then the
course of memory as long as it's doable
then it should be fine i'm in an example
of when the memory wasn't doable was the
660 ti sorta like it came in with that
you know nerfed memory I whatever it was
the 192 bit wide boss there and that
caused problems in some games like I
remember that so the 60 CT I was an
egg's
we had the horsepower you didn't have
the memory whatever is set up to support
the GPU so yeah the memory bandwidth to
flow it yeah yeah exactly that's
definitely not to be a prime yeah you
came out with the sorry you know I do
have excuse mornings is where my brain
just doesn't work so excuse me in
advance guys but this time around hbm
looks like it's overkill if anything
much very much overkill so the gdr 5x
looks like it's that sweet spot at the
moment but again hbm to is going to be
awesome there's no reason not to love it
and it's going to be an extra thing but
does that add to the cost of the card
considerably i would i would say dare
I'd say yes I mean hbm would be in
demand at the moment H being too oh yeah
so yeah it's definitely going to be that
letter we the thing is at the end of the
day it's got to be priced and the 1070
pricing I would still say is a little
bit high 0cm so I think I would it'll be
good if they could undercut them
slightly we will just have to see when
it comes to performance as well I mean
if it just blows it in 70 of the water
performance wise then each day the
bigger 11 does which it should um the
will of Vega 10 Japan how powerful these
cards are and they then we'll see price
wise but but this will be something that
will have to take into consideration but
I'm really looking forward to this it'll
be really good and you guys should be as
well even if you're the biggest and
video fanboy there is you just you just
will never touch a radeon card ever you
should want this as well because more
competitions better makes and video want
to innovate more and you know really
bring it even more with their GPUs and
also it will help with our pricing the
competition is always always good you
really do what I will say that the GPU
market is where over the last few years
we have seen massive gains I mean it
doesn't matter how you got on there has
been competition yet yeah there has been
massive gains sort of like the CPU
market what was that you pulled that
article up where it was a the Sandy
Bridge 2020 700k was it versus the 77
it was like clock for clock a twenty
percent difference it was like really
how many years has been and we five
years or something we got twenty percent
yes yeah this that it is a good point
and I'm Pascal was a big leap forward
for NVIDIA inferred the GPU market in
general is a lot bigger leap than I
think a lot of people are anticipating
but it will be good to see AMD fight
again at that with the top tier the
high-end graphics cards with the RX
Freddie still doing very solidly as
you're a value-for-money mid-range GPU I
very much think people often overlook it
in favor of the 10 60 which the 1062
fine grub scale that's very good
graphics card but you guys should know
as well that the RX Frady is still very
solid when it launched out a few
problems but nowadays with all these
driver updates have been having it's
really you know starting to bring it to
the 1060 it's very competitive between
those two graphics cards yeah sorry just
my cat interrupted the stream man he's a
he's a lovely little cat if he if he
keeps crying I'm gonna have to have just
put him outside so sorry about that yeah
miss the little bit of that but so sorry
man more so it's just my my point was
the 480 and the 1060 have gotten more
competitive over time as opposed to win
the 480 first launch oh yes they had
very very very true yeah you know look
this is the thing about the 470 I've
been buying those things up in droves
because the last two months I've been
looking for graphics cards to get for
builds that are you know with CPUs
that'll support that price point and
yeah I can't find anything when you look
at the comparable value of an RX for 70
so I've just ordered in like 2 RX for
70s I got in a zoo 0 got the gigabyte
one and they're just kick an ass like
people want three hundred dollars for an
i-9 290x here 300 australian dollars and
it's like you can get the you know the
474 280 or something so it's like what
the hell
getting a brand new card you're getting
warranty and it's performing better and
is using less power keep your 09 290x /
you know like it's just that's the
problem I've had lately I've been
looking for these use graphics cards and
they just haven't been good value so
I've just been buying RX for 70s they've
been fantastic value for money so I
completely agree the RX 470 and the ice
variety really hit the market hard and
in ways I do prefer it now like after
using the RX 470 I do prefer it to the
gtx 1063 gigabyte because you get that
extra gigabyte there it's a really good
balance i think that four gigabytes of
vram is actually a really nice balance
with the RX 470 that's what I like yeah
I agree yeah and I think that's 3
gigabytes I do think it's just a little
bit too much certain titles will demand
a bit more and when you've got like when
you're buying the latest graphics card
the latest graphics card you do want it
to perform in all your titles exactly
it's getting a bit closer than three gig
mark um but you know that's exactly
right should we talk about the sin a TTI
yeah we'll quickly talk about this over
got the d/s 12 game ready drivers a
quick performance law the 1080 ta
launched they brought out some our
driver releases that helped fix the x
FPS and DX 12 titles interestingly so
we've got to rise here in ashes of
singularity to rise of the Tomb Raider
dx12 saw a huge increase their to
eighty-three percent that was huge
hitman pro so I mean a lot of people
aren't using dx12 at the moment I don't
use it either so I'm kind of like what's
the point of dx12 the moment is really
just a lot of the times you get crashing
that's the worst thing it's not a
performance it's mainly the crashing
whenever I switch to DX 12 and a lot of
titles program has not responded and you
get circle it just crashes have you been
finding that too now I'm 90 x 12 has
been just fine i played the entirety of
day 6 and drake x 12 and it seemed fine
to me but you do see that performance
arm hits which people have been
complaining about for some time so this
is a good step you know obviously
doesn't fix everything but it's good
that and videos aware of this and
hopefully we see this drink and
you and the dx12 performance then catch
up match dx11 because and some titles is
blind and then surpass it but of course
we we knew this would be a problem for a
while with DirectX 12 but it's looks
like they're heading in the right
direction so that's really good and yeah
you know somebody's Article II about AMD
risin five 1600 X may beat intel it its
own game I mean the title there may beat
of course anything may beat anything if
it's not released yet so yeah will this
thing it's against the 6850 k which oh
that's right for easy but yeah yeah
we're talking about that before should
be the 6800 k so that was kind of a yeah
bit of a cherry picked example there is
i mean even then you've got 24 lanes
even on the 1800 x for example or the
70s and so you still got 24 lens versus
40 lens on that you know 6900 k and
whatnot so that's still a factor but of
course you look at the price
differential there it's like seven
hundred dollars you know 6900 k vs an r
7 1700 that's a huge price gap so it's
like okay you'll ignore the 16 pcie lens
but when you're looking at this sort of
lower in comparison here the four our
five 1600 x + 4 compared vs the 6800 k
it's a more valid comparison much more
valid prices yeah starting to come
closer and then you've got twenty eight
lanes verses 24 so still got the extra
four gigabytes of deer VRMs direct ddr4
slots the dimm slots there so yeah did
you want to add more yeah on the other
cool i know i mean yeah now we already
spoke about this a bit earlier but um
yeah the 69 Rex looks like it's gonna be
coming in and quite the good price point
and I think that'll still be a very
valid workstation CPU also alongside the
hour seven series of CPU so that would
be good also yeah yeah now we're good
only as o tick yeah so ticked in attrs
infinity as in the works yeah I mean
which one looks like your favorite I
pulled up the gigabyte or us here as
well
they're gonna really sing a 1080i horas
and there's the 1080i from zotac as well
I think I pulled up one from inno3d as
well it looks pretty cool as well I mean
so many cool things coming out and the
you know 3d ones got a looks like a
little fan on the vrm there too so yeah
so there's some crazy i noticed yeah
yeah the other thing I notice is to look
at the IO on them a lot of them have the
DVI back yeah really took it off the
founders and haha yeah of course that I
mean I like that DVI port I use it for
when I've got my second monitor up here
for doing live stream yeah or editing
videos it's really handy to have a DVI
port anyway so i use my utilized mind at
the moment me keep in mind they do
include that display adapter to DVI
adapter yeah yeah that's fair game I
mean for monitors is a lot to use that's
a hell of a lot of monitor there yeah
exactly and I mean the only blower style
um cooler you see they even this otech
as otech lower akula they have the DVI
removed and it's just to help it exhaust
that hot air out the back your case just
even faster so i do understand there was
a very good reason for doing it um yeah
these otech ones look like pretty good
and so the gigabyte and a lot of them
and it wasn't a card that it ran fairly
hot and as always with these 250 TDP a
250 watt TP um nvidia flagships like we
saw with the 980 TI and and before that
as well so this will be very helpful but
these guides again guys they're going to
only appeal to the ultra enthusiasts
those guys out there that are just they
got a 1080 or something they're just
like man i just need more power and
they'll be the ones going for these
guides because i want to then overclock
the 1080i and then that'll be an
absolute beast the performance is
already ridiculous enough as i showed in
my videos and it's fear as well as
getting about thirty percent better
performance than the 1080 on average
it costs about thirty percent Morse okay
what about a salad I'm getting one in
pretty soon what about overclocked
versus overclocked that's all I care
about because they get the 210 80s go to
around 2.1 gigahertz to 2.1 what is the
10 ATT i goaded III didn't do it because
it was a borrowed card which I'm not
allowed to but the in the future I
should be able to get a 1080i that I
will be able to overclock a non
reference design and then I will do a
overclocked verse overclocked one but
again I wouldn't imagine I mean clock
speeds out of the founders edition ten
ATT I was already at 1800 60 megahertz
which is pretty decent so I would
imagine you be able to take them over
2000 and from memory that was similar to
what the 1080 got found this edition so
yeah I think that overclocking wise
they'll probably be quite similar to
each other the 1080 and the 1080p I but
of course with all those extra cuda
cores that the 1080 TI has it's just in
raw performance it'll always be higher
yeah so there we go guys awesome stuff
so we'll move over to QA now so we're
going to heat the questions are for 80
got it got it we had a donation just as
we move over 20 awesome Jack so we can
start up the QA and do you want to read
out the question keV yeah yeah it's got
a 7950 use and it caught fire when I
plugged it in but it still works turns
out one of the GPU VRMs blue ever have
that happen to you personally I can say
that hasn't what about you Brian I've
had a lot of weird stuff go on generally
for vrm something on the VR and blows
out for me the cards gone like you have
to fix it up that's really weird that's
bizarre um yeah that's this doesn't make
much sense but house is still going
that's just yeah like dude you gotta
send this you got to take a video of
this thing and show me I mean it could
have been just like a piece of wire or
something on the vrm and cuz it catches
fire it blows off the piece of wire
and the card still works I've had that
before you know my arm my little baby he
chucked it was just the weirdest thing
that happened every like he had this
little thing in his hand he picked it up
chucked it and it like went through the
front of the case like ninja I didn't
even know how I don't even know how he
did it man he just went like this is
perfect throw on it just I saw my GP you
just go shoot and then the whole system
just shut off and it still worked so
I've had a motherboard in the past as
well spark up as well that's been fine
computer parts are very sturdy and
that's what I've been saying in the past
they're very sturdy so when I manhandle
my parts as long as I'm not like
twisting the PCB or anything like that
because that's really dangerous don't
twist the PCB you'll shadow yeah
but as long as you like you know putting
it down or whatever or being a little
bit rough as I generally find its app
it's absolutely fine with pc parts I've
never had a PC part break on me because
I've been man handling it and no i don't
think i have father so yeah but that
that vrm definitely sounds like that's a
nickname in love to see that thing so
please show me a video of it that's
crazy is that crazy someone said in chat
manhandle my parts Brian ah yes the
donate hey guys so if you want to ieave
you want us to answer questions and all
the donations are on her you know it
helps us out and it's really great that
you guys want to support us and we'll
answer those questions straight away if
you donate with a question or getting
hit head over to the forums we're going
to answer some questions right now and
put your questions there so yeah we got
us from coalition gaming any chance of
seeing old high-performance laptop CPUs
pulled from dead gaming laptop carcasses
and be turned into Frankenstein gaming
PC's I would do that if I could find the
high end laptop CPUs I've every I've
been looking for a long time and any
laptop with an i7 on it even if it's
dead has just been a ripoff so it's like
there's no sort of value added there of
course I'd love to do it for
Mike around project but it's just the
actual price performance just wouldn't
be there unless of course you got a
laptop that someone just chucked away
which I'm yet to find with the nice 7 in
it so usually people like um I remember
my laptop died I had a had an i5 and and
I pulled out the i-5 and sold of 200
bucks like it was crazy because those
they fetch some good money and then we
got from the Canadian he he said Brian
have you played with that Alibaba p55
board yet so you have to send me a link
which p55 border you're referring to
because they have some good h55 s on
there they're like the azuz board that's
gone for 65 bucks i bought the biostar
that was a media i was mediocre it still
did the job but it wasn't the bias was
pretty limited and I was pretty annoyed
that it couldn't get that top speed
multiplier by a staff you're watching
just release a bios update where you do
enable the 20 even if it's seven years
later who cares people would want that I
want that anyway I want that anyway so
what do you do with you use computers
after you've built them I sell a lot of
them actually get the fina get the cash
back in for what a spin on them so yeah
a lot of the underused builds they get
hopped off after I'm finished with them
because it's just that stuff starts
piling up around here man I've got such
a limited space to work in so actually
have to have to actually have to sell a
lot of it too otherwise I'll be broke
bro and we near that baby no see man it
won't be just baked beans it would be
like you know use baked beans oh yeah we
have them in sir will the 1080 or 98
each I be a better use bargain when
people start offloading them for 10 ATT
is do you think that most people who
will buy a 1080i will have 10 A's and 92
TI's do you want to take this question
keV um yeah I mean you probably know
better about the used market than I do
but yeah I maybe it would be a hell of
an upgrade for a lot of people go from a
980 TI to attend a TTI although it would
probably cost you a lot you yeah I think
I think you'll see some of us feel I
would say quite a few people
with 1080s might be upgrading to the
1080 TI especially for key gamers like
myself that just want a bit extra
performance they will go towards sits in
a TTI now because the extra performance
in 4k was quite good so yeah you you'll
probably see see that but that's always
the case with new that's quite a general
question whenever there's a new
higher-end GPU then the other ones you
know people will sell them to upgrade
and then those ones get cheaper so it's
always a a constant thing that's always
moving forward with the newer GPUs
coming out obviously the older flagships
and the card that used to be the most
powerful I mean 980 TI yes I think
people be offloading there but if you
have a 1080 I'm sure a lot of people are
just going to wait for volta now like
it's it's not that far off surely voltar
would be maybe you want five months off
so I'm guessing a lot of people just
wait for vault or are you get into that
cycle the 980 i use is i do see a few
people selling their 90 eyes and going
jump into a 1080i that's true so yeah
yeah and the pricing year the pricings
crazy them and GPU markets crazy for use
for us now like it's all over the place
and of course you can find a bargain but
it's usually from that person who knows
what it's worth it's like okay this card
isn't worth that much if i'm going to
sell it then i have to drop it
significantly there's you just see so
many graphics cards out that out there
at the moment on the used market and you
just like looking at the price
scratching your head you like what the
hell i can bind you and it's better
value for money so yeah yeah okay and
gary is answering questions don't answer
the questions man yeah if you're the
 confuses us when you guys answer
the questions that are meant for us in
the questions thread because then when
we look through it we get confused of
what you know the quick that we assume
the questions are directed at us for the
show so we can talk about them together
on that ogre it does ask a good question
though you get the six core the r6 you
know the r5 when it comes out different
schemes they'll probably be the same
deal all overclockable to the same
levels what difference does it make
in editing times with a six claws oppose
a call it's interesting because it's a
weird thing with its basically added in
Premiere Pro and Premiere Pro utilizes
all your threads when you like loading
things into the program and stuff so
we'll make things faster overall but of
course on a 6-core with that much
productivity on it like the risin six
score and 12 threads you're going to be
able to edit videos absolutely fine like
I doubt I would see much of a slowdown
going from eight calls to six scores in
Premiere Pro six cause the four cores
year you might start noticing things but
i'd say the six score is really that
sweet spot for two hour premiere pro
going up to eight core especially in the
final render times when you've got 16
threads of us is 12 threats the render
times will scale off a little bit
because i think after six scores 12
threats the performance in Premiere Pro
starts the scale off too so interesting
but I'd say it doesn't make too much of
a difference especially if you're
editing yeah i mean i think what i can
tell you yeah i can tell you guys um i
have the benchmarks up here so a 6800
case that's obviously the six core at
4.2 versus a 6900 k @ 4 gigahertz so
it's actually a little bit less um
encoding times in hand brake it was
three minutes 42 seconds for the 6800 k
3 minutes 9 seconds for the 6900 k and
the cinebench multi-thread test seeing
1300 CB for the 6800 k and 1658 so then
with the 6900 k so all in all armed
basically yeah you'll you the 69 okay
will do better if it's better value I
mean you pay a lot more for it probably
not um it's a lot more expensive for
that but better and productivity times
but it still does better but yeah I
think this except on okay I mean it is
the most popular broadwell each chip so
that makes sense because it was
very good value by comparisons the
others in the 6900 k is a particularly
good value yeah well duh then we got
another question here too so we've got
the he wants to ask the he's got the
1700 nice choice the r7 1700 and he
wants to check on the temps does the
risin master tell it correctly compared
to other software out there are like I
use the risin software for like two
seconds I looked at it as like okay this
is like a bios in windows which I don't
need so I just yeah I just don't
installed it so I can currently tell you
but I just use hardware monitor it's
really good you can see all the speeds
real-time you can see all the how it's
boosting the max the men it's even got a
temperature setting in there so i think
i think those temperatures in hardware
monitor are more accurate possibly again
i've actually okis i'm building a new
rise in pc i've taken the old one and
put it in pieces now so yeah i'll be
doing some more testing i just got to
get through a lot of things and that's
why i mean i'm waiting to do some really
good rise and testing and hopefully that
update up that fixes the smt versus non
smt discrepancy comes out as well
whatever fix is applied so yeah yes
that's that's very good in the other
part of that question was what's a safe
voltage to go to and not any higher for
the rights and sevens are from what I
have heard and been told it's one point
four or five bolts is kind of where you
you kind of don't want to go higher than
that really you should be able to get
whatever you want out of it by going up
to about 1.4 25 area so you really I
didn't see any need to really go above
that oh sorry yeah Mr safe voltages yeah
I yeah I would say 1.35 is like that
that's the confirmed super safe level at
the moment if he's only wanting to go to
3.7 on all eight then you should be able
to do that but I mean if you're wanting
to
take this to the max then you might need
to go up to 1.4 1.4 to type thing to get
the max out of it but that depends of
how it depends what type of overclocking
you are I personally always just take
the chip to the max the safe maximum and
just leave it there and I've had good
luck with my CPUs in the past not having
any problems even though they've been
setting it quite high over clocks and
voltages for quite a long time but if
you're saying that's you know not like
pink I'm not wanting that high-risk
high-reward type thing um or higher risk
than yet if you got a 3.7 yeah I'm sure
what Brian said 1.3 25 or something that
1.35 I that's what I found the sweet
spot was for mine anyway after that you
just do things would start tripping you
know it's a lot of years after three
point one point three five diminishing
returns really kicks in so is that extra
50 or whatever the 50 millivolt is that
going to be worth the you know extra
temperatures and whatnot yeah yeah yeah
it is a good point yeah so that's that's
that's a guy's one down the questions
there and also any requests as well make
sure you guys jump over if you've got
questions for next week's tech lounge
jump over to there'll be a new thread
their questions for episode 19 attack
lounge sign up to the forms really cool
place really awesome and a new home for
you guys if you need want us to discuss
tech know insulting each other and none
of that crap really peaceful there and
also as well if you guys got requests be
sure to drop a comment the comment
section below and also be sure to check
out kev over at tech showdown I drop the
link in the description for his channel
yeah and and your closing statement is
set up ah yeah I just wanted to say if
you guys want to see my rice and
retesting i'll be doing that hopefully
sometime soon just going to see how
things play out and yeah just the last
discussions in there thread i was just
reading through our questions thread has
been about the 1700 and people saying it
it's overclocking better than the 1700 x
um I I haven't I mean some people are
getting that but I'd to me personally
and from my own testing and other
people have spoken to both tick
reviewers and people in the industry it
seems like a lot of these rays and chips
just seem to overclock around the same
between three point nine and four point
one seems to be where they set on all
late and it doesn't seem to really
pattern much which one you pick the 1700
all the 1800 x they all seem to sit
around that area and so I think do
you're getting this 1700 is good if
you're gonna sell it overclocks anyway
you should be able to get 3.9 on a late
I find they're not 3.85 dude like I
tested that thing rigorously so I must
have got a really early chip I don't
know but it might only went up to three
I think I might get better with with
more coming out and of course the
motherboard to get better i'm in room
with the the motherboard drivers we had
the advise drivers and stuff the bosses
themselves i should say um we're not all
three of us here meet me you and Steve
were having a lot of problems with the
motherboard so I think that would get
ironed out as well and that should allow
people to get a little bit more out of
their rise and chips alright guys thanks
for tuning in for another episode of the
tech lounge and we'll catch y'all next
week and peace out for now I'm going to
get this any guys and see you guys next
week peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
