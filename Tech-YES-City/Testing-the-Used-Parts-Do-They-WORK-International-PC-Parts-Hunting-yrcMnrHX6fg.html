is just a heap of pipes here that I have
to take a look at and we've also got a
new build coming there's going to be a
really cool build is going to be r5
1,400 and a gtx 960 then we've got all
the used parts that i got in taiwan
today we're going to be checking out if
they work i'm going to get our dad man
if he thinks these parts will work a dad
man do you think these use parts to work
mate yeah I reckon chipping right so
firstly parts we have up here is a gtx
770 and a z87 motherboard now i got
these from the BitFenix office they were
lying around they said they'll broken
know like hey I'll definitely take them
see if I can fix it this one here I just
got to test it out see if it works if
it's broken there's nothing I can do
this here has a heap of bent pins I've
never seen this many bent pins on a
motherboard socket before so I have to
get my toothpick out and start fixing it
and then over here we have the new parts
that I bought from the stores in time
one this is the Phenom the six core with
a name three motherboard and it came
with a cooler got that for about 50 US
dollars and then over here we have an FM
2 motherboard with an a 5580 you this I
got for like a dollar and the guy thinks
it didn't work but either the
motherboard of the CPU hopefully should
work so we'll see what comes out of that
before we get on to testing these parts
of course we are going to give them the
yes cleanse
you
yeah
so first up here we have the FM 2
motherboard and the FM 2 CPU the a 5500
let's see if it boots up I think that
one's completely completely spent right
so we're trying a different RAM slot and
different USB port and I'm pretty sure
at this stage this motherboard is just
toast it won't even boot up and usually
if the CPUs dead you'll still have the
fan like spinning at full ball that's
the signs of a dead CPU so I'm going to
take the CPU out and just chuck away
this motherboard
now we're going to try and boot up the a
and three multiple and the phenom sticks
cool let's see if we have any luck here
okay cool this actually sounds normal
and that fan noise is on cool now it's
all about getting a signal and there we
have it we have a signal so these six
core and the motherboard do work
so here we go gtx 770 let's see if this
thing turns on hopefully we can get a
signal out of this come on work for me
so we've got like lines going through
the screen and stuff I am going to try
underclock this graphics card and then
see if it works after I underclock it a
GTX 760 damn that's the biggest gtx 760
i've ever seen in my life
so now with this gravis card it's pretty
much toast I've seen a graphics card
exhibit the exact same behavior before
and it's not even being recognized in
Windows by the drivers so pretty much
here is like either the vram damaged or
a controller on board the card is
damaged to the point where it's just
it's a faulty card now so shame about
that doesn't work but I can pull the
cooler off and use it in the future now
so here we go we are going to boot up
the z87 board with the has well I 5 in
there and we'll see if we can get a
signal out of this thing I really doubt
we'll get anything out of the third
synthesis I've never seen that we've
been seen before I've never attempted to
fix any bent pins but I will try some
other RAM slots as well just to see if
that's part of the problem all right
right right wrong so now we're looking
at the screen and nothing is coming out
of this motherboard so it is not working
at the moment so there is one
possibility and that is that the 4690k
is not supported on this 387 motherboard
so and this is the only has little chip
I have here at the moment so if I get
another chip in then I will test this
motherboard and give it one more try in
the future so there we have it 3 of the
4 parts that I tested here today just
didn't work but the one part that did
work was the one that I paid money for
so I'm pretty happy about that because I
didn't officially get hosed like I have
been in the past
however on that note that was the one
part that if it had to work and I had to
pick one part that needed to work that
would have been the part that I would
have wanted to work if that makes any
sense
because I really want to do a six core
phenom buildin I have wanted to do one
of these builds for a while and not
overpay for an am-3 motherboard and a
phenom CPU and also I want to test that
six core versus something like the
old-school Vee on the six core the 5650
and see how well they compare to one
another both o'clock four o'clock and
how well they both overclocked albeit
the motherboard does seem a little bit
weak since it only has a single four pin
slot and there's no heatsink on the vrm
though also you may have seen the
absolute mission that I did bending all
those pins back and it still didn't work
and now that could be of course the fact
that it's a z87 and I did put a Haswell
refresh CPU on there so I will keep that
around and tested in the future but I'm
pretty sure it doesn't work I mean there
was a pin that just broke off and when
you're bending so many pins back and
forth like that there's bound to be one
that will break I've actually had a pin
in the past break as well off another
socket that I've tried bending a lot of
pins back on so this is officially the
second time that I couldn't bend pins
back to get a motherboard working so
keep in mind in the past though I have
bent pins back a lot and it has worked
so it's just one of those times where
things you just don't get lucky but I
got the motherboard for free so yeah and
also for you guys I have the Rison v
1400 build coming very soon and there's
also that Aliexpress keyboard showdown
I'm going to test if those keyboards are
actually worth the money or not a lot of
you guys have been telling me for a long
time that I've got to get some of these
budget keyboards in and see if they're
worth the money so stay tuned for that
and also before I get on out of here I
wanted to talk about used parts hunting
internationally because I've been to a
few places now and it's been extremely
difficult like for instance Japan and
Australia are pretty easy to get used
parts there's lots of places you can go
to whether it be physical stores or
online sites but over Christmas time I
went on a boat cruise to a place called
New Caledonia now I thought Taiwan was
pretty bad like I couldn't find many
used parts in Taiwan it was very hard
very hostile but in New Caledonia this
place was just
dead there was nothing there like I was
looking around all day like I had a
whole day there and I just couldn't even
find a computer store like the only
computer store that was there was
apparently closed on a normal weekday
and then there was other stores that had
like new computer parts and they were
asking really terrible prices for them
so little and then I couldn't even find
any use part so there was a store that
had like console parks but there was
really nothing to do with computer parts
and used in do these parts for sale
so if you were at one of these places
where there's just no computer parts and
that's where in places like Aliexpress
can become a really good Avenue even
though the prices aren't as good as
buying local use parts Aliexpress does
give you decent prices especially in
some of those use price performance
parts if you pick out the right parts
anyway guys that's about it for me today
if you enjoyed this video then be sure
to hit that like button and if you have
any requests or anything you want to see
tested on the channel to be sure to drop
a comment the comment section below and
also I'll put some links for some
current hot deals on Aliexpress in the
description to see some of you guys who
can't get access to some of those hot
local deals or even new parts and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon and yes when we hit 200k
subscribers I am going to change the
name back to check yes city because the
yes is back baby and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
I made three of the four parts of rooted
all that goes without saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
