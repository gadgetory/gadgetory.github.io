back to episode 26 of the tech lounge I
hope y'all doing fine and I'm joined by
keV from tech show down how you doing
man been doing great Brian how are you
bro you seem to be pretty busy lately
yes Eileen leading up to Computex
there's a lot to do it's a lot of stuff
we're getting it done I still gotta do
the GTX 1060 versus the rx 580 we should
which should be really good because I'll
be overclocking both the cards talking
about everything in those involved with
those two cards and there's a lot of
builds that have to get done I've still
have to do an r5 1600 build r5 1400
build and yeah I just want to do a lot
of things other yesterday's we did a
build yesterday it's people like you
know why would you use the r7 1700 over
the 7700 K it's like I just I'm just
doing a build like is no it's not like
the end of the world you know what I
mean yeah I just felt like it's just a
bill yes sir it's just a build guys
prices well yeah it's pretty good like
and I did put like I did put a cookie
cutter list in the description so yeah
yeah I got to build things because I
have to get content done I can't wait
for extra parts or I just don't have
time until Computex at the moment I've
just got to get things done so yeah that
could have been a few little things I
could have changed but the end of day I
hope people enjoyed the video and I hope
people enjoyed the performance figures
that came out of those two parts
together the 1700 overclocked and also
the gtx 1080 overclocked so yeah yeah he
gets really was really good i was
surprised that their gains in dota 2
were as big as they were that was huge
as I remember testing dota 2 when the
game was when Rison was first released
and it performed pretty bad now it's
performing really well so I'd say like I
think they showed us slides at their
presentation in Sydney and it was like
and it was about 15% or so they said
something like that the gains in dota 2
I'm seeing much more than 15% so yeah
yeah no it's just a really solid a oh no
I thought it was it yeah solid build a
I think maybe it's just because a lot of
people I think the those mid-range
builds are what's more applicable to
people but of course we like doing the
high-end ones as well they're always fun
the end of the day it's usually the GPU
that's most important and you Chuck
there's a gtx 1088 yeah 1080i yeah
that's no rule I mean that's a pretty
powerful GPU so yeah I think it'd
probably go pretty good it's a really
good GPU the 1080 is probably the one to
get now that if I can see I assume going
for like four hundred and eighty dollars
that's extremely good price for eternity
so yeah yeah and voltage and volt has
been announced - we'll talk about that
later in the show because first up you
wanted to talk about the I nines
announced from Intel so finally they're
going with the i9 naming scheme I mean
it's taken them long enough I thought
okay we'll go they'll holding out with
the i9 variant and now they're releasing
it with this which is arguably one of
the least anticipated releases from
Intel so what you wanted to talk about
this - a what sir what's your thoughts
on the i-9 yes I tried - about as much
research as possible on these because
they're going to be a very interesting
CPU now that Intel finally has some
competition from AMD so going to the i9
naming to start with that's an
interesting choice it's going to be good
to make it distinct from the i7 line but
then at the same time most of the people
that were buying these high-end CPUs are
all enthusiasts anyway so it's not like
they would be getting confused in the
first place there would be some people
buying these for workstation use and
editing rigs and things like that maybe
people that aren't PC enthusiasts but
yeah it's still but they've done it so
and someone actually a few people
actually predicted this a while back so
they were right on the money
with saying that Intel would go to the
i9 naming scheme so this will be coming
in on the new socket 2066 these new
motherboards will be the x2 99s but we
don't know much about them yet and
right now it's looking like you're
getting the same as Broadway Lee in
terms of lineup except instead of two
six scores you'll just have the single
six core and instead of going up to ten
cores at the top there'll be the 79 20x
which will be the 12 core 24 thread
behemoth and that will be coming out a
little later on that won't be from
launch which is apparently going to be
next month these will be launching so
but that 12 core won't come out till a
little bit later maybe a month or two
after the rest of them are out so that's
quite interesting when we look over the
specs of them allow you guys that know
CPUs will tell very quickly like I did
looking at the l3 cache you'll be like
why is it so low let's look at the 78
20x for example that has an 11 megabyte
cache all abroad well II except for the
6800 and the 669 50x I believe had a 25
the rest'll had 20 so what it looks like
here is Intel have actually dropped down
the cache um quite a bit actually like
on the 78 20 X which is the a core so
it's like my 69 hundred K they've almost
half the l3 cache which is an
interesting move at the same time the
dye itself is going to be much smaller
on these compared to Broadwell II and
also the clock speeds will be higher
he's seeing at 4.5 gigahertz boost clock
that will only be on a single core
imaging but you'll see it all core
booster probably around 4.2 4.3 or
something
maybe I will have to see close to the
time yeah so that's quite interesting
there it seems like Intel's done a
little bit of a switch I probably think
this is to bring the price down but it
looks like they've traded a lot of the
cash away in exchange for higher clock
speeds this is actually made on the same
fabrication process as KB Lake so that's
why it says 14 nanometer plus so that's
quite interesting
so we should see bit bit of gain they're
going from the broad well to skylake
just pretty much same as cable a um so
that would be quite good but yeah what
do you make of there Brian trading cash
vests for speed obviously it'll probably
improve performance because you know
clock speed it's better than cash in
terms of better performance it's I mean
it's good it's good and bad to a certain
point right I mean if you start
disabling too much then it's going to
affect CPU performance or so I like the
fact that they're going with the higher
clock speeds on this eight core I think
this would be the one to get out of this
lineup I mean if you only get one of
these CPUs not that I'm really
interested I'm actually really waiting
for word to their coffee like 6 quart 12
thread that's going to have the latest
IPC and should hopefully overclock
higher than these but this one you know
you've it looks like what they got two
point seven five megabytes of level-3
money per to cause so yeah interesting
designer they going with Sonoma not only
the disabling the cause like you said
they're disabling the the money on board
there so I should say cash right yeah
because of hearing excuse yeah but I
think it I say cash I say cash ah I
still if people say that here in New
Zealand as well but every time I'd say
it people get confused my videos so to
said cash well it's interesting for you
guys that like Rison is that only the
top one will have a larger l3 cache
because remember rising 7 has a 16
megabyte all three cache so only the 79
20x will have a large one now that isn't
there's a lot more to this this is very
sort of simplistic how I'm explaining it
but and Intel will obviously done
internal testing because it's not going
to be worse than Broadwell II you know
they just simply wouldn't release it if
it was worse so this is obviously going
to be better
um just do the clock speeds alone the
fact that they can get that ed core up
that high I mean my 6900 k will not go
over 4.2 no matter what you do so that's
quite cool but
yeah it's an interesting take in those
bigger ones TDP getting raised up to 160
watts it's starting to get up there yeah
now um it's getting pretty pretty toasty
so that's it's an interesting attempt
the other thing that's interesting is
they'll be releasing these kb lake x
CPUs at the same time and this is quite
bizarre to me so it's a it's going to be
on the same mother bore the same socket
LGA 2066 so it'll go in the X 299
motherboards but there's going to be the
I 777 40k which will be at four core
eight thread it looks like the same
thing as a 7700 k it has the same cache
everything is the same except it has a
higher TDP it should have been easier
connectivity - I'd imagine
yeah I'd imagine didn't it didn't it be
that pointlessly PU in history that's
the other thing that you just reminded
me of is that on Broadway le that's the
other thing that's getting reduced the
six core and eight core skylake X will
have on the CPU they'll be able to flow
28 lanes then when you go up to the ten
core and 12 core they'll be able to flow
44 and that's a big departure from
Broadwell II where the 6800 could flow
28 and all the rest at 40 so are they
going to stand out as well are they
going to make the a core more cheaper
then I hope so because yeah it has to be
yeah has to be much cheaper because if
you're going if you're someone like me
and I've been looking for I've been
waiting for these CPUs because after
these come out I'll be deciding between
this and risin of what my rig upgrades
to because I want to get off X 99 the
tomorrow
the 69 hundred K I have right now it's
gonna be funny to test it against this
78 20 X because it has more pci lanes
more cache and and but but the lower
clock speeds and it seems like the only
thing that's letting it down and
probably the IPC will obviously be
better on these ones too so it's just an
interesting thing from Intel obviously I
think they see the price tag that 500
you
yes of the 1,800 ex and maybe they're
trying to bring it down if that 79 20x
came in at 500 us boy now that would be
a that would be a good price point to
come in um
but you be 600 Pro be 600 for the 8
corridor imagine that's about right
that's about Intel's level of they'd
want to charge a bit more because you
know the margins will be higher but one
thing that really is sort of is getting
me as perplexing me as this boost clock
here from the 6 quart of the 8 core you
see there the report I mean this is
again not official I don't think yeah
this is just a leak he's still four
gigahertz versus four point five units
are they doing a bin job on these chips
so they all come from the same skew like
well they all come from the central is
not the same skew so at the same chip
they're just these ones of the most cut
down version yeah and things with the
most things disabled on the Corbett is
that an indication that hey the 8 cores
will still kind of be some sort of bin
as opposed to the 7800 X and will you
indeed on average get higher overclocks
out of the 8 core versus the six core
because the six cause always been that
champion of price performance on Intel's
lineup I mean the 5820k really hit the
market hard not a lot of guys who are
still right on the 5820k and don't care
about upgrading because there really is
no need upgrade if you're on a 5820k and
so but this time around if they're going
to have a chip that runs significantly
slower or at least doesn't overclock as
high as the Acorn and I think that'd be
a point for the eight core to go for the
a core yeah exactly right and I mean
picking on it for the PCI lanes isn't
completely fair because if you're going
if you're deciding out of that and
rising remember rising can only go up to
said 24 a on the rise and sevens the top
I think Jetts believe 24 so these will
still have four more than the top risin
and when these come outs so that'll be
interesting we'll talk about the 16 core
raisins a bit later but these top ones
will be good too the fact they got 44 I
was talking to Steve about it from
hydrobox last night and we were
discussing how many lanes
at an average consumer really need and
yet most people will not require more
than that the average gaming room in the
average gamer would only need like 16
like yeah 20 plus nvme SSD so is it you
know because even then a lot of graphics
cards can't saturate the PC a 3.0 so I'd
say 20 or 24 is is very mainstream of
course I need to put in a capture card
and put in some extra devices via PCIe
so 28 would be pretty much a sweet spot
for me personally mmm yeah that might
yes oh that's interesting in the the
weirdest thing about this though the
weirdest by far is those kb like x ones
because what i don't really see why they
exist to begin with um but whatever but
what makes it even worse is that 76 40k
they're calling it an i7 that's a 4 core
4 thread CPU what on earth Intel maybe I
know maybe they can do as usual you'll
see dude maybe they can have the option
because it has the option you can
download more threads maybe those fish
makes why that's why make a full or a
quad core 4 thread CPU on socket 2066
like I my only thought with these is
that it's for people that want to get on
X 299 but they don't want they don't
need that big CPU power which maybe
there's people out there that need that
um but yeah it's just find out these the
CPU seem very bizarre but the rest of
them seem quite interesting the I nines
so it should be about the pricing that's
what we don't know right now is the
pricing and if these are going to come
in at a very high price point I mean
you'll probably end up seeing these at
Computex well I'll say say I was gonna
say we go into Computex I'll be doing
full coverage on this so you can see
what's going on see what the real deal
is see the price points they're going to
hit out
giving you guys my thoughts and opinions
but as I've said before I'm kind of
waiting for their next gen six core 12
threaded mainstream CPU I think that if
a can overclock as high as cabby leek
and they do it right then that's going
to be a hard-hitting CPU so that's the
one I'm most curious about and there's
no information on that there's just X
299 which in ways you know risin is
really bringing competition to this
lineup even before this is very even
released so yeah I know yes let us know
what you think of the i9 are you going
to get 99 so we go here the next one
Alan Wake is getting removed from
digital stores due to expiring my music
licenses so I just went and bought this
copy and get it on Steam the actual
story and steam itself for like three
dollars ninety nine USD so they've just
reduced this game ninety percent off on
Steam because the music licenses are
running out and I guess the sales of the
game I just aren't enough to renew those
music licenses so they just late look
we're just going to let this game sort
of not be for sale after literally today
so that life is like 18 hours left to go
get this game so I went and bought it
give it a go so you can get affiliate
like three dollars so really cheap yet
and twenty game now as well I mean it's
seven years old so um but yeah it was
it's quite scary if you don't handle
horror very well like me then you
probably want to give it a mess I just
watched it I just watched a playthrough
but the rest of it yeah it's it yeah
it's quite it's quite a cool game that
was very um right when it came out at
the time I remember it was quite a cool
story that had a departure from a lot of
the cliches that the horror video game
industry was sort of stuck and back then
yeah we'd have to do a whole PC what do
you recognise Alan Wake PC what do you
think of that Jesus if I run into Grady
yeah at penny mg 45 60 and that's it so
you hear next up we've got thread ripper
from AMD so apparently they've got two
lineups coming to Naples which is the
server dedicated CPU with two plus No
dude there so you can interconnect two
of these CPUs and you got thread Ripper
which is meant to be I guess more of a
workstation orientated CPU with being a
single node and both coming out on AMD's
X 390 or X 3 9 9 platform I guess it has
been confirmed that AMD wilt we'll talk
about that now quickly AMD at Computex
so AMD have confirmed at Computex that
they will be showcasing the x3 99
platform platform and that's huge
x3 99 platform and a radeon vega so
they're both going to be at Computex
they're both going to announce these arm
both these lineup of CPU architecture
and video card architecture so kind of
wait for that but on that let's get back
to the thread at hand here so with that
we've got X 3 9 X 3 9 9 motherboards one
being only one node that means you can
only use one CPU and then the other you
can use two or more so I think spread
rip is going to be very interesting and
I think from thread Ripper we can still
derive I guess predictions for the yeah
2 + Naples anyway yeah we can you can
kind of the the way the Whitehaven or a
thread repair will be yeah up to a 16
core so this and this will be coming out
not too long after I believe that 12
course Kali kicks will be coming out so
that will give it some pretty fierce
competition straight off the bat the l3
cache is enormous at 32 megabytes like
wow and the TDP Zhou Oh getting up there
- apparently 180 watts kind of makes you
remember back to the old 95 90 with that
220 watt TDP and people thought that was
outrageous and now we're sort of heading
there the same time there's actually a
pretty incredible performance so at
least with workstation stuff so that
will be quite good a quad channel memory
as well coming so that'll be good um
what people a lot of people complained
about with X 370 although I honestly
thought it was fine that it didn't
feature it because it wasn't really that
much of a detractor for the vast
majority of the consumers I don't think
really cared about that and but for
those that did then X 399 will have that
therefore you see this will be quite
good in competition the clock speeds as
you can see are not going to be the the
greatest in terms of what by comparison
to Skyler cakes but in just pure power I
think it will make up for it being that
it will have 16 cores 16 good course to
and 32 threads more callers it also it
also wastes Intel because there they
took their naming scheme what's going to
happen with the next is Intel just going
to have to jump like they did program
from X 99 to X to 99 you know because I
can't go to X 399 now they'll have to
jump it'll you know they like to change
it I was I mean it was it was a good
move from AMD I thought it was a smart
move
that's i mean ii x 399 a guys we got the
best just binary 99 sounds better than
299 right yes well that's the thing
that's the thing as much as people like
as much as us guys who know what it's
all about don't really care about the
namings there's a lot of guys who just
walk into computer stores and they see
numbers o X 399 a that must be better
the next 299 I'm going to get that and
they didn't even think twice they just
see oh it's got more cause - what's
there not to like about this I'll buy it
now a named DS defense this time around
they've got a really good architecture
so hey they're offering really good
value for money but um yeah I don't know
what Intel's going to do in response to
that I think yeah they probably just end
up probably just jumping and going to a
whole new lineup of CPUs and
motherboards and yeah yeah so the quad
channel memory does excite me a little
bit especially once we get there you get
four sticks in there and you start
seeing how much of a difference it
really makes the games you know there's
this whole thing about oh you know dual
channel but hey let's check out quad
channel and see how much of a difference
you make it makes the games yeah so
people like you know I get my memory too
3,800 megahertz or something and it's
just killing games it's beating
everything now it's not like yeah
probably not
so they gets the quad-channel get to
confirm that so that'll be a good thing
about quad-channel we can finally test
games in quad and see how much of a
difference it makes but yeah the key
actually said before the clock speeds
are significantly lower but that's to be
expected as you get more cause you get
more heat and yeah helping to do a bit
difficult yeah it'll be going to be
difficult and and seeing how much rise
in likes memory right now fast memory um
that'll also be interesting from going
from Jill to quad channel but uh yeah
you'll be able to overclock these so I
mentioned you'll be able to take them a
bit higher I can't imagine it would go
over 4 gigahertz to be perfectly honest
with you guys I don't really see it at
16 core I reckon you'll probably get
like 3.8 3.9 out of it um depending on
how you want to do it if you're just
wanting it to go on a single core but
that that no one would be buying one of
these for gaming I would imagine um they
would be buying for gaming and
productivity or just straight
productivity so that it will still be
interesting but this is definitely aimed
at those high-end enthusiasts and the
people out there or the workstation guys
that just need that raw power and
depending on the price point again that
this guy will be coming in it because we
don't know what it'll be um you could
say because it's double a rising 7 that
you could just double like in 1800 X but
I don't think that'll be fair I doubt it
will be like a thousand u.s. I I would
imagine this will probably come in at
I'm thinking maybe 750 or something u.s.
what do you reckon Brian for the thread
Ripper it depends yeah I mean either be
a bit more I'd say the charge 800 for at
900 possibly even a thousand just
depends and do you have to make money
man at 750 then opportu be making much
money on a 16 course so it yeah it said
coming around a thousand bucks with a 16
called the East really is that high well
they have to man you have to yeah you
can't be selling stuff like you look at
300 I can see that the yesterday digit
yesterday's build the
thousand seven 1700 s coming in at 310
bucks that's there that's essentially
AMD's flagship at this very point in
time 300 bucks man they're not making a
whole lot of money you know people like
others the 1800 X they're the same thing
like you just have to overclock so yeah
it's kind of like they need to start
releasing that exclusive product that's
really up there and it's making the
company a bit of money I mean I'm sure
no enthusiast is going to felt hard you
know felt hard done by because they
can't get a 16 core for relatively the
same price in comparison to an 8 core oh
it's not it's not six hundred and twenty
dollars bang my chest yeah I mean can't
guys like aim D have to start making
profits and if they don't then they're
going to end up in the same situation
they were in a few years ago where they
were just really struggling so
interesting you don't offer they've got
this PCIe graphics Lancias I'm reading
that right 44 lanes from the CPU and
then you've got an extra eight lanes
from the chip so fifty two lanes in
total that's pretty huge so there's a
lot of PCIe lanes so thread rip is
definitely going to shape up to be
something that will hopefully benefit
people on workstations and make a good
alternative to what's out there of
course 4,000 pins is a lot of pins ya
know edition and I think for you guys
out there the fans you're going to see a
lot of your favorite chick youtubers um
changing CPUs this year if they haven't
already switched to Verizon I think
you'll see a lot maybe we'll switch to
Scylla kicks maybe some will switch to
this 16 cool risin the thread Ripper
I've changed everything man I like
experiencing everything so I think after
a few months I'll even do a breakdown of
Verizon what it's like compared to an
Intel 6 core and I mean honestly I
haven't really done it too soon because
there's not much of a difference like my
life has changed yeah okay like
experiencing everything everyone that is
your anything that's it all sides of the
party don't you get everything else it
and I if you never go you never know
[Laughter]
that's it so you got to experience all
angles man yeah oh I'm not doubting you
okay I said that's the creek oh this
year I think you guys are we are
watching watching a lot of your tech
youtubers and you'll see them change I
think there'll be a lot of personal rig
update type videos coming out okay so
now we got Amy's starship as well which
apparently they've got this on a a sleek
slide from video cards so 2018 7
nanometre this just seems a little bit
too much for me you know because it just
they're just starting to roll out
they're you know they're really high
core high threaded enthusiast and server
based CPUs now where's this 7 nanometre
cut it just seems way too aggressive way
too soon more of a news kind of click
Beatty kind of thing it's like okay how
they going to drop down to seven
nanometer now with 48 cause 96 threads
and it's saying he x86 so I know people
will be like oh it's going to be on a RM
or something like that but not saying
here x86 so I just think that one's way
too soon way too much maybe we should
move on did last year that it could have
been they could be meaning the end of
the end of next year I mean so because I
mean Naples isn't even out yet this is
where AMD will be making the big profit
margins everything else it's saying that
it was really like quarter to 2018 yeah
I think it will get pushed back though I
think it will more likely be Q through
q3 q4 2018 because it will be on the is
into architecture be it that that would
really do a good blow to Intel because
the xeon e7 z-- the the new naming
scheme the gold and platinum they will
be going up to 32 cores
so if AMD can get a out of 48 core i
mean we're gonna have to see the power
consumption as well
I mean Naples itself is going to be a
beast
being 32 core 64 threads um so that will
be quite interesting to how the how much
power they use TDPS rated for between 35
and 180 watts for naples whereas the
xeon e7 ziz looking like 110 260 um a
lot more cash as well on that Naples
then um the the Xeon so that will be
interesting too but this is good this is
at least it's good the Intel has some
competition and the silver platform
market because they've just had a like a
monopoly for ages and they've been
milking that monopoly like crazy you
know making so much money so it's good
that Andy's bringing some competition
here and I think it's good that they're
aggressive by I'm with you Brian I think
this is very ambitious to replace Naples
after only 12 months um but you know
it's happened with the Xeon so could be
possible it's going to be it'll it'll be
a big blow to Intel if they do achieve
this um the they'd have to do something
crazy with the Zeon's I did yeah so I
mean that's I mean when we're going to
go to copy text we're going to see what
it's all about really so we can only
speculate so far Naples I mean I'm
honestly not feel like I said before I'm
not too interested in the higher past 8
core 16 threads I'm really not
interested I think it's a waste of money
even for someone like me who can
multitask and utilize a lot of calls and
threads past 8 cores 16 threads with
good IPC and high over clocks I don't
need a whole lot like that kind of power
really is starting to be a waste
especially when it these are made for
the enterprise market not the consumer
market those and look at our audio data
service how many go yeah I know I'm just
saying yeah yeah I know it's not not so
much for the audience but more for the
fact that a lot of people want AMD
they're worried about them financially
and this is what should help bring them
back they can sell heaps of rising
consumer CPUs and that will
helped them but this is where they'll
make their big money and this is what
will bring aim d/dx they have that's
I'll say if they have flagships I mean
they have to outperform the competition
and they have to be really good the
consumer flagships are still a big
profit Avenue and you can't deny that
oh I'm not denying it I'm just saying
that this will be more profit here but
then look at this there's not going to
be loud I see really the average
consumer wanting to go and buy a 16 call
32 threaded CPU especially when the
risin 310 bucks you know to be any Moses
programming visualizing or not exactly I
mean any business have to have a reason
to do it so I mean Intel's knocking on
their door giving them incentive so it's
going to be interesting to see how it
plays out but again yeah it will be
again with that one I can only now can't
really speculate a whole lot but we can
speculate on this one and videos first
Volta powered GPU sits in at a hundred
and forty nine thousand now speaking of
flagship speaking of profit this is what
NVIDIA does they've got a literally
they've got this new graphics card
architecture that's announced it's
designed for deep learning they've put
really big focus on deep learning in
here and big charging for it so you get
eight of these GPUs in a box and they're
charging 150 grand for it and honestly
they're probably going to be selling it
because of the power that a bose mmm I
can do so much more than a server could
do and it's so good so tiny so I mean
the invidious direction I remember we
called this out a few years ago they
were getting into cars they're getting
into this deep learning sort of Avenue
and it's really paying off for them
because not only are they getting a lot
more money from it as a company
standpoint there have got a lot more R&amp;amp;D
money now and they're branching that
down to ask gamers so we're benefiting
from it too of course there's the whole
competition argument but at least in
vidi has been a healthy company they're
doing their thing they're getting into
big business they're getting very
profitable and of course we've seen
year-on-year just gains from Nvidia in
terms of GPU performance to us can
choose so some that I really like it
something that I really like about video
and they're doing that so
this thing is just absolutely huge
apparently we've got 5120 CUDA cores now
this is for business guys this is when
we're gonna when we're going to see
voltar for consumers I have no idea
invidious really just said look this is
we've got this card it's here it
utilizes HBM it has a massive amount of
cores the die is freaking huge what's
the size of the die 800 850 millimeters
squared yeah so it's one of the biggest
dies ever to ever but is it biggest I
ever I think one of the giant I think
it's the yeah one of the largest silicon
chips ever produced period it's almost
twice the size of a tiny XP chip that's
as people pointed out last time with
Vega as well these chips are utilizing
HBM you can see here so that's making
the die bigger so yeah hpm - yeah that
will obviously yes so that will bring
quite a bit bigger arm that sits on the
12 nanometer process
they're saying it's a dramatic that the
architecture is dramatically different
from Pascal rather than just a simple
die shrink so that's quite interesting
- and Nvidia's R&amp;amp;D budget as you were
mentioning before has actually been
increasing so it hasn't a lot of people
think maybe that they were sitting on
their hands but it definitely doesn't
seem like that
remember thing we're seeing and video is
number one when it comes to graphics
cards and they're definitely wanting to
keep that position because they're
investing a lot of money in this and EH
bm2 clocked at one point seven five
gigahertz on a huge 4096 bit bus that's
going to be just crazy so this obviously
isn't going to be for consumers but we
can learn a bit about this and the fact
that the architecture is so different
means that it should be quite
interesting when Volta comes out for the
people that have been waiting for it or
maybe once Vega comes out they'll wait
to see what Nvidia releases to compete
with it yeah this could be very very
good
I expect Volta to be extremely powerful
yeah they'll be releasing one of these
cards apiece
I a slight version for around about
10,000 so if you can't wait for the
consumer version you can go out and pop
one of these in your rig just let me
know how it performs that's all so yeah
it's a very very crazy design it's a
radically new architecture and they're
going for 12 nanometer so they are
shrinking down that is confirmed so what
you've got here is again and this is an
even the I think they've still cut off
some of these CUDA cores as well like
it's apparently it was at five thousand
three hundred and seventy-six or
something like that so this isn't even
the full-fledged version of this GPU so
maybe in another years time you might
see like a consumer-grade 5300 CUDA cord
GPU so stay tuned for it it's going to
be absolutely massive but this is what's
installed in the pipeline for US
consumers essentially it will trickle
down eventually yeah so that's a good
thing yeah here it is it's been
announced and how does it perform in
games I think they didn't even do they
showcase any they just showcase really
some um VR kind of thing with it I
remember I watched a little bit of
livestream they had a car and it just
went out sort of and sort of mapped
itself and they'll people for people
like talking or interacting and yeah it
was basically they're taking this is a
business dedicated graphics card for
deep learning and for helping people
with whatever modeling everything like
that so out of my depth as well I'm only
just looking at games me yeah so yeah
looking forward to this but here it is
it's been announced its official 12
nanometers huge amount of CUDA cores can
utilize HBM to but I'm sure a lot of the
consumer-grade I'm sure a lot of the
less you tie this article in here I'm
sure a lot of the consumer great
graphics cards will be utilizing gd-r
five six now so six and we got the
article up here SK Hynix has kind of
like announced their GD r6 at GTCC so
the same time Nvidia announced their
volt are the boys over at SK Hynix said
look we've got GD r6 ready it's
essentially doubled the speed
so you can expect double what you're
getting so sixteen thousand megahertz
effective on your memory as opposed to
eight so hopefully I mean I don't
exactly know how it works but that's
what it seems like and that's how it
seems it'll work so that's going to be
huge for those mid-range graphics cards
or even mid upper range graphics cards
like we're at ten seventy is at the
moment I think that's the next ten
seventy will utilize this quite well
yeah what what Nvidia plans to do with
HB m2 on consumer graphics cards is
anyone's guess at the moment I'd say
they'd have a top tier card like the
Titan X maybe the Titan whatever Titan W
and Titan V that's probably what it'd be
called do you reckon yeah yeah yeah
there we go so Titan V that'll be out
and expect to see an article in like two
days time WC CF tech Titan V rumors and
some fake for that's the fake slide it's
going to have this in the HBM too so arm
yeah I'm looking forward to that but
that'll probably be the upper card
HBM two yards last things I mean it's
it's going to be interesting as far as
memory goes on with these new GPUs I
mean we pretty much know that Vega will
have HBM too but would it be interesting
to see what volt it comes with and on
all the different models that will be
coming out all the different SKUs you'll
be able to pick from yeah I think yeah
I'd imagine you were right they'll
probably save HBM too for the very high
ones maybe not just the Titans I'd
imagine they're 20 80 TI or whatever
would probably get it too but I yeah
hopefully GD r6 makes it into the lineup
because is it is it out is that what
they're saying or is it although now
said it's ready so it'll be here I guess
it will it will be pretty much
officially hitting volta cards yeah
that's pretty much confirmed when
they're when volt is coming out exactly
I mean I don't know but just vault is
there I'm sure Nvidia is even working on
their next architecture that probably
had sex was too
close to alpha yeah so September October
guy says what I would imagine in video
is not going to they're gonna want
voltar out for the the Christmas period
I guarantee it they'll have it out for
them because that's when they'll make
time next week yeah so anyway guys we've
got here up next here the NSA so a group
of hackers stole some tools and now
they're using them for nefarious
purposes so what have you made out of
this cyberattacks so essentially what
are they using like wanna cry and all
this so they infect the computers via
however it can be via some fishy
websites or via advertising and then
they hold you to ransom where you have
to pay 300 bucks on Bitcoin per Drive my
sister actually got held up I want to
say yeah my sister got held up and I
just said look just yeah have you got
your stuff backed up on a USB stick
she's like yeah I actually do I'm like I
just can't read you know
reformat the whole hard drive GG where
you go don't pay them anything don't
yeah this is this this is quite
interesting so apparently they called
the shadow brokers and the they used a
tool which the NSA used to use or maybe
still does it seems to just have
affected people running on updated
systems but mainly hit a lot of people
running Windows XP and so it's sort of a
good thing that you always update your
PC um and maybe all the people on
Windows 10 may be doing all their on it
now ah so yeah this is this is
interesting that the it basically
encrypts your files and you have to pay
a certain amount of Bitcoin and then it
will ah be fine I think I think it
deletes the files or if you wait too
long the price goes up or something like
that so yeah but not apparently
someone's already figured it out one guy
I was reading they said I think it was a
22 year old I had already figured out
how to beat it a sign but the sad thing
is is that this is hit
apparently one of the worst places was
the DHS and the UK which is their health
their public health system and all their
computers there and that's interrupted
all the hospitals and stuff from what I
was reading anyway so it's not really
good and then when these guys get caught
that do because they attacked Russia and
other places as well see you pretty much
you know going to have everybody going
after you um you're going to go to
prison for probably the rest of their
lives
so and like do reckon you'll start
seeing guys on University campuses
running around just manually putting
this into people species like some guy
with a hoodie on like you what up man
that's probably what like the news
things like happens but it's like
something you would see on CNN but yeah
that money as someone will do it I
reckon someone will do it maybe a matter
of time before someone actually
physically goes onto people's computers
and installs this crap I only get that
cash sir yes on that news of dodgy
software and dodgy programs I've got HP
so contains a key logger so if you guys
are on some of these laptops on if you
guys have a HP laptop you know someone
who's on a particular model I believe
it's the it's built into the Audio
Driver so there was a person who it was
a mod 0 these guys here they found it in
the audio drive it's essentially a
keylogger stroke it records everything
you say I mean not everything everything
you type you know probably could even do
things that you say maybe about a know
we got HP Elite Pro books elite books
more elite books ebooks and the
operating system spanned from a wide
variety of ten to seven and even
embedded so if you guys are on a HP
laptop you might want to check this out
I put actually put the link to this
article in the description below so if
you know someone who's on HP laptop
might want to tell them give them a
heads up and say look you know you might
have a key logger
it's in courtesy of HP a keylogger built
into your computer which is pretty sad
like it's not really good news for HP
but man
nothing worse than a key logger knowing
that every key you type is getting
recorded so that's pretty bad
yeah no it's pretty it's yeah that's
what's weird about it as well as where
they put it you see where they put in
the audio track yeah it's also yeah yeah
it's like bizarre um yeah
no it's not good and last on the news
here we have invidious financial quarter
one is up 48 percent now Nintendo
switched sales of course helped I don't
think it really I mean it's some people
be like oh yeah then intend to switch
sales yeah it did help it did account
for anything 192 million of its tagra
revenue and I mean the switch is selling
really well I know a lot of people have
bought a switch I was thinking about it
but I was like ah like look only gaming
that I do guys is PC gaming unfaithful
to my PC okay
ain't cheating on this thing ain't going
anywhere I ain't cheating on yeah so as
I realized in the end so faithful to the
PC I know a lot of you guys out there
are faithful to your pcs as well yeah
but we look at the revenue it's up like
that's the thing even if the switch did
192 million look at that it's not like
six hundred and twenty-two million so up
48 percent compared to the same quarter
last year that is HUGE if it is just
making the box see the margins I was
telling you guys last week about the
margins in videos gross margin is huge
as well 60% in tells us 60 something
percent
AMD's was down to like 30 was at 34
percent so am d have to pick up their
margins these margins are healthy
Intel's margins are healthy and of
course this revenue is huge the increase
so it's not just the Tegra cells
obviously the deep learning program
everything else that they're doing but
that is making up I think it has a
report here so automotive industry yes
so that Nvidia is just putting their
hands everywhere and it's just like
success
so there you go what you have to say
about the the juggernaut that is in
video no I mean it's good that the
profit margins are there as we talked
about earlier here and you just said
that the nd profit margins it's good
that they got back into it I mean you
you must submit this is what they've
done Verizon is really good to bring
people back onto a MD based systems um
by probably not running very big margins
on their rise and CPUs was a good move
but yeah the that they have to bring up
the their profit margins which is kind
of its kind of really really ironic that
they were competing sort of like their
GPU competitions gone down but now the
CPU competitions gone up it's kind of
just yeah really like and I'm really I
wish they would hit hard on both fronts
but again we've we've gone down this
Avenue a lot of times many times before
so crazy out of that yeah and it says
some QA just just lighten the mood up
guys some QA so Oh only one question ah
I feel so lonely this week so we got
here some questions uh but it's a couple
of questions so for Kevin what's the
story behind Teddy yeah do you want to
share this story behind Teddy Yoko's not
a very long story but yeah the so um my
brother when he was living in Singapore
sent me titty as like a birthday present
and then I thought you know be quite
cool to keep him in the videos um so it
was sort of like having my brother in my
videos because I didn't see him very
often so um that's how it kind of
started and then I just get two men as
like a co-host plus I always just
thought he was kind of funny because I
used to watch mr. bean when I was
growing up and I always thought it was
funny him and Teddy Bay in the TV show
so yeah that that's why
I I kept him on um do you want to stop
calling him brother Teddy this is my
curse brother the teddy no that sounds
like but this but the but that yeah I I
just give to do something different I
mean the thing is with YouTube in
general there's a lot of people are
scared to do anything different with
their channel but you have to do
something because it's such an
oversaturated platform you have to make
yourself stand out from the crowd for us
you're going to be glanced over and to
assume degree I probably still AM
glanced over but at least you have
something that makes you different look
at all the top youtubers and there's
something that makes them different the
way they make their videos or how they
act on the camera or what they're about
or what if it is always something that
makes them very different you don't get
to get like a million subscribers plus
by being just like everybody else so
there is a reason why people keep coming
back to your videos in that um so it's
good to be different that's my advice
I'd say to you guys as well if you're
starting a YouTube channel yeah there
you go guys
you've got Teddy's co-host yeah all
right so we got here love sporting the
Illidan Stormrage background wallpaper
yeah I love World of Warcraft a big fan
even though I don't get to play it much
yeah I guess you could call me a bit of
an early worshipper even back in the
Warcraft three days it was such a really
rogue captors really cool and yellow to
like the background as well it's a
pretty cool background so yeah big WOW
fan of it ever since that game dropped
in like what was it 2004 to those like
everyone at first dropped man it was
just crazy I had friends who didn't even
play PC games I like dude you know I
made like a Turin warrior I'm like huh
like dude yeah yeah you never play PC
games what the hell's going on
so yeah was this one of those games that
was iconic and it still just carries a
real soft spot and that's why I buy like
every expansion even though I didn't
really get time to enjoy it much so one
of these days men one of these days I
will have a holiday and play through the
whole well expansion and enjoy it
thoroughly enjoy it I'm sure so can you
guys think of that single defining
moment
you fell in love with tech all things
tech and decided that you were going to
live breathe and eat tech so what about
you keV um I can't think of the defining
moment but for me it was it kind of came
in two doses so when I was about 15
years old I started getting into tech
heavily back then and then I sort of
only kind of half kept up with it and
then about four years ago I got really
back into it again at the tail end of I
remember it by gpus with the tail end of
the Nvidia 400 series and when Sandy
Bridge was very new and then I got back
into it then and then I started getting
into it much more heavily to like the
enthusiast type degree and watching
YouTube channels back then I was
watching Linus and and it was really
good and I got really into it
so I sort of came to me and kind of two
doses um but yet lately it's only been
since sort of Sandy Bridge I would say
that I was really sort of solidly
following everything tech before then it
was a bit more sporadic ie breh Warcraft
2 was when I first was introduced to
awesome PC games a member Warcraft to
men I was just loving that remember I
first played I remember my friend lent
it to me because I was a big console
like played Nintendo's and stuff I would
have been like what 11 years old or
something man like anyway I was I was
just talking up Zelda all the time and
he's like hey did you try Warcraft 2 and
I tried it I think that was the first
all-nighter ever pulled in my life just
like glued to this machine playing
Warcraft tools oh man this is amazing
and everything about us of blizzards
games were just so good the voice acting
even back then was so good even with
Warcraft 2 everything you didn't realize
it at the time like I was only a kid but
now that I look back at Warcraft 2
everything was good the gameplay was
good the music was good the sound the
voice acting was just on point and
that's why that's why I love some of the
old-school games of course it really
started with brood war
or when I only had a 100 megahertz
machined with the tube I had a turbo
button like legit I still had one of
those on my machine and it just ran
brood Lord Warwick crap so I got out the
newspaper and I was looking through and
you know there was like you could go and
buy an all-in-one which was just
ridiculously expensive back in those
days or you could just build it yourself
remember there's this place called game
to computer know like okay you can build
this this if you buy all your own parts
as their own why not give it a go
built a AMD k4 50 oh man I gotta get
I've actually got to build my first PC
that I built and redo it that'd be cool
because then I can refresh myself with
all the parts everything I used I didn't
overclock it always had no idea what
overclocking was back then this was
built it but as time went on I started
to like enjoy tech and I wanted to get
the most out of it and it became just a
really good passion you need them now
it's just what it is
take yes city bro what's also good when
we got into it when we did in a lot of
ways because um the industry's just
growing so massive now in terms of like
see what we're seeing in PC hardware
sales and everything is going through
the roof so it's good that that we got
into it when we did um of course there
were people that were in terms of making
the videos as well but you know there
were the oh geez that were there from
the start and they were really in from
the start but uh the rest of the rest of
us I think still got in at a good point
yeah question number two I'm not going
to answer you can answer it if you want
let's see okay um oh why did why didn't
you want answer it well yeah the lissa I
did I couldn't couldn't do things sir
what's that I was just reading there's
another person had posted a question
just underneath it yeah um and that's
the thing like I've you know
legitimately like I do
videos because I love doing videos for
you guys I mean yes money is an
important thing and you have to make
money at the end of the day so what
people do to make money man yeah like
you know I could be selling my butt out
at night you know to make ends meet so
it's just like at the end of the day
though like yet when we announce patron
and stuff like that you know you become
a patron that things like that do help
the channel I don't beg for patron but
of course just understand it like if you
do donate money it's going to a cause of
just us to keep doing videos for you
guys that's all it is you know YouTube
is really a weird really weird kettle of
fish
they'll favor certain channels and
they'll just promote those channels like
no tomorrow and if you're that channel
you've got to be loving life you get the
views you get near the companies come
and wanted to join you guys like me
Steve and keV we don't get that
mainstream love from YouTube we never
have so it's kind of like we've got a
grind and grind and grind and I enjoy
the grind
I do enjoy making videos but at the same
time it's not like even though the
channels at 100 and you just hit up
193,000 it's not like man I guarantee
you the average Ozzie working a regular
job is making more than me they're
getting more free time than I am as well
I guarantee you that I only do this
because I love doing it even still it's
not massive box so yeah and you know
it's um and I mean there's been the the
ad issue now which has hit quite a few
people that's worse lately yeah that's
been the biggest thing this YouTube hole
shake-up which I believe is in place
because they're you know you heard the
news they're willing and Ellen DeGeneres
and stuff like that they're getting all
these big names and making more TV
g-rated friendly and stuff like that
that's the real sort of reason they're
doing it and that's affected a lot of
people I've been affected I know a lot
of other people have been affected you
said you didn't really get affected by
it I did but um for some reason my
advertisement from
the from Canada actually like that it
went up so I don't know what was
something there but yeah the rest them
went down so has still affected me but I
think tech channels generally got away
with it a little bit better than other
ones yeah there were some channels that
just went on dot and they're probably
yeah or that'll go on doll because
they're just killing the advertising on
these poor channels and I feel sorry for
a lot of these guys because they built
up their YouTube channels to the stage
where they're employing people and
they've got people relying on them for a
paycheck and you know I don't know now
you know I yeah I don't really know at
the end of the day I don't really know
what's going to happen all's I can do is
say hey look I'm healthy man I'm going
to go overclock myself after this at the
gym you're healthy you can just I can
jump into a job any job if YouTube
failed the next day man it's all good I
got friends who will give us a job I got
two friends who would like offered as
jobs already so it's fine I'm all good
don't worry about me I'm a grinder year
bright so I hustle alright that's it man
you gotta hustle you gotta grind so as
long as you're healthy as long as you're
healthy and you've got energy and I feel
sorry for the people who have
disabilities it can't be helped
you know that's sad my heart goes out to
those people but if you're if you're a
guy and you're healthy man don't be
afraid don't be scared you know you're
healthy you're willing if you've got
some intelligence you'll be fine in this
world yeah yeah I guess we're going to
move over we're going to end this stream
