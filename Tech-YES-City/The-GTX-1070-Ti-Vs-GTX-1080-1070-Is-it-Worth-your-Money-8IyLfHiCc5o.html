over graves card called the gtx 1070 TI
and today finally marks the day where I
can show you guys the results and also
give you my opinions on this gravis card
now it comes with two thousand four
hundred and thirty two CUDA cores which
is actually closer to the 1080 than it
is to the 1070 however on the memory
side of things it comes with this same
configuration as the gtx 1070 with eight
gigabytes of gddr5 non ex memory so how
will this affect the gaming performance
when it comes to the 1070 TI well in
today's review i'm comparing it against
the 1080 TI a 1080 and also a 1070 in
their ole overclocked and have also
thrown in vague of 56 and 64 and on top
of that I'll even throw in the 1070 TI
stock figures so with that said let's
roll the benchmarks
[Laughter]
some in the lead up to this video I saw
a lot of people asking why does this
gravis cart even exist and that's why I
wanted to show you guys the benchmarks
first and especially when they will
overclocked if you guys look at Vega 56
when it's overclocked it performs really
closely to of Vega 64 card which is kind
of trading blows with the GTX 1080 and
the GTX 1080 is marginally faster than a
gtx 1070 so that does leave a gap in
between the 1070 in the 1080 and that is
the 1070 TI and this was the answer I
believe to Vega 56 it performs a little
bit better at least in a lot of the
benchmarks I've done and when you're
hitting in at a 1080p or a 1440p
resolution this graphics card is going
to do very well that what we saw with
those benchmarks of course when we
started stepping it up to 4k the 1080
did start to fall a little bit ahead of
the 1070 TI and this was because of the
gddr5 X memory this does help at those
higher resolutions specially when
textures are a lot larger than they
would be at lower resolutions though
there are a couple more reasons why the
1070 Ti can exist and that being that
Nvidia haven't released a graphics card
in quite a while now so releasing
something like the 1070 Ti does create a
bit of buzz and then the last reason of
course is the bidding process 1080 - or
1070 is quite a big drop in CUDA cores
something like this allows them to been
even more cards and of course create
more sales with the $449 MSRP which sits
perfectly between the 1070 s 399 and the
1080 s 499 so it is positioned right in
between and in my opinion at those lower
resolutions 1080 and 1440p it does sit
more closer to a 1080 so it is a good
proposition for someone who's looking to
get into 1440p gaming where I think
personally for PC gaming is the sweet
spot so I do indeed like this card
especially the MSI variant that I've got
here this thing overclocked quite well
and the best thing about this kind of
meticulous the fans I was shocked when I
put this thing at a hundred percent fan
speeds it was actually really quiet even
at a hundred percent if you had this in
a sound dead in case I'm pretty sure you
wouldn't even hear the noise coming out
of this thing though I'll let you guys
take a listen for yourselves
now it's for the inputs and outputs on
this msi card it is the standard
configuration same as the founders
edition you get three display outs one
DVI and one HDMI out on the back there's
also a backplate included on this card
and of course in the 1070 T I found as
addition to that where the MSI gaming
variant differs from the founders
edition is in the pin layout you get a
six plus eight pin power connector which
allows for more power delivery on this
1070 TI which is good for overclocking
on the founders edition it only requires
a single 8 pin connector so they each
have their advantages then of course
there were the temperatures and the
power draw of the 1070 TI which came in
as expected of course the gaming variant
did do very well with 62 degrees at 100%
fan speeds and as I said before it was
very quiet though of course let's talk
about those gaming figures when it came
to 4k gaming in the first benchmark I'll
pull up here was Wolfenstein 2 this is
where the Vulcan architecture allowed
the Vega 56 and 64 cards when they're
overclocked to perform considerably well
of course when it came to 4k results
though the GTX 1080 and the 1080 T I did
start to push back very hard so lower
resolutions on Vulcan Vega 56 and 64 did
very well scoring a victory over the
1070 TI though other games the 1070 T I
did hand a pretty good beating to the
Vega 56 card and of course the charity
was scoring a victory over the Vegas 64
and with the fan speeds I set them to
generally 80% across the board in a
25-degree ambi controlled environment so
the results are pretty apples to apples
when it comes to the overclocks if one
is overclocking way better than the
others then I tend to find out what's
the norm for that overclock and drop it
down to one that everyone can generally
expect to get if they were to go out and
buy one of these cards for themselves
though of course overclocking is never
really guaranteed I just like to do it
to all the graphics cards that come
through here and of course give you guys
a different perspective on things but
when we look at battlefield one for
example this was a game at 4k where the
1080 did start to edge over the 1070 TI
when we directly compare the 1080p to 4k
numbers and this was a trend that
generally swept through all the titles
whether it be the newly released destiny
to Wolfenstein 2 or of course pub G or
even games like for honor or Far Cry
primal the
Destinee - it's a newly-released gaming
it's extremely well optimized though at
the moment it's actually quite hard to
benchmark you have to use present mana
and actually didn't have time to set it
up again so I just had to use a static
benchmark and actually found out there's
a 200 FPS cap in this game so I don't
know how to remove that or I don't know
if it's going to be removed and if they
removed it I'm not sure if it would
break the engine or not but I'm telling
you now guys at 200 FPS this game is
extremely smooth it's really well
optimized I noticed absolutely no dips
when it came to running through at least
about 20 minutes of gameplay and of
course I found an area where I could
just get a consistent apples-to-apples
benchmark the new Wolfenstein whoever
did have problems on both the AMD and
NVIDIA cards though the Vulcan
architecture did allow that Vega card to
shine especially at the lower
resolutions so the gaming benchmarks
done and Dustin and of course a lot of
you guys on Twitter are messaging me
about the pricing and now what we're
talking about here is MSRP is 449 USD
and I think in the interview they said
to me 719 at Randall's
now I've already seen it up for
pre-order on Newmont for 699 Australian
dollars and of course I agree with you
guys you've picked up ten ATS for
cheaper when you've been deal hunting I
personally have picked up a GTX 1080 in
Australia on eBay sells for 680
Australian so it comes in cheaper and of
course you're getting a more powerful
graphics card though with the 1070 TI
the MSRP is lower than the MSRP of the
1080 and with that
wendy'll and since sales come about
you'll be able to pick this card up for
an absolute bargain and with that the
performance is closer to a 1080 than it
is to a 1070 though the last question I
will address what about the
cryptocurrency mining now I only use
eques hash and I'm only using it as an
experiment and when I tested this card
it did perform really well when it came
to cryptocurrency mining though I
believe the guys who want this for the
gddr5 memory then you're probably better
off getting the 1070 because you've got
those more CUDA cores and for that
particular currency then I believe that
you will benefit from having a more
power efficient card which I believe the
1070 will be because it's got the memory
the same amount of memory has less CUDA
cores I know I probably shouldn't have
talked about crypto currencies I
apologize gamers please forgive me gaben
please forgive me then when it comes
down to what the gtx 1070 is here it's a
card that exists for its price it
performs as
should be I've really got no quarrels
with it I'm not super blown away by it
at the same time however it is the
answer to Vega 56 in my opinion does use
less power and it does perform a little
bit better on average so any of you guys
