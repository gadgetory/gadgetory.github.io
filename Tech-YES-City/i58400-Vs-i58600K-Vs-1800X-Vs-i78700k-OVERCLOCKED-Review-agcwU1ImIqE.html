the i5 8400 and also the I 580 600 km
we're gonna overclock that compared
against an overclocked 8700 K and arisin
7 1800 X in a variety of games and we'll
also do some productivity benchmarks to
see how good the I fives stack up
against the best out there welcome back
to check yes city this Bryan coming to
you guys today with some more benchmarks
on the to 6 core i5 variants now these
were released into the wild with the i7
8700 K however the 8700 K kind of stole
the show with it being the 6 core 12
threaded CPU that could get to 5
gigahertz and was on the main stream z
370 chipset of course however the 8600 K
does raise a good proposition and now
we'll talk about the overclocks later in
the video where an average this six core
six threaded 80 600 K is rumored to
overclock higher than the 8700 K and
we've also got the most interesting of
the bunch the i5 80 400 which turbo is
up to three point eight gigahertz on all
six cores out of the box comes included
with the cooler and costs one hundred
and eighty dollars however before we
talk more about these CPUs let's roll
all the benchmarks and paint that
picture
so today's benchmark rig consists of the
MSI gaming Pro carbon really good
motherboard if all you want to do is get
into overclocking and things are very
simple in the bass great for beginners
and you will get extremely good results
too and also we're using the galaxy X
1080 Ti and of course the three
different coffee-like CPUs and the 1800
X though with the 8400 I decided to drop
the memory speeds down to two thousand
six hundred and sixty-six megahertz
you
so as you could see in those benchmarks
both the i-5 8400 and the 80 600 K we're
doing extremely well in games now keep
in mind this is with the gtx 1080i which
is practically the best gaming graphics
card you can get out there at the moment
so if you do get a card like a gtx 1070
or a Vega 56 or something like that
the differences will become less and
less so going with any kind of the cpus
that I've shown here today won't cause a
problem for games and even then even
with a 1080i there's not much of a
difference what it comes down to those
especially if you're a competitive gamer
and hence why do test those competitive
titles and you want the best FPS then
you're probably going to be honestly
looking at an 80 600 K that was
performing extremely well of 5 gigahertz
and I was really surprised when I put
this in and overclocked it the first
time I overclocked I got stability I've
never had that before
5 gigahertz 1.3 3 volt it just locked in
and it was running perfectly fine and
the funny thing was it was using a lot
less power than the 8700 K now keep in
mind I do have to do more testing on
this just to say with certainty that the
8600 K on average will overclock high
because I could have a good sample for
the 8600 K bad sample for the 8700 k but
what I'm seeing here is that the six
extra threads coupled with that small
die size on the mainstream CPUs is
allowing this time around the 80 600 K
to use less power and so with that
before the heat can dissipate to the IHS
the 80 600 K is allowed to go higher
because of that so this is kind of
making any sense this is what I'm trying
to say is is that my CPU the 80 600 K
here overclocked to 5.2 gigahertz with
ease
but the 8700 K could only go up to 5
gigahertz and now both these CPUs were
delivered and of course you will see a
temperature drop both on the 8600 KD
live versus the 8700 k but also on that
note the 8600 k if you don't want to
deal it it will go to 5 gigahertz stable
I'd say in most these 8600 case will do
a fine job of doing that
so now let's focus on the games
themselves and first up we've got pub G
now I will remove the cap in future
testing when I rerun all my benchmarks
but for now what we could see was the
8600 K was neck-and-neck
with the 8700 K and also the 8400 was
performing really well as well in this
title the 1.1 percent lows were doing
extremely well on all these three CPUs
on the coffee leg lineup the 1800 X was
doing really well too and also on that
note if you're streaming in this title
there won't be much of a difference now
a lot of people seem to think that
streaming is extremely intensive on your
computer the only thing that I've found
it to be really intensive on is your
discs especially if you're constantly
copying over to those discs so make sure
you get a good SSD if you want to strain
but otherwise the CPU and the GPU itself
I noticed not much of a difference when
I stream with xsplit and it's why I use
xsplit because it's so simple and easy
to use in the output picture in itself
is really good in the end but what about
dota 2 when we look at this title we saw
a difference again that scaled similar
to pub G and I thought it was just a
really good experience on all four CPUs
of course if you're looking for that
edge then the 8600 K is gonna give it to
you the 8700 K of course will do the
same thing except it's wasted money if
you're a professional dota 2 player but
moving over to csgo this was an
interesting title because the 8700 K did
win by quite a bit here and I did see
this when I was playing some matches
after I ran the benchmark so the 8700 K
is kind of like the king of csgo if you
need the best FPS possible and what I
did was of course I test these titles at
1080 P high settings because I don't
want to stress the GPU a hundred percent
and I'm sure that's what competitive
gamers would want they want to be
stressing their CPU so they can get the
most frame rates possible but of course
moving on to some of the other titles
the Ubisoft titles they were all doing
really well on all four of these CPUs
surprised the 8400 was kicking it really
hard as performing the exactly the same
as the 8600 K and 8700 K a lot of the
times and one benchmark I will point out
here is the Far Cry primal benchmark
where the 8600 K
beat the 8700 K so this is kind of one
of those things where maybe having
hyper-threading disabled helps it and
was a for FPS difference which although
you could put down the margin of error I
did run it a few times and this is the
numbers it was spitting out though the
last gaming benchmark I want to pull up
for you guys is the f1
2016 4 K results and I probably will be
pulling up something similar to this in
every single CPU gaming benchmark result
that I do because at the end of the day
if all you're looking for is an end user
great graphical experience especially at
4k and it doesn't really matter what CPU
you use I mean you could probably get
away with a knife 3 even and you won't
notice a difference that what we saw
here today with the four CPUs on display
was that there was practically no
difference at 4k so the differences were
showing at 1080p again is mainly for
those people concerned with getting the
at most highest fps whether you're on a
240 Hertz monitor or you're a
competitive gamer plan for cash
although the gaming benchmarks in the
i5s is the main point of today's video
also threw in some productivity
benchmarks and I was really surprised by
both what the 8400 and the 80 600 K were
pulling off the 80 600 K overclocked
handed a victory to the 1800 X in
Premiere Pro now Premiere Pro of course
after you go after 12 threads I believe
it starts to scale down and and doesn't
utilize all those 16 threads for example
properly and so this allowed the 80 600
K to score that victory but Adobe
Audition
single threaded performance there so
these are the kind of like two
benchmarks for me personally that I use
a lot so it's more relative to what I do
but when we look at other benchmarks
like pov-ray and also things like
Cinebench and 7-zip the 1,800 X is doing
really well so now it's conclusion time
and I want to sum up mainly what the I
580 480 600 K are about and they are
those relevant 6 core 6 threaded gaming
CPUs the 80 600 K if you want that edge
if you're looking for the best fps and
the 8400 if you're on a budget though
with the budget thing it's kind of
tricky at the moment cuz there's only Z
370 chipsets available and to further
complicate things as Zeus recently
someone of the Zeus announced that they
could get a Z 270 board working with the
new coffee leg chips and if that's so
then a kind of debunks Intel's claims
that they had to change the socket
around for power delivery and with that
if a z2 70 will work then H 110 and B
150 and B 250 s could technically work
with an i5 84
and if this is in fact a certain truth
then man until what are you guys doing I
mean just hit off the hit I don't know
really what to say but we're gonna just
focus on the 8,400 and the 8600 k for
what they are right now and that's that
they're really good gaming CPUs if
you're looking for a CPU and you can get
the Z 370 chipset and you can get a
decent cooling solution then the 80 600
K will be a great solution I think you
don't have to go out and spend as much
on a Z 370 motherboard and cooler as you
would if you wanted to buy the 8700 K so
that is the benefit of the 80 600 K not
as the CPU cheaper but you will get away
with a entry-level Z 370 and also a
cheaper cool because using around 90
watts at 5 gigahertz which was
impressive thermal draw and now the 8400
with the thermal draw people are like
okay why are they advertising 2.8
gigahertz on the 8400 it's kind of
confusing because it goes up to 3.8 you
go it's on all course and that's mainly
in Intel's defense is the AVX
instruction set that does juice a lot
more power and put a lot more strain on
the CPU so technically they have to
advertise that 2.8 gigahertz base
because if they didn't an aviation
instructions ran on a slower speed for
instance if it ran at 2.8 gigahertz and
they advertised 3.8 gigahertz then they
could be up for some legal action or
something like that I don't know anyway
besides the whole Z 370 only being
released and also the limited supply
situation with these CPUs when they do
get back in stock and when the B 360
motherboards hit in the h3 tens then the
8400 is going to be a great Buy at its
current price it's good except with a Z
370 motherboard it does start to lose
its appeal especially compared to
something like a B 350 and Verizon v
1600 though the 80 600 K that's very
solid if you want to couple that with a
Z 370 Pro floor for example from asrock
really good combination and yes with the
stocks I did manage to get to 8400
retail samples
I bought one from my local retailer also
got one delivered from amazon.com and I
didn't really
going any waiting lists I just saw him
available I was like hey I'll get them
because I want to use them and if you
enjoyed today's video then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below do you like
coffee coffee lake if so why if not why
not
of course the why nots are a pretty
strong argument and I'm not gonna argue
against that and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon there's a
youth build going to hit the channel
very soon also if you want to check out
my 8700 k review then I'll put the links
in the description below and also with
the overclocks the 8600 k versus the
8700 k i'll probably do a separate video
later on once is more data out there
it's really preliminary early results
but it is looking like the 8600 k on
average will overclock higher than the
8700 k which technically would make it a
better gaming cpu anyway guys i'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
