conference where they announced two big
pieces of news especially for tech
enthusiasts the first one being the
brightest than 3000 series CPUs looks
like they're going to hit mid year they
didn't give any specific dates but today
we're gonna go over the details on what
they did show and also what I think
about this CPU and what they announced
and then we'll talk a little bit later
about the Radeon seven which is their
new high end GPU also on seven nanometer
welcome back to tech yesterday we're at
CES 2019
straight from Las Vegas Nevada and today
we're gonna be talking about the new
3000 series Verizon now there wasn't a
whole lot of details that were mentioned
today except they did show us a
Cinebench score comparing the Rison 3000
series eight core 16 threaded CPU versus
the ninety nine hundred k now did edged
it out out of the box settings versus
out of the box settings however it's one
thing I'd have to guesstimate would be
the clock speeds on the new rise and
3000 series CPUs if it's anything I'd
guesstimate between 4.4 to 4.6 gigahertz
all called Boost speeds
since razzin does perform a little bit
better in Cinebench than the Intel
counterparts especially clock for clock
that's where I'm going to be putting a
number on those clock speeds for you
guys who are expecting that in terms of
architectural improvements you'll
probably see some slight tweaks to IPC
just like you did from Verizon 1000
series to the 2000 series CPUs but in
terms of the core counts and threads
this is where things get really
interesting in my opinion because we'll
first start off with the epic CPUs which
they did talk about and they announced
if eclis that there will be a 64 core a
128 threaded epoch CPU going into a
single socket so they indeed have
doubled the core counts double the
threads but when it came to the
mainstream CPUs there are only
announcing eight core 16 threads on a
single die versus the previous
generation where they had two dies
interconnected by the Infinity fabric so
I think AMD have done such a good move
here because this is going to reduce the
latency from the interquartile 'evil 3
cache and the actual CPU core itself and
I think this is a big benefit for people
who demand the snappiest experience
possible which is why I think the ring
boss has done so well up until now or at
least up until mid year until the rise
in 3000 series is being released so I
think this is a brilliant move from Andy
where they're focusing their lower core
count threaded CPUs for mainstream
desktop users and then they're going to
be focusing those higher core count
higher thread count CPUs for people who
need extra cores and need extra threads
but don't necessarily need the reduced
latency
so in terms of pricing however they were
pretty vague they didn't really give out
any specific details on the CPU rather
than just a demo and saying that's a
core 16 threads and it's beating the 99
hundred K and Cinebench the one thing we
did see was that the PCB and the design
of it was different than the previous
generation so they are using a single
die for the cause themselves but also
using the input/output hub on the CPU on
a different piece of silicon so it seems
like we would come back to these adored
TV rumors now where he was suggesting 16
cause 32 threads and I think maybe he
was just a year or a couple of years
ahead of himself with those rumors and I
don't think mainstream desktop users
quite need 16 coarse 32 threads just yet
and so I think the 8 core 16 thread
snappier higher clock speeds better IPC
play from AMD is one that is going to
excite people in 2019 now in terms of
being right or wrong it doesn't really
matter this is why we have to wait for
the official news and releases from the
companies themselves another great
benefit of the next series rise in CPUs
is that they're going to be introducing
PCIe gen
so definitely see this introduced with
the next-generation x5 70 motherboards
as well as some other improvements too
so with the Rison 3000 series you can
indefinitely expect 8 cores 16 threads 6
cores 12 threads and most likely for
course 8 threads as well as better
latency and higher clock speeds the IPC
and architectural improvements
themselves obviously have to get a hands
on sample and review it which won't come
for some time yet however moving on to
the next big piece of news was the
Radeon graphics cards this will be out
mid February with the flagship $699
Radeon 7 it's got 60 compute units
they're also touting 25 percent
performance increase over the previous
generation I guess they referring to
Vega 64 and this didn't excite me as
much as the rise in 3000 news because we
got a lot more Vega details for
something that's releasing in just about
a month there wasn't a whole lot of
performance figures there wasn't any
power consumption thrown out there
unlike the CPUs were they were throwing
our power consumption figures where it
was pulling ahead of the Intel CPU
getting a better score but also getting
a lot of power consumption the Radeon
seven an ohmmeter all's we saw in terms
of benchmark scores was some 4k figures
where
was being compared against a
competitor's card we don't know if
that's an RTS 20 80 or 90 X 20 80 TI so
my guess would be it would likely be a
20 80 that they're comparing it to and
not actually a 20 80 TI because the
Vegas 64 did fall behind the 20 80 and
so giving that a boost in performance
does sort of match it up versus the 20
80 we don't know until we get the cards
and test them for ourselves but in terms
of specs we'll be looking at 16
gigabytes of HB m to memory in terms of
GPU clock speeds and other civic details
that were very vague on that and it will
come bundled with various different
games so that's the Radeon 7 in terms of
the mid-range and the lower end cards
there's no details out there at the
moment of course we do hope for
successors to the rx 518 RX 5 70 and
even the RX 590 but since the RS 590 was
just released perhaps they're using the
seven nanometer die pacifically for the
higher end graphics cards hey guys
that's it from AMD's new keynote in 2019
from CES the Rison 3000 series CPUs are
coming and they're going to shake things
up a lot in terms of pricing and
availability
we don't really know those details yet
and then they've got the Radeon 7
graphics card the new flagship today one
and give you an in-depth review and if
you enjoyed today's video then be sure
to hit that like button and let us know
in the comment section below what you
think of AMD's announcements love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
