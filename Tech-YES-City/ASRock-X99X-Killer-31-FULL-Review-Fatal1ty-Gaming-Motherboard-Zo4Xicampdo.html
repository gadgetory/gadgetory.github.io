asrock x99 ex killer with USB 3.1 ladies
and gentlemen welcome back to tech yes
city this is brian coming back to you
guys today with a review of the ex 99x
killer this is their fatality gaming
series motherboards and this time it's
for the x99 line and it's kind of a
refresh where they introduced USB 3.1
and now I've tested USB 3.1 I've also
tested the onboard killer and their
claims are actually legit so we'll get
onto that later but first let's take a
look at the motherboard and then we'll
move on to like the BIOS the onboard
audio and all that juicy stuff that
comes loaded with this motherboard so
starting from the top to the bottom of
this motherboard we've got an ex 99 red
heatsink covering a 12 phase vrm design
which is actually an 8 + 4 phase power
design with 8 phases are dedicated to
the CPU 2 phase is dedicated for dims
and another 2 phases are dedicated to
another 4 dims of memory also at the top
there you will find an 8 pin CPU
connector which is out the way and then
just besides that you'll have a 4 pin
CPU connector and a 3 pin CPU connector
and then besides that you've got a USB 2
port onboard the motherboard if you wish
to use that now another thing I will
mention about the vrm is that it does
have 12 Kane itch con caps on board
there they're Japanese made caps also 60
amp chokes and also a dual MOSFET end
design so it's a very solid vrm I've
been using it for months on the extreme
6 and it hasn't missed a beat and it
stays cool at 4.2 gigahertz whenever I
touch the heatsink on the heatsink there
so moving a little bit further down the
board here we've got a 24 pin ATX
connector as well as two USB 3
connectors and a 3 pin chassis fan
header there and then below that we've
got 10 SATA 3 ports there as well 6 of
these the first 6 down the bottom are
dedicated to normal solder usage or you
can put them in raid 0 105 the four
above that you can only use them for
normal usage so you can't put these into
raid zero 105 just
that in mind below that we've got a
solder Express port there if you wish to
use that though that will cut cut out v
solder port if you wish to use that as
well as if you wish to use an m2 solid
drive I believe that will cancel out a
solid port as well now besides that
we've got a big heat sink there covering
the platform chipset hub or formally
known as the South Bridge and then we've
got the dr. debug LED which is really
good if you are having problems for
instance overclocking if your computer's
crashing if your keyboards not
connecting properly to your computer and
it's causing crashing and sometimes this
dr. debug LED will help below that
you've got your speaker head out there
you've got your front panel power
outputs and then you've got two buttons
onboard one's dedicated with being a
power button one's dedicated to being a
reset button which can definitely come
in handy and in my case it did since I
don't use power buttons on there I just
said just press that and then I wire my
ps2 keyboard to turn on the computer
just above that power and reset button
is a HDD saver which they include the
cable for though me and myself I do not
use this and then besides that you have
these chassis fans three pin and an
additional chassis four pin they're
quickly going on to the middle of the
board however we've got a power fan
there as well and then you've also got
the auxilary four pin connector there to
give your board extra power if you're
doing things like two or three Way SLI
so if you're in total you've got a total
of six fan connectors there or chassis
and CPU power connectors there which is
really good I like to see that they've
got a lot of these on the board so going
back to the bottom of the board we've
got two USB two outs there we've got a
bar selection switch there which you
actually have a dual bias and you can
select which bias you want to use very
handy then besides that you've got a
manual clear CMOS connector there if you
wish to do it the old-school method and
then moving on besides that you have a
TPM and thunderbolt connectivities there
and then besides that you've got a comm
port and then you've got your front
board output there so just above the
front audio out there we have as rocks
purity sound - which features the
realtek 1150 and I'm going to do a sound
test
and mic test for you guys later and I
will say this onboard audio is
impressive on the x99 killer so then
moving on to the middle of the board
here we do have three PCI 16 speed slots
there and they all support PCI 3 3.0 now
depending on your CPU whether it's a
5820k or the 59 30k or the 59 60 X you
can either support to a SLI or 3-way SLI
depending on your CPU going below that
we've got two PCI Express one speed
slots there and also besides that you've
got an ultra m2 as well as a CMOS
battery and then below that you've got a
PCI mini there so all up you've got
decent connectivity and we'll quickly
move on now lastly to the back of the
board so looking at the back of the
board here we've got two USB to ports
there also one of these is the fatality
Mouse port which you can manually set
the polling rate from 125 Hertz all the
way up to a thousand Hertz even if
you've got an old-school Mouse and you
can actually use this for your keyboard
as well so keep that in mind very good
feature there ps2 port there if you want
to use a ps2 keyboard like I do below
that you have a clear CMOS button which
is very handy I love the implementation
of this below that you've got the new
USB 3.1 C connector which you can put it
in any way you like
below that you've got the solder Express
port there then below that you've got
two USB 3 ports and the killer on board
and IC and now we're gonna stop quickly
at the killer there because this is a
legitimate solution the killer I've
tested this in the past we're gonna talk
about it a little bit later but it
actually is a legit solution if you are
sharing your internet below that you've
got the Intel ni C which is pretty much
one of the best on board in ICS at the
moment the i-21 8v then you've also got
another 2 USB 3 ports there below that
you've got your syrup onboard audio
solution there which supports 7.1
surround sound as well as having an
optical out and you've got your line in
mic in and your standard stereo out
there as well which I actually take
advantage of all bottom three ports
there whoo I hope you guys are still
with me because asrock include a USB 3.1
add-on card there's now this card
features 2 USB 3.1
connectors and unfortunately it takes up
a PCI four-speed slot and since you only
get to one speed slots in 3/16 speed
slots this will unfortunately have to
take up a 16 speed slot if you wish to
use it now this could be a problem for
someone who got this motherboard with
intentions for 3-way SLI so a little bit
of a bummer there but nonetheless most
people it wouldn't be a problem for so I
just thought I'd put that out there so
you guys consider the card also has an
auxilary power port there if it is
juicing too much power from the
motherboard anyway that being said let's
move on now to a look at the BIOS so
let's take a look at the asrock UEFI x99
fatality bios here and it mainly differs
from the extreme 6 in that it's red and
black so cosmetically there's a little
difference there and basically you've
still got that same awesome BIOS that
you had on the extreme 6 very intuitive
very well has all the settings that I
would need personally from a boss and
then some so you can see here I've
configured my 5820k for a basic 4.2 gig
overclock that's pretty much the sweet
spot on my CPU and this board does it at
around 1.2 volts so I can change all the
voltages there some reason I find that
the override mode on as wrong boards and
this is in the past on the z77 as well
it works really well in practice it
keeps your voltage fixed but when it
enters the initial C state still gives
you the power savings so it's very
interesting how they've done that anyway
this is the next part here you've got
more settings there which you can change
and then after you're done with that you
can save you use a default and load it
so you've got a total of five years of
profiles there which is ample enough for
me anyway so here you've got more
settings here where you can go into and
set different settings there you've also
got the chipset settings you can
actually manually set the link speeds on
the PCI Express Lanes there I've set my
first 16 speed slot death for generation
3 that's PCIe 3 and also on the I think
it is the ACP I so yeah I can also set
my ps2 to keyboard power on which I do
since it's an open testbed but not a
thing that's worth mentioning in this
boss is the fantastic tuning software
here this is actually really good and I
do take advantage of
so my CPU one fan you can see here I've
actually got a custom profile in here so
that it's as quiet as it can go when the
CPU is under 50 degrees actually I might
just manually set that to 50 degrees but
you can see here so you can set it to 50
degrees up until 50 degrees it'll stay
at 20% and so to be very quiet when I'm
just browsing the web talking on skype
whatnot my fans will stay quiet
especially on my CPU fan which is the
noisiest fan here at the moment though
when it starts when I start rendering a
video and stuff like that I don't want
any risks of my computer crashing so you
see here as soon as it gets close to 75
degrees bang the fans go into full speed
so that's that you can apply that you
can also do that on the chassis fans and
you can monitor the motherboard and CPU
so really good implementation there
you've also got your boot options there
fastboot I've got that enabled still
allows me to enter the BIOS but it still
gives me a speed up time there logos you
can disable that if you want to I don't
really see it as my monitors are direct
from the GPU anyway
Save Changes negative that's the boss
really good let's move on now to a sound
test and a mic test for you guys so
let's quickly talk about the fatalities
onboard audio solution and now just like
the extreme six it's got the purity
sound too and it's an amazing onboard
audio solution it's pretty much the best
onboard audio solution you can get out
there at the moment the clarity of the
audio coming out of this thing is really
good like I just finished listening to
the old school rock album the police and
it was man I was impressed on my HD 595
so that was just it was really good I
could hear all the detail there one
thing I will point out those the
crosstalk levels are not as good as
something like say for instance and as
easier 7k decane combo but that's thing
costs like $100 anyway on its own the
fact is for an onboard motherboard
solution this audio is really good to
boot the volume levels are there the
clarity is there also as well the
crosstalk is still pretty good
on that note as well the mic in and the
line in deserve a good worthy mention as
well the mic and I'm testing it for you
guys now I'm actually recording at a
level of 50 with plus 20 DP with noise
suppression turned off as I believed
reduces the quality of voice if you're
that turned on you probably already know
your voice starts to sound like you're
speaking through a tin can so if I can't
always like to turn this off and the
fact is this is pretty much introducing
no noise at these levels which is really
good I like it when the board's got a
strong mic input nothing is I will say
as well I like it when the board's got a
strong line in as well so this when I
put the mic preamp that I use into the
line-in I can turn that all the way up
to 100 and we'll introduce no noise as
well unlike the for instance the x99 UD
4 which I reviewed which had a pretty
lackluster on world audio solution
introducing noise on the line in and the
crosstalk was horrendous on the audio
out so anyway let's move on now to a
conclusion and we'll talk about USB 3.1
as well so let's go we talked about
performance and power consumption and in
regards to performance this motherboard
performs exactly like all the other x99
boards in other words you're not going
to get a real performance gain from
using this motherboard as opposed to
another motherboard and vice versa
also when regards to power consumption
when we look at the figures here this
x99 acts killer performs just like the
extreme 6 did which performs very
similar to the msi x99s li+ the gigabyte
you default was beating the other three
motherboards the that motherboard has a
plethora of problems in its own also I
forgot to mention included with this
motherboard is a two-way and 3-way SLI
or Xfire connector as well as a USB 3.1
add-on card which gives you those two
extra 3.1 a slots there and also besides
that you get full black side of three
cables included with this motherboard
and you also get that HDD saver cable as
well also I forgot to mention that
asrock make a thing of a SD protection
implemented into their motherboards as
well which could become useful
especially on the N IC liners might me
personally I have had a ni C blowout
during a lightning storm so I like that
that's added in there whether I can test
this or not I mean I can't artificially
produce a lightning bolt so I'm just
gonna trust asrock on this one so when
all's said and done the asrock x99 ex
killer is one phenomenal ball
and I'm gonna keep repeating that
because as rock have got it right with
their x99 line now cosmetically I'd say
they do need to touch things up
especially those little clips I'd like
to see them color code them both red and
black to match the board and I've said
this in the past but besides that when
you buy an AZ rock board what you're
getting is features functions and
utility first besides cosmetics and
that's what I look for when I get a
motherboard I want to know does it have
a solid vrm does it have a good onboard
audio solution does it have a good anti
C on board and the curtain the answer to
all these questions is yes not only does
it have a good vrn it's got a really
phenomenally good vrm on board you've
also got some of the best onboard audio
I've ever heard even then I thought the
mic in on the fatality was even better
than the extreme six and that's like the
best mic in port I'd heard up until that
date so good job on good job on that as
rock I really noticed these little
things and it makes a difference when
you're improving your product and in
turn improving your brand image not
besides besides that we've also got the
fatality and the killer ni C's onboard
which are two are the best in their own
right I'd say the Intel's really good if
you don't have anyone else using your
internet connection and then the killer
would be good if you're in a location
where you've got to use the shared
internet connection though from an
anal-retentive perspective I would say
the Intel would be a little bit better
if you have no one using your internet
though for what it's worth probably
doesn't make much of a difference anyway
but all in said and done also one other
thing that I will point out is that the
USB 3.1 card takes up a four-speed slot
so essentially if you want to use USB
3.1 then you'll only have to 16 speed
slots to use for SLI and other purposes
so that's a little bit of a bummer there
but I mean it can't be helped I mean I
guess the USB 3.1 needs a 4-speed slot
as opposed to one speed slot and I'm
sure not many people would be actually
using 3-way SLI anyway even for
professionals and before we go we'll
quickly talk about pricing I think you
can get this board for a little bit over
$300 though if you don't need the USB
3.1 and me personally I'm not in a
position to take advantage of it I just
go with the original fatality killer
series which will
save you around 50 or $60 if you're in
Australia
eh I can only find the asrock 9x 99 X M
version which is $329 AUD which at that
price is actually a really good deal
so with this motherboard you're pretty
much getting a top-of-the-line
motherboard I can't think of anything
that I would add in besides those little
cosmetic things I think asrock have got
it right on every department here and I
really like what they've done with their
motherboards so one of the guys if you
have any questions or comments about the
x99 X killer then drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can and if you like
this video then please give it a thumbs
up and if you want you can check me out
on social media and whatnot and I'll
catch you in another tech review very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
