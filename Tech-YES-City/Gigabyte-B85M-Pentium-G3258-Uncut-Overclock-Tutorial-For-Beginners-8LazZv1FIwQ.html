my back to you guys today with a
complete overclocking tutorial for the G
32:58
Pentium now this is a Haswell CPU that's
recently been released it's a dual-core
and it's only $70 and it represents
extreme value for money when you couple
it with the budget motherboard like the
gigabyte b85 that I am overclocking on
today so essentially this motherboard
and this Pentium 32:58 they make a great
combo for a low budget gaming rig so
anyway today I'm going to show you guys
how to overclock it on this particular
BIOS you may have a different boss like
as rocker Zeus or MSI however the
settings should overall be pretty
similar anyway let's get on with it so
the first three things first three
programs you'll want to download a
prime95
real temp and cpu-z
now for prime 95 this is a stress tester
so if you have another preferred stress
tester like Ida 64 or OC CT then go
ahead and by all means use that stress
tester I just know I'm just used I'm
very familiar with prime 95 and I find
that for me it gives me a really good
high safe max temps really quickly
without wasting too much time so I
really love this stress tester I mean I
know the other ones are really good as
well just I do prefer prime95 real temp
is a program for pretty much just
showing you the temperatures of your CPU
at the moment it is really hot in this
room it is about 31 degrees so it
actually is quite hot in here and as you
can see here the temperatures are 40 so
they're normal completely normal at idle
and then the last program we want to use
is CPU Z this is essentially a program
that will tell you the core voltage and
also what overclock your processor is
currently at so after you've downloaded
these three programs we can then
continue to install them and then
restart our computer and we will go into
the BIOS where we will be tweaking
around with some settings now to get
into the boss you just simply hit the
hit the delete or the f2 key when you
are starting up your system in my case
it's the Delete key I believe for the
gigabyte boss
so as we're starting on the computer
which hit the Delete key or the f2 key
it depends
which your computer can have them both
at the same time that should enter the
boss anyway once around the boss here we
can see that we've got a huge amount of
options here but I'm going to guide you
guys through just the simple options to
get a nice extra 30% out of your G 32:58
so anyway basically once we're in the
gigabyte BIOS we can go down to advanced
frequency settings now you will have to
update your BIOS in order to do this
especially on a b85 motherboard or any
other non z motherboard from Intel if
you're on a Z motherboard you might not
have to update your boss however if
you're on a non Z motherboard you will
have to update your boss to the latest
BIOS
anyway let's get into it if we click on
advanced frequency settings so we press
enter and I'm going to use my keyboard
for all these settings and I recommend
you do the same I mean you can use your
mouse it's just I'm used to using my
keyboard in the boss and especially it's
always good to have a keyboard with a
number-pad
on it in which you can dial in the
settings manually anyway let's go to
this so we're in advanced frequency
settings and we go to CPU upgrade we
don't touch that we don't touch the CPU
core clock ratio we go down to advanced
CPU core settings and I want you guys to
click enter and enter this and then here
we go to CPU clock ratio and I want you
guys to take this sorry I want you to
press the plus key and you can take this
all the way up to 42 so since this
motherboard actually does have a voltage
limit of 1.2 volts you will want to
start out at maybe 4 gigahertz or 4.2 or
4.3 because I believe it's pretty much a
clock speed that's achievable and
probably most Pentium 32:58 at 1.2 volt
and now we go to K overclock we want to
enable this essentially what this is is
saying look this is a CPU that's
overclocked and since this boss doesn't
usually support overclocking
we want to try and trick the CPU and say
hey this is an overclockable bios or
overclock on my motherboard so we want
to click this to enabled and this
essentially will announce
to overclock the CPU now CPU PLL
selection you can usually leave this on
auto however I do prefer to use South
Bridge PLL that's when I was testing my
for 670 K I found this was the best
setting for just general stability and
higher clocks you guys might have a
preference of Northbridge I prefer South
Bridge PLL it's up to you I filter per
level you can set this to auto that's
fine on call ratio we can take this all
up all the way up to 100 megahertz lower
than our CPU clock ratio this is the
optimum speed however if you run into a
bad overclock I do recommend changing
this one first maybe set this to 3.8
gigs if you can't boot up at 4.2 gigs
because sometimes the this Haswell CPUs
are very funny in that you can actually
achieve a pretty high clock ratio
sometimes but only with a low uncor
ratio for instance my CPU can achieve
4.6 gigs on the core clock but only when
I use an uncle ratio of 4.1 gigs so it's
actually funny how these CPUs what but
for that we will set this to 4.1 as it
is the optimum level 100 megahertz lower
than the clock ratio is optimum and then
I want you guys to go down to power watt
limit here and we can just take this all
the way up to say 150 it's not a big
deal it's basically a limit that I'm
sure the Pentium is not going to reach
on 1.2 volts anyway
anyway we can go down now to core
current limit amps and we can set that
for maybe 120 it's not a big deal I
don't think the Pentium is going to be
drawing anymore than both these figures
now we can go down and leave these on
auto number of calls enabled to by
default CPU enhanced state we want to
leave that on auto essentially that's
your just your initial state of bolting
down and turbo endowed when the intel
speedstep technology is enabled so we
can leave all those on auto and now we
can go back and so we hit escape and we
can go back and leave those settings
there and we hit escape again and I want
you to us to go down now to advanced
voltage settings and feel free I mean if
I'm going too fast for you guys feel
to replay these segments over and pause
and listen to the same parts as it is
kind of tricky I guess if it's specially
if it's your first time
overclocking but be you know definitely
copy my settings and leave a comment in
the comment section below if you're
having trouble and a lot of people will
help you out around here it's a good
it's a good community around tech yo
city anyway CPU we want a so sorry I'll
actually go back and show you what I did
there advance voltage settings we click
enter and then we want to go to CPU core
voltage control so essentially we click
enter here and then for CPU V Rin we can
leave that on external the external
override we can leave that on order
however some people like to manually set
it to 1.8 volts me too I do like to
manually set this to 1.8 volts a CPU v
core now this is the most important part
of an overclock this and the CPU ring
voltage so we're going to pay particular
attention to the CPU vehicle here and
we're going to go to normal now there's
two modes here in this files they're
usually on house wall though it you guys
may be familiar with offset and adaptive
voltage however in this path it is a
little bit different in that normal is
generally your offset and adaptive
all-in-one I found on this motherboard
however if you do click it again so if
you press the plus key once it'll go to
normal you press the plus key again
it'll take you to manual vaults where
you can dial in your vaults manually so
we can dial in 1.2 there however if you
see here I dial in 1.3 it'll go back to
auto meaning there is a limit of 1.2
volts in this box even one point two
zero one it'll go back to auto or one
point two one it just won't go so 1.2
volt is the limit in this bias however
since we do want to take advantage of
the intel speedstep technology we will
want to hit that to order and that we
will want to go here simply just max
this offset all the way up as far as it
can go to 0.1 and essentially this will
order automatically it'll either work or
it won't work and I mean if you want to
achieve the highest overclock possible
and we'll check in CPU Z how high it
goes but essentially if you want to
achieve the highest overclock possible
you can you can
this 21.2 volt initially and see how
high your CPU goes but I generally find
with this normal adaptive voltage
it'll vault up to the highest the CPU
needs anyhow
anyway now the next part we want to go
to is the CPU ring voltage and same deal
we can go to normal here and we can just
set the offset all the way up to 0.1
I'll actually just dial it in on the pad
manually so we said at the point 1 and
we're good to go
now one thing to keep in mind is the CPU
ring voltage you may have to dial this
back a little bit if we are indeed come
into a crash it'll be the first thing
that I will be dialing back today if my
computer crashes
anyway we go down CPU system agent
voltage order input output analog
voltage leader motor and digital voltage
we can leave that on although as well
now that's it for CPU core vol so we hit
escape and we can hit escape again and
we generally I think by this time we
should be good to go I mean I'll just
check some other settings here if we go
to BIOS features or serials we can go
here to yes so I want you guys to go to
peripherals I've actually got to work on
my pronunciation of that word and then
we can go to Intel processor graphics
and just go down and click disabled so
this will disable the onboard graphics
on our CPU if you need this on obviously
leave it on enabled if you're using the
motherboards graphics however if you
have your own graphics card then you can
disable this and it will keep your CPU a
little bit cooler and it will save a
little bit of power so hopefully it'll
help you overclock your cpu further than
it otherwise would be able to go so at
this stage we now are ready to go we can
go over to save and exit by hitting the
left and right arrow keys and navigated
through bars and we can actually before
we do save and exit we can save this
profile and we can go click enter and
enter again and call it 4.2 gigs
overclock and then that's saved
and that that we can load that up
anytime and tweak it so if it's a good
setting we can load it up against if
we're trying to go higher with our
overclocks
we come back to that profile so let's
save configuration and reset and we'll
see what happens in Windows now or if
even if it hopefully it can boot up I
mean it actually is a pretty hot day so
hopefully it will boot up and we will
get into Windows and then we can run a
stress test hopefully so as we can see
here it's past the BIOS which is the
first good sign however it looks like it
may be getting stuck when booting into
Windows I believe this is a crash which
there you go you saw it there so we can
now dial our overclocks back and we can
see the first thing I want to try
actually is maybe the first thing we
should try here
so we can hold our power button down for
five seconds and hopefully we're able to
make it back into the BIOS so the first
thing we can try here is going in and
just dialing our overclocks back just a
little bit and seeing if we can make it
into seeing if we can make it into
Windows so that's what we want to do so
I'm dialed back to 4.1 and four and I
will try saving that I will save that
profile as 4.1 gig 4.1 gigahertz
overclock okay so the profile saved we
can save and exit and we'll generally
just see if this can boot to Windows so
I believe it may be something to do with
that
uncle ratio they are pretty tricky
because I have been testing this CPU at
4.2 gigs
I'm actually surprised that is not
booting this time
around so as you can see here it into
Windows absolutely no problems and so
what we're going to do now is we are
going to open up these three programs
which I told you guys to download
earlier and we're going to basically
stress test our CPU and see how how hot
it gets essentially so if our CPU goes
to pretty much a hundred degrees and
that's really bad but if it goes I guess
with this because I'm using the Intel
stock cooler and it is in the dead heat
of summer if it honestly if it goes up
to ninety degrees that's absolutely fine
on this CPU I think in in winterfell's
going up to 90 degrees and I'd be
worried but we run this stress test here
so we open up these three and I'll do
that again actually I did that pretty
fast for you guys so you just want to
open up CPU Z and then you want to open
up real temp and then what we want to do
is I will exit that quickly so what we
want to do is we want to open up prime95
again and we want to do small FFTs
maximum heat FPU stress so it's maximum
heat and we go okay so we're testing
we're just basically loading up our
computer with as much heat as we can
give it and this is what I like about
prime95 it's going to find those maximum
temperatures pretty quickly and then
we'll just quickly test it here for two
minutes and then we can say okay we'll
try for point two gigs again but this
time I might leave the uncor ratio at
just four gigahertz and then we'll try
that again so what we're doing is we're
just finding our optimum overclocks
and as I told you guys I've already been
testing this thing at four point two
gigs so I know it's the uncle ratio and
that's how Haswell behaves pretty much
the uncork rate ratio is so crucial to
getting a stable overclock on this
platform it's unbelievable a lot of
people message me saying my computer can
only go to four gigs and that's most
likely because they're trying to bump up
the on-call ratio as well as the core
clock when instead if they just try
bumping up the core clock they'll get a
much stable a more higher overclock too
now
was able to be achieved without bumping
on both up at the same time some of
their we've run it for two minutes so
we're just going to jump back into the
BIOS and try running the just the CPU
clock core clock at four point two this
time so there we go two minutes okay
let's give that a try
so we'll just reset I will just quickly
shut it down
and then we'll turn it on again and
we'll go back into the BIOS and change
those settings so just hitting a Delete
key
and I mean overclocking you have to be
patient with it right if you are not
patient with overclocking then I believe
you should maybe try it shouldn't try it
at all so it's just a matter of trial
and error pretty much especially since
every CPU is different so we go back in
here we can just try this time just
upping this one to 4.2 gigs and leaving
the Encore ratio at four gigs and we'll
see how we go this time so we'll save
this profile again as a 4.2 gig
overclock and that's the character limit
I try to type in K but there actually is
a character limit on this so it's like
four point gigging 4.2 gigs
overclock anyway let's let's see if it's
in the windows hopefully it will boot
into Windows it might hang I don't know
but I don't believe it will so here we
go we are booted up into Windows this
time so we have booted up into Windows
this time and we're at 4.2 gigs as you
guys see with the on call ratio at 4
gigs so we're going to open up CPU Z and
then we're going to simply run that
stress test again and see how it goes so
we open up real temp and as you guys
know this is C here we're already
running at pretty much 1.2 volts so we
can't go any any higher on the voltage
so we're going to run that small FFT
stress test again and then we're going
to see what temperature's we get and
then if this is successful for 2 minutes
I will try running it at 4.3 gigs
however in my previous testing I just
was not successful in running this CPU
4.3 gigs so it does need more voltage in
other words so I will have to put this
CPU in my main z87 motherboard if I want
to see how high it can go so anyway as
we can see here 1.2 volt 4.2 gigs it
looks pretty stable the on call ratio is
at 4 gigs and we do have what it seems
is a stable overclock so any guys anyway
guys that's about it for the
overclocking tutorial if you have any
questions or comments about this
tutorial then please leave a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can or someone
else around here will share their
knowledge and help you out because
there's a lot of knowledgeable people
around this channel and if you like this
video please give a thumbs up as it took
me a little while to do and it and
obviously learn the gigabyte BIOS is
this my first time on a gigabyte bias in
a long time maybe I think our 7 years
possibly and anyway that's about it so
yeah as we can see here it's running
pretty stable I mean I may just quickly
if you guys are still there I might just
quickly try and boot into 4.3 gigs
though I have already tested this in the
past and it hasn't booted up at 4.3 gigs
so pretty much this is a mediocre CPU
the one thing I will say is that if you
can't get 4.2 gigs like if you're typing
in my settings 4.2 on the core clock or
wow I hit delete too late so if you're
hitting 4.2 gig on the core clock and
you're hitting maybe 4 and it doesn't
boot up then maybe you want to try 4.1
and 3.9 and just basically drop the
Encore ratio down first and then try
getting a stable overclock and then
after that try booting up the Encore
ratio as high as it goes so I basically
recommend in a nutshell seeing how high
your CPU goes first and then after that
you can see how high your own core ratio
goes so as I saw here my uncle ratio was
maxed out at 4.4 gigs
however the CPU did make it to 4.2 gigs
so we're going to try a 4.3 on the
caller this
time and see how it goes just just for
trial and error and I mean hey at me
maybe the CPUs warmed up a little bit
and I might want to go to 4.3 I mean it
might boot to Windows and 4.3 I'm
curious but I don't think it will
wait it is booting so it may hang on the
stress tests or no there we go it
crashed so it doesn't even work okay so
my computer automatically turned off it
means it came into a fail overclock and
that's that so there we go guys that is
the stable settings for my CPU 4.2 gigs
on the clock ratio with the coil ankle
ratio of 4 gigs so that was what I
managed to jump into into a stable
overclock and also the benefits of this
is that I've still got intel speedstep
enabled and I still can take advantage
of those power saving features even
though cpu-z
does say it's running at 1.2 volts
constantly so I've ready tested with my
power meter and it's good to go anyways
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I
will catch you with another tech video
very soon and peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
