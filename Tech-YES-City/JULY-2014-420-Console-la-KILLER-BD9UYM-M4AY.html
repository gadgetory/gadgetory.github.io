it's time to go back to y2k and listen
to this song
welcome back to tech city this is
biryanis coming back to you guys today
with the july budget build so this is
like a four hundred and twenty dollar
budget built after rebates I just
finished testing the Pentium system and
man was it impressive for the money
you're getting a decent gaming
experience at 1080p and not just that
you're gonna be saving a shitload of
power on the power bills so man I really
like this build I don't think I'll be
doing some other budget builds for the
month I kind of want to get back to
doing my main text off revealing
products and stuff so maybe next month
I'll give you guys more budget builds
but for now let's go with Newegg and
Amazon this month and we are gonna get
straight into this budget build and the
first part of the build is an Animax
boss hogg so like I love the name of
this case but anyway it's just a case
you get a ten dollar rebate so it'll
make the case $30 and I mean it's got
everything you need there it looks
pretty cool let's got a power button USB
ports audio on the front at the top and
yeah it looks good I mean it's got a
screw loose installation as well and we
look at the side here it'll fit a 750ti
absolutely no problems not to mention
it's all black it looks sleep sleek
looks pretty well built I think it comes
with two fans as well so hey man what
more could you want for $30 anyway let's
go on with the next pile they've built
and that is the MSI gaming 750ti so this
thing is a hundred and twenty dollars
after you get a $25 rebate so amazing
the value you're getting here is
incredible $420 this card is freaking
legit means it uses like 60 watts on you
know when it's when you're gaming and it
just it literally stays so cool it stays
so quiet it's on the new Maxwell
architecture and man I was I just
recently reviewed the Maxwell
architecture I got the gang wood golden
savile but they don't they don't seem to
sell it in the States but this card
literally is legit for 120 bucks I mean
you'll be surprised with the performance
this thing will bring and especially if
you overclock it even further I mean I
did the golden sample was like 1333 out
of the box so these things can clock
pretty high if you get a good GPU to
clock anyway the msi the Twin Frozr is
it's renowned for staying quiet and
being cool as well so you can't go wrong
with this my dimension is the cheapest
750ti out there as well and it looks
pretty decent
$120 damn I give him two of these things
it's a shame you can't necessarily these
things that's that's a real shame he's
two of those things in SL I'd be awesome
but anyway next while the build is the
course scx 430 so this is just a budget
power supply I mean the main reason
we're going with this is because it's
one T dollars after a $20 rebate so
you're getting one hell of a power
supply for $20 it's bronze certified
it's got a huge amount of amps on the
rail 12 volt rail there I mean for what
we need I mean it's not 32 amps on the
12 volt rail isn't exactly nothing to
fret over but it's definitely good you
know for this build it's gonna be way
more than enough so it's gonna be
overkill for this build considering
probably drawing like a hundred and
forty fifty watts and yeah so this
Corsair power supply absolutely fine for
the money and then next by the bubble
let's move on yeah calm and quiet baby
this is what the month of July is all
about now Ram is still ridiculously
overpriced this is like the cheapest
stuff I managed to pull up on you egg I
mean if you go to PC pop picker go get
yourself cheaper parts if you want to I
just sometimes honestly if I'll build a
new PC I'd probably go from Amazon and
you a gif files in the States
files in UK I probably just buy it all
from Amazon and if I was you know I
usually just buy it all from you might
that's just might the way I am
so this Ram anyway let's talk about this
around the 1600 plus 1333 which is more
than enough I mean Ram is not an
important factor in this bill demand
you've got a Pentium which utilizes ram
actually really well and then you've got
tight timings there at 999 24 and you
got eight gigs of this stuff so that's
gonna be plenty more than you need not
to mention if you wanted you could
probably overclock this stuff to 1600
speed 999 anyhow so nothing to worry
about that next buy the build is
something I have a little bit I mean
it's a cheap board $45 it's an MSI H 81
mp3 3 so the msi version comes with some
decent caps on board they think they've
got solid-state caps on board and MSI's
dark chokes as well so that's always a
good thing I mean it should be
okay if you want to spend an extra five
dollars you can get the gigabyte variant
which I do believe has a better MOSFET
on board so but you know this will be
fun should be fine for a Pentium and an
assembly TTI and two sticks of RAM and
one or two drives shouldn't be a problem
anyway good board for the money it's $45
and yeah it's really budget now
something I've talked about at the end I
will talk about some upgrade choices
with the CPU but I'll talk about that at
the end but that's for Newegg it comes
to 33 38 96 but then you can take us
there
further $55 off with rebates but don't
count on those rebates some people tell
me they get all their rebates some
people tell me they can't get rebates so
yeah I'll give you guys two prices
anyway but let's move on now to Amazon
where we have a Western Digital blue for
$58 delivered to your door solid hard
drive for the money I mean if you can
afford it look and SSDs are going out
dirt cheap this month I think I saw like
an SSD 120 GB SSD for like $57 and a 240
you buy for $100 damn good value for
money if you can afford it get yourself
an SSD but it's always handy to have a
one terabyte drive
I mean look even if you get an SSD
you're gonna have those movies you know
you're gonna have that porn flick that
mediocre porn flick that you you don't
watch that much and you're like okay you
know I'll watch it when I get bored of
all my good porn so you want to keep
that on the backup Drive and this thing
will definitely become a good backup
drive when you get when you can't come
into some more money so that's not a
problem
anyway Western Digital blue love the
name I love Western Digital drives
anyway good good solid Drive for the
money anyway let's move on next I'll
build the intel pentium g 3220 I just
tested this thing and man it runs
absolutely fine with a 750 Ti actually a
really good combo the two of these
together they just smashed games at
1080p like I mean games would really
smooth if I'd stop the town of medium
settings they would butter smooth at
1080p some games played it high here is
a new earth played at Ultra like I think
new boroughs in us even did 1440p on
high no problems on the 750ti and the
Pentium so if you're into like MOBA
games you know just sort of these alt
like League of Legends like this thing
like this build
we'll be absolutely fine for that to
play games even a 1440p so then the
Pentium processor is a little bit
underrated I think the pentium g 32:58
has recently been released and so the
one thing I've realized what that is
it's a great bridging CPU like if you
get a z97 motherboard right now and then
you get a Pentium 32:58
you can then just hold out till
Broadwell and then you can just sell the
Pentium 32:58 and you might probably
won't lose any money probably like ten
dollars on it and then you can get
yourself a Broadwell CPU and smash it in
like a five 770 K or whatever they
release so the upgrade options are
pretty good with the 32:58 if you decide
to do it that's probably the only route
I could see me using the 32:58
I mean like if you were just saying yeah
I'm gonna get a new rig get a z87 and
32:58 it's kind of like a waste of money
because honestly a budget i5 with a H
81m will give you more value for money
than a 32:58 and it's the 97 or it's the
87 board will so I think of it as a
great bridging CPU if you wanted to
upgrade to broad well anyway the 3220
and a H 81 m motherboard is a great
combo for the money I mean you're
spending like a hundred dollars on the
motherboard and CPU and what you get for
that money is damn good the last part of
build is a DVD drive at 18 bucks I mean
if you already have one of these things
save yourself 18 bucks
I generally it's always good to have one
of them around the house and that brings
the Amazon total to a hundred and thirty
three dollars and 22 cents now if you're
going to use this build as your main rig
and you didn't have any upgrade plans in
hindsight like you're like not in
hindsight sorry and you're just future
prediction vision then I would suggest
getting maybe an i3 because they have
you know they're clocked higher there I
think is clocked at three points five or
3.7 gigs
they've got hyper threading and they've
got the AVX instruction set which isn't
pretty important if you want to do video
rendering and stuff like that so they've
got some instruction sets there that are
good for streaming and rendering and so
yeah the i3 is a good option if you're
gonna use this as your main rec for a
couple of years you know the i3 will
certainly give you good performance the
Pentium is great though if you just want
to
play games and that's it and you want to
budget CPU so anyway that brings the
whole total to have done the calculator
here and get the calculator up here
brings the whole total to four hundred
and seventy two dollars and 18 cents
that's what you're initially gonna pay
upfront and then you should get fifty
five dollars in rebates should and so
they'll bring the whole budget to four
hundred and seventeen dollars and 18
cents
damn fine billed for the money this
thing is a console killer it'll be
faster I mean I just recently got done
testing my golden sample gangly see I've
got a game would golden sample right
here and this thing was trading blows
with an r9 270 in some cases I was
freaking blown off my feet by this thing
now the MSI version I don't know if it's
as good as this but Dan it's a fine C
graphics card for the money especially
$120 you cannot go wrong so anyway this
thing legit console killer legit
performance at a budget and damn you're
gonna be saving some power on that power
bill so anyway save some money on that
power bill anyway if you like this bill
please give it a thumbs up if you have
any questions about this bill please
leave a comment the comment section
below I will catch you guys with some
reviews and all the tech videos very
shortly anyway peace out for now Bharani
Z by and damn it's hot knee and roll the
outro yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
