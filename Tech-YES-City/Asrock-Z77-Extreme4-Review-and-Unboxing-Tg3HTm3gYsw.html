show you a quick review here today of
the asrock z77 extreme for motherboards
basically this board is probably it's
going around the internet as one of them
one of the most popular boards in terms
of value for money for the budget
overclocker so let's have a look at this
I got this board because I got the h77
MVP but that board wouldn't allow me to
overclock so I got this board and my
best friend basically said he'll take
the h77 off my hands I was pretty lucky
because Intel's website did say that hey
show me so no BOTS but that was my
bomber I got dude I should say so anyway
these are two cables so as soon as we
open the box we see here we've got some
solder three six gigabyte cables we got
two of them with the box that's all I'm
going to need we have let's just quickly
open this check out what we get is a
okay it is a sly connector that's just
slight connector or Nvidia also yeah
crossfire and sly-jay i/o shield for
your case this one's black and it looks
pretty stylish actually so over the h77
this looks better and obviously going up
this is the first level of their extreme
motherboards useless crap virtue MVP and
X 555 which doesn't really relate to me
a manual cuz I got mine in Japan this
one is the Japanese manual and this one
is the normal manual so yeah that's
before we get to the motherboard so and
open that up
see it's packaged very well I'll leave
you
kudos to Ezra they do package their
things really well so we take that off
straight away and what we have there is
one really good-looking motherboard must
submit does look pretty cool
straight away you notice that it's got a
big heat sink here and another heat sink
here for the MOSFETs and here we have
the Southbridge heatsink so that looks
pretty cool
so overall the looks is really good on
this thing and straight away moving to
the let's take this plastic off here so
it comes off pretty easy straight away
so we get a good look at it there we
have a PCI x16 port here for your video
card a PCO one here Express pi-1 speed
Express here and another one down here
down the bottom an X 8 here 2 X eights
here oh wait sorry no that's another one
for your video card there so you got 2
PCI Express ports for video cards there
then here you've got another you know
what that is so let's just out of just
standard other PCI Express ports so you
have 4 RAM slots here the clicks on it
like the clicks on the round they feel
really good like the feel solid so if
you click that feels pretty solid there
so it looks that feels good quality
basically I'm trying to I'm trying to
say is that feels like good quality the
board feels heavy this board feels heavy
feels like it's pretty well made if we
look over here we have a power button
down here and reset button something I
think they copied off a Zeus Zeus was
doing that a while ago it's a really
nice feature either I do like it it's
got an LED display here diagnose
problems I think that's for we've got
down here so we take
apparently this is version so it's the
boss there apparently version 1.2 so
here we've got our SATA ports here now
something to remember about these solder
ports is a pet as opposed to Zeus is
cheaper side a port like that I hate my
other h77 board I've got the review on
my you can check it out just click to
your right here check out if you want to
check out the h77 review you'll notice
that these SATA ports are a lot more
solid on this board so they're very
solid these SATA ports on the h77 then I
have the SATA ports feel a little bit
loose I mean it's nothing big but it's
just overall it adds up to little things
about the board so that's something I
like about this board it makes you know
makes you know to the overall feel of
the board makes better makes it better
so you've got these gold-plated like
kind of like the gold-plated to make it
look color scheme I think it's actually
going it's definitely not gold it's just
a gold paint scheme so looks pretty cool
now we turn around to the back of the
motherboard well it's yeah the adapter
plate looks good that's actually easier
than the previous model so the h77
actually had pins sticking out here this
does as well but they're actually
positioned differently so you can
install your cooler probably easier on
this board so I'll give you a look there
the pins here these two little pins
where my fingers are they're positioned
away from the cooler so now you can do
the cooler combo with this board it will
allow you to install your LGA 775 cooler
and some other coolers with this board
if you're upgrading so the rear of the
board looks good now if we come over
here to the side you can check out the
input/output here so reason why I got
this board is because over another
cheaper z77 board for instance the pro
three is because I I do watch a lot with
this spdf FL so I do have surround sound
and I do want this feature
right here another thing that that's
pretty cool is the clear CMOS that is
really handy so you just press that and
you clears your CMOS if you've got a
done about overclock or things are just
you know annoying we've got total of six
USB ports obviously to being side a
three another got a LAN cable there this
actually this model comes with a broad
comb I read on the specs it's come with
a broad come land chipset as opposed to
a real tech it's got a HDMI out there
DVI out and just standard VGA out ps2
one and yeah it's got the other audio
ports so overall feels like a very good
board I going to install it now and try
and finally overclock my finally
overclock my I 535 70 K so this looks
pretty cool honestech think these
stickers off here so yeah overall this
board is so far looking like a very very
good value for money board very good
quality the heat sinks are awesome
everything feels really awesome on the
board so all the you know capacitors
feel like they're on pretty good this
capacitor does feel a little bit loose
yeah yeah that's pretty solid caps are
gonna be caps are always gonna be like
that so yeah the board feels solid so
you can you know rest assured that
you're not getting a they have quality
tested this board pretty well it's a
rest assured you're getting a good board
if you buy this board its overall looks
so far it's looking at it like it's 5
out of 5 for value for money so hey guys
it does have features like the virtue
LCD I mean I'm yet to try that but I
hear some more right things about it so
far so hey guys if you've got any
questions leave in the comments below
and also on another one want the last
thing about this board is it does have
an ALC 8 9 8 codec over an 8 9 2 so I
guess it's got a better suit codec for
audio so that's another good thing so
yeah anyway guys if you any questions
leave them in the comments below and of
course subscribe keep the big Brian easy
go on you
so alright guys anyway peace out catch
you later
that's the asrock z77
extreme fall</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
