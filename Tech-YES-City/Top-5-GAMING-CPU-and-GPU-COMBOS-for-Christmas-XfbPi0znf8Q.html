you guys we do a top list
of CPUs or GPUs for the money,
however, today we're
gonna be combining those
and making top five combos for your money
that you can pick up,
get straight into gaming,
before Christmas 2018.
Let's take a look.
(upbeat music)
welcome back to Tech YES
City, and today's list,
have no fear, we're gonna
be taking care of people
who want new parts, also
people who want used parts,
and we're gonna be taking care of people
all around the world, as well,
but let's start off with deal number one
which is a brand-new combo
with a Ryzen 3 22000G.
This is four cores, four threads,
and it's coming in at under $90.
Now the good news is you
can overclock this as well.
It comes with an included CPU cooler,
so it just screams value for money.
Now if you wanna couple
this with an RX 580,
which can be had for around $200,
then you're gonna be
getting some great value
for money as well as a great combination
for gaming at 1080p, even ultra settings
with some of the latest titles.
For instance, if you wanna
play Call of Duty:Black Ops 4,
you can do that with this combination,
and also for the motherboards.
If you wanna have no
problems out of the box,
I'd suggest maybe going with the B450,
but if you know how to update your BIOS,
then you can get B350s
going for very cheap,
and the good news is as well,
DDR4 memory has also come down
in price, so this combo is
really good value for money.
Now for the next combination,
coming in at number two,
is a used price performance deal
that can be shipped
international since it's bought
from AliExpress, and this
here is the Xeon X3440,
four cores, eight threads, $16.
The good news is, too,
you can overclock it.
It's just phenomenal value for money,
and we couple this well with a GTX 750 Ti,
which can be had for
$55 posted to your door.
Now for motherboards in DDR3,
they're pretty cheap as well.
We can get a H55 motherboard
for around $50 posted,
and some DDR3 memory for around about $38.
As for the gaming performance
on combo number two,
you can definitely expect
to play some competitive
multiplayer titles
at 1080p, either low, medium
settings with good fps.
We're talking games like CS:GO,
Dota 2, and even Fortnite
as well, with a smooth,
playable experience.
As for combo number
three, we're going back
to Amazon.com and looking
at brand-new parts here,
Ryzen 5 2600, six cores, 12
threads, can be overclocked,
comes with an included CPU cooler,
which does a good job of
keeping the CPU under control,
and the best thing is
it's around $190 U.S.
If you're in Australia, you
can pick these things up
for around about $208 Aussie dollars,
making them phenomenal value for money,
just like the previous combo.
Now for a graphics card,
you can either couple this
with a GTX 1070 Ti or a GTX 1070.
Both are going out pretty
damn cheap at the moment.
This will give you a great experience
for either 1440p gaming
or 1080p ultra settings.
Latest titles in 2018,
absolutely no problems,
and as for a motherboard,
you can go with a B450
and have no problems.
You'll be able to overclock.
Get some really good performance
if you overclock as well,
even better than that of
out-of-the-box settings,
and also, with DDR4 memory,
this has come down in price.
You can get a 16 gigabyte
kit for around about $120,
sometimes closer to $100 if it's on sale,
and now going back to
the international deals,
we're going back to AliExpress,
and we've got a little bit of an upgrade
over combo number two.
This is if you want a
little bit more performance
and maybe you don't want to overclock.
So here we've got the Xeon 1230.
This is going for $61 shipped,
and you can also get a H61 motherboard
for a little over $40, as
well as some DDR3 memory.
Again, around about $38
for an 8-gigabyte stick,
and the best news is is when
we go for a graphics card,
we can look at a GTX
950, and these are going
for around $80 posted to your door.
So, this combination here will give you
better performance figures
than combo number two.
Sure, it'll cost a little bit more,
but you will get better
performance at 1080p,
at least with some competitive
multiplayer titles.
You'll even be able to
play some of the latest
and greatest titles at medium settings.
For instance, Call of Duty:Black Ops 4,
and now last on the list
here at number five,
we're going back to the new
parts, and looking at Amazon,
and even in Australia as
well, Intel don't have a lot
of value options at the moment.
I can't find the i5-8400 for
anywhere for a good price.
This was one of my
favorite CPUs from Intel,
and there's no 9000
series out at the moment,
at least from what I can find,
and so I feel like the best
CPU to go for at the moment
from Intel is the 8600K going
for around $240 U.S. dollars.
This is overclockable,
however, you will have
to get a CPU cooler, so
I do recommend something
like the $35 M410 from Cooler Master.
This will do a great job of
taking this to five gigahertz,
and for a Z370 motherboard,
MSI have one going
for around $90.
So this will give you
king-of-the-hill performance
in terms of games that demand
single-threaded performance
like World of Warcraft, for example,
but you'll still be able to play games
like Battlefield V that use
more cores and more threads
absolutely fine since this
thing at five gigahertz
on six cores, six threads
is an absolute beast.
Now for the graphics
card, I'd recommend going
with something like a GIGABYTE RTX 270.
It gives you great performance for $500.
Now if you can pick up a used 1080 Ti,
they do perform a bit better than a 2070,
however, they're becoming more scarce now,
they're becoming more rarer to find,
and also, they are used compared to new,
so that's something you have to weigh up.
Me personally, I love
buying used hardware.
If you follow the
channel, you'll know this,
but in terms of getting used stuff,
RTX 2070 at $500 is
definitely not a bad pickup,
and of course, when it
comes to this last combo
and gaming performance,
pretty much play any title
at either 1080p or 1440p ultra settings.
Anyway, guys, that about
wraps up today's list.
If you enjoyed this one, be
sure to hit that Like button.
Also, let us know in the
comment section below
what was your favorite combo and why,
or would you add any
different parts to the list.
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always.
The one thing I'll also mention
before I get on outta here,
if you're looking for
something to double down
with gaming and do some productivity,
for instance video editing,
then the Ryzen 5 2600
definitely wins an award here
for pretty much being able to
do it all at a great price.
Anyway, guys, I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now.
Bye.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
