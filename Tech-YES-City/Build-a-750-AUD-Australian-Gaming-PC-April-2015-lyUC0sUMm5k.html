down under a $750 gaming PC for April
2015 the one thing I will say is that I
got a lot of requests for 900 - around
about $1,000 for a gaming PC and for
some reason when I looked at all the
parts everything was off I mean the
difference between an i3 and an i-5 was
an extra hundred dollars and the i3 is
clocked higher than the i5 then the
graphics card is between an r9 280 in
the GTX 970 is over $200 so we had to
factor in a lot of those things and so
I'm gonna say you either go with this or
you go with something like around $1,200
but that being said let's get on with
this
but today's bill will be a great build
for 1080p gaming with new games like GTA
5 and Far Cry 4 you should be able to
play those games at high settings no
problems another thing to remember as
well as the prices kind of have gone up
since Easter and all has weakened
against the American dollar and that
being said I will put all the links in
the description below for the UK
Australia and the US so let's get on
with it so for the CPU we're going with
an i3 4160 now this thing comes in at
150 Australian dollars and for the price
it's actually pretty good considering
the closest eye 5 which is clocked at
3.2 gigs
cost over 250 dollars I was like
scratching my head and thinking what is
going on in Australia at the moment why
is the four core so much more expensive
than the i3 I guess the i3 has been
underrated it's not selling enough that
being said it's actually the one of the
best value CPUs in Australia at the
moment so we're gonna go with it today
since it's got four threads and it'll
have no problems with those games that
require four threads and that being said
let's move on to the next part some of
the multiple we're going with them be 85
845 from MSI I know this thing comes in
at 84 strain dollars and it's a good
motherboard for the price I mean the B
85 s are kind of that step up from the H
81 m and this one is a little bit better
for overclocking than the H 81 and
variants as it has a better vrm on board
I personally used a variant of this b85
motherboard and I can see it does a
fantastic job of running the Haswell
four cores really well not only that it
stays cool and it'll support a graphics
card at PCI Express three speeds as well
so you don't have to worry about that so
great board for the money so for the
case we're going with a $45 Coolermaster
3:3 for you this case is just a decent
case it's an entry-level case but it
will fit all your all your components in
there no problems at all installation
should be pretty good since it is a
Coolermaster case they do get things
right when it comes to simplicity and
that's all you're gonna need in today's
build so for the memory we're going with
some g.skill ripjaws 1600 speed ddr3
memory this is one eight gigabyte stick
of memory it's also 84 dollars so it's
not too bad
value for money with
specially when the memory is pretty
overpriced in Australia anyway this is
not too bad now you've also got one
stick there so if you wish to add
another stick in the future to get 16
gigabytes of memory you can do that
especially if you're going to upgrade to
a fork or eight threaded CPU in the
future so you just have to switch out
the CPU as well you can use the same
motherboard anyway
this memory is good all you have to do
is bang in the XMP profiles and you've
got yourself sixteen hundred speed
memory instantly so for the hard drive
we're going with none other than the
Western Digital caviar blue one terabyte
this thing comes in a little bit over
sixty Australian dollars and for the
money it's a really good hard drive it's
fast it's cheap you've got a lot of
storage there you're also in the future
if you wish to upgrade you can use this
as a backup hard drive so Western
Digital have you covered for the hard
drive now for the gratis card this is
the most important part of your build
and for the value for money here the r9
280 at 250 Australian dollars is pretty
damn good value for money
so if you want to step it up to a better
graphics card your next thing up is like
an online 290 which is going for around
$400 and then there's a GTX 970 which is
going for around four hundred seventy
dollars so the price difference there is
quite big though for $250 the r9 280
will do a fantastic job of playing games
at 1080p and playing them pretty damn
well
so for the powerplay this is one of the
parts where I really like to spend a
little bit of extra money if you can you
can go with a 55 dollar 500 watt power
supply that will be perfectly fine
though for a national 24 dollars you can
get something that will last you into
the future so this is what we're going
with we only the silverstone strainer
sensor of 600 watt 80 plus bronze power
supply now it'll power this build
perfectly fine more it's overkill for
this build but if you wish to upgrade
your components in the future you'll
generally won't have to worry about the
power supply especially if you're going
with a 4 core CPU and then you're going
to step it up to like a GTX 970 or
something in the future this power
supply will be perfectly fine for that
as well
also while saving you power and the
power bill and being a more reliable
suit than the cheaper components so
that's it for today the total bill comes
in a 760 - Ozzie dollars and it's gonna
be a great PC for gaming so if you
haven't already hit that like button and
