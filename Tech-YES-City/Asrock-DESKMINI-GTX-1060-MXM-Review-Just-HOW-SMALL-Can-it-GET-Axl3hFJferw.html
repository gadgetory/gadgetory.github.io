my new travel 4k PC I didn't think it
would get any better I thought hey this
is the smallest most compact most
powerful desktop PC I can get that can
edit 4k videos on the road but then
asrock sent in this thing beside me here
their desk mini and this packs a gtx
1066 gigabyte edition and it has the
ability to install a six or seven gen 4
core 8 threaded cpu and you couple that
in with the ability to have 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 so-dimm memory and you've got
yourself this little powerful beast here
now it is actually smaller in dimensions
than my in wind chop and so it comes in
with a total capacity size of 2.7 liters
and it's 212 mil tall by 150 4
millimeters long by 81 millimeters deep
so it is a little bit shorter in length
and width but it is a little bit thicker
than the in wind Chopin however that
said it does carry an AC adapter and
this is probably my only critique with
this product you do need the AC adapter
to give this unit power does plug in the
back fire a four pin connector but with
that this whole build only uses up about
a hundred and forty watts with an i7
6700 and the GTX 1066 gigabyte which
interestingly enough can be overclocked
on both the memory and the core clock
but you can't change the fan speeds for
some reason and you can't unlock voltage
so this is an MX M type of graphics card
configuration I've never actually heard
of it until now and apparently they are
releasing a gtx 1070 and 1080 model in
the same form factor though for me
personally the 1060 is great for this
size doesn't use a whole lot of power
I'd imagine if you put something in like
a GTX 1080 for example you would have
some thermal problems especially if the
cooler is as small as it is on this one
here the GTX 1060 but for what it's
worth with the temperatures we're
talking around 70 degrees maximum even
when overclocked in a heaven benchmark
after around 20 minutes of stressing
also in games the CPU that got up to
about 70 degrees though when I stress
tested it individually it did go all the
way up to 90 degrees but with that it
was the quietest I've ever heard a fork
or a threaded CPU on the Intel stock
heatsink fan I'll give you guys a quick
so what this means is asrock have said
in a very subtle fan profile from the
get-go and now when I initially got this
unit it does come in with three nvme and
two slots and so I used an nvme and got
to drive and I had no problems until I
got to Windows it crashed and then I
updated the BIOS and it was working
perfectly after that in the bus itself I
didn't have any configuration to
overclock the memory though one thing I
could do was actually down the timings
so I could make it tighter for gaming
and when I did this even with the soda
memory it did make a difference in games
games were running very smoothly on this
configuration when we move over to the
firstly pub G I was getting around 75
FPS on high settings at 1080p on both
different maps the new map and the
original map and the point one percent
loads were very impressive too so the
recent update may have optimized this
game even further
moving over to GTA 5 if you like a bit
of this at 1080p seems to be very
popular again
must have been the Steam sale when I was
getting around 80 FPS on the highest
settings on this game at 1080p then
moving over to Crysis 3 of course
there's always that question can it run
Crysis and yes it can 60fps 1080p max
settings and then we move over lastly to
doom we're getting around 122 FPS on
Ultra settings so this thing was
absolutely kicking it at 1080p gaming
and that's the advantage of this sized
unit it's very small you can travel with
it but of course it has a lot more
graphical power then might in win travel
PC for example so not only could I edit
videos on this but also with that I can
play games on the road especially if I'm
hooking up to a 1080p TV which a lot of
hotels do seem to have they're taking a
quick look in the details of this unit
you get a hard type front panel with a
USB type-c and USB 3.1 connection also
get your headphone and audio in Jack's
and you've got on the side too 2 USB 2
slots and on the rear an additional two
USB 3 ports it was one thing I had to
critique about the USB ports it would be
that I'd like to see two more additional
USB ports on the rear of the unit as I
believe five USB ports standard type
connections is pushing it a little bit
especially if you're traveling you
probably gonna hook up an audio
interface and extra webcam and
not if you're streaming on the road and
you're gonna need those USB ports
available though besides that the whole
frame itself is practically all mashed
except for the front panel so this
allows this unit to breathe very easily
even the rear i/o shield has mesh in it
so it's a great design from asrock and
especially with that low noise as you
guys heard before with the fan profiles
being quite silent and the temps being
pretty good this is a unit that is
definitely going to please people of
course this year being a GTX 1060 you do
get that hdmi 2.0 reroute DisplayPort
and mini DisplayPort outs for graphic
options
there's also dual band wireless included
in the unit and it comes with two
antennas to boot and as for the
construction of this unit it's an
all-aluminium chassis you can take it
apart very easy and all you have to do
is install two sodium Ram sticks or one
if you want a CPU the cooler and of
course your nvme drives and you're now
good to go though this unit itself it
does come in at $800 u.s. and I can only
find it available for sale currently at
newegg.com I will report on availability
in the description below as time goes on
but with that at $800 it is a bit more
expensive than what you could get these
parts for individually but what you're
paying for here is simply the size it is
incredibly small and I do imagine this
unit definitely pleasing people like
myself who are going traveling need that
desktop-like performance on the road
especially 32 cubits of ram extra
storage options for nvme and their
editing videos but they also want to
play games with the power of a gtx 1060
but that's about it for me today this
was a lone sample provided by asrock so
I do unfortunately have to return it
though as for getting one for myself I
may think about purchasing one it is
just so damn cool for this size again
the only thing I would really critique
is I'd like to see that AC adapter
somehow implemented into the units
you've just got one simple unit to carry
around and travel even if it makes it a
little bit bigger I'd love to see them
implement that of course a couple more
USB slots but besides that really good
unit one that I can highly recommend
very low noise and keep in mind these
temperatures are in the dead heat of
summer as well so the fact that it
performed as well as it did is a
testament to how well as rock are
designing their products as of late so
with this unit you do get that case you
do get the power supply the
the b250 chipset and the gtx 1060 mxm
and of course the boss was extremely
easy to use and updating it you just can
plug in an internet cable and it'll
update itself for you within the boss so
that was really cool to see and with
that guys let me know in the comments
section below what you think of this
little unit do you see yourself getting
one if you're building a travel PC or
would you rather a laptop love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and
never get hit that like button and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
