coming to you guys today with a vlog
from tokyo Akihabara aka electric city
now this is the place you go to if you
want to build a near PC though it is
also the place you want to go to if you
want to find some new now used parts
deals and also some other really he's
going crazy so I'm here with the little
pubs as well and we're gonna have an
awesome time let's get it on
so now this is the place you come to if
you want
like anything remotely geek we're
talking like you know animation comics
tech even made cafes and even a thing
called gotcha pond where you just open
these eggs and they got toys in them so
this is a place called scheme oh and you
can see here they've got like all the
different stuff here like different
keyboards you can try different gaming
mice you've got different examples of
computers that are set up and of course
you get all the different monitors lined
up here so and gaming laptops so it's
pretty cool this is the first place
we're going to check out and as always
I'm actually looking for deals more than
anything so I'm going to see if any new
parts are here on special and also used
parts so let's get on with this so we're
just casing out this place right now and
we're looking at the best deals and kind
of like this looks like the best deal to
me and anyway in case for around about
forty dollars because you get $10 off so
I'm thinking about before I leave here
I'm thinking about coming back and
getting this case because it is
brand-new as well and I could feature
that in a build since yeah it looks like
it's pretty good date
okay now I'm moving into the best part
of this place and this is the used PC
part so I'm just going to case this
place out and see if we've got any deals
here motherboards are a joke however I
mean I can't get a motherboard really at
a decent price here at all these guys
know their pricing pretty well and then
they bump it up even that
bit more so kind of puts me out of the
race for motherboard here and we're
going into a place called soot potato
now I actually came here with my friend
Tokyo Goomba show me this is the place
you go to if you essentially want to get
like anything retro like that literally
got Nintendo games Super Nintendo games
PlayStation games anything you can name
this store will have it though
I'm actually not shopping here anymore
because I've already got my rock man
collection so this is just for my
friends so but yeah like this is one of
the perks of coming to Akihabara is
shopping at this store so we're at a
place called das power now and if you
want to get a new PC or build a new PC
this is definitely the place to go they
have a lot of like time sales that will
be cheaper than the Internet
so I'm actually going to pick up one of
those SSDs the 240 gig for 60 bucks
so yeah this is actually a good place
you go the price listing there so you
can check out all the different
components if you want to build a PC and
you're good to go so they've got one of
these graphics cards here of 5450 which
I might grab just to use as a
replacement so that'll be interesting so
we're just at a place called das power
unlike this place has got a secondhand
level as well but it is a complete boss
like the prices are just ridiculous so
we're gonna go get out of here and move
on to the next place now if you're a
tech enthusiast this is a great little
corner in Akihabara where you've got
soft mat which sells both new and used
PC parts so we're going to go in there
soon but also across the road they've
also got a place called to top I think
it's cool
and they sell new parts at pretty good
prices so let's go in a sofmap first and
see what they got
so we're in soft mountain now we can see
able to use deals but one thing about
Tokyo you just generally you can't
haggle prices which cuz they just get a
lot of it and they're like just no so
you're out of luck if you want to haggle
for prices but they do have some pretty
decent deals I mean if you're looking
for a graphics card look at a
hall-of-fame 980ti I think for like 660
or something like - about a guess but
one thing I'm I am here and I'm going to
decide on is this a nine to ninety for
around about $180 so I'm going to decide
if I want to get that and just ask them
if there's any problems with it and I
might pull the trigger on that another
great thing about these places is if you
want to pick up a new case you can
actually see them all in the flesh and
see how strong they are and what not and
how many fans they come with so it's
actually a really good thing about
window shopping here okay so I did pick
up that z77 motherboard for 20 bucks and
now I'm actually thinking about getting
this CPU here so 2500 k which will work
on that motherboard and it is
overclockable so i will pick that deal
up now
so we've walked in here and they've got
the CP NS 10 X extreme now I know this
is actually a pretty heavy cooler from
experience so I'm actually going to get
two of these because I always find
myself needing coolers and especially on
1156 xi sorry on 1155 which is my
plumbing bill for the 2500 K I'm going
to need one of these so I get two of
these these coolers you're only allowed
one per person but that's why we brought
no he wants to go home
so now we're back home I can do a tally
of everything that we picked up here and
I got two coolers for $20 each and I
picked up this Sapphire 7870 GHz Edition
for about $90 got that fifty I mean
sorry 2500 K for about $80 and then
we've got this here this was the SSD 460
the Turner 40 you a SSD
and also the 450 450 now this might pick
this up is because I actually sold that
GT 430 that I had in that 15 or
five-door 1500 PC and I kind of missed
having a car that didn't need a PCIe pin
just for testing so so did I get this
just for testing and then of course this
case here we got this for $35 but we
actually got $5 off because we use some
coupon so I think that believe I believe
that raises the whole tally to around
about three hundred and twenty dollars
for all this so we've got a mix of new
and used and they were kind of like all
the awesome deals that I picked up there
so that we have at Akihabara aka
electric city in Japan I highly
recommend it if you are coming for a
tourist sort of vacation to Japan or
also if you're living in Japan and you
want to build a new PC because they've
got the best prices even compared to the
internet here so that's definitely the
place you want to go if you're building
a new PC but use deals was kind of like
mediocre I mean I've definitely seen
better used deals here in the
countryside where I live as opposed to
Tokyo but we still did manage to pick up
a few decent deals though the new PC
deals can't be matched also I would have
taken more footage for you guys but I
wanted to spend a lot more time with my
son since I only get him two weekends a
month so that's kind of like yeah I try
to kill two birds with one stone and I
thought I did however with Aki Harbor it
is the place where if you're even
remotely introverted there is something
for you there I guarantee you I
literally only scrape the surface of
that place I only visited my favorite
enthusiast tech stores which I'll put
I'll put in the description below so if
you come to Japan you want to go to
however I'll put those places in the
description so you can check them out go
there and get some awesome deals for
yourself anyway guys if you have any
