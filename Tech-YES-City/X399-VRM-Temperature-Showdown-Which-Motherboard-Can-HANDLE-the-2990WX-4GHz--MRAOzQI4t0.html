in perfect harmony with my surroundings
and that's exactly what we're gonna be
looking at the surroundings here on
these motherboards X 399 prm's we got
the Auris X 3 9 9 extreme we've got the
asrock Taichi also got the creation the
meg this is MSI's top of the line
I think it's literally the most
expensive X 399 motherboard out there
and we've also got the zenith extreme
from a Zeus paired with a twenty nine
ninety WX 32 core 64 threaded processor
overclocked to four gigahertz and have
four gigahertz this thing can push over
400 watts through those VRMs now this is
crazy because this puts out a lot of
heat and if you are in the market for an
x3 night now motherboard and you're
interested in getting a 32 core
processor one must ask which of these
motherboards is up to the task now today
we're also going to be putting a 12
centimeter fan on each of these VR amps
and seeing them before and after
temperatures but also testing out the
Zeus's Zen if the extreme 40 mil fan kit
as well and see if that makes a
difference but with that aside what are
we waiting for
maybe we could wait for me to finish
migraine tea
now you unlike men you actually know how
to solve it properly well if you are the
PCB way today's video sponsor is giving
ten PCBs for as little as five dollars
and if you're a new member you can get
five dollars off
so are you waiting for get these high
quality PCBs links in description below
welcome back to take your city right
here we've got four different X 399
motherboards all top of the line and
today we're chucking a 12 centimeter fan
on the vrm heat sinks as we said in the
intro 32 cause this thing can put out
some serious heat let's get straight
into the details first off the as rocked
IG comes in at three hundred and twenty
five US dollars so it's the cheapest of
the bunch here 8 plus three-phase power
design and we had the vrm being stressed
with no fan initially on the heatsink we
got up to 118 degrees that was what was
being realized with the thermal-imaging
camera and also the heatsink itself was
posting around 65 degrees and the
ambient conditions here in the tech yes
studio was about 23 degrees through all
the testing here so controlled
environment too and when we put the 12
centimeter fan on the Taiji's heat sinks
we then dropped those temperatures down
to 58 degrees on the heatsink itself but
ironically enough the VRMs didn't really
show any difference I still managed to
see a hundred and seventeen degrees on
the back end of the board itself so the
12 centimeter fan it is making a
difference and we will see that in the
next three results but it made the least
difference on the Taichi but another
interesting thing is that the Taichi was
the only motherboard here to survive ten
minutes without having a hardware
failure with no 12 centimeter fan
mounted on top of the heat sinks but
next up here we've got the gigabyte X
399 extreme this is their new board it's
coming in at 450 US dollars you've got a
10 plus three-phase vrm design and
initially with no fan on the heatsink we
got 70 degrees on the heatsink and a
hundred and thirty-three degrees on the
VRM I couldn't believe what my eyes were
seeing but we also didn't get to ten
minutes it failed and then we place the
fan on that heat sink and then reran the
tests so we let the heatsink cool down
for 10 minutes then we put it back on we
saw
a hundred and eleven degrees max on the
vrm and also fifty five degrees on the
heatsink itself so this board responded
extremely well to having a 12 centimeter
fan mounted over the top of those heat
sinks and now they do have fins
installed and this is one thing I do
like about the Auris x3 99 extreme board
I'd like to see the other manufacturers
following suit and doing the same
because not only does it look really
cool but as we see here in the results
it does definitely help when it comes to
cooling down that vrm and next up here
we've got the Meg creation from MSI
their new board introduced with the
thread Ripper 2000 series to our four
CPUs and this with the twenty nine
ninety WX and with no fan over that
heatsink initially we're looking at 98
degrees on the vrm and 57 degrees on the
heatsink so this was running the coolest
of the bunch and this was from the
thermal-imaging camera mind you the
heatsink is the biggest one that is on
all the boards here and so I'm imagining
that there is some more heat that we
can't see underneath this heatsink
because this board did fail before we
reached it to ten minutes
however the VRM is the beefiest of all
four motherboards here featuring 16
phases or 16 plus 3 phases 419 in total
and it definitely shows when we had that
12 centimeter fan running over the heat
sinks it did drop quite considerably 78
degrees then on the VRM and then 46
degrees on the heatsink itself so this
responded very well to having a cooler
master blue LED fan over that vrm
heatsink i guess perhaps maybe leds do
make things run cooler also with the Meg
creation board it's coming in at 500 us
so it is the most expensive out of the
bunch here by 50 dollars and last up
here we've got the x3 99 Zenith extreme
from a Zeus this is coming in at 450
dollars speeches an 8 plus 3 phase vrm
and when we had no fan sitting on that
heatsink we were looking at a hundred
and twenty one degrees max that's what
we saw on the actual heat with the
thermal-imaging camera and on the
heatsink itself 81 degrees when we place
this
12-centimeter fan we just gently laid it
down on top while I was sipping some
green tea because I had a little bit of
time to spare we then saw a drop to 94
degrees on the vrm 50 degrees on the
heatsink this was the biggest drop on
all four boards here but they also have
the option to get this kit and this
includes this real little 40 mil fan and
now when I looked at this thing
initially I thought is this really gonna
do anything for like what's 400 watts
coming out on the CPU and does my
surprise no it really didn't do anything
we saw a VRM from 121 degrees now to 118
degrees and then the heatsink that
dropped from 81 degrees to 70 degrees so
there was a bigger drop there because it
was pretty much placed on top of that
heatsink so in terms of its actual
functionality it's not really doing a
whole lot and I guess that now brings us
to a conclusion time where if you are
getting a 32 core CPU an X 399
motherboard and you're overclocking then
you would seriously want to consider
getting some fans for at least one fan
on top of your vrm heatsink that's
what's come out of today's results
because three of the board's the zenith
extreme the Auris extreme and also the
main creation they failed without this
fan on top and this was only 10 minutes
imagine if you're doing work for 20
minutes or longer and you need to get
work done faster hence why you're
overclocking and then you also need to
get stability which is kind of I mean
it's a little bit ironic but the world
we live in now gives options to do that
and that's what X 399 is it's an option
for high-end desktop enthusiasts just
like Intel's X 299 where you want more
cause and more threads and you want the
single thread performance but you want
the ability to still do multitasking and
high powered production but on the flip
side the good news is that if you don't
have a fan and you're not overclocking
you're just going with out-of-the-box
settings with the 2990 WX then all four
of these motherboards will be absolutely
fine because the power draw won't be
anywhere near the near 400 watts that we
were seeing when we're at 4 gigahertz so
it does put out a lot of heats the most
heat
that I've seen for anything that's even
water or air related of course ln2
you're going to be using up a lot more
power but that's not a discussion for
someone using this in a work environment
now but ultimately with the pricing the
Tai Chi is coming out well ahead however
they do have their professional gaming
option features the same vrm but it
features a 10 gigabit NIC but it's
coming in with the best value for money
on X 399 in my opinion if you just want
vrm goodness but before I get on out of
here I will say some critiquing points
MSI include this thing here it's like a
graphics card looking MVM a cooling
solution with four sockets that you can
plug into the PCI Express 16x slot and
that will give you essentially four nvme
options to do whatever you want but
instead of including things like this
I'd like them to spend their money that
they're charging for the motherboard on
things like a better implementation of
the vrm perhaps make it a fin design so
the heatsink doesn't cut out after ten
minutes when you're overclocking because
I'm sure people buying this motherboard
really want it for the best of the best
and when the Tai Chi in ways I feel like
it not cutting out after 10 minutes is
in ways a slight victory for the Tai Chi
which is coming in consider really less
money I feel like that's a bit of a
letdown but at the same time I will
critique horas as well and MSI at the
same time I think 4 X 3 no 9 boards
their BIOS needs a bit of an upgrade
they're still using the same preface and
interface with the same options as their
budget boards I'd like to see more
descriptions in the BIOS I'd like to see
more intricate settings I mean for
example the zenith extreme that's got
negative load line calibration they're
taking that thing up to the next level
so they're implementing the better
features but they're also working on
that by providing a better interface to
utilize those features of course as we
Rock make us all advice but I feel like
out of the 4 manufacturers here azusa
just nail it when it comes to getting
the bass right and you guys I hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button let me know
in the comment section below if you have
an X 399
bored which one did you go with and why
or if you want to get an X 3 9
motherboard or even if you can't afford
one which would you get love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and
this little 40 mil fan here I feel sorry
for me he tried but he just didn't make
it he was the little 40 mil fan that
couldn't and also big thanks to PCB way
for sponsoring out today's video I'll
put the link for their website in the
description below and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
when you're buying an x3 99 motherboard
x3 nine nine nine nine nine nine
okay and then yeah so again Arif all
from awesome I go awesome
x3 99 lastly okay lastly lastly lossy
welcomed by detect yes City and in this
studio we've got a ambient temperature
of 23 degrees C that stands for Celsius
if you didn't know not Fahrenheit not
that filthy Fahrenheit metric that you
guys use over in the US nine and so the
Germans would say if they heard it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
