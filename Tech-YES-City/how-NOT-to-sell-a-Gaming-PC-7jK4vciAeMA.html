- Whoa.
Okay.
So you guys have been
messaging me on Facebook
and you're showing me these listings,
and when I stumbled upon a few of them
I thought, damn, this
is looking pretty bad
if you wanna sell a gaming PC,
so today I'm gonna be blurring out
all the information that's
private and personal,
and just showing you
guys some tips and tricks
on how not to sell a gaming PC in 2019.
(upbeat music)
So the first PC we've got up here
is a 4K gaming system with a GTX 1070,
so first up I'm not entirely sure
if a GTX 1070 would be
considered a 4K gaming GPU,
maybe on low settings,
but with that aside we
look at the ad itself,
and as I've been saying in the past, guys,
a picture speaks a thousand words,
it's just so important for
selling your gaming PCs.
As we looked at the previous example
in the eBay video where the seller
had just garbage specifications,
but they were selling those PCs
because the build looked
clean and it had RGB bling,
this kind of is the opposite
to what was going on in that video,
and if anything it's a
lot better of a scenario
because the person's not
trying to scam anyone
because the specs are pretty
good at the end of the day,
but I feel everything else in these photos
pretty much deters people
from wanting to buy this PC.
For instance, if we
look at the first photo,
there is just cables everywhere,
and then we look at the
surroundings of the PC,
before you even go into the PC,
the floor's all dirty, looks like an,
honestly, a filthy
environment, for this PC,
and then we look at the PC itself,
the side panel's just hanging off the side
and then the mesh front cover
is not even installed on
the 5.25 inch drive bay
which makes you wonder if the person
has taken care of this PC,
and so that's where the photo starts
to speak a thousand words straight away,
where you're looking at
the condition of this
and you're like, okay,
will this thing even boot?
And if I buy this, how
long will it last for
if it hasn't been taken care
of in the last couple of years,
then what is the outlook for this PC?
And it's probably not going to be good,
in any way, shape, or form.
But furthermore, I'm kind
of a little bit curious
to how a build with a seventh gen Intel,
which is only a couple years
old at best, gets this filthy,
I mean it looks really bad,
and you guys would know and
around the channel here,
I've got three phases of Tech YES loving,
phase one's where we just
give it a quick clean,
phase two's where we go a
little bit more in depth,
phase three's where we just go to town,
pull everything apart,
break, clean, and WD40,
and just bring that thing up to brand new,
but I'm pretty sure in the case of this PC
we'd have to go to a new special phase
and then use some chemicals
that I've never used before,
and maybe even go into another dimension
just to clean up this PC.
But I wanna stop right here and give
the person selling this some feedback,
because even with just
20 minutes of your time,
you could really clean this up
and make it look a lot better.
For starters, take the
computer off the floor,
put it on the desk, at
least just for the photo,
and then get those cables managed
so they're out of the shot, furthermore,
just take this thing
down to service station,
usually most gas stations will have
a compressor, air compressor,
that you can just hose the PC
off and get all the dust out,
especially out of the front of the PC,
and out of the insides,
and that would really go a long
way to clean this build up,
and make it look just that bit better,
but when we go inside the
PC things even get worse,
the dust is just all inside this thing,
and then we've just got cable management
which is reminiscent of that of The Verge,
it's as if these guys put this PC together
and then ship it to this guy in Australia
because I don't know
what is going on here,
because the SSD is just hanging there
and it's just like in
the middle of no where,
and I'm pretty sure we're getting up
on the level of this thing could
be a potential fire hazard,
at this point in time.
But to fix this up, a little
bit of cable management,
even just 10 minutes with some zip ties,
and then getting some alcohol wipes
while the PC is turned off
could really go a long way
to clean up the inside of this PC
and make it look really good,
because when we look at
the price of this system,
it's 999 Aussie dollars,
so the person is clearly
trying to sell it,
they wanna get rid of it
using that price point,
they think it's a good deal,
and honestly looking at
the specs it's not too bad.
You're getting a 4K 28
inch monitor included,
you're getting a i5-7600 seventh gen,
GTX 1070, a 250GB SSD,
and 16GB of DDR4 memory,
for around 1000 Aussie dollars,
or a little over 700 USD,
which for the whole combo,
isn't too bad as we said before
but in its current state,
I don't think anyone's
gonna wanna buy this PC,
even hustlers and PC flippers who wanna
come in and low ball it
because they're afraid
of the longevity of these parts,
and if they would actually
work in the future.
You're probably gonna stop me right there,
and just say okay, Bryan,
these people just wanna get rid
of their stuff though,
they really don't care,
they don't have the time
to clean this stuff up,
they just want it off their hands,
and if that's the case
though I would argue,
the counter argument would be
the price would be considerably lower then
because I've seen stuff
like this go in the past
but the prices have been like
literally fire sale prices.
But on the flip side the next two examples
I'm gonna pull up for you
guys are two bad photos,
but at the same token
the price is really good,
to the point where I was like damn,
I wish I could have picked up these deals.
Now we look here, GTX 1050 system,
with a 4-core second gen
i5, it's going for 250 USD,
now you may think okay, that's
actually pretty mediocre,
but it's loaded with a
240GB SSD, 2TB hard drive,
and the case and everything
else is not too bad,
so even if someone put
in an offer of $50 lower,
I'm sure this person would
have taken that offer
and you would have got a really good deal.
Same as the next deal here,
the photos are just really,
the person couldn't care,
but same with the price
tag, they couldn't care,
we've got around 350 U.S. dollars
for a seventh gen i7
system with a GTX 1050 Ti,
now the same deal applies,
if you put in an offer of maybe $50 lower
the person probably would have
accepted it straight away,
but do keep in mind with
these seventh gen Lenovo's
you do have to be pretty careful,
I did a video sort of
exposing the problems
where they do have
proprietary power supplies,
and so if you do wanna
change out components,
especially a high powered graphics card,
and you need a high powered power supply,
then you're gonna run into trouble.
Pretty much the only upgrade
path for this computer
would be the upcoming GTX 1650,
which you then could
replace for the 1050 Ti
to get some better performance.
But back onto the last example,
here is a 2016 MacBook,
which is going again
for around about $1000,
and this one's sort of even, I think,
worse than the last three examples
because it's literally just one minute,
alls you have to do is get a cloth
and just run over the
whole computer quickly,
just to make sure it
looks good for the photo.
When you see here, the screen's
just got all dust over it,
and sort of with that in
mind it makes you wonder
if the person has taken
good care of this item,
and with that in mind if
someone really wanted a MacBook,
which is does baffle me
as to why you would want
anything from Apple, given
their recent track record,
this could actually sell pretty quickly
if the person actually spent a bit of time
to take some nice photos and
put it on a better backdrop,
though with that in mind guys,
let us know in the comment section below
what you think of photos, I
mean, what's your experience,
do you find that the better the photo,
the better the PC sells?
I mean in my experience,
when I was over in the U.S.,
when I was here in Australia,
all the time the better the photo,
the better the PC build looks,
the much higher chances you are gonna have
of selling that thing
because the pictures,
straight away, as we said before,
not only captures the person's attention,
it also says a lot about the seller,
and if they've taken
good care of the system,
if there's anything wrong with the system,
if it's going to last into the future,
these are all those questions that I think
go through a lot of our heads,
either consciously, or subconsciously,
and so when the photo's really bad
it's going to speak for
the whole ad itself.
Anyway, guys, with that in mind,
if you want some links on how
you can spice up your build
I'll leave some links for
some $1 LED strips in the description,
as well as some LED fans,
because I've also found in the past
that adding these
components to your system
does actually help it sell really quickly,
and also a lot faster
than just having a system,
even if that system's
clean, the photo's clean,
having those LED lights in that picture
does coin the phrase LEDs sell PCs,
but also there is rumor that
if you put RGB LED lights
in your system it will
make you a pro gamer,
and double your FPS, that
is the rumor on the street.
Anyway, guys, hope you enjoyed this one,
if you did then be sure
to hit that Like button,
and with that aside, guys,
I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon,
peace out for now, bye.
