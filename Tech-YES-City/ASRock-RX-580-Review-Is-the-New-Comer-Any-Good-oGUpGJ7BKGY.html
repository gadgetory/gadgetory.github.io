graphics card market and this is the rx
580 from asrock they also have other
variants ranging from the RX v 7t r x
560 and 550 though today we're going to
take a look at this one the flagship of
the bunch that they have released here
of course it's not a flagship card but
it is the best SPECT car that asrock are
going to be offering at least for now
I'm also gonna take a look at what makes
this card so special in particular if
there's actually anything special about
it at all
let's roll that intro
welcome back to tell us city there's
Brown coming to you guys today with the
600 gram as rock phantom gaming rx 580
now there is no back plate as well so
they've gone with the whole value
orientated lineup I believe because they
haven't quite provided me with pricing
yet and apparently AMD have already
blocked the sales of these cards in EU
or Europe due to certain limitations so
it's actually not as rocks fault there's
got to pass some laws and regulations
and hopefully they will be for sale in
the EU in the future as it stands though
this card will be hitting shelves in
Australia in America at least to my
knowledge I will update the description
below with pricing but what you're
getting with this 600 gram cooler is two
fans that go up to 3800 rpm I could not
believe how much air these two fans are
pushing of course they do get extremely
loud and I'll let you guys take a quick
listen
however as you see in the benchmarks
later on 100% fan speeds is really for
me only testing the max limits of this
cooler itself and also when you've got
the stock Auto fan settings it doesn't
sound too bad it goes up to around 55 60
% fan speeds and of course the sounds of
these levels aren't too bad now up until
50 degrees the fans will switch off
completely and so even in overclocked
mode you don't have to worry about any
noise as even when it's overclocked
itself it only uses around six to seven
watts of power so the idle power
consumption doesn't really change at all
but the power consumption on load is a
little bit worrisome you can see that
overclocking does indeed put a lot more
strain on the GPU itself going from 145
watt to 175 watt and then near 200 watt
when we overclocked this graphics card
now you've probably seen the thermal
paste video already if you haven't I'll
link it up here but we did change the
thermal paste around on this graphs card
with Gela GC extreme though this is a
really good thermal place that's some of
the best in the biz so it does speak
lengths to the little minor details or
ramble about this card a little bit
later in the review let's pull up some
gaming benchmarks for you guys which I'm
sure you're dying to see first test we
have here 3d mark firestrike you can see
that the RX 580 this one on the bench
when I overclocked it the results are
phenomenal we're getting over 16,000
points just to put things into
perspective I think that's getting close
to the Vega 56 at least out of the box
so this card is a little beast and keep
in mind though as ROC could have sent
over one of their golden samples as this
is personally one of the best scores
I've got with an iris 580 in 3d mark 5
strike out of the box
still getting really good scores so over
14,000 points dual point something out
if you get this graphics card even just
changing that power limit slider of
course it will increase power
consumption but you will get a tangible
benefit by just doing one little easy to
do trick and of course looking those
results beating out the gtx 1066
gigabyte both out of the box and
overclocked they're moving on in our
first game Kingdom Come deliverance here
we saw a victory for the RX 580
overclocked versus overclocked
I'm looking at mainly these numbers
because as an enthusiast I love
overclocking I love looking at the
overclock figures so this 1060 itself
was no slouch either went to over 2.0 5
gigahertz on the core though moving over
to GTA 5
we saw a victory again for this
overclocked rx5 18s it's typically a
game that does go a little bit in favor
of Nvidia just a tiny bit so as we can
see here over time AMD has seemed to
optimize this game in the driver support
for their cards to make do with better
frame rates and that's exactly what
we're seeing with the RX 580 getting the
edge out in this game to move over to
Final Fantasy 15 of course this being in
the video title I did turn off those
Nvidia unique features such as hair
works to make this a fair comparison and
honestly I don't use them in my everyday
gaming life as I believe they're just
not really worth it especially for some
of the frame dips that you can get not
to mention the point 1 percent low
stuttering but here we saw these gtx
1060 did edge out the RX 580 both stock
and overclocked that is to be expected
being a relatively new title on PC and
also being that of an Nvidia title the
moving out of pub G I always test in the
ruins section lots of stuff going on
lots of pillars lots of open world lots
of graphically intense settings 1080p
ultra settings here we saw the
neck-and-neck battle between these two
graphics cards though out of the box of
GTX 1060 did really edged out just a
little bit over the out-of-the-box rx
580 and moving on to the last game
we've got ashes of the singularity I
initially thought this was an AMD title
but it seems the Nvidia card did take
the win on the dx11 GPU focused
benchmark when I changed it over D X 12
or Vulkan I can't specifically test the
GPU for some reason it's only got a CPU
only test and to be honest I don't even
know what's so appealing about ash is a
singularity but anyway when all comes
down to it the RX 580 phantom gaming
from asrock is actually a really solid
attempt for their first go in the
graphics card scene I know a lot of
people ask me when I posted a picture up
on Instagram of this thing they were
like why is asrock even bothering to get
in so late in the cycle and i think it's
actually a brilliant idea they're gonna
be sending these out to reviewers
they're gonna sell a few on the market
and I guess they want to gather as much
feedback as possible so when they
released the six series cards or if
that's what AMD is going to go with 600
series they're going to have a product
that is perfected by the time it hits
the market so they can get some feedback
from me I think the fan speeds are a
little bit
loud at a hundred percent even though
they push a lot of air I also would like
to see a backplate included though just
besides the backplate I maybe like to
see even the azrog logo light up even
with RGB and you can change that in
software to give it maybe a temperature
indicator so you know if your cards for
some reason getting really hot you can
switch the system off always do like RGB
when it's the functional type though
speaking of functionality there's also
as rocks own software that is included
with its graphics card and it's actually
not bad especially for a first
implementation I like the fact that you
can overclock the actual vram and change
the voltages directly to that vram
something that I don't believe I haven't
seen in MSI Afterburner for quite some
time you'd also save overclocking and
custom fan profiles and there is three
default nodes as well the first being
the out-of-the-box setting which goes up
to thirteen hundred and eighty megahertz
then there's the overclock setting which
goes up to fourteen hundred and thirty
megahertz then there's a silent mode
feature which will actually under clock
the card to give you lower temperatures
and lower power consumption in order to
keep those noises down from the fans
themselves though one thing I noticed
about the overclock profile it's getting
especially on the core itself very close
to my maximum overclock when I change
the thermal paste around the max I could
get out of this was around about
fourteen hundred and fifty megahertz out
of the box I believe I got just over
fourteen hundred and thirty megahertz so
they're really capping this card if you
put in that overclock mode you may come
into some problems overclocking it in
general may not work hence why the
default mode I guess the thirteen
hundred eighty megahertz is guaranteed
to work across all cards there was 4
display outs you've got one dual link
DVI three DisplayPort outs which support
the free sync technology and also HDMI
out if you wish to use that anyway guys
when it all comes down to it the Phantom
gaming from asrock not bad at all for a
first little attempt let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
this graphics card do you have any
feedback of your own for asrock - i'm
sure they'll be listening in the
comments section below also update the
pricing of these units as that
information comes in and I look forward
to catching you guys in another tech
video very soon and if you enjoyed this
video you might want to check out some
other videos on the channel and if you
enjoy those then you might even want to
subscribe and hit that Bell notification
to get notified when the latest tech
bids are dropping and your
box and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now they
burn rx 580 and 3d mark 5 strike out of
the box
still getting really good scores though
over 1400 thousand points oh of course
what about the gaming numbers themselves
let's roll some benchmarks for you guys
first up fire strike I'm going to show
this score because it shows how beast
this card is and also the fine wine
technology itself seems to be getting
even finer they may be a fine line
between the wine or it might be fine
wine technology I'm not too sure yet but
anyway if you enjoyed this video but as
for the simple clean black and silver
aesthetic I'm option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
