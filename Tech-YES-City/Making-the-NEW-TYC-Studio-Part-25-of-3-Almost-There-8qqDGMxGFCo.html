an awesome time over the break period
I've just been working through it and
completing this new studio we've almost
done the construction side of things but
with that I'm going to make this a
two-part series instead of the third
part being the final part because
there's still a lot of work to do in
terms of finishing it off but with that
today's vlog is gonna get sort of all
the base work done and then we're gonna
move on to the final stage in the next
part on the studio vlog but it should be
about another whole week and a bit until
this thing is at least finalized for me
to move all my gear down and start
filming with that said let's get on with
it I've tossed a special hand from the
one and only dad man now people have
been wondering what dad man's been up to
lately and he's actually been trolling
scammers so give you guys a little clip
of that my son said it could be Optus we
went to on the bear bill no that's what
my son said I thought I was with Telstra
okay is she going to Jamaica did you say
and so with that today we're gonna be
doing the undercoat and of course going
to finish off the colors now I actually
need you guys to let me know which
colors you think of the best because
we're still gonna finish off the room
I've picked out three colors because I
want to have kind of three different
colors in the studio for doing different
backdrop different b-roll but let me
know in the comments what you guys think
would be the best colors for the studio
note rolling as well note rolling and
with that we're gonna start painting
I got so now we're starting to paint
we've got the method called the cowboy I
met
so we're now on day two and we've done
this wall here a color called reckless
green I absolutely love this color it's
like it's so cool I don't know we got to
do another coat anyway with this so
we've done the first coat go do the
second coat and then this is gonna be
the feature gray color so I'm going to
start doing this while dad man starts
painting the second coat on that and
then we're gonna go inside here and do
this wall a orange and this wall a red
so that should all come together and
hopefully we get a lot of it done today
so these final phase of the studio we've
been doing this over a little over a
month now and I've had a lot of work to
do on the meantime I had to go to
Bangkok for the galaxy' vent had to do a
lot of reviews in the meantime and so I
actually lost some of the footage
painting as well as doing the skirting
and gluing that off that's sad but in
the meantime we've got the sound tiles
they've all rocked up so basically I'm
putting white silent sound tiles on the
roof and also on the side will be
putting black sound tiles in the orange
section so I'm still thinking of what
sound tiles to put on the red walls and
also possibly in just the front of the
teal wall where I'll be doing a lot of
the voice recording so if you guys have
suggestions for the colors of those
sounds Isles then drop some links in the
description or just some suggestions and
I'll check that out because I don't know
what to do with the color coordination
there but also for the desks we've got
all that sorted out practically every
desk is done now so that's really good
I've just got to wait till we put the
carpet down and then I'll go book all
those deaths by them and then install
them and that'll be in the next part but
also besides that we've got the TV's the
monitors
everything's ready to go so this is all
coming together so in the next like week
or two weeks I don't know exactly when
because we've still got some water leaks
happening in the studio and we've got to
fix them before we put the carpet down
so don't know yet and it is raining
today so we'll get all that done but
it's coming together so going through
all the switches and all the
electronical gear that's set up down
here we've got two data points down here
one is Internet to the main hub upstairs
and one is to the data hub that I'm bill
down here because I didn't have enough
data cable so they're both tang gigabits
per second all the connections down here
at 10 gigabits per second cat 6a which
was what we've used just for future
proofing as well and of course the cable
itself with the cat 6a it's a much
better quality than the cat 5 it's much
stronger it's also shielded better which
is another reason I would prefer anyone
I would recommend anyone use it over the
5e stuff especially nowadays but with
that we've got two more powerpoints here
so we've got four powerpoints in total
at the end here and with these lights
but a bit more on this we've got the C
CFL lights they turn on from two
different switches so the first will go
on here and that's just one light out of
five and then we turn on the other one
and that turns on the other light so
we've got two lights here that can be
controlled individually and then if we
need more lighting we've got the other
switch here which we can turn on and
then all five lights will be on so
that'll just make light up the main area
which I plan to do builds b-roll and all
that goodness but with that I'm using C
CFL lighting now one thing about see CFL
lighting and why I love it so much is
it's just so easy on the eyes proof is
really in the pudding if you grab an LED
light which I don't recommend and you
look at it for like a second it'll hurt
your eyes you know see CFL lighting I
can just look at it and so the light is
so evenly spread and so with that it
just it's good for your eyes not only in
that aspect but as I've talked about in
the past with it emitting the light
mainly from the green spectrum which are
our eyes see detail through it rather
than blue LEDs so I've got C CFLs lights
set up all through the studio but over
here will take you guys over here with
this lighting and explain a little bit
more about this so these are all lights
that I can just put my hand out to and
move around if I need light so if I need
a light over there you can move it over
there need light over here I can point
it that way and then I've got light
wherever the light needs to be directed
at least from up here of course I'll
have the extra lights to light up the
product or light up my face if I need B
but that's always great support having
those up
there especially if we're streaming and
we need like some spotlights but here's
the streaming setup here we've got a
data point over here just to give
internet access or even access back to
the main hub which will be over there a
little bit more on that later but we've
got a power point over here as well for
the streaming setup which will be just
here and then over here we have another
data another power point and this will
be where I'm going to be charging all my
like camera batteries phones and
everything like that will be charged
over at this point here so that's like
my little charging station and then the
final part what you're going to move on
to now is the whole benchmark and main
computer hub so we've got a six point
data switch here so one of them is
internet and the other five will run
over one over there and then all over
here one two three four so there the
rest of the four so five points in total
back to the hub which I will have my
data back up here as well and not only
that it'll be tanking bits per second
and I hope to raid zero or some nvme
SSDs off this so every computer can
access games off this main hub and with
that it'll just save a lot of time
especially for benchmarking and
especially for installing new games so I
won't have to redownload any of those
old games but here in the middle here
you can see this this is actually a
speaker wire and so before we put on the
walls
I plan to have 5.1 surround so this will
be the main seat here with the desk
coming out here and then we've got 5.1
so we've got cables coming in all angles
of the room so I do love 5.1 sound it's
an absolute blast I also bought on the
sales the Logitech Zeno and 906 I think
it is so now of course we've got more
power points here so for more power
points for the computers which of course
will probably use power boards to give
us even more power points and you'll
also notice that they're actually 600
mil off the ground so standard power
points are about 300 mil off the ground
we've extended these up to 600 mil off
the ground just to have no cables really
showing underneath the desk and then
over here the last connection is an
internet connection so we've got three
internet connections two
here and also five from this main hub
going over to different points there and
then over here the last wall is sort of
like a TV if I want to mount a TV here
in the future I've got to die to power
points and then a TV point and there's a
light switch there and lastly here is
for a intercom so there's a data point
there then there's a TV point of coax
line anyway which I don't think we will
need anyways that's about it for today
for the rest of the day I'll actually be
just gapping up the little bits outside
of this any little gaps so water can't
leak in because there are still some
little bits of water leaking into the
actual studio itself and we can't have
that once the carpet goes down so in the
next vlog carpet will be going down
death will be installed and also the new
Internet should be switched on and the
computers should be on those desks ready
to go and with that you guys will also
see the new content coming out in that
new studio and with that aside if you
enjoyed this video then be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comments section below
what you think of the new studio is
there anything you would have done
differently or if there's any additions
that you want to see in the new studio
then make sure you drop a comment as I
do read all the comments and I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
and here's a little balcony out here on
the studio this is the mess so far so
there's a lot of cleanup to do as well
still so that's one big pile of mess</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
