This right here is a
$150 trade in that we got
and that's aussie dollars
so promises to have an i7 inside,
it's got a Z 77 motherboard, 16 GB of RAM
and the graphics card I don't
even know what that is yet
but first things first,
this case needs to be scrapped.
I don't have any use for
something this dirty, this messy,
I mean look at the back here,
we've even got rust like
really bad rust here
and that's just gonna be a nightmare to
clean up considering
this case is pretty much
something that, I mean no
one would really want this
I could keep it around but I
mean considering the amount of
dust just everywhere inside this thing
it is just not worth the hassle
cause it just doesn't look good at all
and there's no clear side panel.
We can't even see LED's coming through
but the goodies don't stop there.
This includes a 520 watt power supply
with 40 amps on the 12 vault line
so that's pretty good if it does work.
I mean I don't know what doesn't work
and what does work in this rig
but I figured if I pull it all apart
then we can find out easily
what the problem is here
since the person who traded it in said
they don't know exactly what happens
but it just doesn't boot.
(upbeat music)
So we've pulled all these
components down individually now
and I was actually surprised
it came with a one terabyte hard drive
and also a GTX 70 Ti
so there are two really good components
I hope they both work.
Though we can see with this case
and this is a big problem here is
that it's got corrosion all on the back.
The screws even show
signs of corrosion on them
so this person I'm guessing
lived near the beach
so if the salt water you know vaporizes
then flows into your home,
gets inside of your PC,
over time it can cause
damage to your components
and now people laugh at me for WD-40
like &quot;ha, WD-40 it's a big joke&quot;
but I guarantee you if this
person sprays a whole layer of
WD-40 on these components
then if that's the cause I don't know
what's the faulty part yet
but if that was the cause
it may have not been faulty
if the person had used WD-40
if that makes any sense so
you know it does have it's uses
but let's get on with the cleaning
and then we shall diagnose the problem
(upbeat bouncing music)
So now all the Tech YES loving is finished
all these parts are looking amazing
and we've left the heat
sink off the motherboard
up on the north here
because I've actually had
an incident in the past
where the heat sink fans
have been so dirty up here
that it's caused the
motherboard not to boot properly
so we're just going to leave that off
and of course if the motherboard is faulty
then it just saves us
putting it on and off again
so with all that said let's
see what was the issue here
with this $150 PC.
(upbeat music)
So we've pretty much nailed this down
to the motherboard itself
so what I'm gonna do is try
a different motherboard now cause
I've already tried a
different CPU, different GPU,
different power supply
and it still won't boot
and I did say in the previous
video where I got this deal.
I thought it was the motherboard
if you haven't seen that
I'll put it up here it's a part time
where I picked this deal up.
And the thing is with
this particular model,
I've already had one of these
exact boards come through
here with the exact same problem
so there must be some sort
of thing with the longevity
of these motherboards
where they just fail after a
certain time maybe the traces
or the way it was put
together it was just weak
and so something's
giving out on this board
over time and so this is
the second one I've had here
with the exact same problem.
This board is pretty much
gonskies but at the same time
I'm hoping everything
else in this build works
because if it does then we've
got 16 GB of RAM and i73770
a cooler hard drive, power supply
and of course it's really
worth it at that price
(upbeat electric music)
This is so weird at first
I thought the memory
one of the sticks could have been faulty
and I tried a different vengeance stick
but then I realized no it
was just the motherboard
it doesn't support corsair
vengeance memory in dual channel
so we had a two single
channels on the left-hand side
work absolutely fine but
here's the weird thing
these Ripjaws they work fine
in dual channel on this board
so just another case of gigabyte
lovely bias and I mean
this is a high end board
it shouldn't have this
problem to begin with
Regardless everything but the motherboard,
the original motherboard that
we had and we pulled out,
is working absolutely
fine so we're gonna see
what magic we can do now
with the parts that we have.
So from that PC we had at the start
we've now got all the
components here on the desk
that I'm keeping, the
power supply, the 750Ti,
the one terabyte hard drive,
the 16GB of Ram and also the 3770.
So it's actually a great deal
for this whole combo here
but what we're gonna do now for this build
is we're going to exclude this 750Ti
it's gonna go over there for a later day.
For a micro hustle like
you guys never know
when someone comes here like,
&quot;Look Brian, my son needs
a PC for like real cheap,&quot;
and you're like yeah man
I can accommodate this
with a little hustle I got a 750Ti
so save that for a later day
and we're going to introduce
a 120 GB SSD so these are
dirt cheap at the moment
I think I got this for
around 30 aussie dollars.
So I'll put all the prices in USD as well
as we go along with this.
We got a GTX 1060 6GB.
We got that for $180 Aussie.
We got an LED strip here,
super important, one dollar
and it's a white strip
and this is gonna segway
into this cooler right
here which is a Hyper 411R
now I can't really find
these for sale in America
but in Australia they're
$29 Aussie dollars
so that'll be like 20 USD so
for the bling and sorta like
what it adds to the build
it's actually not bad
and this cooler here we
can sorta go away with this
and we're gonna pro radar
in a Lenogo motherboard here
and we're gonna take out the i5
and we're gonna put the i7 right in.
So if I had to guestimate
the cost of like prorawing
this board taking out the i5
and the other goodies
they've got in that PC
I'd say we're looking at
about $50 Aussie dollars
for this motherboard
and then at the back with
the final component here
that is the MX330
but this is weird because
this came with a power supply
so we don't have to use that power supply.
We can actually we might as
well just use that power supply
and take this one out and save
it for a later date as well
because there's not point of
me just removing a power supply
and putting another one in.
It's kind of the same caliber.
With that aside I'll put the
total price of this build now
and what spare parts
we're getting out of it
and let's start putting
this thing together
and see what we can come up with.
(inspirational upbeat music)
But I'm gonna go put myself
to sleep now by doing this
and I'll catch you guys soon.
(upbeat electric music)
So there's all the benchmarks done
the overclocking finished
and this PC honestly impressed me a lot
and comparing it to the
previous build I did
where we did a $500 build
with an i74770k and a GTX980
if you haven't seen that already
I'll put the link up here.
This one honestly came out
where I didn't expect this good
of a PC for the money
where we only paid $367 USD
and it's a quiet PC.
It performs really well in games.
We saw it with Apex Legends
we were getting over 80FPS
1080P high settings.
Anthem, probably want to
drop that down to medium
as the high settings was getting around 50
but the one percent and
point one percent loads
were also very smooth.
A CS:GO was getting over 200 FPS.
The .1% loads went down to
like 45 but that's still great.
It's still gonna give
you a smooth experience
but when we compare this build
to the previous build I did,
this one is just honestly more
desirable in that it is quiet
the temperatures are very well controlled.
When we had the side panel on versus off,
we had 65 degrees with the side
panel off versus 68 degrees
with the side panel on.
This is in a 27 degree ambient environment
and that's when the GP is overclocked.
So we can see here that
even overclocked the GP is
having no problems even with
just a single exhaust fan
on this build and this MX330 case.
Now another thing about this case is
even though it's got no
front fans at the front,
the rear exhaust fan is actually
pushing out a lot of air.
So what I've realized out of this build
versus the previous build is
that you can have all these
fancy RGB fans at the front
but if they're not pushing air properly
then they are basically useless.
I like how in this case, all pun intended,
the exhaust fan is pushing air properly
and so not having front fans installed
doesn't make a huge difference
especially when this build
only uses up 240 Watts.
That's the most I saw on the power meter
when we were testing this thing in games.
So in a nutshell with this build
the power consumption's low
the performance is really good.
You got an i7 in there,
you got a GTX1060 6GB,
resale value's gonna be good
since we've also got 16
Gigabytes of RAM and SSD
and a one terabyte hard drive
and the best thing is
it looks decent as well.
It's not the best looking build
but it does look very clean
and we've got that wide LED strip
which honestly doesn't look tacky coupled
with that white fan on
the cooler master H411R
and speaking of that cooler,
did an absolutely fine job of
keeping the CPU under control.
Anyway guys hope you
enjoyed this video today.
I really didn't know that
this was going to come out of
the video when I started it.
I thought I was just
going to diagnose problems
and hopefully find what was wrong
and then just redo the system up
for as cheap as possible
but when the motherboard was damaged
I thought well we've taken
all the equipment out
and then we've got to change
the motherboard anyway
we might as well just turn
it into a full fledge build
and that's exactly what
happened here and uh,
definitely gonna be one
that's a good for a flip
and if you guys enjoy these videos
then you know what to
do hit that like button.
Also, let us know in the
comment section below
what do you think of today's build.
And also on that note
with the GTX1060 and some
other mid range cards like these
perhaps I can test them on the
3770 while I've got it here
and then compare it against the 9900k
to find out on the mid range
how much performance you're losing out on.
Maybe that's a video you
guys will want to see.
I don't know.
Let us know on the comments
but with that aside,
hope you enjoyed this one.
If you want to see more of Tech YES city,
