the used PC build of the month for
September even though it's now October
so we're running a little bit late but
better late than never because this
month we have two gtx 690 s which are
actually two graphics cards on one PCB
so we've got essentially Quad SLI in
this whole build which is going to come
under five hundred US dollars I believe
when I've tallied up all the costs
because these costs three hundred
Australian dollars we'd pick them up on
a deal on gumtree and the used parts
hunt and I'll put the link in the
description below for you guys if you
want to check out that video where I
actually go these graphs guys for a
really good deal and then we've got here
the arrow strike X we got this for fifty
Australian dollars and also put all the
prices here for you guys so you can sort
of weigh up all the relative costs and
an interesting thing is a new cooler
from Aliexpress this has two fans it's
also like a quite a big cooler we've got
this for twenty five US dollars so this
thing's going to be kicking it pretty
hard and then moving on to the main dish
this is the Zeus rogue Jean Z Maximus
for motherboard we got this for ten US
dollars in Japan when we're at bargain
hunting and mantels it needed was to bed
pins to be fixed and it's working
perfectly fine I already tested that in
a previous video and the CPU in it is
the i7 3770k when we're in Japan again
we picked this up for a hundred us so
absolutely incredible value for money
Ram we've got a gigabytes of memory
which I've got two sticks one which I
hunted down recently another which I got
in the past and then we've got a used
harddrive here this is a 500 gigabyte
hard drive and we've got this for a
pretty good deal and now the last part
that's gonna make this build all tick is
a gold rated power supply from FSP we
got this in Japan for around about 50
USD back home Asti over a year ago I
believe now it's been crazy how long
I've had this thing for and we actually
had to solder some SATA cables on there
because we didn't have any of the
connectors however we will need an extra
PCIe connection to make sure this build
is working however I'm not positive if
this is the one that is going to work as
you can see it's kind of a weird fit
doesn't fit all the best
so we're gonna test this out on a really
old graphics card first just to make
sure it works before we put it on a 690
and make sure we don't blow one of them
up but without further ado let's get on
to putting this build together so we've
come into a dilemma actually we've got
two dilemmas the first being that this
needs ad lib the 3770k because it was
the first generation of Intel CPUs where
they stopped using the solder between
the IHS and the dye but another problem
we had here is that this connector
actually isn't giving out the proper
voltages in its configuration in other
words the FSP power supply is sending
out 12 volt signals to the ground wire
instead of the 12 volt wires on this
cable so a way to get around this is I
didn't want to do this but I think it's
the only way we're gonna get this bill
done is if I hack this cable up test out
where the 12 volt is coming out of that
VGA connection on the power supply and
then rewire this connector so it doesn't
not work though the good news is however
is that nothing blew up here I was
actually afraid hence why I use this
graphs card though the power supply is
to thank for that it must have some
really good short-circuit protection
built in that tripped before any damage
could be done because I've already put
the otherwise hook the original wires
coming out of the power supply off and
the graphics card still works perfectly
fine so we'll come back to the office
and the first problem we fixed by just
quickly popping in to Bunnings and using
their awesome devices they've got some
really expensive ones and they do a
great job of deal it in your cpu the
next problem here is we've used now a
digital multimeter and we were able to
test out which of those connections on
the power supply is spitting out a
negative or a positive 12 volt and we've
actually figured out that our connector
is not suited as it was out of its
standard configuration so we have to
switch this positive wire here with this
negative wire and then hopefully we
should have PCIe power out of this power
supply which is using its good old
proprietary stuff which makes things
very difficult but we'll get there in
the end
so we've used a multimeter to test out
all the voltages on this power supply
and we can see here we had to switch
around two of the wires and now all we
have to do a solo that back together and
tape it up and we should have the power
supply ready for this build oh yeah
so we're just about to take the coolers
off this GTX 690 s or actually GTX 619
and they've got like these screws that
hexagonal they kind of remind me of
smartphones screws so we're unfortunate
gonna have to head down to Bunnings yet
again and try and see if we can get a
tool that will fit that so we can
unscrew these and change the thermal
paste around
okay so here's another hiccup along the
way of this build so we turned it on and
basically one of the GPUs wasn't being
registered nor what's the fan spinning
up and what's happening on this bottom
eight speed PCIe slot and damn you can
see in there that the it's gonna get in
as closer than a can be you can see that
the pins are actually munted on this
PCIe slot so I don't think I can
actually get this build working on this
motherboard I can only get one graphics
card working maybe on the top so
unfortunately this Quad SLI build is not
gonna be so quite this time with that
said let's go ahead and see what a gtx
690 can do and then I'll probably make a
follow-up video where I put it on
another motherboard and then make it a
gtx 699 nine nine nine nine
so then we have a guy's the bill is now
complete however we did run into some
problems along the way and the biggest
one being that the Quad SLI actually
doesn't work on this motherboard for
some reason I checked around and I guess
it's because it doesn't natively support
quite a lot and he supports two-way SLI
on the bottom PCIe connector is only
eight speed and so initially the fan
would even boot up but after
investigating that bottom slot it
appeared that some of the pins were in
an awkward configuration they were just
a bit munted so I got out my trusty
tweezers flattened them out and then put
only the GTX 690 in the bottom slot and
it actually turned on and was recognized
in Windows on that bottom slot
however again once we put in both the
graphics cards and we checked all the
options there was just nothing I could
do to make four GPUs or the four gtx 680
s in the two on the two 690 PCBs work on
this particular configuration so after
that we then had to start testing with
one gtx 690 and the results were pretty
good I mean there was only one game out
of the games that I tested here that
would just not work with the 690 in sli
mode and that was csgo and I mean csgo
itself doesn't really need any graphical
power really to play as you guys noticed
in the past I've had that thing running
perfectly fine on a 9800 GT which is a
very old graphs good so going through
the results however with one 692 this
date on some titles like for honor it
was running really well until you got to
some parts of the map where there was
some slight stuttering and the
experience was definitely not as good as
one single GPU solution and keep in mind
the GTX 690 is the last solution that
was released from the video that was two
GPUs on one single PCB so I guess they
stopped that because of these frame
times and you can actually see it when
I'm even doing single-player benchmarks
on the live frame time map there's just
spikes
however the temperatures on these GPUs
let's talk about that a little bit
because we did change thermal paste and
it was crusty it was old and it wasn't
working up to pi however once we replace
it with some
TMX for the temperatures were now really
good we're going into the mid-70s on the
sli configurated set up on one gtx 690
as opposed to before we're getting into
ninety degrees so the temperatures were
a big difference after we changed the
thermal paste and also on that note we
had to go into Windows to enable the six
90s to work in SLI beforehand they just
worked off one GPU itself and in the
fire strike scores this represented the
scaling before and after before we're
getting around 8,000 points after we're
getting around 14,000 points so we were
getting about 80 percent scaling however
in some games for instance like for
honor we were getting near a hundred
percent scaling so it was great to see
that an old card like a 690 was still
performing very well in some of the
titles that were released this year and
then we look at another title for
instance like Far Cry primal where I
thought and the results aren't gonna be
too good here again they're actually
very good and we're getting very good
frame rates at 1080p very high setting
and then we move over to another title
like Tom Clancy's the division and the
frame rates were actually very good
however all three games on the Ubisoft
titles did have frames spiking and this
is indicative of an SLI setup in all
three titles when I was testing it with
the live monitoring again there was
frame spiking and then the next game we
tested was pub G and this was the worst
by far sli just wasn't working that well
it was really bad really unplayable in
my opinion on the dual 690 SLO ever
changing over to a single 690 actually
better performance I'm very low even
though the frame rates weren't as good
we were still getting less frame spike
so that wasn't looking too good for the
GTX 690 s so if you are an older
graphics cards putting them in SLI is
really not optimal for a good experience
despite the increase in overall frame
rates especially pub G which I believe
is one of the most popular titles today
though what about the vram buffer on the
690 interesting configuration we've got
two gigabytes and two gigabytes
technically it should be four gigabytes
right and the answer is no especially on
dx11 titles and a lot of titles out
there at the moment even when dx12 don't
support that full scaling feature of
utilizing all the vram on the gratis
card so what we had here was effectively
2 gigabytes of vram to work
and it was pretty limiting even at 1080p
on a lot of the titles coming out in
2017
you're still gonna run into problems so
my suggestion would be if you want to
get something like a GTX 690 and run it
as a gaming graphics card if you pick up
one for a bargain then I would suggest
turning down the settings to maybe
medium even very low in some cases but
some games will run absolutely fine on
1080p high settings so do guys today was
not the best showcasing of the GTX 690 s
I was hoping to get quite SLI working
but unfortunately it just wasn't
happening on today's build so the good
news however is that we can drop the
build by around 150 AUD or 120 USD of
our initial estimate since we're not
actually using this graphics card
anymore and that'll bring the build cost
down to a relatively cheap price of
around around 350 USD which is very good
for the performance it was getting and
now speaking of the performance that
3770k that ID littered man that thing
was just absolutely insane on the
performance we're getting this thing up
to 4.8 gigahertz on a 25-dollar
aliexpress cooler and the temperatures
were actually very controlled the
ambience in here at the moment around 23
degrees I believe and the performance
was just insane 4.8 giga it's 70 degrees
at all times even on a stress test
gaming the performance was really good
something like this for $100 is
definitely kicking it in today's games
but don't know that you'll be able to
edit videos even 4k videos if you have
enough RAM on something like the 3770k
and honestly overclocking this thing was
really easy however I did try to get it
to 5 gigahertz but it just wasn't
happening it just wouldn't boot into
Windows it was refusing to get there
though it was booting initially up to
the load screen it was just crashing out
and so I had to settle on 4.8 gigahertz
so I know guys that's today's build done
and dusted I hope you enjoyed this video
if you did then be sure to give it a big
thumbs up and let me know in the comment
section below what you want to see when
I actually get these up and running in
Quad SLI that video is coming let me
know what grabs card you want me to
compare it to maybe like a 1070 or
something like that and I'll get that
done in a future video I've just got to
get a motherboard that supports Quad SLI
so that's an upcoming video coming to
you guys in the future and also today's
build it was one of the most time can
Schumi because that every single hurdle
there was a problem I had to overcome
I mean first we started with those power
connectors and just didn't have enough
connections and they were really
proprietary so I had to change them
around and then do a multimeter to test
out the points it was just an absolute
headache and then in the end we didn't
even need to do that because one of the
gtx 690 s didn't work in the Quad SLI
configuration and then of course after
that we came into some problems with
that bottom PCIe slot and then of course
we had to deal with the 3770k but in the
end we got through it all and today we
have a build that is running really well
and actually the aro cool strike ax case
is even though it's really big the
airflow on this thing is extremely good
that top 20 centimeter fan draws air
down you've got a fan covering your hard
drives and dress s these if you put them
in there and you will get really good
performance and low temperatures anyway
guys I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
