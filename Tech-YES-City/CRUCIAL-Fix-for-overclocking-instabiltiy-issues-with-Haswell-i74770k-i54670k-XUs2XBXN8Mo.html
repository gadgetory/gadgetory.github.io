brandy's coming back to you guys today
with a crucial update for haswell and
the instability shoes that I was
encountering now the recent update to
the bios so on my msi motherboard i
updated my bass to 1.3 and it has fixed
completely fixed my instability issues
which is really good now if you are on
another motherboard manufacturer like
gigabyte or zoos or something like that
and then I imagine they would have had a
recent update to their bias as well that
may fix the instability issues as well
if you're encountering the same thing as
I did if you're on msi motherboard and
you want to overclock then update your
boss straightaway to 1.3 now another
thing for MSI users if you guys can't
flash from the bass I was having the
same problem while I was having a
problem where I couldn't flash my boss
from the bios itself using MSI's m flash
so i had to flash with live update but
it did work and it worked fine so if
you're going to use live update you can
go to this website here i'll show you
just go you can just click download live
update 5 install it and before you
update your bias make sure that you're
running optimized defaults so make sure
you're not you don't have any over
clocks running on your computer and also
close things like skype just close that
down make sure windows update as well
even little things like this turning
onto never check for updates you don't
want anything interrupting your computer
while you are updating the bios
especially if you're doing it from
windows i don't know why it didn't work
from m flash it actually was weird it
could save a bus from the bias itself
but it couldn't update so weird thing
with msi there i think they have to
address that and fix that and yet that's
about it guys so I you're probably
wondering why my microphone this one
here it's like it's just got this it's
crap man this thing quality control it
sounds like you know there's just
turbulence like it sounds like an
aircraft planes driving by it now so
this thing's got problems I gotta get a
warranty get it fixed on warranty only
had it for six months and I haven't even
barely like a beaut like this thing
hasn't been abused at all this thing has
been dropped down the stairs like two
times the baby's been using it as a
hammer I mean and it's still working
really well so yeah bit bearing a
quality controllers hit and miss there
so I'm going to say to there's a lot of
juicy videos coming for you guys as well
I've got some
really cool settings I've got some
really cool things that I've discovered
with Haswell and I'm going to share them
in an overclocked video but also an
optimization guide as well so I'm going
to bring out two guides in the next few
days probably next week is going to be
an overclock tutorial and an
optimization guide for recommended
settings with Haswell i will say now
that it's stable it is amazing
everything is working really well after
this recent bios update so before this
bios update there was huge stability
issues like it was just the weirdest
stability that I was ever like
instability that I was ever encountering
is just on the deck i said before my
previous video is just on the desktop
and just crash like doing nothing so i'm
glad that they fixed it anyway it's a
shame that it took them 20 day 20 odd
days after release to fix it properly so
that's a sad that's a shame but anyway
not to worry it's fixed now it caused me
a lot of frustration it probably caused
a lot of frustration for you guys as
well and yeah it's fixed anyway so if
you have a friend who's having
instability issues with Haswell you can
let them know so hey update your bias
man as most likely causing the issues
sorry guys please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it and if you
haven't already subscribe I'm going to
get some really juicy tech videos coming
for you guys you guys going to be blown
away by the crap i'm going to give you
it's not necessarily not crap it's
really good stuff so anyway i'll catch
you guys soon peace out for now wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
