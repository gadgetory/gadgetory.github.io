this is Bryan easy coming back to you
guys today with a overclocked tutorial
for RAM now I've been meaning to get
this done for a long time but I've just
wanted to make it as in-depth yet simple
as possible for you guys also I wanted
to get my camera audio fixed as my
camera audio was a bit dull and so
hopefully yeah this this video is a
little bit better than my previous
overclocked tutorials and I hope I can
give you the best advice I can so anyway
that being said let's move on to the
overclocked tutorial now before we begin
we're going to need three programs and
that is the first one is max mem the
second program is prime 95 and the last
one is cpuid cpu-z now I'll put the link
to all three of these programs in the
description below so you guys can
download these and now basically this
one here max mem is a benchmark so it's
going to test our RAM prime95 is a
stability test which is the last program
we're going to need and C Bui Z is just
there to check our settings so that
being said also I want you guys to open
up Start menu computer and go to hard
drive where your OS is installed so for
me that C Drive I want you to right
click on that and click properties and I
want you to go over to hardware and
click properties again for your disc
where your OS is installed and go to
volumes sorry go to change settings in
general and then go to the policies tab
and then I want you to take off write
caching take this off so just in case up
in case our OS crashes we're not going
to corrupt any files so it's just a
safety precaution Airi measure so once
that's done guys we can then open up CPU
Z ID and we're just going to check our
ram ok so basically what we're doing now
is we're checking our ram and basically
go over to as you can see i'm clocked at
4.2 gigs but i want you to go over to
SPD tab and basically this is a little
chip that is on your ram that comes with
settings from the manufacturer and as
you can see here I have XMP profiles now
some ramp I pretty much every Ram that
sold nowadays comes with these XMP
profiles and what they are is they're
just guaranteed overclocks from the
manufacturers of your Ram
and as you can see here I have two XMP
profiles but if you don't have an XMP
profile you should have a profile here
that says these tweaked settings from
the manufacturer so if you don't have an
XMP profile then write down the settings
here because you'll you might want to
dial them into BIOS and basically I will
put the video in the description below
but I already did a video showing that
the XMP profiles or at least the
guaranteed overclocks from the
manufacturers are a lot better than the
Auto settings so this is important that
you guys are at least getting in these
XMP profiles so that being said let's
move on to let's restart the computer
and now we're going to go into BIOS so
this is why we're recording off a camera
we can't use desktop recording software
because we are using the Sony camera so
so that being said we just move into
BIOS guys and now we're in BIOS don't be
afraid to enter BIOS it's not that scary
you guys probably already seen my CPU
overclock tutorial and basically we go
over to overclock Tweaker so this is
asrock guys this is the asrock UEFI boss
now by different biases are going to
look different to this one again if you
guys haven't asrock then that's pretty
good you're going to find it a lot
easier than maybe if you got a gigabyte
bios or something cool Zeus's file so
they're going to look different
according to the manufacturers this is a
Xerox version but these settings should
all be in there somewhere so you guys
have to find them for this one this is
as rocks so you just go over to
overclock Tweaker and now you go down to
your DRAM timing configurations so as we
can see here I want you guys to first
load up the XMP 1.2 profile so this is
my 1600 megahertz profile which is 9 9 9
and 28 so if you load that up there so
we'll do that again so it was on auto
but load XMP setting here and we just
click dial that in so we're going to do
this first because this is going to give
us a baseline of the performance figures
so now we're doing this we're loading up
the XMP profile first and nothing else
has changed and Save Changes in exit so
that's easy
now another thing is to guys
make sure your CPU and everything else
is stable before you do this okay
because if other things aren't stable
then obviously you things could be
crashing but not because of your RAM so
you want to make sure your CPU is stable
your GPU everything's stable before you
do the RAM overclocked tutorial and with
that being said let's move in and so now
you've got the XMP profile enabled and
with that all you have to do is load up
Mac's mem so we can double click on that
and load up this and what we want to do
is we just want to hit start benchmark
so once this is loaded up we hit start
benchmark and all this does is just it
does a benchmark on your RAM so we're
just waiting tick tock tick tock okay so
there's that there's the first benchmark
done on our XMP settings now I want you
to go to set screen shot here so we go
to screen shot and we go save to file
and on desktop and I can just put XMP
1600 and now that is the first benchmark
we've done and we have the picture here
so we can come back to this later and
check our schools and make basically
what this program is doing maximum its
benchmarking your RAM but it's also
giving you an idea of if your ram your
ram overclock is stable because if your
ram overclocks not stable you can be
getting bad numbers here as opposed to
your XMP profile so this is just
establish this is giving us a baseline
of our basically of our scores so now we
can restart the computer and now things
are going to getting a little more
in-depth now so we're going to be going
into BIOS again and so I'm just taking
you guys I'm going to make this is going
to be uncut I just want to show you guys
everything from start to finish and now
overclock obviously it's going to be a
bit faster for me because I already
tested my ram but I'm just going to show
you the methodology here so now we want
to set this back to auto so we go back
to load XMP settings and put that in the
middle of the screen for you guys but in
overclocked weaker we want to go back to
load XMP settings and we want to put
that back to auto okay so both of that
that's taking off our XMP profile now
and what we want to go down to now is go
down to DRAM frequency so we'll go down
here but actually no we'll do that sorry
what first what you want to do is you
want to put your DRAM voltage up to so
the default is 1.5 volt now check guys
make sure you check in CPU Z and make
sure your voltage is 1.5 volt because
some Ram is 1.3 volt 1.3 5 volt and also
some Ram is 1.6 5 volt so you have to
know what voltage your Ram is this
pretty much this tutorial is for 1.5
volt 1600 megahertz Ram like if you guys
are going to copy my settings the less I
want you to take this up to the setting
that you're comfortable with I'm going
to take this up to date to 1.6 volt now
I'm not going to go any higher because
there will be obviously this is a
tutorial and it's a safe guide so I'm
not going to make this setting higher
than 1.6 volt because I don't want you
guys risking or I don't want you guys
having any risks of frying your hardware
so this is just going to be one point
six volt if you guys want to take it
higher you can but there just be aware
that especially over one point six five
volt there is a chance that you can
damage your hardware and I don't want
you guys damaging your hardware I always
recommend safe over blocks so straight
away put this up to one point six volt
and we can bring once this will be the
final stage bringing this down will be
the first and and be the final stage so
that's something we don't really have to
worry about now once that's at one point
six volt we can then go to direct DRAM
frequency and basically I want you guys
to get just go go turbo on this okay so
drop this down and instead of 1866 or
2002 one three three and once is good
what what this is going to do is it's
going to tell us how fast our RAM can go
if my ram can boot at two one three
three then i've got pretty good ram if
it doesn't boot at two one three three
then I think I've just got mediocre Ram
so not not too worried there and now
we're going to go into also sorry so
change that to to 133 if you're on 1600
megahertz Ram change it to do do
three two one three three and make sure
your voltage is at one point six volt
and now also go into DRAM configuration
and we want to relax these timings okay
now let me just pause here for a sec
you're probably wondering what are these
timings here okay so these timings here
our timings for the RAM and now I'm not
going to explain what they do but rather
I'm just going to give you guys a simple
outlook this is timing one this is
timing two this is timing three now
these three timings the lower they are
the better for performance however the
lower they are things can get unstable
as well so we want to relax these when
we're finding our max speed and now this
here is timing number four okay and
basically timing number four should be
the sum of all these three give or take
plus one or minus one but generally it's
it's around that area plus one minus one
but it should be the sum of these three
so now this is what I want you guys to
do when you relax the timings and I want
you to go for a say two one three three
and now we're going pretty hard we're
going pretty high here because we're
just going to find out how good our ram
is and how high it can go so we go that
one more time one point six volt ddr3 to
133 and during configuration twelve
twelve twelve thirty six now don't worry
what these do it is a timing one timing
two time III lowers the lower they are
the better timing for the sum of all
these three timings okay and that's all
you need to know you don't have to worry
and stress about anything else now that
being done we just go over to exit Save
Changes and exit okay
and now hopefully it boots hopefully it
doesn't boot if it doesn't boot you guys
are gonna it's probably going to be good
for you guys because you're going to go
you're going to see the frustration
involved in overclocking and you know
things can get you know things can get
crashing things can get be unstable
that's not to worry that's just one
thing you just want to make sure when
you're overclocking is not to set
voltage is too high because that'll fry
ram and as you can see here my computer
isn't even booting so it can't boot at
233 which means my
cannot run two on three three speeds
which it's that's just normal
that's from 1600 speed ram you can't
expect too much so hopefully it'll boot
I mean it's just chugging at the moment
it's taking its poor time it's it's
struggling my poor RAM it won't go into
bales so basically that what this but
the good thing about the asrock is is
that it'll reset the settings so if it
doesn't boot three times it'll then
reset back to auto so that's a good
thing
if you guys if your computer doesn't
boot then just hit the clear CMOS button
or reset your BIOS that's what you're
gonna have to do so that's basically if
you can't boot in at two one three three
you just have to hit your clear CMOS
button now obviously my ram is not
capable of running as you see it's ddr3
1600 it's reverted back to its default
setting because it can't run at this
setting and now we're going to take it
down to two 2000 this time and see if we
have any luck so basically what we're
trying to find out is is how fast our
RAM can actually boot into Windows out
so and this is going to save you a lot
of time this is the method that I use
it's it saves a lot of time because
we're not figuring we're not messing
around with voltage or speed we're just
finding the highest speed our room can
run up straight away rather than the
lower speed some people are going to do
overclocking to draw is a lot different
and that's fine no one's wrong and no
one's right and so this is my method I'm
just going to teach it to you guys
because it's pretty quick and now look
we've booted into Windows at 2000
megahertz on Iran and everything's okay
so we're going to run a benchmark with
the timings relaxed and now I probably
could get my ram running at to 133 if I
gave it more voltage I am just not
comfortable running my ram at 1.6 5 volt
or 1.7 volt I'm not comfortable in
getting you know putting those highest
voltages through my components because I
don't want to risk frying them and same
with you guys I recommend you to be
careful with it but here we go we're
running the benchmark this is at 2000
and as we can see here we got
a hopefully we got a better score than
the XMP settings even with the relaxed
timings so we're going to save a
screenshot of that save to file two
thousand twelve twelve twelve thirty six
now that is a that is our next overclock
okay so we've got the first one and
we've got the second one as we can see
here we had a pretty much a 10% increase
in memory read speeds and also a
increase in memory latency so the lower
the latency the battle and also there
was an increase in memory copy as well
so everything all the performance of the
RAM went up when we overclocked our RAM
higher which is a good thing and now
this is the part that you guys have to
ask yourself for a 24/7 overclock do you
want to be running your ram at 2004 me
no I don't I want to be dropping it down
another level so find the max setting
that your RAM is capable of running out
so my ram is capable of running at 2000
and i'm going to drop it down one knotch
so for me 1866 is basically the suite
24/7 overclock for my ram so 24 hours a
day 7 days a week my ram could run to
1866 and i don't think it would have a
problem so this is generally what people
like to do with RAM and I like to do it
as well it's just a good safe level so
now we've found our higher speed which
is ddr3 2000 I want to take it down 1
knotch
ddr3 1866 and basically this is might
this is going to be my 24/7 overclock
for my RAM so once you guys have found
it you guys may be able to boot at 2 1 3
3 I know for instance the Samsung memory
is very good so Samsung of releasing
their ddr3 that Ram that they've been
releasing I think it goes as high as
2,400 so some people will be able to run
stable at 2200 and yes this is for like
the $50.00 Ram it's amazing value so
Corsair Vengeance are probably capable
of the same as me maybe 2000 I don't
know it's up to you guys but for me 1866
is my one level my one notch below
my max stable overclock so 1866 is what
I'm going to be doing for 24/7 overclock
and now for the DRAM timings I'm pretty
comfortable when you when you're above
ten you can generally take it down two
notches at a time so again we're taking
those down two notches to timing one
down two notches timing two down two
notches timing three down two notches
some of all them is 30 so we're going to
go to 30 and now this should be okay so
what we're doing is we know we know for
a fact that my ram was stable at 2000 so
now we're dropping it down to 1866 but
now we're also going to start being
aggressive on the timings and we're
going to start dropping the timings down
so we're going to see if it boots at
basically we're going to see what it
boots up and what we can get it up to so
which is now is sort of now we're
tweaking so we've found the we've found
our safe level so we're comfortable of
going at 1866 and we're just basic for
24/7 overclock and now we're just on the
timings now and don't be afraid don't
worry about what it all means what does
tear ass mean what does don't is just
all's it is is timing one Tommy - Tommy
3 don't be afraid so just know the logic
involved and once you know that you'll
be comfortable doing it so anyway let's
once we've done that we're going to open
up maximum again lovely little program
and we're going to do our benchmark this
time again we're going to go hit start
benchmark boom
fingers crossed fingers crossed it all
works it should it should work it should
be all good
ok come on tomorrow ok so there we go
let's save the screenshot save to file
and desktop 1866 ten ten ten thirty okay
so we just save that one there and we
can bring that up again we'll see how
that compares to our previous benchmark
so it was the memory copy was higher
which is good the memory read was a
little bit slower and the memory write
was a little bit faster and the memory
latency was a little bit low but that's
the memory latency should be expected to
be low because I dropped the timings but
as you can see there that was a good run
so that was I'm happy that it did ten
ten ten thirty now we're going to drop
it down again so let's try 999 so once
we get now below ten you only want to
drop them down generally by one notch
because below tens when you start
getting a bit fragile and if you're
dropping it down to I'll pretty much
guarantee my ram won't boot so as we go
back to over so we go into biasing and
go down to overclock Tweaker
and now our RAM is comfortable this is
confirmed my RAM likes running at 1866
ten ten ten thirty now we can drop it
down to 999 27 at 1866 so we just again
we're dropping it down one notch this
time so below 10 only drop it down one
one notch at a time and generally you
drop them all down at the same time
because you just want to find out if it
can boot and if we can run a bench at
this at this level and now we're the sum
of all three is 27 so we're going to
leave that at 27 and I tend to like
leaving the tier ass on an even number
so with that being said I'm going to put
it down I'm going to drop it to 28 for
some reason when I did my benchmarking a
tea race on an even number was better
than an odd number I don't know why but
yeah for me I like having it on an even
number so for you guys I'm going to
recommend the same leave your TRS on an
even number so for me I'm going to drop
back to one notch slower drop it back to
28 and that's my settings now and then
we're going to go exit Save Changes in
exit so hopefully there's boots it might
not be and if it doesn't then we have
found a stable overclock at 10 10 10 30
which is really good so I don't know if
this will boot I'm hoping it will boot
nope
I don't think so come on come on no it's
kind of like it's kind of hanging now
just to have to restart
okay so yeah sometimes you're going to
it's going to be probably have to hit
the clear CMOS this time because it's
kind of booting but it's not working so
yeah I'm gonna have to hit my clear CMOS
button so you guys are going to get it
laughs so this is a okay so for me on
the asrock I just have a I basically
have a button on the rear that's a clear
CMOS button and it's really easy so
basically when I hit that button it'll
reset everything back to normal which is
really good okay so there we go we're
booting again we're up and running so my
ram does not like running at nine nine
nine twenty eight so my ram just said no
as you can see here everything's loaded
back to normal so before you I sorry
another thing to use guys before you do
this tutorial as well make sure you have
your profiles as well so make sure you
have profiles as well because they save
they save you a lot of time so as you
can see here I'll you know you guys
aren't going to see too much there don't
worry about that that anyway back to one
point six volts so we're making sure our
vid D Ram voltage is at one point six
volt and 1866 and as before our timings
were on basically our timings were nine
nine nine twenty eight and it didn't
boot at that stage so now this time what
we want to do is we want to now drop it
by one only on one setting so nine ten
ten thirty so we're taking it one step
at a time now because we're getting
closer to the maximum settings
okay so safe changing the exit so timing
one now gets dropped by one knotch
and that's all that's happening so it
should boot now so hopefully ah damn I
hit the camera
in the game come on camera
come on okay okay cameras come on on
cameras coming on okay
so we're back in now guys we're back in
business so now our computer basically
if your computer boots to Windows it's
pretty much stable rams rams basically
one of those hit-or-miss things that
either works or doesn't work it's very
sensitive and another thing too guys I
forgot to say is RAM as well it's prone
it's it the thing about overclocking Ram
is you have to be very careful with the
voltages and the heat because Ram
doesn't have built-in protection as well
just keep that in mind that's one thing
you have to keep in mind so when you
ever got the CPU it's got the throttling
built-in and automatically cut itself
off same with the GPU and they get too
hot they cut themselves off Ram doesn't
Ram just shits itself so that's why you
have to be very careful with Ram and so
follow this guide it's obviously today
I'm recommending you guys safe settings
so let's go now we're at nine nine nine
ten thirty and we're just going to hit
load up max man hit start benchmark and
obviously with the GPU as well the RAM
on board the GPU can get hot as well
which is why you always should be
careful with RAM and say prone to
failing piece of equipment so there we
go there's our benchmarks there and
we're going to basically save the
screenshot again save to file and we're
going to do eighteen six six nine ten
nine sorry nine 10:00 10:30
so in ahead of myself then and now this
is what we're going to have here as you
can see here we got the benchmark this
time around was a little bit faster on
the latency a little bit slow on the
memory right a little bit faster on the
memory read and a little bit slow on the
memory copy so that's just variants I
think if I ran the benchmark again I'd
probably get better numbers so you can
just check that but that'd just be a
little bit of variance I'm guessing
nothing to worry about this
around we might get better memory copy
and stuff like that but nothing to worry
about as long as it's all similar we're
just getting the best timings the best
thing to note was that the latency is
consistently a little bit faster which
is a good thing so that's a good thing
as well
okay so let's move back now so that's
pretty much stable at 9:00 10:00 10:30
which is okay the memory copy for some
reason is better or you didn't see that
smash ligther the memory copy is again
better when it was relaxed so that can
give you an indication of that generally
might give you an indication that your
RAM likes running even though it can run
at nine ten ten it might like running
better at not at 10:00 10:00 10:30 so
there you go there's a benchmark against
it's running solid so that's pretty much
stable so let's get back into it we're
gonna go so our benchmark did fine we
got better memory latency we got
generally better scores by dropping it
down just one notch and it's not yes so
once you get back into here it's really
just fine-tuning now that you're at this
stage you're basically just fine-tuning
and now I know I've already tested it
but I'm pretty sure that the raster cast
delay is the one that's causing the
problems but let's get it on anyway so
I'm scared of doing that but yeah same
you can solve it follow the same
methodology and you can boot and find
out which one doesn't like getting
booted up at 9 so I'm pretty sure it was
my second timing the second timing just
doesn't work at 9:00 9:00 10:30 as you
can see here is is just struggling it's
cute
so that was so now I've got a problem
again set that back again
okay that's booting yeah okay well okay
we're getting back into boss so the boss
is already over set overclocked depth
well you know my
now my bias is like looking crazy yes
it's just really unstable
it won't even load up blasts I just got
to hit the seam I got to hit the clear
CMOS just wait okay turn that off and
now this is your clear CMOS this is your
captain speaking
clear CMOS talking to you so don't be
afraid to clear CMOS II know it's a lot
of RAM RAM overclocking is a lot of
crashing guys it's a lot of I guess it's
more frustrating than overclocking the
CPU and GPU because it takes a lot of
clear CMOS and again you want to have
that profile set and you want to okay so
yeah for me sorry I gotta save it again
that save it okay
so I'll make it easier for you guys now
let's get back into the Dhiren
figuration it didn't like at 9:00
wouldn't boot it was going crazy
however at 10 it was fine so we know
that this for nine is okay this for 10
is okay as well and this for nine is
okay as well I mean sorry now this time
so my bad this time we're going to drop
this down to nine so I've already
obviously already tested my ram so I
know what it's capable of but we're
going to drop this down to nine now so
this one didn't boot it nine so we're
dropping it back to 10 and that's the
best that it can do this one here we're
dropping back to nine now we're going to
give it another notch and I'm going to
take it to nine and now this here we can
leave this at 30 because we can work on
that last and we're going to save
changes in exit and now we're on nine
ten nine thirty and we're going to run a
benchmark and it's going to be all good
okay so we're booting it's all good now
everything's fine Rams happy computers
happy everybody's happy this is a good
thing this is a good thing guys there
you go check make sure it's all good you
zoom in the reflection hey you would you
can see my can you see my shure sm58 i
don't know if you can see that but yeah
anyway let's get on with it so now we've
got our I'm pretty sure this is our
final setting because I've tested it
before but you can see how I've worked
my way to this setting and I'm showing
you all the methodology on how I've got
into this setting okay so let's start
the benchmark and see how we go alright
so there we have it that is the
screenshot safety file 1866 ating manam
law 1866 910 930 okay
alright so let's have a look at the
scores now ok guys sorry we were
interrupted by my DSLR overheating but
let's get back into it so we have a look
at the scores and then we see here the
scores are pretty similar but this one
is the memory latency is a little bit
better and that the timings are a little
bit better on the last overclock ever so
slow I mean it's probably variance but
it doesn't really matter that basically
our RAM is capable of running at 1866
910 930
now this time around we're going to
restart and we're going to drop the tear
ass down to 28 so actually I did it but
I didn't realize my camera cut out so my
timing is already set down to 28 but
anyway let's get back and let's get back
into it not going to let a DSLR
overheating deter us from overclocking
our room so again back to overclocked
Tweaker and now down to DRAM
configuration and I've dropped the T
race down to 28 now I've actually
benchmarked this a lot and for me I've
found in games that having the tier ass
slightly slower than the sum of all
three
is the best for the benchmark scores I
don't know why this is but this is just
what I've found and what I've tested so
obviously we'll do a benchmark in mem
test just to check the scores and see if
the TRS of 28 makes a difference versus
30 but I don't think it does I find
having the TRS a little bit slow that's
timing so timing for I find having the
timing number for a little bit slower
generally gets you the best results so
we'll find out here if our benchmark is
indeed going to show us better numbers
with a tighter trass so let's have a
look come on RAM give us it you know
what you're good for there we go so oh
it did give us a I think slightly better
score save to file 18 6 6 9 10 9 28 so
that will be so as we can see here we've
got a lot of 18 6 sixes but this is just
us fine-tuning so as we can see here the
memory copy was better on the pre on the
terrace at 30 the memory read was ever
so slightly better the memory was pretty
much exactly the same and the memory
latency was a bit better so I'm going to
say that mmm overall it mean kind of
looks like a yeah I mean so yeah I mean
it's just much of a muchness I just
found for gaming that having a tier ass
was giving me a tier ass that was
slightly slower was giving me a better
score I don't know why so you know since
I've been chucked games I'm going to
change my tier ass back to 30 and now
I'm going to show you guys my final this
is Goa the final stage now so once we've
found our timings and our speed we then
work on the voltage and we drop that
down in notches so this is not over yet
so if we should be happy that we found a
level that we're comfortable having ram
at so for me it's 9:10 930 that's the
best score for me and for you guys you
can play around with the rat tier ass if
you want to and
find the best setting for you but you
know ultimately the trass having it a
little bit slower than the sum of all
these three I found gave me the best
results and also keeping it on an even
number so those are two things to
remember the t race now let's get back
to it so that's our overclock ddr3 1866
DRAM configuration nine ten nine thirty
and voltage now one point six so we set
this initially this was the first thing
that we set up was the one point six
voltage on the RAM so we'll put that in
and now we want to drop this down you
can drop it down one at a time and
basically stability first ability we can
also save this as our four point two so
this is my oh yeah you drop it down one
voltage at a time and basically for this
the stability test is going to be
whether it boots into Windows I mean
generally with Ram your general
stability test is whether it boots I
mean if your computer boots into Windows
generally that level of ram is actually
going to be probably okay so that's what
I've found as well now our round boots
at one point five nine we can then
restart again take it down to one point
five eight fold so we're just basically
we're just dropping the voltage down one
notch at a time and that's basically to
save I know maybe a minuscule amount of
power who knows but we're just dropping
our voltage down and that's the this is
the last part guys just finding out the
level at which your RAM runs out what
voltage it runs up so now I've actually
tested mine and the lowest I got was one
point five seven five five volt so I'm
just going to set that down now so my
Ram was comfortable running at one point
five seven five volt so this was my
sweet spot for my RAM and I'm going to
save changes in exit so I'll just
quickly save that again so so my RAM was
comfortable at running at four point
five seven five volt so for you guys you
can take it down and basically when
things become unstable
give it a little bit not your head so
1.56 5-volt my ram didn't boot and so
that was for me I just said okay I take
it up to one point five seven five volt
and it ran fine so I'm going to give it
a benchmark also give it a final
benchmark now and once we've found our
sweet spot for our RAM we go open up
maximum again and we do a final
benchmark so this program is great it's
so simple it just does a benchmark on
your RAM I mean there's a lot of other
benchmarking programs out there but I
just find this so simple you know I'm
not compare I don't care what other
people have on their RAM I just care
about what my ram is and my ram is
capable of doing and so let's have a
look here so this is the final score and
as you can see here it's I mean we'll
just pull up some of the other ones
there so to just have a look and yeah I
mean the results are pretty similar so
this was our 28 - race and this is our
32 grass so I just like the 30 I mean
the voltage yet so everything's fine
it's running fine and now at one point
five seven five volt 1866 my ram is okay
okay guys so the last thing you'll want
to do is open up prime95 so once you've
found your sweet spot overclock and it's
running the benchmarks fine and
everything seems to be okay I want you
to open up prime95
and I want you to click on blend so test
some of everything lots of RAM tested
now this is a great thing and I want you
to click OK and then you can generally
leave this on overnight and if it
survives this test you are pretty much
solid you know this should be fine and I
find with Ram you're going to be very
careful so in conclusion I will say with
Ram you've got to be very careful it
doesn't have the protection that CPUs
have and GPUs having so that's why I'm
very today I'm very I'm very you know
cautious and I'm very relaxed with my
settings and my recommendations because
I don't want you guys risking blowing up
your hardware or frying your hardware
because I know how frustrating it is
from my personal experience so generally
all my overclocked tutorials are going
to be on the safer side I mean over the
ox are never safe but you're guaranteed
that this is a very safe
Guide to Getting safe over clocks so I
hope you guys enjoyed it and if you did
please give it a thumbs up and if you
haven't already subscribed at at gas
city where I do a lot of stuff to do a
lot of tech stuff to do with gaming and
technology and I just love those two
things they go ahead and hand gaming in
tech they're just awesome so and if you
guys are a yes man - then that's ever
reason more to subscribe so thanks guys
thanks for watching today if you have
any comments about this video if you
need to know anything or you're
desperate for help please leave a
comment in the comment section below or
if it's urgent
please send me a PM and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can and yeah guys
basically in a nutshell don't be afraid
to overclock the RAM it is a little bit
more complicated than the CPU and GPU in
my opinion there are more timings more
settings more things to do but in the
end it's a good thing and you know you
guys get more knowledge and more the
more you know the better it is I think
in general so I today I found my sweet
spot settings and I showed you how I
found my sweet spot settings so don't be
afraid to rewatch the video but
basically don't be afraid you know the
first three timings are just timings
that's all they are they're just the
lower they are the the generally the
better the fourth timing is the sum of
all three which should generally be an
even number and maybe a little bit more
relaxed so that's in a nutshell that's
basically it guys and yeah stay tuned
for my next - I'm going to basically my
next video will be and I don't know how
long I'm going to have a little break
from all this overclocking stuff it's
sort of you know I've been I'm going to
have a little break I've been stressed
out with YouTube a little bit I'm gonna
be making a video that shows all my
sweet spot overclocks into one sort of
list and then I'm going to be comparing
my sweet spot versus default Auto
settings and you're going to see how
much of a difference Auto overclocking
makes especially in games compared to
non over not overclocking just leaving
all your settings on order and you guys
to be surprised it's pretty big like the
differences are actually big so
overclocking your gear and this is safe
over clocks - I'm not like I'm not going
crazy on my overclocks all my basically
all my tutorials and all my guides
and all my settings I use personally are
save settings so that's a good thing and
so I never really generally I never
recommend settings that are crazy so
with your with your RAM generally the
voltage is the main thing to look out
for don't go too high and that's
obviously with Ram it can you know it
doesn't have the protection that GPUs
and CPUs have in place so that's
something to be mindful of and so anyway
guys that's about it I've ran it on a
little bit but yeah as you can see my
ram is stable it loves these speeds and
obviously I'm going to enjoy the
benefits of having a more slightly ever
so slightly snappier desktop and yeah
just faster ram which does make a slight
difference compared to the XMP profiles
gives me that little bit extra so guys
let me know for you you need anything so
that's about it I think so I look
forward to getting that guide out stay
tuned for my monthly budget builds
they'll be coming out soon and for the
next episode of Tech Talk where I'm
going to be talking about the server
market and all Dell IBM and HP so guys I
hope you enjoyed the I hope the camera
audio is a lot better too so peace out
for now anyway
