overclock mighty
when I saw a GTX 780 listed as junk and
not working I decided upon myself to
take a real close look at the photos and
then take a gamble so here is the story
of the rejuvenated GTX 780 all right
it's time to see if this thing boots so
let's see if we can get a signal today
Ritchie
that is a short-circuiting 780 Ti so as
you saw there before with that graphics
card it just it's basically the power
supply did a safety mechanism where it
cut off straight away and that's
generally an indication of a
short-circuit which I'm just going to
check the basic stuff maybe these put
too much thermal paste on the previous
owner and it's sort of squeezed off the
side of the GP units now you know
connecting two resistors together or
what not so it's going to quickly check
that and see what's up then also this is
really bad Wow okay it's got metal
straight on the back here connecting
these things with the components there
so we're going to try a few little
different things and then see if we can
get this gtx 780 to boot up again Wow
like look at that I mean if this stuff
is conductive then
all right so it's time for round two all
right let's do this okay come on
graphics card give me a signal okay we
got another power cut
damn so it looks like we may have a 780
after all Wow okay so anyway I pick up
the power supply the test power button
is water weight water coming out of this
power supply like I've never seen it
what deep I really do not understand
what is going on here like there is
water coming out of my power supply like
what the
what the actual I've never seen this
 before now you see that like just
dripping water and there was water on
the fan so water must have leaked down
somewhere Wow okay well apparently my
house is leaking like water around here
like literally right on my friggin
power-play of all places in the house to
leak water it leaks it on my freakin
power supply all right so now we've got
here a towel which is a temporary
solution so fat leaks it's going to leak
under the window which is fine with me
I don't care let's get on with the
testing so we've got the heater going in
now it's going to dry off that power
supply but in the meantime we're going
to use the AK bell whereas it's finally
time to see if this thing boots up I now
have a chance
all right I don't know what happened
there but it turned itself on and let's
see if we get a signal out of this GTX
780 uh huh yeah we got 130 dollar GTX
780 oh okay this time around we are just
going to see if this thing actually just
makes this van spin here essentially
meaning it's just booting up on a basic
boot so just get our key here
come on Carson yes yes okay all right
cool so we basically have water in here
and we dried it out and Wow
I mean this speaks lengths for FSP group
I mean they got some good protection
built into their towels place at the
very least but anyway let's move over to
a conclusion so in conclusion there you
have it I have to think I was I don't
know really unlucky or really blessed I
mean maybe that power supply cutting out
due to the water leak was a way of
cutting the graphics card out before it
sustained any damage that's the only way
I can think of it because what are the
chances of water leaking in a house the
size of my house now
in just the hole in the power supply so
anyway guys at the end of the day we
have now a working GTX 780 that if you
guys look for a graphics card you see it
is not working and you see that it looks
pretty good and it doesn't smell then
maybe you can take a gamble as well but
keep in mind not all the time it will
work but if it does work you're going to
get extremely good value for money like
I have here and the good thing is it
does have a really good aftermarket
cooling solution on it and another good
thing is the GTX 780 benchmarks can we
now begin so that's it for me today guys
if you enjoyed this video then you know
what to do hit that like button if you
have any questions or comments about the
GTX 780 and the leaking water in my
house that almost calls my power supply
to blow out then be sure to drop a
comment in the comment section below and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
and in the meantime if you haven't
already hit that like button and
subscribe to tech yeah sitting I'll
catch you in the next video very soon
peace out for now bye don't worry the
CPU is already the bottom of the tea
tastes terrible oh my god
