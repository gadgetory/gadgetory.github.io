seven 1700 X review which is the second
best CPU from a and these are seven
lineup
it is 399 USD or 569 AUD and it's eight
quarts and 16 threads of AMD K 17
architecture so I'm sure you guys have a
lot of questions for example what is the
IPC like how does it perform and how
does it overclock well let's answer all
those questions here today welcome back
to texting today we're going to run
through this CPU the good the bad and
the mediocre and we will start with the
good it is currently coming very close
to Broadwell a IPC almost identical at
least from my testing and about seven
percent behind Intel's latest cabbie
Lake though four o'clock this CPU at
least a 1700 X clocks to 3.5 gigahertz
on all caused out of the box so what
about those clock speeds well for the r7
1700 x8 cluster 3.5 gigahertz on all
course out of the box then I managed to
overclock it to three point eight five
gigahertz which if the standard stone
scales relatively the same when
comparing it to the 7700 K that out of
the box is four point five gigahertz and
goes to five gigahertz when overclocked
though let's run the benchmarks with a
lot of them being overclocked as that's
what I am baby and enthusiast is likes
overclocking also keep in mind these are
deliberate CPU intense benchmarks
designed to stress those cause rather
than the GPU
so lots of testing was done to get an
insight into how the CPU really works
and the productivity benchmark showed
just how kick off this CPU really is
especially for the price though when we
start to look at those gaming figures it
is very weird to see that Rison is
falling behind a little and it seems
like the productivity IPC isn't scaling
to games why this is is anyone's guess
at the moment more testing will have to
be done before anyone can say for
certain what it is the way will stress
this for most games on most GPUs and
especially if you are stressing the GPU
gaming will be absolutely fine it's just
at the exact same clock settings with
the exact memory speeds on even the
exact same memory - I'm getting figures
that differ by quite a lot in some games
power consumption is pretty good and
temperatures were fine on both CPU and
VRM also the risin AM for platform is
still very infant so overclocking memory
speeds and also settings like USB ports
dropping and with particular settings
get occurred but again this should all
be resolved in the coming weeks memory
speeds are also a factor to consider the
max I could get my memory to was 2,400
megahertz at 1314 1436 one and there was
no option to change the command rate
hence I think while I wasn't able to
achieve higher memory speeds on this
board though it could indeed also be a
weak IMC on my r7 1700 X memory speeds
did account for a slight difference in
some tests I did going from 2133
megahertz to 2400 megahertz though again
i retested this on the same intel side
of things with the same speed and
considering the bandwidth results were
very similar in those tests the memory
speeds can't explain the majority of
those differences out of the box from
rising CPUs have AMD sense mi technology
which is meant to adjust the clock
speeds automatically depending on your
cooling solution I think this is also
relative to the motherboard you have to
and it's vrm though I found in
real-world testing I did manage to see
clock as high as three point nine five
gigahertz in Hardware monitor though I
actually believe these clocks would not
realize in any real-world testing as a
single thread Cinebench test scores
showed it's still capping at its default
Oh point five gigahertz but and gaming
frame rates was still lower compared to
the three point eight five gigahertz
overclock in the particular games was a
three point nine five gigahertz
overclock appeared so stay tuned as I
will be releasing an overclocking and
tuning tutorial for Rison very shortly
but when it comes to overclock it was a
very different beast altogether and I
have to say it was a lot of fun working
with this CPU it is something very new
and also it's for the cool the
compatibility latch down coolers should
fit no problem that bolt down coolers
will most likely not fit and will still
need a new bracket from the cooler
manufacturers which should be getting
delivered for free if you purchased the
cooler from that said manufacturer it
should also be noted that although I did
dip tie the cooler down temperatures
were not a problem at all with me
topping out of 53 degrees max which was
actually better than some others who had
air coolers ashtag you can do anything
with a zip tie and now its verdict time
and the rising CPUs are of course
excellent value for money especially
when it comes to productivity and these
CPUs will handle the outpaces 6800 K in
value for money and get around sixty
nine hundred K levels of performance for
half or even less than half the price
the gaming performance however was a bit
behind with the 7700 K handily beating
it in every title I tested here with
some figures that left me scratching my
head the 6800 K also beat it for gaming
and these are the two CPUs where
currently the r7 lineup is going
head-to-head with so if you are a tech
enthusiast and gaming is your priority
then maybe it is better to wait for the
r5 or r3 line up to see what price
performance that brings to the table or
of course if you are building a
workstation then Rises certainly offers
amazing price performance some
last-minute things to native nvme
support works fine on this motherboard
the asrock gaming k4x 370 and the speeds
of the USB 3 and nvme drives were also
on point so everything checks out there
guys if you enjoyed this video to be
sure to hit that like button if you
dislike the video and be sure to pop a
dislike in there and let me know in the
comment section below
was the result what you expected from
the r7 1700 X firstly I'm a little bit
disappointed with the gaming performance
but the productivity performance is
definitely there anyway guys I'll catch
you in another tech videos very soon
please now for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
