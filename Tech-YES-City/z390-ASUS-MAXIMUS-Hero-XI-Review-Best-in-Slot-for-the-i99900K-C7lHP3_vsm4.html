ASUS Maximus six here our formula a step
up from the Z 370 Maximus hero 5 that
you may already have since this is a
flagship board we will be putting it
through a lot of different tests and
telling you guys if it's worthy of that
flagship title without aside let's get
straight into the meat and potatoes of
this review
walking back to Tokyo sitting right here
is a 10 faves BRM design implemented on
this board using vishay silicon ax si
six seven three nine dual stage MOSFETs
now I couldn't find a whole lot of info
on these MOSFETs but I will say when it
comes to overclocking and the real-world
results this is where it really matters
and honestly this board has done better
than any Z 370 board as well as doing
better than other Z 390 counterparts
when I tested it with a particular CPU
that puts out a lot of heat and it did
so well to the point where it was using
less power
it was also getting good overclock and
keeping them stable at certain levels
for the chokes they've implemented 60
amp solutions and then after that you've
got your niche akan FP 10k capacitors on
board which will do a mighty fine job
for whatever you need it to do
especially if you're on air or water
overclocks
this thing is not gonna have a problem
at all right beside that 8 pin you've
also got an additional 4 pin to give the
CPU extra power if it's so needs it move
you through the board itself you've got
8 PWM fan headers as well as one 3 pin
for a water cooler so 9 fan headers in
total we've also got to RGB outs for 4
pins and also to RGB outs for the three
pin solutions as this we've also
implemented a power button as well as a
doctor debug LED light which is great
for LN to overclock is on the rear of
the board you also get the clear CMOS
button and the switch BIOS for the dual
bias implemented on this board and then
when it comes to the ddr4 memory
overclocks they say they support up to
40 400 megahertz
unfortunately the memory I had on here
only went up to 3,700 megahertz I
couldn't test past that because I don't
have extreme overclocking tools and also
really good memory to test that but in
terms of overclocking the memory it did
the best again out of any board that
I've had here in terms of overclocking
that particular set of memory and then
glancing a little bit further down the
board you've got your implementation of
the ROG heatsink which can be controlled
with the Ora software and you can even
control that in the boss itself setting
in different modes if you don't wish to
install the software on Windows the
shroud at the top will also glow with
RGB lighting so you do have two
different zones here on the board itself
besides that we've got three PCI 16x
slots although only the top one itself
is true 16 slot the one below that is
eight times and then there's one at the
bottom
four times and if it's one thing I do
have to pick a bone with the Z 390 in
general which is not a Zeus's fault is
that they've only included 1/16 speed
slot I'd like to see the CPUs themselves
support more lanes and also the
motherboards have 216 speed slot
solutions so you can then link up to RTX
28 ET is for example in 32 times for
both those graphics cards there's also
an additional three 1x lots of PCIe
coverage as well as having two nvme PC a
3.0 4 speed slots that do have heat
sinks on both the slots themselves when
testing the bottom and the primary slot
for this we notice the temperatures do
go down quite a bit on the heatsink
itself we had 48 degrees when running a
100 gigabyte stress test and with the
heatsink off it was 91 degrees on the
thermal imaging camera also on the
software we reported 61 degrees versus
92 degrees itself so this heatsink is
doing a great job of cooling down nvme
to flash-based storage devices however
moving over to the right of the board
with the supreme FX audio solution a lot
of you guys tell me you love the audio
testing that gets done around takia city
and so analyzing this solution here
they've got a 192 kilohertz 24 bit ADC
solution implemented and then also for
the audio out you've got 32 bit 192
kilohertz solution that's what these
supported rates but also when we're
testing the audio itself for things like
the frequency response curve especially
in something that normal people will
listen to we've noticed that the
roll-off here below 7 Hertz was only
like 1.4 decibels and then the frequency
response curve after that was incredibly
flat so this is a phenomenal
implementation of onboard audio the mic
import itself also had a noise
suppression that was clearly visible
when we turned it up to a hundred volume
30 plus 30 dB you can see that there was
a little spike when we tried to change
it which does indicate that there is
noise suppression but it will give you a
clearer signal just don't use it for
professional recordings but if you're
using it for gaming your mates are going
to be able to hear you absolutely fine
with no noise whatsoever move over to
the left and right channel balance we
had only a point one to point two
decibel difference between the left and
right channel which is again is
phenomenal values and then
- crosstalk numbers they were - 80db and
lower and this is the thing with the
volume here the volume is quite strong
stronger than previous generations of
motherboards so you will be out of power
pretty hungry headphones that need that
extra power but also after the volume
level of 90 just like a lot of other
solutions there is a slight bit of
crosstalk leaked into the right channel
this is a very common problem I guess on
the ELC Realtek 12:20 solution that a
lot of multiple manufacturers implement
on their motherboards
don't a nutshell if you're getting this
motherboard for the audio just set the
volume to 90 or below and you'll have
happy days before we get back to the
overclocking and also the BIOS will
quickly take a look at the rear
input/output eight USB slots one of
those being a Type C DisplayPort and
HDMI port outs ps2 out as well as the
clear CMOS and BIOS switch buttons as we
mentioned before you've got a wireless
solution ac included which comes with
its own antenna tested the speeds of the
on-board it included Nick and that was
fine all the way up to 1 gigabit per
second as well as having manual 5.1
surround and an optical output which I
hope motherboard manufacturers never get
rid of this port I absolutely love it
anyway overclocking now let's roll
things back now to the overclocking and
as I said before I can only talk about a
CPU which put out a lot of heat at this
very point in time and this motherboard
the vrm and the heatsink the heatsink
weighs about 300 grams and when we
looked at it with the vrm thermal
imaging camera with an overclock on a
particular CPU at a particular speed we
managed to see that the vrm was going
around 50 degrees this was out of the
box the veeram itself was only going up
manually on the thermal imaging camera
to around 56 degrees so this was
phenomenal performance on this
implementation from a Zeus as well as
the power efficiency being very good
when I compared it to other boards here
so they've definitely got things right
in terms of the magic behind the
implementation of the hardware on this
board itself but women move on to the
BIOS this is where things really don't
need to get any better
Zeus his implementation of their bias
has all the features you would want for
overclocking LLC levels as well as
recommendations as well as preset
overclocks for memory and also
overclocking - things like a
five units they've got that included too
so in a nutshell itself the Z 390
Maximus hero 6 is definitely going to be
the board you'll want to get if you want
flagship performance now keep in mind
this thing will come at a premium I
actually don't know the official pricing
yet but expect it to be maybe slightly
more than the current Z 370 Maximus 5
which currently goes for around about
300 us in Australia about 400 Ozzy and I
really can't fault this board for
anything in particular maybe other than
the price performance which on a premium
flagship motherboard you're always going
to pay a premium so everything from the
onboard audio to the vrm to the bios
feature set it's all practically perfect
and a Zeus do get this right they know
what they're doing when it comes to
making motherboards and without a sight
I hope you guys enjoyed this review of
the Maximus 6 hero if you did them sure
to hit that like button also stay tuned
on this channel for more coverage with
XIII 90s and particular CPUs they are
coming up I look forward to reading your
comments and opinions as always in the
comment section below but also on that
note let us know what you think of this
motherboard and also let us know what
you think of the whole Z 390 release and
chipset and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon he's out for now
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
