asked me to mix things up a little bit
and do some top 5 videos more
pacifically
a top 5 monitors for the money video and
so today I'm going to bring that exact
video to you guys
so coming in at number 5 is the VG 2 for
8qe from a Zeus now this monitor can
support up to a hundred and forty four
Hertz refresh rate so it's a very quick
monitor also another thing to remember
low input lag and you've also got the TN
panel there for fast response times so
when you're going with those high
refresh rates you want fast response
times as well and for under $300 this
monitor is certainly going to give you a
good gaming experience if you like high
refresh rates so coming in at number
four is the ace of g2 5:7 hates you this
is a 25 inch panel that's recently hit
the market and Wow I mean it's a 1440p
IPS panel that's coming in for $300 now
the benefits of this panel is that it's
one of the fastest IPS panels out there
I think it is the fastest IPS panel out
there at the moment so you're gonna get
pretty much no ghosting as well as an
absolute beautiful picture for 1440p
gaming at $300 so coming in at number 3
is the Dell P 2 2 1 4 H also it's big
brothers of p2 for one plate if you can
pick it up for under $200 now these
monitors again for under $200 you're
getting an IPS panel you're also getting
not just that you're getting a fast
panel as well the response times for an
IPS panel are pretty damn good I
recently tested one of these things and
I was pretty impressed by it the input
lag is some of the lowest input lag I've
ever seen on a TFT monitor though one
thing to keep in mind is just beware if
you get one with cross-hatching as I did
and since I returned mine I'm still
gonna be recommending because a lot of
my viewers actually said that they
didn't have this cross-hatching
issue and since I love listening to my
viewers more than anything and so I'm
gonna be giving this monitor a
recommendation today so coming in at
number 2 other monitors I use personally
in the background these are the 27-inch
Sack was from company called crossover
from a seller called dream seller on
ebay now he does have a pixel perfect
option for around about $300 which I
recommend you take I think the non
option is $10 cheaper but if you take
the risk and you get one of these panels
and it works out then the rewards are
going to be
huge these have an a h IPS panel from LG
and man the panel is so beautiful the
colors just pop in your face it's the
most beautiful panel for a computer
monitor that I've seen in my life
now that being said the response times
and the input lag not as good as the
other monitors I've mentioned here today
but they're still very good like we're
all in the really good section already
so it's in that section don't worry but
another thing to remember is that this
thing comes really accurately calibrated
out of the factory as well so you won't
have to play with colors too much as
both these panels I have here are really
close to being perfectly calibrated
coming in at number one is the Bank URL
two four five five H M so this thing
comes in at a hundred and seventy
dollars and for the money you're getting
a really good gaming monitor especially
for competitive gaming it's got instant
mode which pretty much gives it zero
input lag and then it's got one of the
best ten panels in there in terms of
response times it's got really low
response times so if a competitive
gaming this thing is the way to go
especially for a hundred and seventy
dollars so Bank you definitely get the
nod for number one so that's it for
today guys though I'm sure there's a lot
of other good panels out there this is
just the panels that I've either used
personally or I get a lot of feedback
from my viewers about so I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please get

insights or thoughts then drop a comment
