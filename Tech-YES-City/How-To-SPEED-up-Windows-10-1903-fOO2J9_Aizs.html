been asking me a lot for a Windows 10
optimization guide and with the recent
release of update 1903 that's exactly
what we're going to do here today with
an older CPU - so I'm using an i7 2600
it's only got a gigabytes of RAM so if
anything these optimizations are gonna
make a bigger difference the older and
more slower your hardware is though will
that aside before you even install
Windows make sure if you're updating
from a previous version of Windows that
you don't have a USB storage device
connected or an SD card as that will
cause an error but on top of that when
you're doing a fresh install make sure
you uncheck and decline these settings
at the start I'll show you the list and
with that aside let's get straight into
the meat and potatoes of this guide to
make that Windows 10 optimized with some
tech yes loving that's basically where
we're gonna speed it up and make
everything snappy and lightning fast
so now that we're on the desktop here
the first thing that we're gonna do is
right click on these icons unless you
use the windows man or leave it on but I
like to clean things up straight away so
unpin from taskbar and of course I
usually like to install Google Chrome or
opera if I've got a higher-end system on
still opera if I've got a sort of like a
semi potato that we've got here today
then I'll leave chrome on right click
though talk to Cortana right click this
and then left click show Cortana button
and it's a really good addition now we
don't have to disable our search bar
from Cortana in this new update now
another good thing is you'll notice
straight away there's a new background
and this is to let you know that your
updated to 1903 in the past Windows
updates I don't really know what version
I've on I've actually had to go manually
check because they've always left the
background the same but this is a good
thing they're changing the background so
after that we can now go to the bottom
right hand corner here left click on the
little arrow right click on onedrive and
then left click on settings and then
left click on the settings up here and I
like to not start onedrive automatically
when I sign into Windows left click ok
and then go back down again right-click
it and then close onedrive this is so we
can uninstall it later but if you use
onedrive make sure you leave it enabled
now the next I'm gonna do is right-click
down the bottom here on the taskbar
setting left click that and while we're
down here I like to left-click on the
combine taskbar buttons and then
left-click on never this basically just
assures that nothing gets cluttered up
here down the bottom and everything I
can see every app that's open every
browser that's open but then from here
we can actually move up the list and go
through and take off all these settings
I mean if you like these settings leave
them on but again I'm making things
snappier making things faster and then
we can also left-click up on the
lockscreen here and then go down to the
Cortana setting which is left click on
this Cortana lock screen setting and
then we can go down to here use Cortana
even when my device is locked so left
click that turn it off we can then hit
the X arrow here and then right click
here go back to the taskbar setting
because there's no actual back arrow
there so it's pretty annoying so we've
got to go back to this tab buyer this
way
and then left click on the colors here
and go down to transparency effects and
turn this off this is important if
you're on an older machine obviously if
you've got a more powerful rig you may
wish to leave this on to have a fancy
looking windows but essentially now a
start manual also have solid background
colors as well as our taskbar down the
bottom here but now we can move now back
to the Home tab so left click on home
and we'll be greeted I like to maximize
this by clicking that little tab there
and we can go through each of these
settings individually so starting off
with system now you can see here I'm on
a 4k display and I've got to leave the
icons really big so we don't want to
touch any of that but nightlight
settings it's important to talk about
this because it currently is a little
bit buggy if you want to turn this on
you can try your luck and schedule it to
your nightlight but I believe it does
have an update as I tried it before and
it was a little bit buggy but moving
down now through sound there's nothing
really to change he had notifications
and actions I like to turn all these off
if you get something out of these
notification settings and you know that
you need them then definitely leave them
on there moving through now focus assist
this is pretty important because if
you've ever played a game and you've
changed resolutions it'll pop up with
this annoying alert like I'll fix your
blurry applications I'm gonna turn this
to alarms only and then I'm gonna turn
all these off here from being an alarm
and so essentially this will not show me
any of those annoying pop-ups anymore
because I don't have anything set to pop
up now next up in the line we've got
power and sleep settings this is very
important if you are on a laptop if
you're on a laptop or a tablet
definitely leave these as they can
seriously drain your battery faster than
what it would be used to but we want to
left-click here we want to left-click on
high-performance mode and make sure
that's on so usually on a laptop or any
other computer you'll have balanced on
but we're gonna left click here
high-performance click on change plan
settings and then go to change advanced
power settings and make sure the hard
drive here is set to 0 as well as the
desktop background settings is check to
pause on top of that we can also go down
to sleep timers and make sure that we're
disabling hibernate as well and this is
important for later when we want to
some SSD storage but moving through the
list we can then left-click on storage
and going down here go to optimize
drives and we want to go to here to
scheduled optimization change settings
and we want a left-click and turn all
these settings off here because this
will free up a background process where
it automatically schedules drives and if
you're playing a game it can get
annoying of course I'm stuttering
potentially especially if you're in a
clutch situation which you don't want
happening now on top of that it is
important to note that you may wish to
defragment your drives or trim them by
using this feature so definitely come
back in here every few months and I use
these settings analyze and optimize
because otherwise your drives will get a
little bit slow over time where the
space will get fragmented and the
storage performance will suffer but that
aside let's move down to tablet mode we
can ignore that because there's nothing
in here unless you're on a tablet of
course left clicking on multitask will
bring up snap windows and also show
suggestions on timeline I like to turn
these both off that's how I use Windows
I'm not a big fan of snapping some
people love it it personally triggers me
a little bit because I'm pretty precise
in how I like my windows moving now to
shared experiences we can left-click
turn that off we don't need that
clipboard though this is a setting
that's new on Windows 1903 and I
personally love it if we turn this on
and then we hit the windows V key we've
now got our clipboard history where if
we're copy pasting many things it'll
have all those copy paces selected so
you don't have to use now the last copy
paste so for instance if you go to your
bank details and you're sending them to
someone else you then copy them
individually and then pick and select
them quickly from this clipboard menu so
very handy to have I actually like to
leave that on so we're actually turning
something on for once which is rare but
after that we can then go back to the
home setting and move across the devices
and there's not a whole lot to do here
except down in the pen and windows ink
setting we can then click on left click
on that and then left click on show
recommended app suggestions just turn
that off left click on home and move now
back to phone but we can skip phone if
you're not signed into a Microsoft
account which you can see here
I'm not so if you are on a Microsoft
account there may be some settings in
there that you want to disable it's up
to you your mileage may vary on that one
we're moving now across the network and
Internet and going down to the VPN tab
we can left-click that and then turn off
these two services here now if you're on
something like Nord VPN or some other
VPN service they've got their own
separate applications they shouldn't
conflict with these settings though if
you are having problems getting your VPN
to work you may wish to turn these back
on again I've never had a problem
turning these off and using a separate
VPN client but that's my personal
experience and now we can left click on
home and we can move and skip
personalization because we did cover
that in the intro when we're right
clicking down on the task bar here but
moving now across to left clicking on
apps and apps and features this is
always a big one because we've got so
much crap that we can uninstall and this
time around with windows 1903 they've
enabled you to uninstall even more crap
which is actually a pretty good thing so
we're gonna go through here and just
uninstall a heap of different stuff
obviously things to not uninstall are
your video card drivers so make sure you
don't understood that and if you use
Skype for example you may wish to not
uninstall that but I use that on a
smartphone so it's not a problem
so let's quickly go through this speed
it up a little bit
uninstall all the crap you can copy my
settings if you want to and you use it
like me but let's go through and quickly
get this done
and there we go we've done with absent
features now moving over to default apps
if you've got something like Google
Chrome you can manually set that in here
which I'll be doing after this video and
then moving down to offline maps we can
delete all the maps delete all and then
go down here to automatically update
maps that little cheeky bugger there we
can disable him and that's another
cheeky bugger noise in the background
moving down to apps for websites we can
turn these off these are background
things that we don't need
video playback should be ok and startup
we can left-click and get this
notification off because it's just
annoying left click back on the home
setting there and now moving across to
time and language we can skip accounts
because I only use my admin account on
Windows 10 oh that's the way it's always
been but it's that time automatically we
can see here that it's actually setting
a different time zone for me so I'm
gonna see if it automatically sets my
time zone to Australia and then way what
I can do after that is uncheck these and
quickly get the right time and you can
see here it didn't work this time so
since I'm in Australia I can then go
down manually set my time zone and leave
those settings off especially the set
time automatically because that's a
background service that's going to be
going on chewing up ever so small amount
of performance which is the whole point
of this guide every little bit we can
get we will get but keep in mind though
one negative of this is that it will off
sync over time so you may be a minute
slower or a minute ahead depending on
how it works but on that we can now move
back left click on the Home tab and move
across to the gaming tab where I like to
pretty much disable all the options in
all these five tabs here so going down
to game bar we can left-click that turn
that off and then moving down to
captures same story where we're left
clicking on this and we can left-click
that and just turn this off here to 30
minutes so making sure everything is
just off the lowest standard and
broadcasting left click that and make
sure that is turned off as well and then
game mode and
turning this off now game modes one of
those things where I've tested in the
past of benchmark did and it literally
hasn't made a difference in performance
between having it on and off so it's one
of those sort of what they call placebo
things I think where I haven't noticed
any difference even on very slow
machines to so after we've disabled all
that the networking we don't have to
worry about that tab we can then
left-click on home and then move across
now to ease of access we're right here
we can left-click from display show
animations in windows and automatically
whole hide scroll bars in Windows like
to disable that and we can leave show
desktop background image on because then
your desktops not gonna have any
character or personality and moving
along here cursor and pointer and
magnifier we can leave a lot of these
settings alone even than the radar tab
but I do like to disable the shortcut
key from the raita tab so I don't
accidentally turn this narrator on by
mistake so I do like to uncheck a lot of
these boxes because I never used
narrator in general if you do use the
narrator then you may wish to leave all
this on but I just like to uncheck it
all and make sure it's not popping up
and causing any problems which I think
if you left click sorry if you just
press shift a heap of times it'll bring
up some annoying display as well but
don't do it you're just gonna get a
headache but from here we can then go
back to the Home tab and move over to
search left click that but from here we
want to turn off windows cloud search
and also my device history as well as
left clicking clear my device history
and that should make it a little bit
better but there's a new feature here
and that's the enhanced search so if
you've got a really powerful machine and
you like using the search bar a lot then
you can change that to enhance but I
like to leave it on classic I've never
had a problem with using the classic
search bar but after that we can left
click on home and then go back now to
the privacy tab left click on that and
it's got a lot of options to disconnect
and take off so in general we can
generally go through and just left click
all these take them all off inking and
typing personalization I like to turn
that off diagnostics and feedback it's
now set to basic by default which is
good and moving down we can delete left
click
and on the feedback frequency we can
then left-click this and go to never
and also the recommended troubleshooting
make sure you leave that on ask me
before fixing problems so it prompts you
and says hey do you want to fix this and
you can choose because sometimes windows
can get it wrong after this Wingo left
click on activity history
left click storm activity history on
this device and also clear activity
history and then from here we can now go
down to app permissions which is pretty
important because some of these you're
going to want to keep on some of these
you are going to want to disable for
instance location is disabled by default
but moving from here we may wish to
leave camera on and also microphone
especially if you're using Skype discord
or other things like that they can rely
on these app permissions to be on and in
the case of if you disable them then you
could have some problems with those
applications so do leave these two on
but after that voice activation I like
to turn this off moving through
notification account info same thing
just turning all these things off all
the way down to other devices where
after that we've now got background apps
and this is pretty important because
this is the apps that run in the
background I like to just turn all this
off personally but if you do use
Microsoft edge for example and you
listen to music on YouTube and you've
got that in the background then you may
wish to disable all these but that
particular app for example so what we've
got here is just giving you an example
if you had edge installed if you use the
Spotify app here we can then just leave
that one on but again I don't use any of
these on my main desktop machine so I
just turn them all off and then left
clicking on app Diagnostics we can then
turn this off here allow apps to access
your other apps and automatic file
downloads same thing moving through
documents left click that turn it off
pictures I like to turn this off to
videos it's the same thing and then file
systems same thing again
turn that off after we're done here we
can left-click back to home and now
we're on the last tab here for Windows
settings update and security left click
on this and the most important one and a
big change here in Windows Update is the
way Windows Update works so one windows
home you can pause the update for up to
35 days I think I'm
you can pause it for up to 365 days but
in this case windows update I like to
just change the active hours and I like
to set this from in the morning till
midday so we see here I changing it to
midday that's in the morning I generally
don't play any games in the morning so I
don't have a problem if my computer
stutters a little bit but if you're
playing games in the morning or whatever
you want to change this to the hours
where you're not gaming so Windows
Update can't potentially come in and
effect when you're in the middle of a
game and that can potentially cause
stutter and obviously cause you to lose
the match but there's also automatically
adjust active hours based on your
activity so if you're not doing much it
can then update windows in those times
where it knows you're not doing much but
at the same time this is then enabling a
service in the background which I don't
like personally so getting back to this
update and security tab we can then now
go down to delivery optimization and we
can make sure that this is a setting
that I like to leave on because all my
pcs in my local network here they can
all share the updates and that saves me
from downloading them to on the internet
but do make sure your PC is not on this
setting here otherwise you'll literally
become a torrent for the rest of people
who need in the world Windows updates so
after this we go down a Windows security
some important features here that I like
to disable personally left clicking on
that and then left clicking on virus and
threat protection we can then go into
this tab and then go down to virus um
threat protection settings left click
manage settings and I like to turn off
this here cloud delivered protection and
then under that also I like to turn off
tamper protection this is a pretty
controversial one because I believe this
has to do with the recent zombie load
and the other meltdown inspector things
that are happening with CPUs on intel
side me personally I've never ran into a
problem with it I honestly think it's
just a way to nerf performance on your
PC and especially if you're gaming I'm
gonna test this setting in some upcoming
benchmarks so stay tuned for that but
tamper protection I'd turn it off and
unless of course you're on a cloud and
there's some dude who has an IQ of 200
and he could potentially hack your money
out of your bank account if you like me
you don't have a whole lot then I don't
think you're gonna be too concerned but
after that there is a new ransomware
setting as well which I believe is off
by default but as we go back here left
click on this little shield
and move down we can see manage
ransomware protection and it's off by
default so if you're prone for instances
mum and dad are at your home and they
click on a lot of crappy links you may
wish to turn this on and could save you
a big headache in the future so after
that we're now finished with the windows
security tab and that's also makes us
finished with the windows setting tab so
we can right click and close that down
but also now we can move on to a pretty
important one it's one that I like to do
and that's left click on the search bar
down here type in services left click
that open that up and what this is going
to do so I like to maximize it here by
clicking that little link I like to
organize these by name which they
already are
but I also like to organize them by
running and so essentially what this
does is that shows us all the
applications that are running so we can
quickly go down for instance to
connected user experiences in telemetry
we can right click this left click
properties left click the startup type
go to disabled apply and then stop and
then ok that's the first of the services
the three services that we're going to
disable here next up we can go down to
distributed link tracking client and do
the exact same thing disable that apply
left click stop and then the last one
it's one that I haven't disabled before
but if again if you're on a touch laptop
or a touch base tablet then you may wish
to leave this running but I'm on a
desktop where I don't use any touch so
I'm going to right-click this go to
properties and disable it even though it
says it's manual it's running for some
reason at the moment so I don't want it
to run but it can't stop it but at least
we disable it it's not going to boot up
the next time we start up windows so
there are three services I'm disabling
we can left-click that and now since
we're in our high-performance mode
some other tweaks and settings we can do
is go down to CMD type that in right
click here and run as administrator now
if you're on a laptop you don't want to
do this again because this is
essentially freeing up the space that is
reserved for hibernation and since we've
on high performance mode and we don't
let our computer hibernate we then free
up some space on an SSD by typing in
power CFG - H off and then hit enter and
that will free up some space but moving
back down to the desktop now the last
few things we have to do is left-click
on file explorer and then be a Dora and
left-click on view
Dora the Explorer that's a little joke
I'm trying to Mac wack in here mid
Windows 10 optimization but go over to
options change folder and then we go
over here to view and there's two things
we want to disable and that's show sync
provider notifications as well as
turning off you sharing wizard if you
use the sharing wizard don't uncheck it
but I never use it so I'm gonna click
apply turn those two things off and then
the final thing to do is go down the
search bar and go type in MS config left
click system configuration go over to
boot and click no GUI boot click apply
click OK
exit without restart because we're gonna
go down to this little bottom left-hand
corner again and we're gonna type in
system and we're gonna press spacebar I
for some reason this is the only way I
that quickly brings it up for me so
system I and then we can from here
settings we can left click system this
brings up our old school system tab and
from here we can left click advanced
system settings and then from here we go
to performance left click settings and
here we're essentially going to make the
OS interaction a lot snappy oh this
really isn't gonna increase performance
a whole lot but for me it just makes the
experience so much more snappy err
so you guys can follow me here and
uncheck all the options that I uncheck
and this will still keep Windows looking
really good but we'll just make it that
much more snappy err
so click apply click ok go back here now
startup and recovery left click on the
settings and
time to display list of operating
systems make sure that's unchecked and
then click OK so that'll make Windows
boot up just that little bit faster
system protection we want to make sure
this is off which is is in this case and
then we go over to remote left click
this left click advanced take off allow
this computer to be controlled remotely
click OK and then left click this as
well this one's pretty important if
again you've got mom and dad who don't
know anything about computers they're
using your computer for instance dad man
around tokyo city he sometimes uses a
computer and doesn't know anything he's
doing clicking on stupid links this is
just making sure he doesn't get scammed
and no control his computer and sees
bank account details for example so left
click ok and we're good to go
from that tab itself and with that aside
that pretty much concludes the windows
1903 optimization guide I hope you guys
have enjoyed this one also stay tuned
for another video where we're talking
about all the changes with 1903 all the
cool new features this guide in
particular is just for speeding it up
making it snappy er disabling all the
things for desktop high-performance
users who don't want any delays want the
best experience possible and another
thing too about this guide another good
thing and another reason why I know a
lot of you guys come to us for this
guide is because you can reverse a lot
of the settings and changes that are
made within this tutorial because I know
in the past there's other guides out
there that have done reg header
hacks and deleted things and they're
usually non reversible so you can't
reverse those changes and a lot of the
times if you had come into a problem
you'll have to reinstall windows
entirely with this guide here you can
reverse pretty much everything I've done
here today so if you come into a problem
with a certain app and then go back and
sort of backtrack some of the changes
you've made and you won't have to
reinstall windows which can take a lot
of time especially if you've set things
up the way you like it
and with that aside if you guys have
lastly any optimizations and tweaks of
your own in regards to 1903 and they're
really good be sure to add them in the
comment section below and if they're
good enough and they get enough upvotes
they'll be sure to add them in the
description for you guys to and with all
that out of the way if you're enjoying
the content enough umos to consider sub
and hitting that Bell notification so
you get the videos the
they drop and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
