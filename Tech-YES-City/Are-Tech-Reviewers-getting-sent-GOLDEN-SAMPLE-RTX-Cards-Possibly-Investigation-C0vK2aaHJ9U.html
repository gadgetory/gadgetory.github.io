also the press been getting sent golden
sample r-tx
and GTS gravis cards well today we're
gonna be exploring this question more in
depth where we have a retail sample for
an RT x 2060 this is the cheapest card I
could find in Australia on a sale on
eBay I got it for a little over 500
Aussie dollars which would be roughly
close to around the retail price in the
USA and then besides that the RT X 2070
here which is a review sample sent from
Nvidia we have an RT X 27 T retail Galax
ample which is currently the cheapest in
Australia as well coming a little bit
under 700 Aussie dollars or at least
that's what I got it for then this one
here was the card that we used in the
original comparison against the RT X
2070 versus the RT X 2060 if you guys
haven't seen that video I'll put the
link up here for you where a lot of you
guys said in the comments that this RT X
2060 looked like it was underperforming
and so I went back and double-checked
the numbers and Metro Exodus definitely
was standing out as giving odd results
but some people in the comments were
saying that this game was giving out odd
results to begin with but I then sent
Galax an email and said look this card
could possibly have some weird results
so they decided to send us out another
r-tx 2060 for this video for the
comparisons so let's put all these cards
on the test bench and then come back and
see if the press have been getting sent
those golden samples
so I finished up testing all yesterday
at night and I was benchmarking in
double-checking results and this gave me
the answers that I really needed to know
so I'll be dropping the yes man happy
used parts Cape hunt act and I'm gonna
be putting on the serious face new parts
investigation for you guys and the
answers I really needed to get came from
these two graphics cards right here the
galaxy x models
ones a black edition ones a white
edition they're the exact same card at
the core exact same coolers one just got
a wide aesthetic and they even share the
same v bios so when I put this card in
after this black card it actually
recognized it as the exact same graphics
card and even applied the same
overclocks
that I left when I took this out and
this is really interesting because as we
go through some of the results here we
can see that this white variant here is
actually performing pretty close to this
gigabyte edition here which is a retail
sample one that comes in around MSRP and
some of the results were really really
crazy especially Far Cry 5 where we look
at this Galax Black Edition here clearly
coming out well in front of even the
overclocked gigabyte retail sample and
then we look at the power consumption
results and we can see that they were in
favor of this black edition here and so
moving through some of the other results
here and I tested these four games of
1440p as you guys have been requesting
we saw this black edition here just give
the retail sample of beat down and its
own white edition variant a beat down as
well apex legends was a similar story I
decided to start testing at water
treatments since I believe this game is
now hard locked at 144 FPS so I tested
again 1440p was a great resolution to
test that to make sure we weren't
hitting that cap and we can see in
tandem that the r-tx 2070 samples I have
here actually are performing very close
to one another there's not too much of a
discrepancy here but these three are TX
2060 samples clearly have some variants
going on Resident Evil doesn't really
show this a whole lot and the synthetics
benchmarks like 3d mark firestrike don't
show this either in fact it has the
retail sample gigabyte card pulling out
ahead of these two galaxy cards and
moving on to time spy extreme
showed similar things but then we moved
back to the games there is a clear
difference so what exactly is going on
here and this is where we're going to
try and answer some questions because
this is the worst I've ever seen it in
the history of benchmarking on my
channel and benchmarking in my life
starting off first you guys are probably
gonna want answers as to why different
reviewers are getting different results
and I believe it has to do with GPU
boost 4.0 versus the previous editions
of GPU boost that was released with ten
series seven series and six series cards
and in that manner this time around it's
worse than it's ever been because the
GPU boost 4.0 isn't just detecting
temperatures and also voltages it's now
detecting the quality of the silicon on
board and boosting that gravis card in
games according to that silicon itself
so in other words yes it's very possible
that the press and your favorite tech
reviewers are getting sent out golden
samples and that is affecting their
benchmarks and sometimes it can be to
the tune of 10 or more percent which is
quite a big sum to skew out results and
also looking back at my 20 60 vs 2070
video the conclusion and the results
don't seem too far-fetched to what you
could expect if you go out and buy a
retail sample of both these cards
so in that case other reviewers could
have got a really good 2060 in and then
got a really lackluster 2070 and that
would show that the 2060 especially when
it's overclocked is catching the 2070
which again as I said I haven't seen
that around the studio here but further
proof of this and things that weird me
out is these cards here perform pretty
much identical in the simulated
benchmarks like fire strike and time spy
extreme but when we look at the power
consumption results they were pretty
much the same as well and the only
indicator that I had to show that these
cards were differing in the gaming
benchmarks was the schools themselves
but also the core clocks that averaged
out in MSI Afterburner this black
edition here was clearly overclocking
better on the core clocks then this
white edition here but from going on
forward from here in every review I do
with these graphics cards especially the
main one in focus I'm gonna be showing
the core clocks averaged out and also
the core clocks averaged out when
they're overclocked those are the two
main factors that will affect
performance
you guys
get an indication of how well this card
is performing compared to other
reviewers cards and then you can check
their results and cross-reference and
say hey he got a bad 2060 or he got a
really good 2060 and that's affecting
the results so that's likely where
you're seeing a lot of these variances
come from and especially I've seen it
myself in the last couple of months
numbers have started being all over the
place as hopefully this gives you guys
some more answers but when we compare it
to a CPU review I think it's even worse
than the press getting sent out ring is
for CPUs and the reason being in those
cpu reviews you can at least see that
every CPU that gets sent out as long as
you turn off that multi-core enhancement
is going to run at the same clock speeds
and so for ninety nine hundred K you can
say okay this guy's getting four point
seven gigahertz out of the box but his
chip is overclocking higher and we can
see that with the 5.1 gigahertz numbers
and that's why it's crucial now to I
guess with GPU reviews now include the
core clocks on what they're averaging
out to when that said person is testing
the games and so if you guys are
scratching your heads I'm gonna throw
another curveball at you and this has
got to do with why I test on the same
day in the same ambient temperatures
with the same driver even though I don't
test as many games as other reviewers or
I don't test as many graphics cards I
always make sure you guys are getting
these same apples-to-apples results on
that particular day although particular
two days across the same drivers and if
we don't do that then we could add even
more variants into the equation for
instance if we're testing on a four one
seven driver or four one a driver and
then testing that against another card
which is running four one nine drivers
and the ambient temperatures were twenty
degrees on the four one nine driver card
versus the four one seven we could see
some results that just balloon out of
control and now I know a lot of the
colleagues on youtube like gamers next
is hardware on box J's to sense all
those guys do their best to give you
guys apples to apples results but
unfortunately firm the results i've seen
here today the silicon lottery is going
to affect GPU benchmark numbers that you
guys are seeing so the best thing to do
from here would be to hopefully test
more retail samples as that's going to
be very indicative of what you guys are
going to get in terms of performance but
on top of that I'd definitely go check
out people like a dog TV who are
analyzed
all the different reviews out there so
you guys can then get a mean from the
average of reviews and you guys I hope
you enjoyed today's video if you did -
be sure to hit that like button also let
us know in the comment section below
what you guys think of GPU boost 4.0 and
now the silicon lottery in my opinion
affecting reviews this is going to be an
interesting topic and I'm actually going
to make this a two-part series we're in
part two I'm going to be testing out
ambient temperatures and fan speeds and
how they can also affect numbers that
you see in reviews and in case of the
r-tx
2070 samples that I had here they
perform pretty much around the same
ballpark so there's nothing to worry
about in terms of variants of the r-tx
2070 numbers you guys have been seeing
here on the channel and this RT x 2070
was a retail sample - so that's good to
see with Galax and speaking of Galax
themselves the one thing I will say is
it's great to know that they're not
sending me out cherry-picks samples as
reference with this white card here this
came in before this black card here so
if they had a need to send me out a
golden sample or they were sending our
golden samples they would have never
sent me out this in the first place so
I'm glad Galax in this case KF a - and
Europe are doing a great job of being an
honest company and I get that vibe when
I go to their events and collaborate
with them anyway guys I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
