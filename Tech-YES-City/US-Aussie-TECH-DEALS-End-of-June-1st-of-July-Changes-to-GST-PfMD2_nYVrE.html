my fellow Aussies and with eBay having a
15% of everything so and also 20% off
some other tag on I thought I would let
you guys know some really good deals and
also talk about the changes coming next
month from 1st of July which is the GST
implementation but it's a little bit
different to what a lot of people think
it is welcome back to tacky-ass City
this is brian coming to you guys today
with some hot deals with people down
under also throwing some deals for
people in the states without further ado
let the show begin
so before we get onto those awesome
deals for the audience there are two
deals that I really like for people over
in the US and the first year is the CF
791 34-inch ultrawide monitor from
Samsung I'm currently using this as my
daily driver and I absolutely love it
100 Hertz refresh rate quantum dot
technology as well helps bring out the
colors a lot better than a standard
monitor and also 21 by 9 aspect ratio so
this thing is gorgeous for a price of
800 us the next and last deal for people
in the states is the Kingston HyperX
cloud Court has that really good headset
and for 50 us it's actually really good
value to Jing gives us for gaming and
you'll still get really good sound
quality for the money one of the very
few gaming headsets that I actually like
so now getting on straight into these
awesome deals we have the rising 5 1600
it's currently $2.99 for 17 postage
however you can use the coupon code
cracker and get 15% off and this will
leave the total for 270 Australian
dollars for this six core which is
overclockable and comes with a cooler
included and if you're looking for a
motherboard for that risin 5 CPU then
you can get the a/b 350 M 404
motherboard from asrock really need
board especially for a hundred and five
dollars shipped to your door so with
this one you usually coupon code see tax
20 and now the graphics card market is
going absolutely crazy at the moment but
this is a really good deal on an MSI GTX
1080 our Morosi Edition so it's
currently 709
five dollars Australian though you can
apply that 15% coupon code cracker and
get this for around about six hundred
and seventy dollars posted extremely
good deal especially if you're looking
for a GTA 1080 and a lot of the 1070 is
in 1080 TI's they're getting snapped up
as well at the moment so if you guys
want a great gaming graphics card one of
the best out there and this is certainly
going to give you an awesome experience
for the money
and now if you need some storage this is
one of the two really hot deals on SSDs
I have here this is the m500 from
crucial and m2 drive and 240 TB bytes if
you apply that coupon code cracker
you'll get this for around about a
hundred dollars shipped to your door
extremely good value for Ozzie's though
if you don't want to go with m dot 2
from crucial then they've got this
transcend 240 gigabyte SSD going for
about a hundred and two dollars after
the coupon code so really good deal on
this SSD as well now if you're not into
desktop PCs and you want something thin
very portable and extremely powerful
than the exuse rogue 17.3 inch laptop is
going for a really good price this is 32
gigabytes of ddr4 memory to one terabyte
of hard drive storage and also 250
gigabyte SSD with a gtx tastic music
gigabyte edition so really quick you
could use this thing for video editing
too since includes a 4 core 8 threaded
CPU and for the money you can pick this
thing up for 2058 australian dollars
after applying the coupon code see tax
20 so if you don't want a laptop for
gaming and something that's a lot
cheaper for doing light work or also
watching movies then you can get the
Toshiba Satellite L 50 for currently 363
Australian dollars after that coupon
code that's really damn cheaper
something has got an i-5 a gigabytes of
memory and also a 750 gigabyte hard
drive in there and the lifestyle have
for the Aussies is a LG 4k 55-inch OLED
TV this is HDR and in my opinion these
are easily the best-looking TVs out
there that look extremely gorgeous and
you can get this for currently 2257
Australian dollars after you use the
coupon code so really loving this deal I
wish I could buy this personally
just can't afford it at the moment also
now there are some changes coming to
eBay from the first of July and this has
to do with GST and the Australian
government now charging eBay GST on
their services so what this means is
essentially if you sell an item and
you're paying eBay eight percent fees
say for instance you buy an item for
$100 you then pay $8 fees to eBay you
now have to pay eight point eight
dollars or eight dollars and 80 cents
fees to eBay so essentially it's just
10% on the actual fees that you pay it's
not actually ten percent on the item
that you're selling say for instance if
you sell it on for $100 you don't
magically have to get $10 for that item
goes to the government so it's not as
bad as it seems though it seems over
time that always we seem to get a little
bit more taken out of our money when we
sell things online anyway guys that's it
for today's deals let us know in the
description below what was your favorite
deal I think that rise in 6-core and
also that GT X 1080 we're really good
and if you like this video be sure to
hit that like button and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
now fan out bye
tomorrow night I'll be releasing my vlog
where I picked up some really cheap
graphics cards so stay tuned for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
