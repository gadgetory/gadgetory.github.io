easy just coming back here today with a
quick video comparing a 23 inch monitor
to a 24 inch monitor now if you're in
the market to buy one of these I suggest
if you can get I mean looking at the
sizes there's not much of a difference
as you can see them the monitor on the
right is an ace a 24 inch gloss panel
the monitor on the left the Samsung 24
23 inch gloss panel and now the Samsung
is it looks a lot better but when I look
at the size differences I do prefer the
24 inch slightly so the only reason I
got the 23 inches because they didn't
have that model in the 24 inch but if we
look at the bezel though the bezel is a
lot bigger on this monitor on the 24
inch Acer so it might look a bit bigger
but the screens probably a little bit
bigger I mean I can see a little bit of
a difference I do prefer the 24 inch in
terms of size to the 23 inch but in
terms of the monitors themselves I
prefer the Samsung a lot better as you
can see the colors are a lot better
there are a lot more brighter and
clearer and the colors on the ice are
really dull not really dull but they're
pretty dull compared to and this is on
brightness on full so the ACE is on full
brightness as a basis Samsung which is
only on 80 brightness if I go to 100
it's too bright so it's quick just a
quick comparison showing you the size
difference mainly over 23 inch compared
to a 24 inch so 23 inches on the Left 24
inches on the right there is really I
mean ultimately it doesn't really matter
but I think 24 inch is probably the
perfect size for desktop so they are
obviously I like both my monitors
they're really good but I use two of
them for when you make that while making
a book at the moment so I do need two
monitors the one on the left is a lot
better than the one on the right there's
a lot more expense twice the price as
well so the one on the right is just an
ISA weighs 150 bucks so yeah guys if you
got any comments leave them in the
comment section but
and of course subscribed kid brain
easygoing but yeah as if you're
wondering which monitor to buy it
ultimately doesn't make a difference so
much I mean you're going to be happy
with either monitor if you're upgrading
if you're going from 24 inch to 23 inch
you probably will notice it slightly but
yeah guys that's just a quick review
just showing you what's the difference
between the two so alright guys peace
