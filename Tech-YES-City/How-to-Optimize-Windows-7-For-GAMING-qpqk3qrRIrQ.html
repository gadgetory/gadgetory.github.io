yeah City this is Brian is he coming
back to you guys today with an OS
optimization for games ok so the whole
point of this guide is going to be
getting all those automatic updates off
or getting rid of all that stuff that
could possibly cause jittering in games
so I also have my SSD tweak guide and my
windows 7 tweak guide which I'll put the
links in the description below check
them out and let's get on with it so
first of all I want you to go to
advanced type so click the Start menu
click in this little search box Vance
system settings click enter and it
should bring up this little menu here
now on this Advanced tab right here so
go on to the Advanced tab performance
and obviously if you want the best
performance then click on adjust for
Best Performance but me personally I
find that this does not like if all that
my custom settings here they don't
really make a difference at all ok so if
you guys want to copy my custom settings
and obviously I think this makes my
windows a bit more snap here as well
then copy this so here I'm just going to
leave it up here for you guys I'm not
going to go through each and every one
I'll just leave up the screen and you
guys can have a look so basically the
ones that are unchecked they're the only
ones that are on ticked so uncheck them
and let me know what you think the next
part is a little bit it was just as
important adjust for best performance of
programs ok you want to make sure that's
ticked and then virtual memory if you're
on 16 gigabytes of RAM I want you to hit
change and no paging file ok and then
click OK if you have only 8 gigabytes of
RAM or less then I probably suggest
leaving this on as yet but if you got 16
gigabytes of RAM then you can take this
off virtual memory and it'll free up
some space on that SSD as well now
that's the two important things there
let's move on to ms config which is
another important one now if you go so
click on Start menu type in MS config
bring this up here so we'll do that
again sorry I didn't show up properly so
Start menu MS config just type that in
hit enter
and brought up a frigging thing and then
hit enter and it should bring up
selective startup so you've got this
here as you can see here you go
selective startup load system services
and load startup items because I've
customized this ok so I'll show you
first in the program section you want to
make sure that only the programs you
need are loading up against your
instance I don't load up all this Adobe
stuff I don't load up Google update I
don't load up my Realtek HD audio
manager all this power registration crap
from Logitech so I took unchecked all
them and only I only have my logitech
camera software intel's user interface
software and also Skype and that's all I
have okay loading up at startup so I
recommend you have a lightweight startup
and if you you can adjust you can adjust
it all here so pick the programs that
you don't want loading up and uncheck
them and services now this is another
important part this part here you want
to make sure that there are no if you go
to manufacture a tab and you increase
that you can just then roll through Z
and then just scroll through and make
sure so that if you look through mind
it'll be Microsoft Corporation Intel
Corporation you just want to make sure
there's no dodgy ones there so I've only
got Microsoft Corporation Nvidia
corporation so there's only trusted
services running on my computer at the
moment valve is ok
Adobe's ok and I'm just going through
here and even then I think that Adobe
stopped so it's not even running at the
moment ok so that only only starts going
when I actually open the program so
there's no problems so just go through
your services and just check if there's
any out of place ones there from any
manufacturers and maybe you might want
to uncheck them so anyway that's for me
guys that's so those two as well now the
last part of the guide I'm going to show
you here is obviously just configuring
programs like nvidia z' so we double
click on that click on help and updates
and preferences I've met eclis so I
don't automatically check for updates ok
so I've taken that off and I just if I
want to manually check for updates I'll
just check for new updates so I'll do
that probably once I don't know once a
week the moment I having no problems
with games and you want to
that for every little program you have
running down here preferences my
logitech webcam software check so
configure last updated configure again
turn on automatic updates I've got that
unchecked so turn on it basically
there's no automatic updating going on
so I'm turning off all my automatic
updates same with Skype you can go to
tools options advanced automatic updates
and again there should be an option to
turn off automatic updates in Skype so
those three things I recommend you do
and if you have other little programs
that use automatic updating then turn
them off as well now Windows Update I
generally find you don't have to turn
that off ok because when Windows Update
updates it lets you know that it's
updating so you know that that program
is then updating so Windows Update is
actually fine I recommend you leave that
on now let's go on to the last part of
the video which is going to be my flat
line theory and just basically this is
just the way to check and especially a
way to check that programs aren't using
or aren't doing these big spikes because
if you're getting big spikes in the next
part of the guide then that can indicate
well if that happens in games that could
indicate that that could be what's
causing jittering so anyway let's get on
to the last part I'm going to take with
my camera as the desktop software will
actually cause see people make you know
the CPU usage won't be accurate so I'm
going to use my camera for the next part
and let's get into it ok guys now this
brings us to the last part so if you hit
control-alt-delete you should be able to
bring up start task manager and now this
should bring up a whole I've obviously
enlarged this and I recommend you guys
enlarge it as well but you'll see here
when you first open it up there will be
that initial spike so there should be
initial spike there that's normal
but after that there should be pretty
much relatively zero CPU usage and your
RAM should pretty much what I call
flatline okay so this RAM usage here
memory usage it should just be a flat
blue line okay so as you can see coming
from the right here there's a flat blue
line there and just leave this for a
little while obviously you can see my
cores here there's no CPU usage pretty
much
so there's no I've got no programs or no
updates that are causing problems so
when I start games my games are going to
be using all these cause so it's great
so obviously this one here is going to
one of the causes obviously going to
have these little little little jitters
that's just obviously this program
itself updating so this program itself
is actually using a bit of CPU usage
task manager but if you are having like
big spikes anywhere in between that
would be a program that is using CPU
usage so you might want to check that
out and find out what program is causing
that
but other than that there should be this
should be pretty much flat or little to
none CPU usage so anyway guys if there
is so that that's that's that done so
you can have a look here
so that's pretty much flat as you can
see but if you want to you can check up
here in processes and you can find out
what programs are running as you can see
here I have very little to no processes
open at the moment so just check that
out and yeah that's about it guys so
that's obviously this is the best way to
check what is getting you know what
programs are using one so as you can see
is 0% it just doesn't move so that's
what you want guys hey guys I hope you
enjoyed this let's get back to the
webcam and the condenser microphone so
if my video wasn't too bad you can
probably see that I had 0 CPU percent
usage across that whole time except at
the start obviously when I opened up
task manager now and you saw the blue
line that was the flat line so if you
guys are getting like big spikes on the
CPU usage then that can indicate that a
background program is using resources
and if it's doing this while you're
gaming that will most likely cause
jittering which in the past I had
jittering and I hated it I hate it while
I'm gaming I want the most fluid gaming
experience so if you guys yet have any
questions please leave a comment the
comment section below or send me a PM if
it's urgent and as always if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and if you haven't already subscribed
attack your city where everybody here is
a yes man and a yes or a yes woman
on your sexuality anyway guys stay tuned
for Tech Talk episode 10 it is going to
be huge like mammoth it's not gonna be
that huge but it's going to be talking
about second date secondary games
killing the industry and of course Intel
monopoly I'm going to talk about those
two things so stay tuned for that
and yeah guys peace out for now brain
easy wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
