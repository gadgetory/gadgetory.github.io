baronies gumma back to you guys today
with an unboxing and review of the z87 G
45 gaming motherboards so this is the
new LGA 1150 motherboards series so this
is supporting the new Haswell CPU so
straight away when you unbox the product
this is what you get in the box so I
won't spend too much time on the actual
box things I want to look at the
motherboard but you get the i/o shield
you get a doorknob handle which says I'm
sorry busy gaming which is pretty unique
it's pretty I found it interesting you
get two side of three cables you get the
drivers utilities and you also get a in
Japan yet a 12 month warranty I think
it'll be different in different parts of
the world you get a quick installation
guide and the full user manual as well
the also the box you know it comes it
comes pretty bit neatly boxed I do like
the look at this box rather here's the
board itself it looks amazing so I'm
gonna say this is one of the reasons why
I've got this over this z87 extreme for
you probably you guys are wondering why
did you get the z87 extreme fall well
this time around I decided to give MSA a
chance because the red and black theme I
mean usually you pay more money for it
but this time around you are not and I
mean you're not paying extra money for
the red and black thing you're getting
so much value packed on to this board
it's not funny well from the spec sheet
anyway I'm gonna do some tests later and
see how it fares but let's have a look
at the board first of all you get three
PCI Express 16 of sorry you just get
three PCI three Express ports this run
runs at sixteen speed this one runs at
eight speed and this one runs at full
speed if you use Xfire it'll run an 8
speed for speed for speed if you're
using SLI only two cards can be
supported on SLI so you can only get
eight speed and eight speed and that's I
mean it's good that's good enough fruit
I mean if you have a lot of money you're
gonna spend a lot of money and get a
better board anyway so you know the fact
that ports SLI in eight speed eight
speeds really good that's all you're
going to need it especially two gtx 780
subhuman anyway this is comes with four
PCI Express
single speed ports so that's really good
as well now the main thing I like about
this board is you get the realtek ALC
1150 which is better than the realtek
ALC 898 I'm assuming and so you're
getting really good dax really good a
TCS on board now not to mention this you
get the audio boost here so this is the
audio boost from MSI
embezzler it's an app that gives you a
clearer or a stronger output signal for
your headphones and hopefully I'm going
to test it after this review and
hopefully you get a better input signal
as well less noise and so I'll be
testing that out with also with the
microphone I'm using now and also the
razor carcase headset microphone to give
you guys an idea of how much noise and
if this you know this is a great option
for streamers for people who want to
stream and stuff like that and they're
on a budget this board hopefully it
offers what you need now looking at the
board itself the heatsink should get
three heat sinks and they look amazing
and they feel amazing as well so they're
made of aluminium I think they you know
they look good this one's huge here it's
got the dragon on I like the theme it's
actually not too fancy it's not too
bright it's actually more of a maroon
color than a red color in my opinion and
looking at the board a little bit closer
you get the eight phase power design
here so this is apparently supports up
to a 180 watts of an overclock which
will be absolutely fine for house well I
don't see myself needing more because
especially since I like to run stable
over clocks this thing should support a
nice stable 24/7 I'm hoping for about
four point six maybe four point eight so
let's get on with that we'll have a look
at that later in my house well review
and overclocking as well so I get onto
that later now if the system fans you
get three system fans so you get one
down the bottom here one at the right
and one in the middle of the board for
CPU fans you get two four pin headers
there at the top so if you've got a h100
eye that you want to mount up the top
your motherboard double your case you
can do that and you can plug these into
here so really good you get for ddr3
slots there and they support up to three
gigahertz of an overclock and also 64
gigabytes of RAM total now the actual
board itself is a full sized ATX board
I'm going to say that with the z77
extreme 4 they did cut the size of the
board down a little bit and a lot of
people found it annoying this is a full
sized motherboard as well so let's have
a look now actually you get down the
bottom here first lastly say that you
get three USB 2 headers which gives you
an extra 6 USB 2 ports and you also get
six 6 SATA 3 ports as well so that will
give you that'll be more than enough I
mean only use for
solder three ports at the moment so I've
got another two if I want to do a raid
zero or something crazy like that
I can def
we do it now also you get the USB 3 you
get an extra USB 3 headed down here
which gives you an extra 2 USB 3 ports
you also get all your front panel audio
front panel power and all that stuff as
well so that comes on the board as well
now that's about so your 8 pin 6 Patrick
8 pin CPU header is over here and
everything just feels pretty well bit
built I mean the board does feel pretty
good so this time around I think MSI are
really aiming to give you a board that
is the value King and I think they've
done it this time around with the g45
gaming so this is the board I chose to
go with instead of the z87 extreme 4 and
the one reason I'm gonna get onto this
right now so the one reason I decided to
go with this board I'll just focus in
there for you guys the one reason I
decided to go with this board over the
z87 was that giving you the clear CMOS I
really like this feature
I loved it on the z77 I don't know why
they took it away on the z80 says the 87
extreme for really good feature if
you're overclocking is gonna save you so
much goddamn time I'm serious you get a
4 USB 3 ports on the back of the board
you also get a killer n IC so it's a
it's a Qualcomm and it's I guess it's
better than a real tech so if anything
that they give you something it's better
than real tech then it's pretty damn
good in my opinion so you also get a ps2
slot as well which is great because I
use a ps2 keyboard you get 2 USB ports
now why would they just give you 2 USB
to ports the think it's good to do with
the initial installation with Windows 7
and stuff like that so you know
definitely compatibility the USB 2 works
so that's a good thing now you get the
audio jacks there you get a lot of you
know optical out as well which is really
good use standard line out line in mic
mic in as well so really good and
surround sound options there you get a
VGA port as well in a DVI port an HDMI
port as well so very good there I like
it they've given you all that and the
clear CMOS button which is really really
good as overall I'm gonna say that this
board is looking like the new z7 it's
not extreme for I'm gonna do some tests
on it I'm gonna boot it up I'm going to
overclock it tell you how good of an
clocker it is I'm also going to test the
onboard audio for you guys now and yeah
it just looks amazing it does feel right
well it does feel well-built
and it is priced really well as well so
that's a good good thing about this
board it looks like the new value King
so hopefully this is what it is and you
guys probably wondering what board I
went with and this is what I went with
so this time around are giving MSI a
chance as it looks like they're you know
they're trying their best to get back
into the market with an awesome board at
a great price
so hey guys let's move on to the tests
alright guys so here is the z87 onboard
amp for recording the audio so the
actual audio coming out of the sound
card or the on board or your solution
didn't sound any different to my real
tech LC 8 9 8 but the audio coming in I
think it sounds pretty good I've played
around a little bit if you set the
recording volume to full and then a 10
decibel gain with all the effects turned
off you'll get this sound that you're
getting right now so this is just like
cheaper click on clip-on microphone I
use this for my reviews it's a very good
microphone for the price as well
obviously not as good as this condenser
microphone but this is the onboard audio
solution just straitly this microphone
directly plugged into the motherboard so
I think it's really good so it is a good
solution now the onboard LAN controller
the network interface card the ni C that
is great as well like I'm using that
already and it it does feel like it's
very I don't know it just feels like a
good card so it was downloading all my
things blazingly fast so really good all
so far this boards amazing I'm gonna get
into the overclocks
soon so I just thought I'd give you this
review and say the board itself is solid
it's stable it's a very nice board I can
highly recommend it anyway let's do a
quick quality test with the Razer
carcase now so I'll give you guys a look
at that okay here's a quick quality
chest with the Rosaire Razer carcase
microphones is the boom microphone that
comes with the Razer car case so here it
is now basically I will say one more
thing
okay so this is the razor carcase
microphones is the boom microphone that
comes with a pair of razor carcase
headphones I don't think it's the best
microphone in the world it's definitely
actually it's probably not far from the
worst but anyway it's his equality chest
same settings a hundred volume recording
input level with a +10 decibel gain I
tried to I couldn't hear any noise when
I tested the first time so hopefully
there's not much noise in this either so
I will say that it's definitely an
improvement over the z77 extreme board
onboard audio solution now another thing
as well is that the audio coming out of
the motherboard the actual audio out the
Greenline out is does give a stronger
signal as well so it is louder so
basically in a nutshell what I'm trying
to say is is that you guys if you buy
this and you're looking to start
streaming and getting into recording and
stuff great solution is already put on
board the z87 G 45 MSI motherboard now
another thing is to as a UFE I UEFI BIOS
the screen is great it's easy to use I'm
I quickly got the hang of it I'm gonna
get into it more though as I do I'm
gonna do some more overclocks and get
the for 670 k versus the three 570 k
review done and I'll get that to you
guys soon as well so check out that
check out my unboxing of the for 670 K
and I'll be doing the budget builds as
soon as I can anyway guys if you enjoyed
this review please give it a thumbs up
and if you haven't already subscribed
take your city and I'll catch you guys
back with some more has well anyway yes
