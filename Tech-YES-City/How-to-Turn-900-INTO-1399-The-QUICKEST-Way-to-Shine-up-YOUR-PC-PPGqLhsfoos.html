beside me is the PC that I picked up for
900 Stratton dollars in August 2000 18s
used PC parts on I'll put the link up
here if you haven't seen it already
absolute bug in this one because it
looks like so far all that's wrong with
it is it's just really dirty really
dusty it came with a gtx 1070 750 watt
gold rated power supply also a 360 mm
red eye 747 90k see singing about to ram
really solid motherboard tempered glass
case 500 gigabyte SSD so the specs are
all there now one can just hope for a
straight boot so we're gonna boot it up
now if there's nothing wrong with it
which is the best case scenario then
it'll be the easiest flip of my life and
we'll just have to reinstall windows and
after that we can just give it some
checkouts loving so stay tuned today
we're gonna be doing a really fast new
met off for tech yes loving if you're in
a hurry but let's see if this thing
boots
so got the PC booted up now it is
working absolutely fun it's actually
really quiet and the amount of ring fans
installed from the get-go is actually
very impressive so there's actually a
lot more value loaded into this PC than
I thought possible however there is some
crap installed on the PC here so we're
gonna reinstall windows right now though
if you need a Windows 10 Pro 64-bit key
then today's video responses 0 &amp;amp; 9 have
you covered you can get these keys for
as low as 12 US dollars after using the
coupon code tech yes - s now this coupon
code will also work for office 2016
retail Professional Plus and also for
the lots of other games that they have
on the site they have Steam GOG origin
also PlayStation Xbox games you can get
them at 10% off if you use the tech yes
- s coupon and I've already used the
Windows 10 key and activated project cos
of steam and it works absolutely fine
they're really quick to get you your
keys links in the description below with
the coupon code save some money today
and let's get back to it
so now we've opened it up you can just
see how dirty this PC is it's really
filthy surprising for a gtx 1070 rig
it's even a cobweb in there from a
spider but we've got the selection of
tools here of course we've got alcohol
wipes this is gonna be the initial just
set and forget sort of clean everything
off and then Chuck the alcohol wipes in
the bin very quick and easy then after
that wd-40 and Dada vac at the same time
and I'll show you this metal how quick
it is to bring up a PC like this from
rags to riches
so there it is on the floor that's the
preliminary grime that we've cleaned off
the case it is looking a lot better just
after alcohol wipes alone but again that
got off all the initial dirt and grime
off all these fans off everything and
it's now time for the new metal so are
you ready
so here it is here this is the final
product it is looking really really
schmick so there it is they're clean and
that new meta of cleaning definitely
helped it look a million bucks
so we can essentially from now I'm
actually curious to see how it performs
and overclock it because I want to
overclock the 4790k and you can see
there the memory actually lights up as
well so we'll probably be able to flip
it with about maybe 50% 60% profit on
top because it's looking really clean
it's got a lot of good gear in it and
I've also added a one terabyte hard
drive in as well just to spice things up
so we've been testing now the PC for
over an hour and a half and the
temperatures are really good staying
under 80 degrees --is of 4.6 gigahertz
as well which is a pretty solid
overclock for the 4790k it's about where
you'd want it to sit ideally and for the
memory we did get us up to 2,000
megahertz but there was problems and the
problem with this memory is it's got
fancy LED lights on it looks good but
there's no XMP profiles at all the stock
profile for it is the J tech standard I
believe which is like the CLS 11 1600
megahertz and that's what it defaulted
to but this PC is running really well
now so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna load up a game project cars and
see how that performs on this PC
so here it is right here the finished
product right beside me and it is
looking really good it's really quiet
and it's also performing really well
there is really no need to deal with the
4790k in this situation since we do have
a 360 ml rat on it and the 4790k was the
refresh of the 4770k and intel claimed
to use better thermal paste and it's
staying under 80 degrees at 4.6
gigahertz which I know is a decent
overclock for this CPU in itself but
when it came to gaming this thing
handled project costs absolutely fine a
1440p ultra wide and also the
temperatures inside the rig itself were
really good noise is really low but
let's talk about of course the flip
itself I've cleaned it all up it was
really disgusting but it didn't take me
long to clean this thing up alcohol
wipes and then at the same time using
the dotter vac and the wd-40 just going
ham giving it that new look shine and
now we take the photos and we put it up
for sale but one thing I am a little bit
confused about is if I pick up a 1080i
or I just keep the 1070 in there and
flip it as it is because if we put a
1080i in it does add even more value
since this case is really nice and
everything else in the build is really
good it would support that of a 1080 Ti
and I'd be able to then keep the 1070
and still make money on top with the
1080i because I did pick one up off an
ebay sell for under 800 Australian
dollars because of the RT X 2007 ounce
Minh people are just going crazy they're
selling their cards they want to get the
new graphics cards and they're letting
them go really cheap plus you've got the
mining crux as well mining on GPUs is
really not profitable anymore I checked
on what to mind calm and this I think
you're making like 4 cents a day or
something on a graphics card it's
ridiculous so assic miners have indeed
killed GPU mining at least to a certain
extent and maybe there's some new
startup Kryptos that make money I'm not
too sure but it's a great time if you
want to get into use price performance
because eric is going to be used
graphics cards coming from all angles
RTX mm is really making things exciting
I know some people are complaining about
the pre-order prices I know some people
complaining about in video not showing
enough figures I personally don't really
care I think it's getting things
exciting where I really love and my
passion resides and that's the use price
performance segment anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button let me know
in the comments section below

had any awesome flips yourself lately
