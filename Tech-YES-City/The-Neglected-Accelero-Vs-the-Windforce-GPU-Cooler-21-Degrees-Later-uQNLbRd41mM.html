graphics cards they've taken over the
market in fact they've infested the
market to the point where you can't even
breathe anymore
though today's story is a little bit
different it's about grabbing a
neglected cooler that had a hard life
and comparing it against one of the top
dogs out there the wind force and let's
see how it does welcome to tech city
this is brand coming to you guys today
with a video on my Exelero cool that I
managed to pick up with a banged-up 780
in Japan for around about 130 dollars
quite some time ago and it wasn't
actually until recently I decided to
retrofit this thing to the 980ti first
alders just see if it worked and second
of all to compare it to an aftermarket
cooling solution like the wind force
cooler that's out there at the moment
now the wind force cooler is renowned in
the market for having low acoustics good
performance and also a pretty sleek
design and this cooler did exceptionally
well on the 980 I mean a 25 degree
ambient temperatures this thing was only
bumping up to around 67 degrees when it
came to a fire strike benchmark also in
Douma managed to top around 70 degrees
so was doing very well and this was on a
custom fan profile which I decided to
keep for the Exelero as well when I
tested that now changing over to the
accelerate I was absolutely blown away
by how good this thing was we went from
67 degrees with the same fan profile all
the way down to 46 degrees that's right
a 21 degree drop in temperatures just by
changing the cooling solution alone I've
never seen temperatures this low as well
for an air cooling solution on a
graphics card 46 degrees 1.5 gigahertz
on a 980 TI which is pretty much the top
dog in terms of power consumption and
heat output for a graphics card out
there at the moment now why is the
accelerating this damn good temperatures
I don't know I'd have to put it down to
the grade of copper that they're using
in the base of the block and also put it
down to those fans they performed really
well for what they are and also the
sheer size this thing is a pretty big
cooler now it is an expensive unit and
the reason I'm doing this video is
because I picked it up for free so I'm
guessing if you guys see one of these
accelerate colors on a banged-up
graphics card I would honestly take that
chance at that graphics card even though
the graphics card might not work you're
going to get a really good cooling
solution out of
gravis so what are the drawbacks to the
Exelero well the first thing is the
price this thing comes in at around
about a hundred dollars the second thing
is the sheer size of this thing it's
almost a triple slot solution so you
will have to make room in your case and
it is pretty lengthy as well another
thing is the installation you're going
to have to change out your current
graphics card cooling solution and
replace it with the Exelero if you want
to get this thing working though with
all that aside you will get some massive
temperature drops as I said there before
even compared to some of those awesome
aftermarket cooling solutions which are
out there at the moment the one more
thing I wanted to talk about before I
get out of here is just accelerate don't
get enough credit for their cooling
solutions I mean I didn't even know that
GPU cooling solutions with this damn
good I always thought they just made
good thermal paste but from here on in
I'm definitely going to be trying their
CPU coolers as well because what I saw
here today was just magic the seductive
time not the Voodoo kind either what
about the GTX 780 that I had here well
they've got some loving - I managed to
retrofit the 980ti windforce on here
even though there wasn't that many
differences I just had to cut out some
of the fins at the end and also the PCB
is now bent a little bit
due to this vrm heatsink sort of not
fitting properly the one thing about
this cooler was that the memory banks
were lined up perfectly from a 980 eye
to a 780 which means the whole lot and
the design didn't change there and also
this little bit on the end here is a
little bit bent out too so it does
overclock perfectly fine I managed to
get this up to 1.2 gigahertz and the
memory is running cool the solution
itself is running cool and it's doing a
perfect job so anyway I'm going to get
on out of here if you liked this video
then hit that like button also let me
know if you've tried an Excel or Arctic
cooling solution before then drop a
comma in the comment section below let
me know your thinker if even if you
haven't tried one just say Brian I want
this magic and maybe I'll fly over the
half puffs in and show you an excel or
oh cool oh that I hacked off some gtx
1070 or 1080
five sixty I'm just making up numbers
here anyway guys I'll catch you in the
next tech video peace out for now bye
I don't know what the better deal was
with this gravis card the actual 780 PCB
or that Excel or a cooler I'm kind of
thinking the Excel or a color was and
the world keeps turning to the triple
fan model there with the two and a half
cut slot the seductive kind not the
Voodoo kind either</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
