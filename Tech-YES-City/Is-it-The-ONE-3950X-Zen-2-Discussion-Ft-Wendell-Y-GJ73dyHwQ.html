gaming horizon event I'm joined by
Wendell how you doing good I've got the
pink bracelet for sale you know I'm
legit I go you're legit - yeah I got the
pink bracelet flamboyant color and
speaking of these CPUs we got the 39 50
X which was announced today
$749 price tag I can't help but notice
1950 2950 3950 oh they've changed the
socket oh no what does that mean
that I want I want the more PCIe lanes
what's what's happening 16 cores on the
main stream well is actually a story
behind that they told me that the lower
court count thread ripper chips didn't
sell at all yeah so I know surprises
there so that's why I think their
reasoning but also with that you think
the next-gen of thread ripper chips that
are coming in will be at least twenty
four core so I mean that it's got to be
now they've really upped the core count
all around but coming into this I think
right the main focus was with their
risings n2 was gaming which they labeled
out five new SKUs and added on the 3950
x but they quietly added in the 3,200 G
in the 3400 G did you notice that those
actually are really good I think that
they're excited for those because those
sell a lot and when I say those sell a
lot those sell a lot like a lot and
those are going to sell even more now
the 3400 G and
thirty thousand three horizon five plus
Vega those are Zen plus those are nuts
into no 7 nanometre but you get the
performance pump and it's soldered the
rods in fives that's right yeah no more
overclock the fork or a threaded
soldered yes so that was that was
interesting to see and they litter
cooler they did yeah they put the spire
on that too now speaking of the coolers
the risin 5 3600 gets a stealth yes and
then the X gets a Spile
yeah and then all the SKUs above that
get the Wraith max for some prism yeah
so they get the RGB bullets so that's I
predicted at Computex I was calling the
3,700 X to be my favorite now that adds
even more value that it gets that best
stack cooler on it 329 and the
overclocked ability eight calls 16
threads again and you can cover with a
beat for 52 it's 65 watts but let's face
it it's not really gonna be 65 watts
when you overclock the bejesus out of
here which everyone is going to do
because it's the sweet spot so coming
out of today I still think that's my
favorite play going into the news into
you guys cool 16 threads you going to
have that good price point 329 plus the
good cooler now and the ability to put
it on a be 450 even a be 350 though a
telling me I think that people that are
excited about computing like I'm getting
a computer I'm really excited
yeah risin 7 but risin 5 the six core
yeah and rising plus Vega I think those
are the ones that are going to make just
a scandalous amount of money for AMD is
so good
I think the rise in five years thirty
six hundred is definitely gonna be good
199 plus 7 nanometre one thing I'm very
curious about still though we have to
put them on the test ban here's the all
core overclocked yes a bit on august and
i was there talking about the topology
the windows scheduler now that's they've
said it's been heavily updated in 1903
yep now I tested 1885 with a thread
Ripper and there was a performance
uplift there and so somebody from
Microsoft reached out to me and I tried
it and I was real salty but this thread
Ripper was not fixed the 2990 was not
fixed but 7-zip in some other
had a six to nine percent performance
improvement and that was because of the
scheduler face I should have dug deeper
I didn't realize but you need the
chipset driver in addition and that
scheduler fix is gonna rise the boat of
all's ends so no matter what sin you
have it's gonna get better that's really
like that's gonna four cores in in which
case I'm sorry yeah well I was hoping
for that like I was hoping like look
marks off really need to work with AMD
to get that schedule it is and they did
yeah that was a good thing coming out of
this news that we got here now I will
concede that my fix for the twenty nine
ninety is going to affect a much smaller
number of people than the patch in 1903
affects the patch in 1903 affects every
Zen user except for the people that'd be
good I mean I'm very curious to see
those old core boosts as I said before
that's the biggest thing for me coming
out the single core boost I mean four
point seven gigahertz on the 3950 axe
versus the 3.5 gigahertz old core base
yeah that's that's that's a big
discrepancy of 1.2 gigahertz yeah it's
uh it's a well I mean I think it's down
to the wattage though so if I throw a
giant closed-loop cooler on there and
dump 300 watts into the CPU can I get
that all core it's not gonna be a thing
and well this is the thing to with a
single cores is it going to be like is
that 4.7 Giga that's gonna be that
momentarily you know boost that even if
you got an old core of 4.4 for instance
so I'm thinking is they're gonna be
faster on the single-threaded speeds I'm
thinking about the 2700 X and the 29 9
yeah so the 2700 X there's not really
any additional overclocking you beyond
PBO like I couldn't like feet of a good
board that unlocks PBO and XFR it's
basically fine but the 2990 that CPU is
breathtaking when you let it stretch its
legs by using like 350 watts yeah
breathtaking 32 cores if you let it over
qua you can also see a power meter go up
I don't care about that I kind of do
but that's no it's good to see that you
got the 16 core though the mainstream I
think at $749 I'm moving in yeah
how many mainstream gamers are going to
want to adopt them I mean that's a lot
of cause like papers games and so though
pitching it as the foot world's first
gaming CPU so I was a little bit
skeptical of it
I think the 12 core is going to be more
practical since it has the same amount
of level 3 ash so it's a it's a slightly
less because you get less on because you
got less cores but that doesn't really
matter for people that are streaming on
super intense gamers that you got a lot
of background processes the 12 core is
gonna win because you got the split
cache so yeah no two groups of 16 Meg
plus the l1 I mean l2 so you've got a
lot of cache therefore background
processes one of the one of the places
where Intel struggles is when you've got
like if you're running 7-zip like I'm
gonna recompress my movies and run
handbrake or something and then you want
to go play a game most systems can't
balance that workload really well but
that's actually something Rises and
balances really well because the cache
is split yeah well I mean that the
system they've really worked on it this
time I've noticed they've really been
talking about how they've redesigned the
cause and I mean to be clear you know
don't pretty order we need to actually
test everything and you know certainly
amy is gonna put their best foot forward
in terms of the demos we didn't gonna go
hands-on with a lot of stuff which is
cool at least I got to play with some
stuff and you got to play with some
stuff and it's not like super hands-on
because it's like I wanted on a test
bench it's just here's some systems you
can actually see and touch well that's
um I'm going into this like I think the
12 and 16 cause I mean 749 bucks
it's a lot of money for a cou and that's
when you start to get into that you
realize okay the value is there if you
can utilize the 16 question how many
people are actually going to utilize
that many cores so that's why I'm saying
the eight core the 329 plus having 7
nanometre all the new updates I think
that's going to be the best play going
in
okay I'm thinking about like in 329 and
like the tomahawk be 450 and it's like
yes not bad so that's what really I
really like you do lose bc IE 4.0 though
going with the be 450 bit yeah that's
right the only demo they realistically
showed we're PCIe gen for made a
difference was that 8k perez i mean guys
if you're editing on a caper res you
know i don't know that an SSD was really
tempting yeah again what five gigabytes
a second but again that's like geared
towards a person who's got a lot of
money if they've got an 8k read you can
get some of the cheaper like two
terabyte in VMI's for like 150 bucks and
they're not the fastest but two
terabytes but they still work on PCIe
gems there are only Gen 3 I'm not Gen 4
so on that be 450 works great yeah so
that's what I made like you really sort
of got the feature set there that's
geared up towards much more expensive
equipment but how many people are going
to want to adopt that is it a little bit
too much too soon but I know they want
to put their best foot forward I know
they're doing a great job but we still
got to test all this stuff out in the
real world strike while the iron's hot
or in this case while Intel is fumbling
and stumbling I mean coming at it coming
out of Columbia checked aim day really
put the foot forward had a blast and
then Intel didn't really have a response
no they're good ok yes that's going to
be 95 watts and 5 gigahertz all cores
and so they didn't they didn't have 10th
gen desktop so sarcastically well that's
well I mean they didn't have the 10th
Jen Jess top CPUs they announced their
laptops I was like people were like
where's the desktop CDs where's the
Cap'n what we heard from the engineers
at the Andy thing and it was like look
we expect we expected to the 7 nanometer
process to be a regression until like
the material scientists around the world
are going to be like for this
lithography process the r-value the
resistance value of the wires in silicon
is going to increase the higher clocks
is going to be really hard and so Intel
has addressed that with like the IPC
uplift they were like ok look we're
Intel we can't get the clocks as high on
air 10 nanometer process is 14
nanometers this is the problem
everybody's going to have because it's a
material science problem
so we don't need to worry about this
because it's a material science problem
and then TSMC is like and now everything
is like you know five gigahertz that's
pretty good I mean like that's going
funky but do you think AMD like they
said they took risks and I think that's
what they were talking about when they
heard they were taking risk they didn't
know 707 nanometer would turn out and so
when they said we were taking risks I
kind of automatically thought yeah you
kind of got lucky that seven nine I mean
it was able to go higher than 14
nanometer even on their own CPU
architectures so I've always said
there's this relationship between cache
and clock speed and it's a little weird
with AMD because their l3 is a victim
cache which is not the best kind of
cache but it's pretty straightforward to
implement and they've done some stuff to
make it not as terrible as just a
vanilla victim cache but I think they
were probably planning in their
architecture for the massive massive l3
increase as a way to offset the lack of
being able to do the claws but TSMC gave
them a way to be able to do the claws so
they got the processed shrink which
should have taken away clocks but they
were able to claw back the clocks but
they've got the in largest cache and all
of the other technology that they plan
to do to offset the loss in clock speed
the IPC uplift
because Intel that's what they did there
18 percent yeah but they didn't Intel
didn't manage to claw the clocks back
well you got plus you got their clock
speeds on 14 down there already like
right up there doesn't get it doesn't
get any higher than that
I think seven nanometer plus two is
gonna have a little bit more Headroom
than most people expect because
tsmc seems to be on the ball here with
the material science actually that's
very true so I think I think though we
are seeing kind of it's great because
we've got this time around with the 3000
we've got a tick and a talk in one and I
think that's the that's why I'm excited
yeah because I think it's for a long
time we've been getting fed tick tick
tock I need a tick tick tock tick tick
tock and it's yeah now we're getting
with 3000 like the both at the same time
and that's why people are just so
excited
you got the tick in the talk right at
the same time I'm kind of like thinking
this will be one of the best Jen
in recent times full game is for content
created for everyone really you know in
my mythological parallel universe
AMD and Samsung also become best buds
from working on the mobile stuff the
Samsung is got these really cool fabs
too and so maybe we can see some cool
AMD Samsung collaborations in the future
with Samsung's material science and then
at that point basically the world versus
Intel so mmm maybe bad might be a bad
thing might be a good thing is then they
get this shaft into gear and start
giving I see what you did there samsung
gear yeah and then they can start giving
us some game and that's what it's all
about I said in my previous video if you
guys haven't seen that one for the GPUs
then today's competition when AMD push
hard
we want to see Intel push harder back so
we get better value but it seems like
Intel won't have an answer for rising
3000 for quite some time yet if the 9900
KS is the best they got I got problems
put it that way
you got a 12 core coming out same price
and it's got better IPC a pattern it's
gonna have even better IPC than Intel's
you know I bought a 70 900 X for $1000
and that was a terrible investment let
CPU has not held its value at all as
$1,000 and like the 99 K was 500 and
that came out like a year later and that
outperforms that's 1/10 or but the
8-quart outperforms the Tim core by a
lot so I'm just wondering well how much
could I buy it off you fit look $300
ideal I've done it will be loaded a
little scratching them don't mind don't
mind but we've also got a main men's
Wendell go way back when we talking
about the old-school Zeon's the value
they possess yeah the 1365 so we're
gonna first introduced another thing too
is we're gonna see the rise in 3000
series will bring down whole use prices
and so I'm looking forward to giving you
guys some rise and deal hunting those
whatever those i7 2670 worth about three
dollars and fifty cents yeah that's the
beauty of it all so we're going to see
everyone wins out of this new risin 3000
and
iseman people who want the best price
points men people who want value for
money when people who won't use price
performance everybody wins
so that's just the awesome thing coming
out of any competition anyway guys that
about wraps up our coverage here at the
gaming next horizon I didn't even know
which way it goes next gaming horizon
I'll say one other thing they snuck a
seven in the put in a Z to be like seven
enemy just cuz it was like gold and
silver what weird but the the display
that they had is solocom past you can't
really tell but now he was the only
other thing there's gonna be a lot of
people are disappointed that there's not
an answer for the 28th epi but listen
the middle of the market is important
like the Polaris was insanely profitable
for handy insanely profitable and Navi
as the next Polaris looking pretty good
but we gotta get that on the benchmarks
yeah definitely have to get that on the
bench on the on the bench table and stop
benchmarking it for the 2080 TR but most
people are not buying 2018 well the
whole thing I was told was they
developed that with mark soft as well
now the main purpose of Navi now is this
revealed was the next-gen consoles that
was the main purpose of Navi and so what
we're getting on the desktop is sort of
like the augmented benefits from that
console Rd and so whether we'll see a
big navvy I mean hopefully we'll yeah
who knows when the consoles came first
and that's the production of the console
so look at it we have no idea but yeah
I'm looking forward to testing it out I
mean it's not like going to be
groundbreaking like the Rison 3000 is
but at the same time it's still good to
have that option there now it's
something that can compete with the RT X
2016 2017 so that's what we're looking
at and also let us know guys what you
think of the new rise in 3,000 products
stack here what is your favorite CPU
coming into the event what is your
favorite CPU coming out of the event I'm
gonna ask wonder what's his favorite SKU
of the stack I think my favorite for
everybody but for my audience probably
straws in five the six core rise in five
maybe
XO not X X
and but the 3,700 X that's probably the
best value for horsepower but if you
just want a powerful machine that's
basically future proof for the next
three years probably rising five yeah
doesn't mean I mean 6 cores 12 threads
are still relevant for practically
everyone that's just playing games and
doing a little bit of this and that I
just think you know you always love to
get that cookie cutter value money value
for money build and I think 16 gigabytes
ddr4 a core 16 threads before 50 is
going to be whereas 65 watts can be
super quiet well you're gonna have that
really good cooler that you will be able
to overclock that 3700 X on and get
pretty much the same results as the 399
CPU 3800 X so that's why I'm calling
that one is my favorite
I also going in what do you think with
the two-month delay on the 39 50x before
we get on out of here I thought that was
like no one expected that no one called
that I thought the delay was gonna be
longer
it's answer is yeah I mean it's probably
fine that that explains the thread
Ripper roadmap thing too I think so yeah
they get people ready for thread Ripper
and then ya got a teaser there if you
want more cause more threads than you
can still go up again hey you just
bought a 12-point lead who said the
thread represent ly not dead but 116
cores it looks like well maybe 16 cores
is the entry level do you think maybe
they just given the real hardcore
enthusiasts a bit of a stepping stone by
the 12 core then by the 16 core then by
the 64 core yeah so it's sort of
exponentially because the people that
really need thread Ripper are gonna have
a lot of peripherals and a lot of other
stuff but you know for even for video
capture having that PCI Express 4 link
to the chipset that helps a lot with
video capture - I know you're into all
your inner extracting all those extra
nitty gritties out of the I mean all the
proof meet the periphery those extra
lanes and everything some of the stuff
that Wendell does is absolutely amazing
guys so big thanks for him - featuring
on this video and also check his channel
out level 1 text links in description
below thanks for having me it's all good
and if you have any questions for
Wendell drop a question in the comment
section below or also let us know guys
in the comment section below what is
your favorite rise and cpu coming out of
this love or any thoughts and opinions
as always you wanna do
this is tech yes city peace out for now
bye peace out for now and behind
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
