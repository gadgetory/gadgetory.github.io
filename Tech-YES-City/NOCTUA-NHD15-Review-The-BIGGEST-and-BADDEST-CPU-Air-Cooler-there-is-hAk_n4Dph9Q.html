flagship NHD 15 air cooler and see if it
is really king of the hill ladies and
gentlemen welcome back to takia city
this is Brad coming back to you guys
today with a review of a very big air
cooler this is the NHD 15 from NOC
schewe and wow this thing is huge so
we're going to go run down through the
specs first then I'm going to do a
comparison against all the other coolers
they have here and then we'll go on to a
conclusion and my subjective opinion
about this cooler so as soon as you get
the Box in from start to finish this
thing was just a luxurious experience if
that's one word to put it the box and
everything in it comes organized so well
comes foam packaged I couldn't ask for a
better unboxing experience now as soon
as we pull the contents out you've got
there too low noise adaptors you've also
got two 140 millimeter fans from knock
Shore themselves so these are in-house
design fans and boy are they very quiet
but we'll get onto that later
they are sort of cream and brown themed
they're also included is mounting kits
for popular AMD and Intel sockets and
another good thing I'll point out about
Knox well is they include future
compatibility so all you have to do if
you get a new socket in the future and
your cooler doesn't mount you just send
them an email and they'll send you out
the attachments and all the mounting kit
required to get your cooler on the new
socket now the goodness doesn't stop
there they also include a massive tube
of thermal paste and I've tried this it
just compares pretty much identical to
the MX 4 so good stuff that they've
included with it and they even give you
this thick metal badge which is
interesting because a lot of people
include cheap decals these guys are
including a thick metal badge which I've
got on the fractal define r4 there now
let's get on to business with the cooler
itself this bad boy is not only the
biggest thing I've seen in terms of
dimensions for an air cooler but it's
also the heaviest as well weighing in at
one point three kilos with both fans
attached looking at the dimensions
however we have 161 millimeters wide by
150 millimeters long by 164 mm
the meters tall also important to note
there is RAM clearance you've got up to
64 millimeters of clearance therefore
your RAM and also this cooler can be
mounted either vertically orientated or
horizontally orientated however looking
at the materials of the cooler itself we
have a copper base plate which is nickel
plated and gives off a mirror finish
that's attached to six heat pipes which
are also nickel plated and then that was
all attached to a heap of aluminium fins
so now it's time to move on to the part
that you've all been waiting for and we
will just get the benchmarks pulled
right up here and the first benchmark I
decided to do was the 5820k at four
point three gigahertz at one point to
five volt which I've tested all the
other coolers around here and it's good
to see that the nock sure does beat out
every other air cooler here by a little
comfortable margin there especially
against the assassin which is its next
best competitor so beat that by a whole
two degrees whilst mainly remaining
really quiet as well it is important to
note however it did lose to the captain
240 water cooler by about 4 degrees
though on a platform like the 5820k
which gives off a lot of heat especially
compared to your 4 cos that's no
surprise as water does cool more
efficiently than air now moving on to
the 6600 K this is where things came
really close like there wasn't anything
in this I had to test this a few
different times but we see here the NHD
15 only lost to the water cooler by 2
degrees however it still beat out every
other air cooler it beat out the
assassin by one degree
so the NHD 15 is the king of the hill
when it comes to air cooling so now that
leaves us to the final conclusion where
I'm going to talk about this cooler and
everything that I like and some little
things that I don't like about it so
let's get on with the actual build
quality this is the most impressive
thing about the NOC schewe NHD 15 I mean
it was just amazing from opening this
thing to installing it
I couldn't critique one negative about
this you can see that Knox you have just
paid attention to detail in everything
just even things like boxing everything
up so neatly and then they're getting
the cooler out and just seeing that it's
perfect and the fans mount easy the
fans are really quiet you've got you've
got good thermal paste included the
manual is just so simple and then you
even get a screwdriver included to make
it just a breeze of an installation it's
actually a tall one as well for screwing
in the middle of the base plate which
was not a problem to screw in so
everything just made sense on this
cooler and I was just absolutely blown
away by the build quality however let's
move on now to the negative or our
negative because there's only one
negative thing that I can really think
of with this cooler and that is the
sheer size now when I got the deep cool
assassin in I thought that thing was
massive and it is massive but this thing
is even bigger than the assassin and
it's just so big in fact that it doesn't
even fit properly on my neck x99
motherboard in one orientation that's
facing horizontally however it does
mount in a non-conventional way the
vertical way which in the end is fine it
mounts on this z170 absolutely fine in
both orientations but keep in mind it is
just so big so keep that in mind and
know the specs of this cooler if you
wish to mount it on your rig just to be
sure for instance if someone's mounting
it with conventional air flow going
through the case then they can't mount
it horizontally they may come into a
little bit of a problem with their flow
or the air flow in their case so this
leaves you with my final score of four
point seven five stars out of five stars
now I wanted to give this thing five
stars but just that mounting problem
caused me to drop off 0.25 of a star
here because everything else with this
cooler is just simply phenomenal build
quality amazing fans quiet I mean I
didn't even have to go into my bias and
put it on a silent profile because at
max speed these things were really quiet
anyway so I was just completely blown
away by every little detail that knock
should have paid attention to with the D
15 so now guys that's about it for me
today if you have any questions or
comments about the nhd 15 then please
