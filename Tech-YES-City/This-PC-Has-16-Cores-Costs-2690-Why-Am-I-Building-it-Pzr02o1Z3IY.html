is going to be pretty crazy because I'm
doing something I haven't done before
and that is sort of mixing high-end
parts with budget parts and also going
to be using this as my main rig for a
few months so we just came off the back
of the Xeon versus the two eight cores
in 2018 and there wasn't a whole lot of
difference but what I want to do is I
want to take the thread Ripper 2950 X
for a good test drive with all my usual
work flow and today we've got here on
the table a bill that kind of integrates
a bit of budget into that especially
since we're using as rocks X 399 phantom
gaming 6 which is specifically designed
for the 16 and 12 core thread Ripper
chips and not the 24 core and 32 cores
they can use a lot more power so they've
cut down on the vrm a little bit since a
lot of people will be going I think for
those 16 core 32 thread thread Ripper
chips instead of the bigger variants
since I think they're more practical for
most people and we're also going to be
coupling this with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
flare X memory this is the seal of 14
stuff for 3,200 megahertz as well as an
RX 590 for the gravis card because for
video editing I find I don't need a real
high-end card I find the mid-range grabs
guys are more than capable of handling
my workflow but we've also got in this
build a 10 terabyte iron wolf Pro for
backup and then for the main drive for
the nvme boot and also scratch drive
we're using a corsair mp5 10 some other
cool components were using in this build
is courses newest specs 6 case has a
tempered glass side panel has a fan
included the front and a fan of the rear
also supports 280 Mildred's so we will
be using the H 115 I plant number
mounting that up the top and then
testing as well motherboard and CPU
temperatures in this case versus an
open-air scenario and the last component
in this build is going to be a little
bit controversial I can already see some
people getting triggered in the comments
but I'm gonna be using a mid-range power
supply this is the CX 750 M because I'm
gonna be testing this with this CPU
overclocked and the gravis card as well
to see if we can juice around 600 watts
plus from the power supply itself and
see if this holds up over time as my
editing rig because I've heard a lot of
people in the past say that you
shouldn't be using these power supplies
you should be going for something more
higher-end like the rmx or the ax series
or other brands as well super flower see
sonic EVGA but for me personally I want
to run this through the gauntlet and see
if it will hold up plus it's got some
really neat black cables included so I
won't have to use any cable extensions
to get a pretty neat-looking build but
with all that aside that let's build
this beast right here and put it through
its paces and yes that is a little tank
on top of the case because I think like
this builds going to be a work tank
so we're coming to a little bit of
trouble in paradise men build and that
is this case is not really going to
support the 280 mil rad with its fans up
the top here without hitting this
heatsink right here so you can see here
even one fan sort of struggles as well
so I'm guessing the 280 mill at the top
is out of the question but we're gonna
try and mount it to the front of the
case
so now the build is complete we are
installing Windows right now and it is
looking a pretty clean like pretty
subtle this not too much bling going on
there's a bit of bling coming from the
fans at the front here and also the
Corsair H 115 I've platinum other than
that pretty stealthy look and it's also
really quiet of course as soon as I've
installed Windows I'm gonna be doing a
bit of overclocking and then testing the
temperatures within this case because
we've got a fan up here ventilating as
well as this one at the rear ventilating
and then we've got these two at the
front being intake so hopefully this is
good enough to cool the CPU also in
regards to the cost of this build if
you're gonna go buy this off the shelves
right now it costs around about two
thousand six hundred and ninety USD and
then estrella around about three
thousand seven hundred twenty two
dollars using all the components I've
used and I mean honestly for the price
it may seem expensive but this is a 16
core 32 threaded beast with 32 gigs of
DDR for memory CL 14 stuff it's also got
a 10 terabyte hard drive one terabyte
nvme and it's ready to rock and roll so
here's the next step in the progress of
setting up this new PC here's my old
desktop and you can just see the amount
of files on the actual desktop itself
and this is pretty much like a week's
work for me so it just fills up so
quickly and then I'll clean it all up
keep all the important footage but in
this case I'm actually backing up data
to the NASS now and then from the NASS I
can just copy it across to the PC itself
so this little Nass here it saves so
much time it's really good really handy
having this thing in the tackiest studio
anyway well all the files are copying
across we're gonna boot this thing up
and start giving it a bit of an
overclock and tune
here's the final product now on the
bench and it is really good I'm
impressed with this build so far I've
already been editing out some footage in
Adobe Premiere Pro no hiccups whatsoever
even played some dota 2 at 4k and the RX
590 handled that absolutely fine they
keep in mind dota 2 is a pretty easy to
play game though it's the game that I do
play in my spare time I do like to play
turbo mode quite a lot it's actually
quite enjoyable and as for the
temperatures inside the build the CPU
only went up two degrees over an
open-air test bed set up with the same
ambient temperatures so that was really
good to see and also another thing was
since the power supply is not as good as
the ax 1500 on the test bench it was
using ten more watts so the temperatures
are being affected really at all but
looking at the x3 turn on fan of gaming
sixes vrm now actually saw a temperature
drop so it is getting some airflow going
over that vrm now and that enabled it to
get about 10 degrees less than when it
was on the open air test bench so so far
with this build I'm really impressed
it's super easy to build in but another
benefit as well as it's really quiet
even on load that the noise only went up
to like 48 decibels and in terms of idle
I'm standing right next to this build
and it's just whisper quiet the front of
the case features an RGB strip as well
with different modes different speeds
and you can change different colors
however there's no option to switch it
off completely so when I've got this on
my desk and these RGB lights are facing
me they can get a little bit annoying so
I'll just like to switch them off
completely and so to do that you just
unplug the RGB controller itself anyway
in terms of this build versus the zeon
counterpart right next to it I won't
really know until I've used it for a
little while then I'll be able to test
all the nooks and crannies and compare
them against each other
and I will be reporting back in a couple
of months what it's been like to edit
videos and just use this as my main
desktop versus the Zeon 8 core but one
thing I'd like to do with this hardware
is take it for a proper test drive and I
think a lot of reviews out there now
just get the CPU do the benchmarks and
then show the graphs as of late I've
really been enjoying trying out
different architectures and different
CPUs and seeing what their strengths and
weaknesses are and yes when it comes to
doing
my work I do use an overclocked
workstation I have been doing so for the
last couple of years without any hiccups
whatsoever when it comes to Premiere Pro
I'd just like to autosave every two
minutes because I don't think the over
clocks are the problem when it comes to
Premiere Pro the software itself as
we've reported in the past is the
biggest issue where it'll just bug out
with some weird bug especially for sound
transitions for example if you
accidentally hit that slider Premiere
Pro just crash on you so an overclocked
workstation in 2018 and going into 2019
is seriously worth your consideration
also in relation to the CX 750 Nothings
are cut out yet everything's been super
smooth so the power supply is looking
like it's doing a decent job as we
mentioned before it's not as efficient
as the X 1500 that is a titanium rated
power supply which does have a hefty
price tag so I will report back and if
this power supply holds up with this
whole build then honestly I wouldn't be
surprised I think a lot of people
underestimate actually how much power
they need in a build and tend to go
super over-the-top when it comes to
buying a pass-by I mean that's not a bad
thing especially since you can always
keep using that power supply especially
if it's got good components but me
personally going to take this mid-range
power supply and use it and see how it
holds up with an overclocked 16 core
system there Lhasa in relation to the
spec 6 itself it's a solid case it looks
really nice especially if you're into
that enclosed front off design of course
I do prefer the air 540 there's not one
case that has come out yet
that has sort of surpassed it in terms
of looks features and also air flow I
mean the fi40 really does go well on
bringing you better temperatures than
you'd otherwise get on an ambient desk
setup the one thing I will critique
about this case itself is the top
mounting for the radiators I did not
have enough room whatsoever to mount the
280 mill rad at the top with the fans
included just mounting fans up the top
is okay you will just clear the
motherboard but if you want to mount a
radiator then you're definitely gonna
have to mount it at the front and
speaking of airflow with this case if
you're going to get this definitely
orientate the front fan to the top so
then you've got two exhaust fans and
then get an addition
to fence or do what I've done here and
that is mount your radiator at the front
and have those fans bringing it into the
case anyway guys I'm gonna be now taking
this bill putting it back on the desk
and getting back to editing videos but
also a big difference already is that I
do miss shadow play it's a very
convenient app to have on your desktop
where you just have one hotkey to record
your desktop but an easy way to get
around this with the RX 590 is I'm now
using OBS studio and then I turn on
notifications in the bottom right corner
of the screen and then I can hotkey just
like I would with shadow play and I can
now record our desktop and also gameplay
footage at 4k and if you enjoyed this
video be sure to pop that like button
and also stay tuned because I've got a
worst products of 2018 as well as best
products of 2018 dropping on the channel
and we've got the BitFenix and so mesh
where they've redesigned the front panel
of the case to allow for better airflow
so I'm going to be stuffing in some
seriously hot hardware oh pun intended
and seeing how well that thing can
cooler
but what was that
you want some tech yes lovin well of
course I mean you're a Zeon and you're
in an air 5:40 I'm gonna hear this
request ASAP
