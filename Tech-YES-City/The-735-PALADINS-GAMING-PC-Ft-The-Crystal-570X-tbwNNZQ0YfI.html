baby looks good on me
welcome to tech city this is brian
coming to you guys today with another
new meets used pc build this time around
I've got the x58 motherboard from
gigabyte which finally rocked up from a
boat from Japan and then I've got that a
56 40 which is I you believe my favorite
cpu of all time you can currently get
this thing for around about 15 us off
eBay and man does it perform for the
door also we've got the five 70 X from
Corsair this is their flagship case in
their crystal series which just looks
drop-dead gorgeous so we'll talk a
little bit more about that later let's
get on with this PC build it was
designed for a game called paladin's
which a lot of you guys have recommended
me over the last couple of months so
with that being said we'll get on with
the price of the pots the build and then
the benchmarks where it's been 700
degrees in here since you came in
I could swear that this room has been
running out of air and now it's starting
to spin you'll make me feel kind of that
kind of good kinda everything and it
doesn't feel like
right Dyna Annie
would save it
you
good swear that I'm fading I think I'm
losing my sight I swear I'm hitting the
floor
where that my store makes your song
leader
if I take anymore you'll make me feel
kind of flat got a good kinda everything
if it doesn't feel like
I would
awaken it is already our
Oh
Oh
so there we have it benchmarks we're
crazy as always csgo just sitting in the
mid to high 200s there on high settings
infinite warfare battlefield 1 also
1440p high no problems at all then
paladins a very interesting game dare i
say better than overwatch it was
smoother looked better and felt better
definitely loving this game and this
computer of course just hammered this
new title at 1440p high settings really
good experience now I'm sure there are
some questions with the e 5640 and
overclocks and x58 I had this thing
running at four point three gigahertz
this was an ambient temperature of
around 28 degrees which is damn high
there are tricks to overclock x58 and I
will show people in an upcoming stream
on how to overclock this platform I mean
I absolutely love it favourite platform
of all time the boards were so tough the
CPU had over couples eons that were
clocked way above their weight and the
performance over 10k in physics also
this was my first time using an sshd
and how was the experience well it was
really good I mean I'd put it of course
in between an SSD and HDD though more
closer to an SSD than a hard drive
especially for everyday toss they were
really nice and I can highly recommend
them to people on a budget also the
green eBay cables they are really nice
to work with not only do they
cosmetically spice up the build but they
also allow you to use ketchup and
custard oh and mustard so this last
portion of the video I will now dedicate
to our friend that crystal 570 x from
Corsair they're tempered glass case and
let's talk about the good and the bad
first the good 180 us or $270 AUD for a
tempered glass case with three RGB fans
and controls included not bad at all
actually quite damn good when you
consider how much it costs to get a
temple
case in the first place so the cosmedix
and procedure definitely there and parts
of the case do feel really solid the
cable management at the back was pretty
decent to tie with and everything worked
in the end to deliver one sexy case dust
filters were large and easy to remove to
on top front and bottom though little
things that I didn't like about this
case the 3.5 inch drive base at the back
of vertical mounted which I'm not a big
fan of and also there is like no
clearance once the panel goes back on
definitely not good for a drive to be
suffocated like that I honestly would
have loved to have seen the bottom suit
cover extended to horizontal 3.5 inch
drive base added in the bottom also on
that note the drive bay insertion screws
were a little flimsy and extremely hard
to put back in so I just left the two of
them out
I thought by not putting the drive bays
on the bottom they missed out on an
opportunity for this case to support
extended ATX as well
I feel like this case could have easily
adopted it instead of slanting the
board's slightly up into the right there
moving along with cable management
inside the three elongated cable holes
were good though adding in some options
in the bottom four front audio power and
fan headers would have hit the spot
lastly mounting options are really nice
you can fit a 120mm right on the back
like I did in this build or slam a 120
240 at the top or even fit a 360 mil
right at the front of the case lots of
options there and I will say that the
included fans are excellent for airflow
and noise kind of reminds me of the air
540 yet overclocked in the cosmetics
department there we have it the build
looks extremely good and performs really
well also with the utilization of those
used PC parts I thought this build also
had good price performance pulled into
that and let me know in the comment
section below do you guys like these new
meets use PC parts bills
I'm absolutely having a blast doing them
would love to hear your thoughts
comments and opinions as always and also
don't forget to hit that like button and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye
nice that's a knife just kids having fun
we have the build looks extremely good
performs good and also with the
utilization of those use PC parts we now
have press OMG</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
