memory you've stumbled upon this video
and in my opinion you're entitled to get
those extra speeds for the money you
just spent welcome back to take that
city today we're going to be doing a
ddr4 memory overclocking tutorial and
now in this tutorial it differs a little
bit to the ddr3 memory over tutorial in
that the timings are a little bit more
relaxed the voltages are lower but for
what it's worth a lot of the variables
are still the same as they were with
ddr3 memory
we've just got to change those variables
especially the first three timings as
low as possible and then we've got to
change the tier ass to a sweet spot and
that's about it I give it maybe give it
a bit of a voltage bump so today we'll
be going for a 2400 mega it's
overclocked on some crucial ddr4 memory
I don't have the ddr4 memory box but
I've got a crucial MX 100 SSD here that
should do the trick but without further
ado let's move on now to the tutorial
okay so now you're on the desktop I want
you guys to grab a program called I 264
it's it's pretty much good at all this
program is really good for benchmarking
as Welli
now you'll put the link in the
description below you can download it
for free you also get a three free
30-day trial as well which I do
recommend just using that you don't have
to buy this software you can just use it
for free for 30 days to find your
overclock and then be done but yeah
anyway once we've done there we can go
to tools and get a CPU ID and we can
also go to system I mean you can do the
keishon memory benchmark here which will
benchmark your memory fine so go to
tools again we'll open up cpuid just to
make sure as you can see we've got a
four gig overclock that I just did
before and when go to keishon memory
benchmark and so what we want to do here
is before we start doing this
overclocking tutorial is we want to make
sure that our memory overclocks are
stable and we're actually getting the
set increases on our memory because if
for instance if we're overclocking like
today we're going to be going for a 4.2
gig overclock
so since we're going for a 4.2 sorry 2.4
gig overclocked or two thousand four
hundred megahertz on the memory we're
going to want to make sure and want to
check what our baseline speeds are
before we do this and so this is just to
make sure that we're actually getting
performance benefits out of overclocking
our memory so what we're doing here is
we're just running a quick benchmark on
the memory just to make sure everything
that we do today is actually giving us
an increase and then we shall be good to
go so use this as a baseline you might
want to save a screenshot after you've
run this benchmark and then you can
start jumping into the boss however we
just have to wait until this benchmarks
done as also with my overclocking
tutorials I don't like to cut any of it
out unless I have to think before I was
coughing in my previous benchmark so I
had to cut it out but so here we see
here we're just going to run the
benchmark and then we're going to
restart the computer and then we're
going to start overclocking the memory
now one thing to remember just like the
CPU is the memory also is pretty much a
silicon lottery some people can get
really good memory some people can get
bad memory in that it doesn't overclock
too well so basically these speeds for
instance mine's the crucial ddr4 2,000
133 megahertz memory these speeds out of
the box is what it's guaranteed to run
out so today we're going for two
thousand four hundred megahertz with
slightly lower timings and that should
give us a bit of a performance increase
so here would finish the benchmark we
see here those numbers 46,000 51,000
49,000 those are the ones to look at
especially with that total latency there
69.6 nanoseconds so once we've done that
we can save that I will save it to my
desktop and we can go save and then we
can close these down and restart our
computer and start jumping into the BIOS
so we're going to start getting straight
into the deep end now as I said before
my CPU overclock tutorial you may have a
different BIOS to me especially this
this is in the future where different
motherboards are out
109 or whatever numbering scheme but
we've got here we hit delete just to
jump into BIOS as soon as we start up
our computer and yes we just got to wait
try and jump into BIOS hopefully our
BIOS hopefully the gigabyte BIOS bug
doesn't strike again
so the gigabyte motherboard the x99 it
actually has this problem where it can't
mean it you can get in stable overclocks
but it just resets the overclocks it's
some weird bug going on with this BIOS
but anyways we boot up the computer we
can just hit delete and jump straight
into the bales hopefully I don't know
what's going on here it's just taking
its time come on gigabyte motherboard
it's doing a few cycles where he's
setting having a dance okay
so I'd like you guys to see everything
as well everything that happens behind
the scenes because it's important part
to overclocking overclocking is not easy
it's not just like you're not just
punching in a few things and
everything's perfect
there's actually a lot of hair pulling
and it can be stressful at times so I'm
glad you guys can see that this BIOS
bugs reared its ugly head because anyway
we're jumping into the boss here this is
the gigabyte blast we can press f2 and
get to the classic mode now in a Zeus
bias or an msi bias or maybe a ga bias
might look a little bit different but
again as I said in the CPU overclock jus
doral the settings should be pretty
similar so now that we've moved into we
can go down to advanced so we should
have advanced frequency settings we
should have our 4 gig overclocked locked
in here but now we can go down to
advanced memory settings and what we
want to do here is we want to up it to
2.4 gig or make sure your num lock
button is turned on and you can use the
numpad on your keyboard and do once you
guys to hit in 24 here and essentially
what this will do is will raise the
speed of our memory to 2400 megahertz
now there's two ways you can do this
overclock you can leave it at 2130 three
megahertz and drop the timings or you
can just up the speed and try and get
the best
timings possible in my opinion I like to
go with a bit of both that's why we're
going with the 2400 mega overclock today
so I like to give it a bit more speed I
also like to drop the timings down and
get the best overclock that I can
so now memory enhancement settings we
don't have to do anything there but
memory timing mode we want to hit hit
enter and go to manual and essentially
this will allow us to edit our timings
manually and put in our settings so
channel interleaving also we'll want to
enable this because this will pretty
much enable all the same timings across
all the memory all the memory subsets so
anyway once we've done that once we've
enabled that we can then go to this one
rank interleaving as well enabled so
again we want all our settings
interleaved into intertwined entangled
basically one of our settings the same
as each other across all four memory
sticks so I am using four crucial ddr4
memory sticks for this overclock also if
you wish to check out a review for that
memory then I'll put the description
link below but I'm guessing a lot of you
guys will be using crucial ddr4 memories
it's actually really good value for
money so this will be a greater clock if
you're on crucial ddr4 memory anyway
once we've done that we can hit that
enabled enabled memory timing manual we
can then go down to channel a memory sub
timings and then we can go down here
memory timing modes already set to
manual and then we can go to memory and
boot mode and I like to set this to
normal mainly because of the fact that
this gigabyte motherboard still has some
BIOS problems and I like my memory
booting up at a normal speed you can if
you want to save time you can enable
fastboot as well but I like to go normal
memory boot mode and then we can go to
cast latency and now for me I like to
hit in 14 so so you can see the defaults
15 but that's a 2133 megahertz as we
upped the speed of the memory
technically our latency gets faster as
well because our memory is running
faster in general so if we would compare
15 nanoseconds on the cast latency at
2004
megahertz as opposed to 2133 megahertz
it would be something like 14 yay around
about thirteen point nine maybe I'm not
too sure I have to get a calculator
anyway off the top of my head that makes
about sense but anyway we're going down
to 14 now so essentially at 2133
megahertz I could probably run this at
13 but since we're going for two
thousand four hundred megahertz I'm
going to drop this down to fourteen and
the T RCD I'm going to put this to
fifteen generally I found with my ddr3
memory as well this setting the TRC D
generally loves to be one nanosecond
slower than the cast latency and the TRP
now you're probably wondering what
exactly these settings are basically
they just think of it as just simple
variables which you have to change in
order to get the best speeds possible
don't try to understand exactly what
they are I mean if you want to stand
understand what they are then I'll put a
wiki article in the description below
where you can read up about all these
timings and what they do but just
understand of the way we can change them
and what effects what essentially so
don't try to understand why why why just
understand these are variables you need
to get them as low as possible for the
set voltage in order to get the best
speeds so now we've done you can feel
free to copy my settings if my settings
don't work then you may wish to drop it
back to 15 possibly even 16 like that
and just just you know 15 17 16 if your
memory is really bad so it depends on
you guys but I'm going for 14 15 14 at
2400 megahertz now with these three
settings these are the three ones that
you want as low as possible
now the tier ass this is a setting which
generally in the past with ddr3 and ddr4
specially this one was generally the sum
of all these three plus one which in
this case would be like 44 but I found
on ddr4 memory it's a different kettle
of fish
this at 44 actually makes a
computer a little bit weird like icons
don't refresh properly
I just find in general I have a little
bit of problems if this is the same this
is the sum of all three plus one or two
so generally I've found from my RAM I
like to have this a little bit under the
sum of all these three say minus four or
minus three I find if I have this at 38
again I run into problems so I like to
have this at 40 the sum of all these
three minus three so you guys can copy
mine mine sweet spot for this is 40 your
sweet spot might be a little bit
different but again you want to set this
to whatever a sweet spot is on your RAM
and that can only be done through
testing and that's the sometimes that's
the hard part I can't tell you what your
sweet spot will be fuel memory sometimes
you just have to test test it out and
find out for yourself so feel free to
copy my settings and if they don't work
you can maybe relax them a little bit
like this and go from there but for what
it's worth we'll go with fourteen
fifteen fourteen forty and then we'll go
scape and essentially what that'll do is
since they're all interleave it'll
enable that on all the channels as well
so here we go they're channel ABCD
should be all the same and now for
voltage so once we've done that we can
hit escape and we can hit escape again
and we can go down to advanced voltage
settings and we can hit enter here and
then we can go to D round voltage
control and we can hit enter and what we
want to do here is maybe give it a
little bit of a boost
sometimes your memory will run at these
speeds at one point two volt in my case
I had to give it a little bit more and
that was one point two three volt so
maybe you might want to start off with
say one point two five volt and maybe go
from there that's up to you maybe yes
since we're just doing a guide today
we'll go with one point two to five volt
on both the dual channel configurations
a and B and a and B now the DDR VPP
voltage we don't have to touch that and
the DRAM termination voltage we can
generally leave those at auto since
we're not going for a really big
overclock here we're just going for a
nice simple easy overclock a little bit
of enhancement so 1.2 volt we'll start
off with that
if you can't boot you might have to give
it a bit more or if you're on a gigabyte
BIOS you might have the BIOS bug and so
you don't even know if it's stable or
not so I really wish gigabyte would
hurry up and fix their BIOS bug but for
what it's worth if you're on a messiah
Zeus or an EVGA motherboard sure you can
start out trying 1.25 volt and now once
we've done that we can hit left and
right on the numpad and go over to save
and exit and go down to save profile and
we can maybe put it for gigs memory
testing memory memory tests so just so
we know what what overclock we're going
with today so we've done that profile
saved okay and now we can go to save and
exit and hit enter and we should be good
to go now so we should be able to boot
straight into Windows and hopefully
everything is stable so I decided with
my overclocking tutorials this time to
go with some easy over clocks because
last time I did go a little bit
aggressive with my over clocks and some
people were not able to obtain the over
clocks that I was able to obtain and so
it caused a little bit of confusion this
time I'm going with over clocks that I
think most people should be able to
obtain a lot of the population should be
able to obtain so that hopefully this
guides a little bit more simpler than my
previous guides as well as the fact that
haswell-e is just a power consumption
beast I mean it's pretty funny this
thing actually uses up quite a bit of
power haswell-e the six core the also
the ddr4 even though the ddr4 uses up
less power than the ddr3 the actual six
core itself is a bit of a beast sorry
once we booted into Windows here we'll
see that that was a successful boot so
what that means is that my memory is
either stable or it's really close to
being stable now there's another setting
in there that's pretty important and
that's the command rate though we won't
go over that today because
yeah I mean it's it's one of those
settings that can cause a lot of
problems as well for starters I do
recommend trying 1t so I'd recommend
trying to T first actually and if your
overclock is stable at those speeds then
you can try dropping down to 1t though
if it becomes unstable you can put it
back to 2t and it shouldn't be much of a
problem I find it doesn't affect gaming
especially smoothness at all so that's
something you might want to test but
once we've done that we can go open
i-264 and we can open CPU ID and we can
open cache in memory benchmark now
before when we go start benchmark now
before I showed you that screenshot so
what we're doing this time around is
we're simply making sure that our memory
is running either higher or at least the
same as it was before and so hopefully
you guys should see here a better
benchmark than what I got before and now
my memory is able as well I'll talk
about a few other things this memory
I've got is able to go up to two
thousand six hundred and sixty-six
megahertz
now there's more expensive Ram out there
that's able to go even higher say two
thousand eight hundred megahertz and
that's with profiles of I think they're
X and P profiles as well so if you have
some of that RAM that's great I'd
probably just recommend whacking in the
XMP profiles and being and calling it a
day but if you're on the you know the
budget ddr4 memory which is fantastic
value for money then you can overclock
this stuff and get a bit of extra
performance out of it as we can see here
the latency is already faster than what
it previously was so we've shaved about
6 nanoseconds off the latency which is a
good thing especially for games and so I
mean you can shave it you can try shave
off more time if you want to by dropping
some of these timings down even more
maybe you can try and get it down to 59
that's I think that's where I got it
down to 59 nanoseconds of 2666 I believe
but anyway let's have a save we'll save
that now desktop I think it was called
cache mem 2 so we call that number 2
we'll save that there and now we can
open these up side by side
and we can check we just do one in the
other but we can see here the memory
that we look at the speeds here we can
see here the read speeds are faster on
the overclock the write speeds are a
little bit faster which is still a good
thing and the copy speeds are
significantly faster so the read and
copy speeds are faster and the latency
is better so the level three cache was a
little bit slow two nanoseconds slower
but that's not to worry because
generally everything else is a bit
faster so this in my opinion is a
successful overclock on the memory now
another thing we can do is if you want
to make sure that this memory overclock
is fully stable we can close this down
we can go to system stability test here
and we can just click stress so make
sure these are unchecked and just stress
system memory and then we can start and
this if there's a problem with your
memory you should be able to see it here
so we can see here this one's just gone
up and down a little bit but I mean
since the system memory it can do this
so don't worry about it too much anyway
that's that system memory is fine I mean
sorry this is the actual CPU usage so as
I was saying before it's fine if this is
dropping up and down since it's actually
testing the CPU man I'm sorry it's
testing the ddr4 memory and not the CPU
so anyway you can run this system to
stability test this will just stress
your system memory if you come into a
crash almost immediately that would
indicate that you either need more
voltage or you'd have to drop your
speeds back so just like the CPU some
memory just won't be able to run at
certain speeds you'll hit the through
you'll hit the max cap where your your
gear just can't run anymore
for instance my CPU just can't go over
4.5 gigs I mean it can boot at 4.5 gigs
hell I think it can even boot at 4 by 6
gigs but it can't be stable at 4.5 gigs
the most I can get my house while a CPU
do is 4.4 gigs
fully stable as opposed to my 4 core
which can get fully stable at 4.6 gigs
sorry I just had to have a break there I
just coughed it's so dry in this room
but I'm
anyway as I was saying last things last
and that is yeah your memory just might
not be able to get to 2666 megahertz if
you're really unlucky you might not even
be able to get your memory to 2400
megahertz
I imagine there would be someone out
there that just can't get their memory
to 2400 megahertz and if you're that
person then you've just lost the silicon
lottery that's all it means however even
if you can't get your memory to 2400
megahertz I still recommend dropping
down the timings if you can 15 1536
seems a little bit it's not I guess it's
not the perfect overclock for memory out
of the factory maybe try and get it down
to 4 13 14 13 36 and just leave it at
that I try to do that first starters at
one point two volt but as you've seen
here I've got my memory at 1415 1440 at
2400 megahertz and it's running
completely fine it's beastin it's
feastin and it's winning so if you guys
have any questions about overclocking
memory then please leave a comment in
the comment section below and if you
liked this tutorial please give it a
thumbs up and if you have any questions
or anything yeah you just don't
understand or you want to get your head
around then I'll help you out as best as
I can
anyways if you haven't really subscribed
to a city where I'll be coming back with
more tech videos for you guys and I look
forward to catching you guys in another
tech video very soon and also one thing
I forgot to add was that yeah just I
mean memory overclocking memory is a
little bit more annoying than
overclocking the CPU in my opinion
because even though you might think
you've got a stable memory overclock
it's just more random in general like if
you don't have a stable CPU overclock
it'll generally tell you pretty much
straight away a memory an unstable
memory overclock can do some little
weird things like for instance icons not
showing and so if you've noticed if you
just notice something strange as soon
after you've done your memory over
clocks then in my opinion that's not a
stable memory overclock and you might
want to give it a little bit more
voltage or slow down some of your speeds
or relax your timings a little bit
anyways that's about it and I look
forward to seeing you another tech video
peace out for now bye
