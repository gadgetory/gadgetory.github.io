game is stuttering and you want to know
how you can make it run as smooth as
possible well ladies and gentlemen
you've come to the right video welcome
back to techy our city this is brian
coming to you guys today with a guide on
how to make Skyrim smooth now when I
first got this game yesterday I noticed
that it was running pretty poorly and
this was like just big stuttering going
on also some micro stuttering going on
while I was running around in the open
world map now I did mine it managed to
find a few culprit settings the first
being shadow qualities and I want you
guys to turn this down to medium and or
low depending on the quality of your
computer now my computer is a high-end
rig it's a 5820k and also 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory and a 980 TI and i also
tested this upstairs on my 6600 k
skylake pc as well so having shadows on
medium did help to give that perfectly
smooth experience now the second thing I
want you guys to do is try turning off
hyper-threading now this was interesting
because when I tested my rig downstairs
even dropping down the graphics settings
I was noticing that it was still
stuttering and I was like what could
what on God's earth could be causing
this still so I managed to turn off
hyper-threading and lo and behold the
stuttering went away pretty much
completely then there was another fix
which is kind of not as important as the
previous two but I will still mention it
and that is to actually overclock your
monitor the 64 Hertz if your monitor is
overclockable and then set the framerate
in game to 64 Hertz now you can do this
by installing a program called msi
afterburner but if you do so make sure
you turn the river tuner statistics
server program on as well and that has
the frame rate limiting option in there
now the next setting we're going to talk
about is the included vsync setting
which is important if you are
overclocking your monitor or if you wish
to reduce your input lag I actually
probably should have mentioned this
before installing msi afterburner now if
you've got the Nvidia control panel you
can go in there and you can also just
click on the game in the program
settings and then click on vertical sync
and manually set that to off since this
game does manually have vertical sync on
by default you will wish to turn this
off now another thing is if you wish to
use G sync or free sync then you'll want
to set this setting to actually use the
3d application setting whilst having
your monitors technology on and I will
say on that note that G sync which is
included on my 27 inch 4k Aysen monitor
it works really well like this is one of
the few games where G sync does benefit
a game immensely because if you have G
sync off you will get noticeable screen
tearing but if you have on vsync you
will get a huge amount of input lag with
this game in particular so on all those
were the three main things that I found
affected and helped fix the stuttering
on this game mainly the graphics
settings and the turning off the
hyper-threading were the biggest
improvements in my opinion however on
that note I'll also pull up my graphics
settings for you guys at 4k which is
currently on a 980 TI overclocked to
close to around 1400 megahertz and this
is on a 5820k with 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and now also pull up my 1440p
recommended settings this is on a gtx
970 which is overclocked as well to
around about 1500 megahertz and also i'm
on 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory here as
well so i'll put the specs exactly of
what the rigs I'm using in the
description below for you guys to get an
idea but keep in mind though when I took
the FBS caps off these were running
around about 110 120 frames I mean I was
getting well above 60 in some areas
though keep in mind though I want to
keep my gameplay experience as smooth as
possible so in some areas it may dip
down to 60 and that's the thing with
this game I don't know what it is about
this game but when it micro stutters and
when you get those frame drops it just
brings in stuttering that is terribly
noticeable if that's the way to describe
it sorry guys I hope you enjoyed this
guide if you did then please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions
about it
then please drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can in the meantime
don't forget to hit that sub button and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
review used awesome gaming news very
soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
