people have been speculating left right
and center on AMD's upcoming seven
nanometer CPUs and also their upcoming
seven nanometer GPUs on the Navi
architecture so after CES this year in
Las Vegas we got a glimpse of seven
nanometer from the vaguer architecture
on the Radeon seven and I feel like the
Radeon seven did and didn't deliver what
we saw though out of that was the seven
nanometer was for real the power
efficiency gains of Radeon 7 over the
previous generation Vega cards was
actually quite big however we'll talk
about efficiency later and why it's so
important for the business and AMD in
particular but with that said we've got
the Computex announcement this is the
official press release that we are going
to finally see details on the rise in
3000 CPUs and we're also going to see
details of the upcoming Navi GPUs so
this is the letter here I thought I'd
share it with you guys since with me
personally I love reading the official
news now I think rumors have got to the
point where they're actually just
causing me a lot of headaches personally
and as we saw the NVIDIA GPUs last year
practically no one got that right until
right before the launch and that
everyone was speculating they're either
being gtx 1180 or gtx 2080 and myself
included because in video were just so
tight-lipped on what they were leaking
to the public and one thing for sure is
is that this trend has been continuing
with AMD as well when I spoke to the AMD
guys last year at the event they assured
me that they were cracking down on leaks
big time and honestly I believe we saw
this early in the year when no one
predicted what would exactly come out of
CES to the T but every guys but that
said let's go through this letter and
all the juicy details that you can
expect to be released on May 27th AMD
president and CEO dr. Lisa Souter
deliver Computex 2019 CEO keynote on new
high-performance computing technologies
April 2nd 2019 taipei taiwan external
trade development council tetra
announced today that the 2019 Computex
international press conference will be
held with a keynote by AMD president and
CEO dr. Lisa sue the 2019 Computex

exhibitors across five thousand five
hundred eight exhibition booths focusing
on the latest tech trends such as AI and
IOT 5g blockchain innovations and
startups and gaming and X are the 2019
show aims to inspire more innovative
technologies and market opportunities to
create a new ICT ecosystem so there is
the official announcement itself i've
RSVP'd for this event i'll be covering
it for you guys
at Computex I'm super excited about this
one because it brings a clean break for
AMD to bring out something that the
competitors haven't yet and that's a
seven nanometer CPU but also on the same
token a seven nanometer GPU with a new
architecture geared up towards the
latest and greatest games so this is a
real big one for tech enthusiasts but of
course it remains to be seen exactly
what specifications we're going to get
I've heard rumors about this site can
you run it showing the latest AMD CPU
specs but when I examined that site
closer
it was literally listing two of the
exact same models as a six core and an
eight core CPU so if there's anything
rumors like these really don't hold any
weight to me I'm gonna wait for the
official announcements which when they
do come out at Computex you guys will
know straight away from this channel
right here and it will be the cold hard
truth but as the Computex itself I
literally consider this the best event
for tech enthusiasts and a lot of other
tech tubers will agree even though you
have to fly internationally to get there
for most tech tubers it is just one
really good event with so much
enthusiasts tech so many new concepts so
many custom builds and now it's going to
have some really groundbreaking
announcements to take place as well but
now as I hinted in the intro about
efficiency it's time to talk about that
a little bit more in depth because it's
so important for companies like AMD
Nvidia and Intel to actually focus on
winning the efficiency race and you
probably stopping there in your thing
and well that doesn't make any sense
shouldn't they have the
best performing product and the answer
to that is kind of yes and no of course
they do want the flagship product to say
that they have the best performance in
the market but at the same time when you
think about it let's take for example a
16-6 TTI that was recently released from
Nvidia this cart is the most efficient
GPU out there in that it gets the best
performance per what currently in the
market for mid-range gaming and why that
efficiency is so important for AMD Intel
and NVIDIA is that when we look at that
16 60 TI not only is the performance
pretty good for the price but it now
costs in video a lot less to make it
then if the competitor isn't getting as
good efficiency because think about it
right they now need to put less MOSFETs
make a smaller PCB use less silicon use
less chokes and that also in turn allows
budget orientated users to get away with
using lower rated power supplies for
example and so this in turn helps the
said company to then make more profits
invest more in R&amp;amp;D and so that enables
them to make better architectures for
the future but also step down the node
size and increase the R&amp;amp;D budget to
extract more efficiency so now in
relation to the AMD 3000 series CPUs
it's a big step because what we saw at
CES was huge efficiency improvements at
least from the Cinebench benchmark that
we saw and that they'll posting it was
really good efficiency to the point
where it was beating out of 99 hundred K
now I can't beat X this year the truth
will all be revealed but it's already
looking really good for that seven enemy
to play on the CPU side if efficiency is
really good it enables augmented things
like motherboard prices to then come
down which then enables motherboard
manufacturers to use less components
which then brings down the prices of
motherboards too and makes their whole
new generation even more attractive but
the benefits don't stop there as we said
with the GPU example it then enables
them to use less silicon and extract
more performance but at the same time it
enables places like data centers to
extract more value out of these CPUs
getting more performance using less
power and at the same time less overhead
costs in the actual build up of the
whole infrastructure itself but whatever
the outcome we know the rise in 3000
series chips are definitely going to
deliver it Computex as for the Navi GPUs
that's really remaining a mystery at the
moment I honestly don't know if it's
going to be a mid-range GPU if they're
gonna start out with a high range GPU
rumors have it is going to be a
mid-range GPU possibly even a 3000
series Monica just like the CPUs to then
one up invidious 2000 series GPUs who
knows it's all up in the air as for the
performance of the GPUs on Navi I'm just
gonna wait for the Computex announcement
and I'm just letting you guys know that
May 27th is when I'm really gonna be
opening up my eyes and listening until
then we're just gonna keep hearing guys
who apparently get information from a
source of a source of a source of the
source of the source of a source and you
guys I hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did - be sure to hit that like
button and let us know in the comment
section below
will you be going to Computex or will
you be tuning in to the coverage love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and what do you think about the
new upcoming horizon 3000 CPUs also what
do you think the Navi GPUs would be
called actually thinking about I think
Navi 3000 actually has a good ring to it
who knows what AMD is going to do but
may 27th is the day to keep on your
calendar and with that said I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
please out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
