headphones from a company called moon
tech these are the Zorro HD 2s ladies
and gentlemen welcome back to tech yes
since Brad comin to you guys there with
a review of some headphones from a
company called noon tech now
interestingly enough I'm going to say
that I've never heard of this company
before they asked me to do a review for
their Zorro HD 2s and I'm actually glad
that I now know about these headphones
because they are really good value for
money and not only that they sound good
and they actually look pretty good so
let's take a look at the build quality
and comfort of these headphones so when
I pick these up out of the box straight
away I immediately noticed how
well-built they are they made of like
this hard flexible type of plastic that
actually feels really good and it's
lightweight so if you're wearing these
anywhere you go you won't have to worry
about a heavy neck weight on your head
is actually pretty light coming under
200 grams which is very impressive so
moving to the inside of the headphone
they've got this synthetic leather
material here which feels pretty good i
actually like it and they've gone with a
different tone of color on the inside
here which is kind of like a dark blue
and a light blue for the color scheme of
this headphone and actually when you
think about it i like that they've done
this because if you put the same color
on different materials as you as we know
with pc cases the color generally turns
out slightly different so I like that
they've just done with a different tone
of color and it actually looks pretty
cool if I don't say so myself so moving
on to the bottom of the headphone you
also get a 3.5 millimeter female jackal
3.5 millimeter in which in my opinion
should be a standard on pretty much any
headphone today so great to see that
there they also give you a cable as well
to listen which is actually color coded
to the headphones so nice touch there
from noon tech so looking at the ear cup
itself they've gone with like this black
synthetic leather tie material which is
replaceable and the good thing is is if
you sweat it won't get sticky as well
I've already tested it it also helps
isolate sound as well now moving to the
actual headphone itself they've gone
with a 40-millimeter driver here they
call it the Vatra speaker system and
it's actually legit like it sounds
pretty good
and this is why I like these headphones
not only do they look good and they're
pretty comfortable they also sound
really good but that being said let's
look at the comfort now so you've got
here a slight adjustment on the left and
right which will fit I guess medium to
small heads so if you have a large head
I can't really see these headphones
fitting all too well the clamping
pressure I would say it's about medium
it's not too loose it's not really tight
and on that note you can't adjust the
clamping pressure you probably like what
you can't adjust clamping pressure
anyway but you actually can on a lot of
headphones if they've got metal Clips
like these are ones you can actually
bend the metal and then you can adjust
the clamping pressure however these
things are made of plastic you really
wouldn't want to try doing that on the
final noted comfort they were initially
very comfortable they fit my head nicely
and I found after about two hours of
wearing and my ears started to get a
little bit sore and if I was wearing
glasses it was about one hour so these
would since they're an Anya design I
guess that can't really be helped so how
did the zero hd2 sound and this is the
most important part of the review so
when I initially put these on my head I
was almost blown away it was the sound
quality coming out of these things was
really good especially for a headphone
under a hundred dollars now i will say
before you get into the sound quality
they are an on-air closed-back
headphones so the soundstage is not
going to be the best though one thing to
keep in mind is still pretty good it's
better for instance than some logitech g
2 30's for gamers the sound stage is
pretty decent for a closed-back
headphones it's just not as good as some
of the open or half open headphones that
i have here though on that note the meds
are really forward they're really clear
like if you're doing voice work these
headphones will be fantastic I was
surprised the clarity is so good on
these headphones the base is pretty
tight the trebles pretty smooth and on
that note it's just where it should be
and just the bases just where it should
be if you're listening to rock while
you're listening to the top 40 tunes so
note these things are really good sound
leakage wasn't too bad I was impressed
these things were just a hit when it
came to sound quality and what they are
intended to do so with that being said
let's move on now to a conclusion so in
conclusion what can I say about the 02
hd's will actually quite a lot of good
when I first put these on I was
impressed i mean the build quality is
good they're pretty comfortable and they
sound really good so if you're that type
of person who's in the market for an
on-ear headphone that looks pretty good
in public then these are going to be the
headphone for you they'll keep that in
mind that they are an on-ear headphone
so if you're someone like me and you sit
in front of a computer for hours at a
time then you're probably going to want
an over ear headphones something like
I've got here these are an over here
headphone and in my opinion they're a
lot more comfortable than an on-ear
headphone so just keep that in mind so
if you're after an on-ear headphone
that's smaller more compact than an over
here and sounds really good is really
comfortable and comes under a hundred
dollars then these are going to be a
winner in my opinion so great headphone
I really like what noon tech have done
with these headphones I'd like to see
them release an ovary hd2 that be
actually really good and yeah I'd love
to try it anyway so overall I'd give
these about a 4 out of 5 the start 4 out
of 5 stars they're really good headphone
I really am impressed with them and I
can recommend them so that's it for me

for now bye like straight away I'm going
to say this is what people were probably
getting pissed off about was not the
fact that they were introducing the
option to have paid mods and I think
it's something that could work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
