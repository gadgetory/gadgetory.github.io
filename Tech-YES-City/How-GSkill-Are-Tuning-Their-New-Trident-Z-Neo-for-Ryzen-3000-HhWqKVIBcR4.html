booth at Computex 2019.
And right behind me they've
got some new memory,
that's ready to go for
the new AMD chipsets,
that's the x570 and Ryzen 3000 CPUs.
So what this means is you can expect
eight XMP profiles ready for
those new CPUs out of the gate,
plus a new updated Assetic.
Now what they're doing for this Assetic,
is making it two tone,
you've got steel on the
left and on the right.
However, they make it
two different colors,
as well as making putting
ARGB LEDs across the top.
So, that means they're going
to shine brighter than ever,
and they're going to
use a little less power
compared to the ever popular TridentZ,
which was pretty much a
staple across RGB memory.
It set the president
and it was pretty much,
I believe to this day one,
of the most popular
selling RGB memory modules.
Now in terms of release dates,
you can expect it to try
and get released to market
by that July 7th date for
the Ryzen 3000 series,
but also on top of that the pricing
and the actual exact specs
of the profiles coming out,
still yet to be determined.
G.SKILL is doing a lot of in house testing
with the five different
motherboard manufacturers
to get the best clock speeds
and ensure that they are
getting the best product out to market.
But speaking of the best
product out to market,
besides this memory we're going to look
at some of their hardcore overclocks
that they've managed to get here on air,
where as opposed to last year,
we looked at some of the overclocks
and they were only done
on LN2 and also water.
So this is pretty impressive
stuff with overclocking
and it does show you how much pride
G.SKILL take in their memory.
(upbeat music)
So now for extreme overclocking,
they've got three sets
of memory here running
over five gigahertz at low latencies,
and the funny thing is
this is done on air.
But behind that is
something even more special
and that's a four gigahertz overclock,
over 384 gigabytes of DDR4 memory,
this is the 28 core Zeon
and they've managed to get
this much memory going at four gigahertz.
Now they have used the Ripjaw stuff,
with no RGB lighting, but
another thing is with the timing,
is it going CL18 but the next step is 30
and the next step after
that is 30, then 45.
I've never seen this sort
of combination of timings,
but I believe that G.SKILL
know what they are doing
when it comes to tuning this memory
and trying to get it to
that 4 gigahertz mark
they have to drop some of the sub timings
so it was interesting to
see that those sub timings
were being dropped to,
then not stress the IMC
on that 28 core monster,
as much it should have been stressed
if the timings were lower
and obviously,
you wouldn't have got the
four gigahertz overclock.
But around the corner there's
also the AMD side of things.
So we're going to take a
look at what overclocks
they managed to get with
the Ryzen 2000 series.
And supposedly the
overclocks on the memory
are meant to be even better
on the latest 7 nanometer.
So we'll take a look what they got there
and then see if that's an
indication of what you can expect
on those juicy Ryzen 3000 series chips.
Now moving onto this
side with the AMD things,
they've got a four gigahertz
overclock on display.
Now in house they have gone higher,
but this is essentially a binning process.
What they're showing you
here at the G.SKILL booth,
is how they bin their products,
and what they're obtaining,
when they ship these kits out to go.
So what we've got here
the best case scenario,
for an AXMP and that's 4000
megahertz, 18, 22, 22, 42.
This was done on a Ryzen 2700x
and a ROG Crosshair VII Hero.
So they're telling me back in the studio,
they have a heap of more sets
that will do these speeds,
and so then that's how
you see your XMP profiles
when they're shipped to market.
So now actually stepping
things down in the speeds,
they're actually stepping
things up in the voltage.
So this is 1.4v as the
previous overclock had 1.35v
but there was a difference
in the CL of 14 vs 18
and then some of the
other sub timings were
even tighter on this kit with
14, 14, 14, 34 across the board.
So this is pretty much
as aggressive as it gets,
in terms of a possible XMP profile.
But do keep in mind when you
start going over those ratings,
with the CPUS not every
overclock is guaranteed,
since you then are still relying on
the IMC on the CPU itself.
So again with XMP profiles,
nothing is ever guaranteed
outside the actual spec of the CPU.
But with the Ryzen 3000 series of CPUs
we can expect guaranteed
overclocks of 3200 megahertz
as AMD have laid out in
the new specifications.
Now usually with Computex if
products aren't worth featuring
and they're just simply
boring I don't feature them
but in this case this
professional keyboard
really caught my eye
due to it's price tag,
Cherry MX switches and
it's coming in at 50 bucks
and it was actually
really good build quality.
But I'm joined by Mark
who's going to tell you
a little bit more about this keyboard,
what makes it special
for that $50 price tag.
- [Mark] So this keyboard
is called the KM360,
and it's a Tank Helios keyboard,
featuring Cherry MX red switches
as well as a Cherry MX
black for the space bar.
And it has detachable USB type C cables,
for affordability as well as
the Tank Helios for the
professionals on the go.
And it has the key caps
and double injection molded key caps
in ABS plastic so it's very very durable.
The key cap lettering does not fade away
as with printed or lasered on key caps.
So look forward to this
keyboard at $50 retail.
- And also I did manage to test
out the rigidity on the keys
and they feel really good too
so I'm actually looking forward
to this keyboard combination
with the black on the space bar
and reds on the normal
switches themselves.
But in terms of the back
lighting, it's white LED only.
So they've gone away with
RGB to reduce the cost
and save any software that
you'd need to install.
But you can still change the brightness
on the hardware level
on the keyboard itself.
In terms of a release date it is TBD,
but it is hoping to be out
before the end of this year.
Now the last of this lineup
of professional products
is the MD550 mouse.
Now this is wireless and
you're probably thinking,
okay, what's so special about it.
The actual sensor onboard is made to work
with transparent and semi
transparent surfaces,
which makes it great for business.
So just like that keyboard we saw before,
they're going with a more
professional approach.
Which is pretty interesting
considering you're going
with RGB and fancy stuff
that gamers would want on the RAM
but what's the shift here with this mouse
and what sort of other
additional features does it have?
- [Mark] Well in terms of market,
we want to expand on our market.
And we've realized that RGB,
the latest RGB fad is actually ignoring
and neglecting the business users.
And we understand that the business user
is also one of our focus's
as well in performance.
So in terms of this wireless mouse,
it's duel mode so it
connects via Bluetooth 4.0
as well as radio frequency 2.4 gigahertz
over a wireless dongle that
you can put into the mouse,
there's a slot underneath the battery cap.
- Now in order to do
this tracking it features
the Pixart PAW3805 sensor
so this is made for these
transparent surfaces.
So in terms of a release date,
when can we expect it to be released.
- No release date, TBD.
- Alright, so it's still to be determined.
But they are aiming for
a price point of $30
which is very fair
considering it can do all this
and the build quality is pretty good.
In terms of powering it,
it's powered by two triple A batteries.
And what's the length of those
batteries in terms of usage?
And how much can you expect
to get out of two triple A batteries?
- So ideally if you're using
it for about eight hours a day,
you can expect 6 months of
battery life out of that.
- Incredible that's what we
want to hear as a business user
and someone who just doesn't
want to have the hassle
of changing batteries all the time.
Anyway Mark, thank you for your time.
And that about wraps it up here
for the G.SKILL booth at Computex 2019.
If you guys are enjoying this content
then be sure to hit that like button.
Also let us know in the
comment section below
what was your favorite product or
information here on display,
at this booth here today.
And They also need some feedback,
G.SKILL need some feedback,
on the colors of the NEO,
they've currently considering
red, blue, silver, black, gold
and they've gotta nail it
down to three color choices.
So you guys in the
audience let us know your
favorite color combinations
are in that memory
and maybe G.SKILL can make
that happen pretty quickly.
Anyway with that aside, I hope
you guys enjoyed this one!
