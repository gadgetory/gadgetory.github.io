i am holding the infamous lightning todd
msi is bringing it back with the 1080 TI
and this thing is literally huge I could
probably do a workout with this thing
but let's take a look at this and some
other graphics cards here on display at
Computex 2017
Beibei 2017 Computex coverage for tech
yes city was brought to you by MSI and
corsair for a limited time only you can
get a free copy of Ghost Recon wildlands
4 lakhs edition with any purchase of an
MSA product click the link in the
description below to find out more so
here is the Lightning here in the flesh
I've got a hands-on with this product
and now I got to learn a lot more about
it as well we have three PCI
eight pin connections so this thing will
be designed for extreme overclocking but
also the air cooler is a triple I
believe it might even be bigger than a
triple slot is absolutely huge
you've got RGB lighting on the side and
on the rear of the card and also talking
about the rear of the card they are
putting a heat pipe on the rear of the
card to help with cooling how well
that's going to be in the real world I
don't know yet but I'm guessing it may
do a pretty decent job since it does of
course incorporate a copper heat pipe
directly linked and of course on the
front you have three massive fans with
the middle fan being a 2.0 design so
they're telling me it's a complete
revamp of the cooler and also the fans
and of the rear there you've got your
display out to display up to HDMI 2.0
and one DVI so absolutely phenomenal
card and of course looking at the VRM we
have an 18 phase design 14 plus 3 plus
one for the PLL so three phases of the
memory 14 phases for the vehicle and we
are good to go taking a closer look at
the specs on the Lightning's it comes
with three profiles out of the box this
is silent which boosts up to fifteen
hundred and eighty-two megahertz
there's also the gaming mode where this
is the default out of the box setting
which will go up to sixteen hundred and
ninety five megahertz on the core and
then there is the lightning mode
which boosts all the way up to 17
hundred and twenty one megahertz on the
core the memory itself I'm also told out
of the factory is coming in 11.1
gigabits per second so it is a boost up
on the original 1080 TI now with the
power consumption there is a rating of
350 watt TDP which is a huge 100 watts
above the factory 10 80 TI founders
Edition also included on this graphics
card is of course that dual BIOS which
for ln2 overclocking and in that second
mode you do have pretty much all the
limits removed so you generally don't
have to go back and put on or flash a
custom blast and it's also another good
thing for models in that you don't have
to worry too much about coming into a
bad feed BIOS flash on your card also
with the VRM on this PCB I am told that
it is implementing a dual MOSFET design
so this will help with efficiency and
will lower power consumption even though
that 350 watt TDP is quite high but keep
in mind that the 1080 TI founders
Edition actually utilizes this same
Joule mosfet design and flow frequency
switching so the 1080p I founded in its
own right is pretty good out of the box
looking over the cooling solution you
get to 100 millimeter fans and also a 90
mil fan in the center and with the heat
pipes MSI tell me this time around that
I've included six massive extra thick
heat pipes coming on the front of the
card and also that P plate coming over
the rear of the card however on the
front of the card there is one heat pipe
apparently covering the vrm and if we
did that live stream with Johnny guru
before we'll know that keeping not only
your V core is cool as possible but also
your vrm cooler is a crucial factor in
getting the best overclock as the lower
vrm temperatures are generally the
better that can deliver power to the
vehicle and hence get better overclocks
also this time around MSI have included
RGB lighting both on the rear of the
guard and on the side logo which can be
connected by the mystic lining software
and it sort of glows through with a
clear translucent sort of matte plastic
so it's not in your face and it does
look very subtle though as for pricing
and availability there's no official
word yet though MSI do tell
that later this month they will have an
update on both so stay tuned for that
and also another thing guys about the
Lightning one thing I forgot to mention
is if you guys don't like the cosmetics
with the silver and the black they will
be releasing different kind of badges
here like black carbon and also gold or
red so they will have some cosmetic
options for a graphics card like this
considering it will be the flagship card
so now here we are with MSI GTX channei
DTI a gaming edition and now a new
feature they're implementing on this is
USB type-c so they're bringing that on
this particular graphics card of course
all the standard features will be
available with the gaming card except
you now can get audio and video out of
this thing
via the type-c connector so nice little
jazzy add-on by MSI with the 1080 TI
gaming and thanks for watching guys that
wraps up our coverage of MSI's graphics
cards but Computex 2017 and let me know
in the comment section below what was
your favorite graphics card of Computex
I'm basically waiting on the vega cards
even though they were delayed this can't
be taxed so there was another delay but
I'm really looking forward to what that
brings to the table and of course the
Lightning was one massive graphics card
I personally am a big fan even though
he'd bend in the PCIe slot can get real
with very high graphics cards but it
does have the cooling and it does have
the options to match and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
these are for now Bay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
