between the I $9.99 ATX and I compared
that against the risin thread ripper
2990 WX if you guys haven't seen the
video I'll put the link up here for you
and basically in the comments section
thank you guys a lot for making me aware
of this I would actually wasn't aware
I've been so busy burying my head with
all things tech yeah city in the last
few months that I haven't had time to
basically watch anyone else's videos out
there and in my defense though I do have
a direct contact for PR with AMD and
they haven't sent me any emails relating
to this issue with Windows scheduler
issues or any fixes that could be
applied but basically in a nutshell
Windell and collaboration with bits um
they made a patch or a fix in Windows 10
that essentially changes the way Windows
addresses the scheduling issues in
relation to the rosin thread River 2990
WX if you guys haven't seen his video
I'll put the link up here also put the
link for call prayer in the description
below but a nutshell they found things
were running much better on Linux than
they were in Windows 10 and when they
applied this patch they will then
getting better results in Windows in an
indigo benchmark and so as soon as I
found out about this I immediately
applied the fix and then I reran all my
benchmarks and unfortunately I didn't
find really any differences worth noting
in fact the only noticeable difference
was time spy extreme no longer worked
properly after I applied this fix but
the weirdest thing with time spy extreme
was when I took off the fix and then
reran the benchmark my GPU score was
much higher than it was in the review so
that was the only difference I found
Wendell said it made a difference to
7-zip but unfortunately for me when I
applied this fix it made no difference
in the compression or decompression
numbers and I found when I down clocked
my memory back down to 2133 megahertz
the results with 7-zip scaled in
comparison to your memory speeds which
in that case especially for the
compression side of things in 7-zip does
indicate that it is bound by memory
speeds in Windows 10 now relation to
Windows 10 versus Linux from what I
research Linux is a superior OS at the
core in the way it handles threads it's
memory management basically there's less
overheads in Linux than there on Windows
10 so things will run better in Linux in
comparison to Windows 10 if they're the
same program but without other way
unfortunately we're going to have to go
now the road of politics and I don't
like going down this road
politics is usually he say she say but
it does relate very strongly to this
issue here with AMD and Microsoft and
this is where things get a little bit
tricky because at the end of the day the
2990 W X was a CPU and I remember
clearly being at the launch event and a
lot of the other tech reviewers and
journalists that were there can say the
same thing practically I believe all
those demos were set up as Windows 10
and this CPU the thread Ripper CPU the W
X was targeted towards Windows 10
workstation users so based on what I'm
being fed I then do my reviews based on
the target consumer of these products
and so I can't really change things
around if you guys want me to test Linux
with the 2990 W X I can do that
certainly but please let us know in the
comment section below what benchmarks
you'd like to see or like what real
world applications you'd like to see in
relation to the 2990 W X and Linux
versus Windows 10 I can definitely get
that done for you we'll take a bit
longer but if you guys really want to
see it I'll make it happen but back to
the point at hand
there's CPU the thread Ripper CPU was
marketed as a Windows 10 workstation CPU
and when I am fed that information I'm
then going to compare it against the 18
core Intel 99 80 XE in Windows 10 and
run a variety of different benchmarks
and then basically give someone an
informed opinion based off what the
numbers I've benchmarked are and in that
case of yesterday's video the
recommendation still stands exactly the
same but here's where things start to
get a little bit trickier because an
antic it was spoke with AMD and they
went on the record saying that it is an
issue that they're aware of and they are
working with Microsoft to get it fixed
and so with that in hand you know that
there is an issue with the 2990 WX in
Windows 10 and that really doesn't help
the end user who is looking to buy
either the 2990 WX or the ninety nine
eight exe that doesn't help them one bit
if there's these politics going on
between AMD and Microsoft at the end of
the day a lot of people buying the
twenty nine ninety WX or the ninety nine
eighty XE are doing so they're putting
out a big investment so they can save
time and make that workflows more
efficient and essentially get more
product
she done in relation to their work and
so if there's a flagship workstation CPU
that's been released and six months
later it's still having issues then that
really doesn't look good for AMD
regardless of whether Microsoft's to
blame or Linux is the Sapiro s people
need to get work done and they buy these
CPUs to get that work done faster I'm in
the same boat as the average guy looking
to buy these CPUs hence why my reviews
are always going to be geared up towards
that average consumer who's in the
market just simply for that product
versus another product of a similar
price for example and that's always been
my way when I got into YouTube and I was
doing these videos and furthermore if
these companies are having issues behind
the scenes where they're sort of arguing
and going back and forth and they've got
issues then ultimately it's just the end
consumer that ends up losing out which
is the sad thing so I would like to see
AMD make an official statement on I
would like to see Microsoft even make
their own statement on what is the
progress and what is the real issue here
because they say that Wendell was very
close to the problem but I'm guessing he
didn't hit the nail on the head exactly
to what exactly is going on and I would
love to find out what the issue is so I
could go back in my review and inform
people hey this is currently what the
rise in 2990 w.x is experiencing here's
the outlook for it and when it'll be
fixed but unfortunately we don't have
that information and basically in
relation to the research thing I do what
I can based on what's in front of me as
I said in the intro I wasn't really
aware of this issue to begin with and I
do apologize for that
but at the same time I think AMD need to
get their software developers on this so
they can work with Microsoft and then
they can make a fix happen as soon as
possible so the end consumer can end up
winning instead of losing you guys it's
a very sticky situation people are
saying that Intel could be in cahoots
with Microsoft of course if you guys
have 100% solid proof of that drop links
in the description below
drop comments in the description below
because that shouldn't be happening in
2019 and I guess Microsoft and also
Intel know the ramifications of that but
what is the real issue and what is truly
going on here
I can only
test that when it's coming from the
horse's mouth that is either AMD or
Microsoft directly until I get those
patches applied in Windows officially
and it's supported by AMD and they make
a statement on it then I'm just going by
these sort of fixes that although they
can make a difference I'm sure in my
case of testing it just caused crashing
in times by extreme you guys gonna close
off this video saying that the fix the
core prio fix didn't affect any of my
benchmark numbers in Windows 10 also
thank you guys so much for commenting
and keeping it civil all the time I've
really got to thank you guys because
it's just it's a really good community
we've got going on here and take your
city we share thoughts and their
objective thoughts there's not any
name-calling or anything like that I
really love the environment you guys are
setting up in the comments I'm going to
get back to hustling soon but to answer
some other questions in the comments
below
I used the X 399 as rock fatality board
for the actual testing on the thread
Riverside and now the reason I put it at
3.8 gigahertz was I felt that that was
the best speeds for the practicality
because once I went up to 4 gigahertz as
I said I saw the Palomita that thing
went up to 770 watts for a CPU alone
that's pretty scary even if it was
stable at that I wouldn't recommend
anyone run a CPU with that much
throughput of power day-in day-out
either as a workstation or anything else
that's too much power I thought 3.8
gigahertz was even pushing the
boundaries in terms of the Intel that
went to 4.4 gigahertz with less power
consumption obviously it's got 18 cos
vs. 32 cores so I like to look at a
practical level of overclocks when I do
these tests and hopefully I did hit that
mark in terms of the Zeus X 299 deluxe
to actually use that on the Intel side
not the AMD sides you guys thank you so
much for commenting letting me know
about these issues and also liking the
videos it really does make me happy when
the comments section is as civil as it
is and yes I do apologize once again I
wasn't aware of the core Priya fix at
all I mean I may have seen a tweet about
it but I maybe have been during CES or
something and I just like a million
other things on my mind where I just
probably just flicked through it
something like that but again
unfortunately I'd love to see something
official from AMD and Microsoft in
relation to this issue and until then I
just think we're drawing at straws and I
don't know the exact issue and honestly
I'm not gonna be AMD's beta tester for
them so hope you guys enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button also let us know in the
comments section below what you think
about this whole issue I really love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and of course if you enjoyed the
content enough may wish to consider
subscribing and hitting that Bell
notification as soon as the videos drop
you'll be notified and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
