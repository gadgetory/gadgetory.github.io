and last year we had Tammy,
but this year we've got Sherry.
- Sherry
- How you doing?
- Hello. I'm Sherry.
- Hands off the gold mic.
(beep)
- PC (mumbles)
(upbeat techno music)
- Welcome to Computex 2019 and I'm
here at the Bitfinix booth,
and I'm gonna take you guys through three
new cases they have coming out,
and also taking a look at a concept case
where they actually might
need a bit of your feedback
on what they should do with it.
But starting off with the entry level.
We got 59 dollars for
the Bitfinix Nova Mesh.
Now for an extra 10 dollars they do have
the tempered glass version
coming into 69 dollars,
but I'm told that this
will fit a 360 mil rad
in there at the front where
the push and pull configuration
so you can have three fans
on the front, three fans
on the back, and then looking at the top
of the case, we got the ability
to mount two 120 mil fans.
Now if clearance allows for it.
So if the heat sink doesn't
come out too much, then you can
mount a 240 mil rad up
there as well in a push
or a pull configuration.
However, speaking of the
clearance from the CPU block
to the actual tempered glass
or the side panel itself.
We're looking at 160 mil,
and for your graphics guard
you're looking at about, or
should I say graphic card,
you're looking at about
340 mil clearance in there,
so you can get those
extra long GPUs in there
absolutely no problems.
And at the back of the case
you have room for 23 mil
of cable clearance there
for cable management
as well as having three SSDs,
or an extra two to mount at the back
if you wish to not mount 3.5 inch drives.
So you do get the option to
mount two 3.5 inch hard drives
too in the base down below.
You can also mount the power
supply in the back of the case
and then that towards the
front leaves the shroud
to cover the power supply
so you can even work
with those dirty ketchup
and mustard cables
like I'm used to doing in a lot of builds
and still not feel the affect.
And then the last piece
of this puzzle, of course,
is the front panel, which
is easily detachable
and it is mesh, of course,
to allow for easy air flow.
On top you get 2 USB3 ports
as well as your standard
audio out mic in and your
power and reset buttons.
And in terms of a release
date we're looking
at a Quarter three release date.
Anywhere inbetween those
three months I'm told they are
still getting this to market
and they have to mass produce it,
but they do want to get this thing out
at the start of Quarter three.
The next case that is coming to market
in about Quarter four is the Saber.
This is coming in at 89 USD, of course
features tempered glass on
the side, and on that note
of tempered glass, both of
the cases I'm featuring here
with tempered glass are
going to have four millimeter
thickness, and out the back
of this case is the ability
to mount four SSDs and two hard drives,
so six SSDs in total,
but the differing factor here on this case
is the RGB stripes at the front.
Now this is a dressable
RGB, so you can use this
with five volt controllers
on your motherboard,
and change the affects,
but another cool thing
with this front panel
is if you take it off,
it then automatically
switches the RGB off,
so it's easy to do cable
management, work with radiators,
instead of having to have
an annoying cable hang out
and then have to work with that.
And it does have these side
ventilation there that you can
easily take out and clean if you wish to,
and I'm told it's not going to
restrict airflow a whole lot,
so they have been working on
the designs with the airflow
to ensure that your components
remain cool and still do
a good job of getting the bling right.
Also, another differing
factor on this case versus
the Nova is the ability
to mount a vertical GPU,
and one thing about DOS
filters is that you do get on
both these models that
I've talked about here
DOS filters on the bottom and
top and they're both magnetic.
And then the last of the
cases here is a concept.
This is the Dawn TG, so no
release dates, no prices.
They're just gauging to see
whether or not this will be
a good design or not,
so do let us know in the comment section
below if you are digging this design.
Now the RGB, they still have
to get it to shine through,
but the idea is to have
what's up on the poster board,
and that is the glass on the
back and the front of the case.
Having RGB in a unique
manner shining through,
and of course it's got the
ability to support even more
than those previous two cases
that we've talking about.
But speaking of the previous
two cases, they also sported
VAGX, something that I did miss
out, which is a great thing,
especially for a 59
dollar case, and for guys
who want to mount big serverboards
from the old Zion generation.
Then that's something to
definitely think about to,
but in terms of this concept
it's mainly that RGB lining
that they're focusing on,
and they're getting it in the works,
but if it does have
enough positive reception
then perhaps they'll
put it into production,
and maybe if there is a finished concept
I'll get some shots for
you guys on the channel
and the vlog in the future,
but with that aside, I hope
you guys enjoyed our tour here
at the Bitfinix booth at Computex 2019.

and on that note let us know
in the comment section below,
what was your favorite case here
on display at what price point?
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always.

ready for peace out (mumbles).
- Alright, alright, c'mon,
c'mon. Quick Quick Quick.
Yeah Quickly.
- Peace out for now. Bye.
- One more time one more
time. Go. Energetic.
- Peace out for now! Bye!
- Nailed it.
