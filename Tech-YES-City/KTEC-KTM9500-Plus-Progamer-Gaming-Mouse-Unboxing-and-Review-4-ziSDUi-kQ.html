it's back with the review guys so sorry
I've been gone for a while I've been
busy I haven't had a day off for like
eight days straight so I haven't been
able to get a video out but you know I
guess let's take a look at today at the
KTM 9500 plus K Tech okay this is an
ebay special Mouse basically guys now
it's an ebay special and you basically
you just get a little box no frills at
all so there's nothing about this box
that is special is just a box and a
mouse now let's have a look quick look
so that's what you do when you unbox the
mouse this is all you get just a mouse
in a box
the shipping time took about let's say
about 10 days and it was it's pretty
quick so it's pretty quick coming from
Korea and yeah the that's just what you
get out of the box so let's take a look
at this on the mousepad
and I'll let you guys know the specs
about this mouse too
okay guys so here we have it in the
flesh here is the KTM K tech 9500 plus
so the the names a little bit weird but
it comes from Korea and guys first off
let's just point out quickly the bad it
doesn't have a warranty so if you buy
this mouse and it comes damaged I guess
you know it's an ebay special so it's
gonna have no warranty but that being
said let's look under the plot positives
of this mouse it's only sixteen dollars
and that includes free shipping the cord
strength the cord feels pretty sturdy I
mean it's just the normal standard cord
just like logitech's cord doesn't have a
noise filter but most Mouse is coming
out nowadays and the budget and don't
have noise filters the cable length of
the mouse cord is only one and a half
meters so it's a little bit on the short
side but you know a few boxes located
right next to you gaming then it's gonna
be no problem but basically let's let's
look onto the buttons in the mouse
itself so first off the durability guys
this mouse does feel pretty sturdy so if
I grab it and I try and crush it like
that it feels you know it feels pretty
solid like it feels like a good Mouse
feels like you know doesn't feel cheap
basically
the looks of it you know I'm probably
one of the worst looking Mouse's I've
had it looks pretty bad so but that
being said you know I'm not not really
looking at my mouse when I'm gaming at
all so it doesn't really matter that but
let's look at the debugger so the DPI
goes up to 1600 and it has three levels
so if you click there it will go down to
800 if you click it again it'll go down
to 400 and the the DPI click button is
really solid so it is probably the best
DPI button changing click I've ever
clicked so the DPI itself is really
solid to change I really like that
feature how that put it there and it's
really easy to click and change the
scroll wheel let's go on to the next
part this scroll wheel this is the best
scroll wheel I've ever felt it feels
really good it's really solid in the
rubber grip really sticks to your finger
well now they click on it feels really
good as well so they've really done a
good job with the DPI switching and the
scroll wheel now these two buttons here
this itself this these two these are the
right click on the mount and the left
click they after clicking them for a
little bit
I don't idler they're good like they're
pretty good but then I'd prefer
logitech's left click and right click to
these left click and right clicks this
one's more like a how would you say like
a slam like it's more suited for people
just smashing the mouse and yes it is
suited to art yes so you know you could
see the left and right click as a good
thing or a bad thing I personally think
that it is good fart yes so I will I
will say that this left right click and
left click and I'll click it a bit more
I'll show you guys it does feel good it
just feels like it's a little bit suited
for sort of bashing so it's a weird it's
weird feel but it is good it is good and
if you're playing arts yes this mouse
will look after you really well now
let's look on to other things about as
you can see red optical sensor so you
will need a good mouse pad for this
mouse to function properly but that
being said guys if I move the mouse
around really quickly I can't notice any
skipping at all so it reports that
apparently sick
2,400 frames per second so it is a
really good Mouse it doesn't Simon
notice any skipping at all so it's a
really good sensor in this mouse it's so
yeah one millisecond response time so
it's really good it's really fast and
also in general it just feels really
accurate so the grip of this mouse I've
got a pretty big hand so my hand is 20
centimeters and the gripping this mouse
feels really good so it is really suited
for RTS straight down the line that made
this mouse specifically for RTS and it
feels really good so if you want to play
RTS competitively you don't have much
money or even if you have a lot of money
this mouse is gonna be really good so it
is a really good Mouse so that being
said let's I did weigh it on my scales
and it weighed 84 grams so I believe
this mouse is perfectly weighed it's at
a really good weight for RTS Mouse's too
similar to the g3 which I thought was
really good for RTS as well but the g3
is no longer sold so anyway overall guys
I will give this mouse a 5 out of 5 and
just simply because it's durable it
feels durable the clicks feel really
good this shape is really well designed
for RTS and the basically this sensor is
really good on it too so you know all in
all this is a is a 5 out of 5 Mouse for
value for money the last thing the Bad's
of it is the cord length is a little bit
short at 1/2 meters the the the
cosmetics is pretty damn bad but that's
not to worry and sorry lastly the feet
on it are really good so the feet the
feet are pretty good on this Mouse so
this is a Razer Calathes control edition
and this Mouse really moves well on this
mouse pad so it doesn't have a noise
filter tool on the mouse so but most
Mouse is coming out nowadays don't have
noise filters and especially in the
budget so that's something to know hey
guys if you've got any questions about
this mouse please let me know I will be
giving away two of these Mouse's next
month for my November giveaway and
tonight at midnight I will be giving
away a HKS controller so anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this Mouse review today

this mouse please just send put them in
the comment section below or if you've
got any requests or any videos you'd
like to see please send me
some message and I will try and get a
request done so I guess I hope you
enjoyed this review today and peace out
now
