its back with the review guys so sorry
i've been gone for a while I've been
busy I haven't had a day off for like
eight days straight so I haven't been
able to get a video out but you know I
guys let's take a look at today at the
KTM 9500 plus k tech okay this is an
ebay special Mouse basically guys now
it's an ebay special and you basically
you just get a little box no frills at
all so there's nothing about this box
that is special just a box and a mouse
now let's have a look quick look so
that's what you do when you unbox the
mouse this is all you get just a mouse
in a box the shipping time took about
let's say about 10 days and it was
pretty quick so it was pretty quick
coming from Korea and yeah they look
that's just what you get out of the box
so let's take a look at this on the
mouse pad and I'll let you not guys know
the specs about this mouse too ok guys
so here we have it in the flesh here is
the KTM k-tech 9500 plus so the other
names a little bit weird but it comes
from Korea and guys first off let's just
point out quickly the bad it doesn't
have a warranty so if you buy this mouse
and it comes damaged I guess you know
it's an ebay special so it's going to
have no warranty but that being said
let's look under the positives of this
mouse it's only sixteen dollars and that
includes free shipping the cord strength
the cord feels pretty sturdy I mean it's
just the normal standard cord just like
Logitech's cord doesn't have a noise
filter but most mouse is coming out
nowadays and the budget and don't have
noise filters the cable length of the
mouse cord is only one and a half meters
so it's a little bit on the short side
but you know a few boxes located right
next to you gaming then it's going to be
no problem but basically let's look onto
the buttons in the mouse itself so first
off the durability guys this mouse does
feel pretty sturdy so if I grab it and I
try and crush it like that it feels you
know it feels pretty solid like it feels
like a good Mouse feels like you know
doesn't feel cheap basically
the looks of it you know I probably one
of the worst looking Mouse's I've had it
looks pretty bad so but that being said
you know I'm not not really looking at
my mouse when I'm gaming at all so it
doesn't really matter there but let's
look at the debugger so the DPI goes up
to 1600 and it has three levels so if
you click there it will go down to 800
if you click it again it will go down to
400 and the the DPI click button is
really solid so it is probably the best
DPI button changing click I've ever
clicked so the DPI itself is really
solid to change I really like that
feature how that put it there and it's
really easy to click and change the
scroll wheel let's go on to the next
part this scroll wheel this is the best
scroll wheel I've ever felt it feels
really good it's really solid and the
rubber grip really sticks to your finger
well now then click on it feels really
good as well so they've really done a
good job with the DPI switching and the
scroll wheel now these two buttons here
this itself this these tutors are the
right click in the mount and the left
click day after clicking them for a
little bit I don't I'd look they're good
like they're pretty good but that I
prefer Logitech's left click and right
click to these left click and right
clicks this one's more like a how would
you say like a slam like it's more
suited for people just smashing the
mouse and yes it is suited to RTS so you
know you could see the left and right
click as a good thing or a bad thing I
personally think that it is good fart
yes so I will I will say that this let
right click and left click and I'll
click it a bit more show you guys it
does feel good it just feels like it's a
little bit suited for sort of bashing so
it's a weird it's weird feel but it is
good it is good and if you're playing
arts yes this mouse will look after you
really well now let's look on to other
things about as you can see red optical
sensor so you will need a good mouse pad
for this mouse to function properly but
that being said guys if I move the mouse
around really quickly I can't notice any
skipping at all so it reports that
apparently sick
thousand four hundred frames per second
so it is a really good Mouse it doesn't
Simon notice any skipping at all so it's
a really good sensor in this mouse it's
so yeah one millisecond response time so
it's really good it's really fast and
also in general it just feels really
accurate so the grip of this mouse I've
got a pretty big hand so my hand is 20
centimeters and the gripping this mouse
feels really good so it is really suited
for RTS straight down the line that made
this mouse specifically for RTS and it
feels really good so if you want to play
RTS competitively you don't have much
money or even if you have a lot of money
this mouse is going to be really good so
it is a really good Mouse so that being
said let's say I did way it on my scales
and it weighed 84 grams so I believe
this mouse is perfectly Wade it's at a
really good way for RTS Mouse's too
similar to the g 3 which i thought was
really good for RTS as well but the g3
is no longer sold so anyway overall guys
I will give this mouse a 5 out of 5 and
just simply because it's durable it
feels durable the clicks feel really
good the shape is really well designed
for RTS and the basically this sensor is
really good on it too so all at all you
know all in all this is a is a 5 out of
5 mouse for the value for money the last
thing the bads of it is the cord length
is a little bit short at one-half meters
the the cosmetics is pretty damn bad but
that's not to worry and sorry lastly the
feet on it are really good so the feet
the feet are pretty good on this mouse
so this is a razer goliathus control
edition and this mouse really moves well
on this mouse pad so it doesn't have a
noise filter to on the mouse so but most
mouse is coming out nowadays don't have
noise filters and especially in the
budget in so that's something to know
every goes if you've got any questions
about this mouse please let me know I
will be giving away two of these Mouse's
next month for my November give away and
tonight at midnight I will be giving
away a HKS controller so anyway guys I
