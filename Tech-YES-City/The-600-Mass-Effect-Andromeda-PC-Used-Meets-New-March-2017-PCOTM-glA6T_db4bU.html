6400 tee engineering sample CPU to good
use in a gaming PC that may or may not
rock your world and also finally take a
look at what went wrong with the Zeus RX
course seven Strix
welcome back to check yet city and today
you will get the lot of build benchmarks
explanations and an added bonus
witch-hunt to find out the root cause of
your Zeus Strix rx 470 so starting off
with the CPU this is $100 from
aliexpress.com and at that price it is
quite a bargain though the one I have
here only clocks to three point five
five gigahertz and it needs a very
specific motherboard and within that a
very Pacific buy off I found that the
azrog z170 pro 4 worked quite well and
that was around 160 Stran dollars or
around 124 US dollars I then coupled
that with some kingston om 2166 memory
that I only took to around 2200
megahertz but at low timings this still
makes for a really good choice for a
gaming on a budget at 71 USD or 93
Australian dollars so what about the PSU
well none other than a trusty Delta
server grade power play that I picked up
for around 1050 back in the Japan days
these things are seriously the best bang
for buck sues you will get Bar None and
for the cooling I am using the Zalman
CMPs
10 speed extreme which I picked up for
around 20 USD or about 26 oz e it's big
and does a good job especially for the
money not to mention it looks pretty men
too and for the hard drive I use the one
terabyte to ship but which I got for
around 65 Australian or 49 USD so of
course I would love to pick up use hard
drives except around where I live they
only ever come up incomplete builds so
going you here although not the best
value is a great alternative and one
which will save a lot of time then we
have the case which is the thermal tech
versa h20 5 which goes through a round
about 56 Australian dollars all can be
had for around about 45 USD on Amazon it
is a great entry-level case which got
the job done and now lastly for graphics
I went with the arch for 70 which are
featured in February's use part hunt
flog and honestly I had some headaches
with it though it was only 265 USD when
shipping they will talk about that later
which leaves the total of the bill to
584 USD or 766 Australian dollars so now
it's time to build this thing and then
benchmark it for you guys
like man
I can't wanna feel like man
I just feel like this forever
I love it when please don't touch the
ground you touch the ground that these
doesn't say can i disgust you find my
head
like this just want to feel like this
forever
I feel like this
like that
I feel like this
don't touch the ground
these colors fade kaleidoscopes inside
my head
like horses
welcome
their toll is the benchmarks looked
pretty good once I had finally figured
out what was going on with this build
and I seriously spent like a whole day
troubleshooting this thing from dusk
till dawn and it ultimately had to do
with the RX 470 Strix from a Zeus and I
tried to HEPA different things I put it
in another machine tried different
drivers try to even flashing AV bios a
few times with different mods and even
went as far as to hex out of one bias to
match up the checksum value that still
didn't work and basically what was
happening here from the get-go was very
odd but made sense in the end and when
the first time I ran 3dmark fire strike
the benchmark the Strix are explore 70
would essentially be dropping clocks a
good 100 megahertz even on default and
even on overclocks
which was very odd since I had honestly
not seen this behavior on a graphics
card for a very long time then my worst
fear that this was actually throttling
was true and was finally confirmed after
I had done all this witch hunting the
benchmarks that confirmed it for me was
when I was testing overclocked in Metro
last light which managed to bring the
card to his knees and when overclocked
is locked in a gradual rise in
temperatures and finally the card
tripped out or thermal tripped at around
80 degrees Celsius when the readout was
on the screen which suggests a few
things firstly the sensor isn't as close
as other manufacturers since in the
gigabyte g1 bar for example it has a
target temperature of 70 degrees versus
tricks which had a target temperature of
60 degrees and now as for the g1 will
actually have two of them since they
were the cheapest rx for 70s in
Australia where ironically enough some
of the best rx for 70s out there now
that I have my friend here called
captain hindsight and when testing the
gigabyte g1 I found out they will
perfectly fine it around thirteen
hundred and thirty megahertz with
voltage bumped on both these random
UniGene heavens for quite some time and
only ever reached around 70 degrees C
which is perfectly fine considering my
ambience that are around 28 degrees C at
the time of testing though what about
the is do Strix on the other hand well
in my opinion I think the Strix cooling
is quite simply inadequate on certain rx
470 and now I say this because all
graphics cards are different especially
on the silicon I probably had a poor
example of an ice core 70 that just like
to use more
power add the stock out-of-the-box
settings and this was ultimately just
too much for the Strix rx 470 cooling
solution to handle in the end and also
is the changing the thermal piece in
this case I believe it won't help that
much since the cooler itself is just
getting too hot to handle no pun
intended so I will be revisiting this
with better thermal paste and an Arctic
Exelero to get to the bottom of it all
however what it means is in context is
that some people will not have this
problem at all because the RX 470 sample
they get with the rs4 semi Strix cooler
won't be bad at all it'll be able to
handle those stock clocks and you won't
notice this throttling it's just in the
case of the sample that I got it was
just running too hot or the actual chip
was too much for the cool of the handle
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's
witch hunt and I didn't really speak
about the other parts but for what it's
worth everything except the gravis card
performed really well the case was
decent the power supply and cooler was
smooth and quiet and if you want to know
more information about the CPU
motherboard combo I used here today then
I will drop a link in the description
below so ultimately it is ashamed since
they do have a GTX 1080 Strix here at
the moment and it performs really well
and I know a lot of other Strix cards
are the same the manufacturers make
mistakes here and there and at least
this card still works and you guys
that's about it for today let me know in
the comment section below what you think
of today's build and also if you
appreciate the witch hunts then don't
forget to hit that like button and I'll
catch you guys in another tech videos
very soon peace out for now bye
Oh sometimes it honestly pays to see a
random retail review
I'll see more on baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
