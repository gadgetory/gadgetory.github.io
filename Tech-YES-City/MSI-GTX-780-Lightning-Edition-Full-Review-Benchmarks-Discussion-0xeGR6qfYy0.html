Randy's coming back to you guys today
with finally coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing and review of the
msi gtx 780 lightning edition baby now
this thing just rocked up in the mouth
so the postman was like look when you
want me to deliver this thing I just
said look any time of the day is like
any time of the day how's it yeah any
time today so he delivered to this thing
to me at nine thirty at night because I
wanted to ASAP anyway I know there's
some people out there they're gonna be
same thing and look Brian why didn't you
get the AMD you know 290 and then
there's I know there's going to be some
people in the audience alike gtx 780 you
boy and fist pump and so you know
honestly when you guys get a GD MLG msi
gtx 780 lightning edition for 520 USD
delivered internationally then that is
reason to fist pump so anyway based on
how this thing goes they might even have
to rename this the msi gtx 780 fist pump
edition so as soon as we as soon as i
got this box it sort of it gave me an oz
daljik feeling in that I haven't really
sort of got a box this heavy before like
the box just looks really good before
you even unbox it so there's just so
much detail here it's got a lot of stuff
printed on the box itself but I'll
explain it as I go through the unboxing
here now as soon as you unbox this thing
this is just amazing I'm just shocked
like this is like a collector's item I
mean this box is really heavy it's
really sturdy and it sort of gives a new
definition to the premium products and
you know i think msi this time around
are doing a really good job with their
products i mean you guys know that I got
the msi g45 as it was you know it's a
good it looked like a good value for
money board and it actually turned out
to be an extremely good value for money
board overclocked well did all this well
and then I thought hey the MS I'd
lightnings going for a good price I'm
gonna try and pick it up now basically
before we get into it you know this this
thing just literally just screams
attention
they've really paid attention to detail
with this product here's the first part
of the box here you've got what looks
like a bottom casing so you pull this
out and it looks like you've got a back
plate here so you can attach that to the
actual back of the video card believe it
looks like a black back plate but yeah
I'll actually get on to that later once
of unboxed it all and installed and i'll
let you know but you guys know what it
actually is but then we open up this
side here we've got the certificate of
quality just to let you know that
they've put in a lot of components but
we'll go through what the components are
when we look at the car itself now you
do get an sli bridge with this and also
a 626 pin to eight pin adapters by the
looks of it you also get the CD but
you're not going to need the CD because
you just get your gonna generally
download the latest drivers anyway off
the MSI often the video website so
that's the first part of the unboxing
and my start and God my god this is just
like literally it's like a treasure box
like god damn this thing is attention to
detail so okay so I thought I'd save you
guys some time and I just quickly take
it out of the static wrapping and show
you the card itself so here's the
graphics card itself as you can see here
it is just a mammoth of a card it is one
huge cars the biggest graphics card I've
ever seen the air cooler itself is two
and a half slots now these are the three
fans so this is the new trife Rosa
design from MSI and I must admit it's a
really impressive design i mean the fans
themselves they're big these are ninety
two millimeter fans and these this one
here is an 18 millimeter fan and they
feel really sturdy like there's no shaft
play at all in the fans now another
thing is you could ease up fans are all
independently controlled so you can set
different fan speeds for different
portions so if you're just overclocking
the GPU you can overclock these two fans
and leave this one pretty cool leave it
on a lower state so whatever you want to
do you can do it with this graphics card
now let's look at the cooler on the side
here we'll have a look so you can see
here there's a two and a half slot
cooler and it is just a beast it feels
really well-built feels about one and a
half kilo I'll have to wait and check it
for you guys but
if it is indeed one knife kilo then it's
pretty much twice the size of my galaxy
gtx 670 and it's a lot bigger than my
gigabyte gtx 670 as well so let's have a
look at the rear here now we've got the
as we turn over to the rear of the card
we have the msi backplate and also this
is the GPU reactor basically this is a
thing this is an add-on from msi which
you can remove it lights up blue and it
looks really good as well i'm awesome it
looks really good but also it has a
function and that is it's an extra
filter for overclocking so it's an issue
filter for the power which basically
helps deliver a more stable overclock so
you can remove that if you want to but
I'm going to keep it on the back plate
feels really well-built as well it looks
really good as well over here we have to
sli connectors as well which is capable
of supporting in theory up to quad sly
but you know really i think the video
put a limit of just try sli so it's up
to you guys but you know try us allies
you wouldn't want to go over that anyway
because drivers and you know you think
it doesn't scale at all one super prove
very little once you go past three cards
so anyway let's look at so it's what
nice lightning printed there as well but
looking at the this side of the card now
ISM is where things start to get
interesting this here lights up green
blue and red i think in depending on the
power state it'll light up a different
color so it's really cool you can just
quickly look at your card and know how
much power you're using without a power
meter which is actually a pretty cool
thing this here this little switch if we
look in here that's actually the bios
switch as well so there's actually three
states there even though it is very
difficult to get to the middle state the
middle states are the one on the left if
I flick it to the left that is your that
should default overclocked out of the
factory bios if we push it to the right
that is your liquid nitrogen or
everything unlocked by us in the middle
is a fail-safe bias but i think you're
going to need a pin because you have to
be very careful to get to the middle so
but another way i love this feature
because as i'll talk about this at the
end of it at the end of this video I'll
talk about this car a lot more in depth
but over here we've got 28 pin
connectors as well so basically really
good you know can support and you know
it's got the extra phases in the car
and it needs these power connectors to
deliver more stable pouch i really like
let's look at the front of the card now
okay so looking at the back of the card
sorry not the front of the card we have
three independent voltage connectors
here so one for the GPU one for the
memory and one for the auxiliary so you
can hook up an independent meter and
check the voltages manually if you wish
to which is really good feature you can
see here all the three fans are
connected independently as well so you
can disconnect them if you wish to or
you know do what you want to so there's
as you can see here here's the heat
pumps as well in pro two one two three
four five six seven seven heat pipes as
well I believe that eight millimeter as
well so let's turn over to the rear of
the card now ok so here is the rear of
the card we have for display outs here
we have a DV DV ID this is a dvi-d port
which is your this is the port i'm going
to be using from 120 hertz monitor this
is a dvi-i i believe so both support 120
hertz both the dual link ports as well
which is really good now interestingly
enough you'll probably see here these
are gold plated so that's another good
feature from msi now the hdmi it
supports full hdmi out as well as a
DisplayPort out so that's the display
port options you have there ok lastly i
will say msi also include a 16 plus
three phase power design with this if
you contrast this to a reference design
a reference design is only six plus two
phases so you've got over double the
phases for the GPU and you've got fifty
percent more phases for the memory so
it's really this card is just made to be
a high overclocker also msi include
their dark solid caps as well and a
copper mosfet so they just put really
high components into this graphics card
to ensure the high overclocks and also
to help with long activity of the cards
so really good features anyway i've
talked about off about this card lets
put it in to the computer put it in the
rig let's test it up i'm going to be
comparing this to the overclock gtx 670
and then also i'm going to be
overclocking it and comparing it to
itself so let's get on with the results
alright so now we're looking at the
results here are the first benchmark
being at battlefield 4
DP at Ultra and also when i was doing
these benchmarks it taught me a lot
about the different games i was
benchmarking as you can see here
battlefield 4 is a very GPU dependent
game looking at the results here we've
got the 780 on a custom overclock or the
 and I've got a gtx 780 on a factory
overclocked or the fock and so the
difference between the factory overclock
and the custom overclock was about ten
percent so it was a huge gain over the
gtx 670 as well if you look at the just
factory overclock versus factory
overclock we can see here that we're
getting about a forty percent increase
over gtx 670 which is huge and this is a
gigabyte model as well I'm comparing the
gigabyte model to the GTX 780 and so the
gx7 ad just is a beast of a card my ipoh
is probably wondering what my custom
overclock is when my custom overclock is
1200 and I think it boosted all the way
up to twelve hundred and fifty-four
megahertz with a 49 millivolt boost as
well on the millivolt so I gave it a bit
more voltage and I was mad at the max I
managed to get out of it was 1254 bus
before it started artifacting so it
wasn't mediocre overclock not the best
but certainly not the worst either
looking at Skyrim eternity be ultra here
you guys can probably see there is just
next to no difference at all we got 160
1.08 161 so it even did a little bit
worse when the GTX 780 was installed and
then we had 160 2.72 when 780 was
overclocked so that's the different
results there so as you can tell Skyrim
is a CPU intensive game and one GPU
maxing out the CPU which is pretty
impressive and that's a 4670k by the way
which is the latest architecture so
that's pretty that was an eye-opener for
me how CPU intensive Skyrim really was i
looking at here we got the gtx 670 with
a 9840 on GPA 3dmark11 with the GPU
school getting looking at the 780 it
scored 14 thousand 235 so that's a huge
increase almost fifty percent there and
learn i managed to overclock it i
managed to get the memory also upped but
i got the memory up 400 megahertz as
well so i was running at six thousand
four hundred megahertz
and I got this the clock up to 12 54 so
that was a custom overclock there and
that managed to score 15,000 850 which
is damn impressive and these overclocks
by the way I absolutely know artifacting
I mean some people will get these really
high over clocks and there will be
artifacting during their doing the test
just so they can achieve an epic highest
score but I'm not definitely not going
to do that as his note point but here we
got here unigene Valley I will he saw
here the average frame rate the average
FPS was 102 on the custom overclock and
92.8 on the factory of clock so there
was at least a good a solid ten percent
12 I'd say about twelve percent increase
in frames per second across all
different benchmarks and comparing that
to the gtx 670 again it was a good fifty
percent faster just factory overclocked
versus the gtx 670 factory overclocked
so very damn impressive this crap this
card is an absolute beast I'll talked
about after these benchmarks I'll sort
of talk a little bit more about the card
in different features but I we see here
power consumption was a lot more though
390 in unigene Valley when we moved over
to the gtx 780 it consumed about a
hundred watts more on average my whole
total system usage when I overclocked it
went all the way up to 5 40 that's when
it was peeking out so i was pretty
damning I mean I wouldn't say impressed
but I was surprised at how much power
consumption went up when I put the gtx
780 in mind you the performance is huge
and it's definitely worth it I look at
the max temps this is this is a very
good test to look at because we see how
good the try froze our cooling solution
from msi is this is all with the fan
speed set to auto so I think the max fan
speed was reported was forty-six percent
and even then it was barely audible so
amazing job from the try throes of their
got up to 68 degrees maximum this was
done at about 15 16 degrees ambient
temps and attempts went up to 68 degrees
I've still got another 10 degrees room
there and I can just leave my fans on
auto and not have to worry at all the
factory overclocked ran really cool
maxing out at 61 degrees and only
thirty-eight percent on the fan speed so
I mean if you wanted to go really heavy
on the over closer you could up the fan
speeds to maybe seventy percent and even
then it wouldn't be that loud okay so
you guys are probably wondering how big
is this thing so this is when i'll start
to talk about the card a little bit more
and what impressed me about this
graphics card now i have thought when I
first got my gtx 670 i thought damn this
card was huge this was back last year
sometime in i think may i forgot one
exactly when I purchases but that was
coming from a radeon 5850 and the gtx
670 was bigger than the radeon 5850 now
this gtx 780 is just a beast it's a
mammoth of a card it's longer it's
thicker it just the cooler is also a two
and a half slot so we'll look at the
photos here and you can see that's just
that much longer on the end and it's
also a little bit thicker I believe as
well the actual width of the card is
thicker not to mention the depth of the
card as well is a bit bigger as well so
this card is just a beast when I first
read the reviews and people like oh this
guy's big I thought now it can't be that
much bigger than two gtx 670 but believe
me it is a lot bigger than a gtx 670 so
it's just a huge card I managed to get
on the scales and it did weigh in at
fifteen hundred and seven grams so over
twice the weight of my galaxy gtx 670
and almost two times the weight of this
gigabyte windforce as well so this is
just one beast of a card however it does
use a bit of extra power and one thing
to note is that so pull up to the big
screen for you guys is that is one thing
to note with this card is that does use
the extra power but it does give you
impressive performance figures so the
trife rosa from msi is just one well
built graphics card i'm really impressed
with this card even though i got a
mediocre overclocker it's not that big
of a worry for me i wish i could have
got one of those cards that went up to
fourteen hundred megahertz but once I
started going past about 1260 I started
noticing little bits of artifacting even
if I did up the millivolts 262 that was
the max with the bios I mean I can flash
the bars but there's no point as I'm not
going to need the extra overvoltage as
my card starts to max out its overclocks
at around twelve fifty so it doesn't
like anything above that so every GPUs
unique if you guys want I could make a
GPU over
tutorial more of advanced one in the
future but it took me not too long to
find the max overclock on this thing but
it was a really impressive card and i
can highly recommend this card is the
premium product so this year this is
probably the second best product i've
got the end of Max t40 was the one of
the best value-for-money products I have
bought this year thirty dollars it was
an amazing cooler this product for i got
it for five hundred twenty dollars to
live it off ebay it is damn impressive
so I mean this is the second best
product of board this year and I mean I
just have been buying impressive
products this year and this is
definitely one of them so if you guys
enjoyed this review please give it a
thumbs up and if you have any questions
about this Claude please put a comma in
the conversation below also will say
that when you first start this card up
as well it's kind of like I don't know
if it's just them if they
unintentionally did this but when you
start up the card there's kind of like
this lightning sound as well as like
foods as the fans really spin up really
quickly for a split second and it's
actually pretty cool it adds that touch
to the card not to mention yeah the card
just felt Wow with the build quality
felt impressive and you know the
treasure chest box was another bonus of
having this card my god so highly
recommend this card I mean I'm getting
speeds that are similar to a 780 ti
superclocked so when I overclocked my
780 ti I'm getting speed similar to a
780ti factory overclock so yeah that's
pretty impressive from MSI here so I
mean 780ti is cost me at least eight
hundred dollars in Japan and then again
that's not a superclocked version as
well so really good purchase this time
around I do think the gtx 780 is your
sweet spot card at the moment I mean
it's it's it's just in that league it's
it's a really upper high-end graphics
card and I can't recommend them enough
so I'm going to be enjoying my games
just all maxed out I'm going to plan on
buying a 1440p monitor as well I kind of
want one that at least goes to 80 hurts
I mean I know the 120 Hertz ones are
about a thousand dollars on ebay at the
moment they're just ridiculously
expensive so if anyone knows where I can
get a cheap 1440p 120 Hertz monitor let
me know in the description I'd love to
find where i can get one
as I'm kind of keen to get one so maybe
next year early next year anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this code a little vlog
about this card if there's anything else
I missed about this graphics card and
you pacifically no please leave a
comment the comment section below as
well let people know and also after the
new years so I don't have much time
until new years after years i will start
whatever you guys request and upvote the
most i will start doing vids on that
whether it be benchmarks where the big
tests i will probably be buying an FX
8350 and testing it against the for 670
cares this is just a lot of debate and a
lot of i guess a lot of argument going
on around did not just my channel a lot
of forums i read too so anyway i'll
hopefully i get that done when I can you
as if you haven't really hit the sub
button to i'm going to be coming back
with some more action more tech news for
you guys and hope you enjoyed this video
and peace out for now baronies you bait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
