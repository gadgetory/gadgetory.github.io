booth for Corsair how you doing man hey
I'm good man could I huh I'm just gonna
have to ask for permission to use this
first sorry Brian could I grab the sexy
golden microphone yeah absolutely
yeah hey guys I'm Ross here the Corsair
rep for Australia New Zealand it's a
second this here is a broken ddr4 memory
stick do you know how much this hurts
when this died on me now I've heard
Corsair have the best customer service
in the business I've heard a rumor what
can you do for me
well Brian really sorry that this
doesn't work but we've actually got some
new and improved sexy Ram here and we
don't want you to be going home
empty-handed we're just gonna turn this
off and get you one of these sticks and
here you go you can have one of our
brand new kits of RAM to be taken home
with you
and that's how it's done - brand-new
memory sticks in the back pocket thanks
Ross
yeah noise we look after everybody but
without said let's take a look at these
two brand new Vengeance RGB prior memory
modules now one of these hit the market
or when are they hitting the market what
prices are there coming in at and what's
different about these compared to the
previous gen now I also notice straight
away we've gotten rid of the heat
shrouds and we're going with a full open
very sort of clear RGB design here I
know RGB Corsair it's very important so
tell us more about these sticks so as
you've noticed as well the shrouds gone
and we've just got a clear LED design
there because we think that these are
some of the most beautiful memory sticks
that we've ever produced and we want to
show that off there's ten separate LEDs
inside the stick so you can have multi
zone RGB it comes with 12 installed
patterns and designs that you can have
running through it such as like a
classic rainbow spiral and things like
that but one of the things that we're
really impressed with is these are the
officially the fastest memory sticks
available on the market they'll be
coming at 4000 megahertz and coming in
July we'll have 40 700 megahertz coming
as well so they're extremely fast and
extremely pretty so that's four thousand
seven hundred megahertz XMB profiles yep
absolutely smashing the competition with
that speed you know what voltage that is
running at so these 4700 sticks are
running at 1.5 volt well I'm looking
forward to hitting this stuff up in a
rig so this also comes in a wide
aesthetic to I believe not just a black
aesthetic we got white horses really
covering the market with their beautiful
RGB memory however now we're gonna move
on to panel supplies and Ross is gonna
detail a little bit about the refresh
and the upgrades going on with the power
supplies is a vengeance and in the SF
series now I believe the SS series here
it has the individually sleeve cables
included from the box and you've also
got an AC X bracket so you can put it
into big sized builds if you want to use
it in the future bit of flexibility and
so it's coming in at $100 I believe in
$140 when's the release date looking for
these bounce bloods so these power
supplies should be available in early q3
we're looking for hopefully around July
and you know they're already listed no
longer under NDA and so we're really
looking forward to these hitting the
market and seeing some creative ITX
build
people are gonna be getting them into
also besides that's the vengeance series
as a 750 and a 650 M on display here
being a semi modular power supply what's
new about these power supplies so these
power supplies are kind of like an
upgrade from our previous power supplies
in that kind of price range so these are
now even more efficient they're hitting
that 80 plus silver mark as well as the
fact that um if for all of these series
they also have a zero rpm fan mode so if
your power load is that low that the fan
doesn't need to spin up if you're
looking for that real quiet operation
you can get that so these are great for
things like home theater pcs and on top
of that as well we've got improved
warranty so for the SF series in about
seven years and for the Vengeance series
or five years it's an improvement on all
fronts not just the efficiency you've
got silver on the Vengeance and you've
also got the SF coming in with platinum
yeah yeah that's correct so they're more
efficient than they've been before yeah
and also last question about the OEMs on
these power supplies who are they so for
the SF series we've got great wall and
for the Vengeance series we have HEC
awesome now moving on to cases beside me
here is a special edition of the 500 day
we did review this here on the channel
but this time around you pay an extra
100 USD and you get three ll fans
included at the front and also the rear
of the unit you get the commander Pro so
you can control so you can control all
that RGB goodness and connect it to the
IQ software which has just been
officially released as well so this is
RGB heaven if you want it to be here we
are now with the last of the cases this
is the 280 X and it comes in a black and
white aesthetic there's also an RGB and
non RGB version one coming in at 110 and
also the RGB version coming in at 160
this is already hitting the market now
we'll hit Australia later on in quarter
3 keep you updated also in the outro but
what makes this case so special I mean I
do see there is three pieces of tempered
glass and there's also some updates over
possibly what looks like the air 240 and
I do love the air series but I'm joined
here by Annie nice to meet you and
please tell us more about this case sure
so this is a micro ATX case it's a dual
chamber design so like you said it has
tempered glass on the front so that you
can show off all of your RGB fans the
RGB version comes with 2ll 120 RGB fans
you can
see them here in the front and then in
the back it includes the lighting node
pro controller which allows you to
connect all of your corsair RGB devices
together through IQ you can sync up the
lighting and control the lighting that's
our new software and then this dual
chamber design allows you to hide the
power supply as well as the hard drives
and SSDs in the back chamber here and
also your cabling can go in the back so
if you're not great with cable
management just shove everything in the
back and show off everything you want
with these tempered glass panels so that
about wraps it up for course there's new
products hitting in 2018 I hope you guys
enjoyed this one and also big thanks to
