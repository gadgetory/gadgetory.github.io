was a lot of confusion out there with
Rison though one thing was clear the r7
Rison lineup kicks the pants out of
Intel's Broadway lead lineup especially
for price performance though as for
gaming there was a lot of comparisons
made to the 7700 K and there was a post
on reddit that sum things up really well
the r78 core rising CPUs were never
intended to beat or even compete
directly with the 7700 K I think that's
what the upcoming r5 NR 3 CPUs will be
for as even the 7700 K beats Intel's own
Broadwell e for price performance in
gaming by quite a lot the good thing
however as for current gaming price
performance with rising CPUs
it will only get better and better
especially once the schedulers updated
windows and also some games especially
major titles receive patches and of
course there are updates to the CPU
microcode via BIOS updates that should
fix stability over the next few weeks
and months
welcome back to tech city and I'm just
here to clear up a few discrepancies out
there and to reaffirm that Rison is a
solid product there seems to be a lot of
different benchmarks floating out there
and lots of questions of who to trust
and is person X Schilling and I'm going
to say that everyone that I was talking
closely with prior and post risin launch
our no shells we pride ourselves on
giving you guys honest numbers that are
directly comparing a product to one
another in the same situation with the
same settings as that is what a fair
comparison is all about however there
are results that you guys keep sending
me and saying to cross check and confirm
against my own results and some people
are even going as far as saying mine and
others results are fake and this
person's results are who you should be
trusting so anyway the youtuber known as
Joker Productions made a 720p low
settings video where he claims he tested
the 7700 K at 5 gigahertz and also
tested his r7 1,700 at 3.9 gigahertz and
the results at face value looked very
compelling for the r7 1700 though once I
started checking these results against
my own I noticed some weird things when
I tested my i7 7700 K at 5 gigahertz
with the GTX 1080 on Tomb Raider with
the same settings as Joker reported I
was getting much higher frames than
Joker was then I checked his Tom
Clancy's a division and realized that
yet again the frames were very off so I
decided to manually down clock my 7700 K
to his lowest 4 gigahertz and it was
then that I was starting to get frames
that were similar to what Joker was it's
honestly very confusing but you guys can
be the judge on whether you think that
video was an unbiased and fair
comparison as it looks like one CPU was
overclocked to the max and the other was
shackled in Chains it's almost like
putting the world's best MMA fighter in
the ring with his hands tied behind his
back first another fighter with a
baseball bat the video also doesn't show
any settings used and has some real big
discrepancies it also doesn't show
clocks and more importantly doesn't even
show the final average numbers so people
who own either the r7 1700 or the 77
decay and have a gtx 1080 can't even
check for themselves to see whether the
results are valid also steve from
hardware and box sent me over some of
the same benchmarks for his r7 1700 at 4
gigahertz with ddr4 3000 XMP profiles on
the same gigabyte Horus board with all
relevant tweaks applied for
cross-reference and joker's results were
still slightly better than his were
indicating that jokah definitely used a
capture card and pointed to possibly the
joker used clocks they were actually
higher than the stated 3.9 gigahertz so
either jokers Intel computer was faulty
or there was some other voodoo magic at
play that was causing the Intel rig to
run like complete ass at a so-called 5
gigahertz overclocked or joker may claim
that he was clumsy and made a mistake
anyway guys as for Aizen it will only
get better and better there will be
updates and also as the node matures
overclock should get better - I honestly
can't wait for the R 3 and r 5 to see
what price performance they bring to the
market there is also another option to
disable SMT aka AM DS version of hyper
threading and it will in some games give
you better performance though if you are
doing work on the computer do you really
want to restart your computer disable
SMT then restart it again and then jump
into your productivity applications
seems a bit tedious so honestly I would
just wait for the updates as even with
S&amp;amp;T on in games there was no bad
stuttering occurring or anything like
that it's just in a few games you will
get slightly lower FPS with it turned on
but regardless I will be retesting Rison
and revisit it once a few updates are
released into the wild
but as it stands it still is an
excellent CPU for productivity and a
solid CPU for gaming but when it comes
to giving you guys the raw facts I'm
just going to keep on doing honest
benchmarks and just publishing the
numbers and I know a lot of other tech
reviewers out there will be doing the
same thing and I hope you all appreciate
it any of you guys I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
