gentlemen today on the desk we have here
some specials for you guys we've got a
used rx 570 gigabyte OC Edition now we
pick this up 480 Aussie dollars which in
the US you lookin around 60 USD
if you change our Aussie dollar e dues
into that currency but right beside it
gaming ex-model from msi brand-new in
the box i picked this up for 170 Aussie
dollars on a sale so this is
automatically coming over double the
price of this used X mining graphics
card now even if we had the same Edition
it would be over double the cost because
this was a pretty good deal that we got
but that being said I do see a lot of
these cards popping up for sale at
around the same prices so today what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna test this used
card out then I'm gonna test it verse
this not only the performance numbers
but the temperatures first they're going
to come back and see if we change the
thermal paste on this and also do a few
things how much better it becomes now
first thing to talk about of course
warranty this is brand new in the box
you're gonna get a warranty you're gonna
get an invoice this here you don't get a
warranty like well at least the person I
bought it off just literally wanted to
offload them and the reason they got rid
of them cheap off it was because they
didn't want to have to deal with giving
me a receipt or anything like that they
like look just take this thing and I
don't want to hear about it again and
I'm like whoa but in that case doesn't
work so the first thing about buying
this used card here make sure it works
before you buy it get some sort of proof
if you're buying online make sure you
have some protection if you're buying
online if you are not gonna get a
screenshot of working but that being
said since I picked it up locally I was
able to confirm that this wasn't deep
working before I bought it this one here
of course brand new you've got no
problems you're protected by law in
Australia I believe in the US as well
and most other countries if you buy
something new you've got that peace of
mind that you don't have to worry about
with that said let's put these things on
the test bench and see who's gonna come
out on top
so the first thing before we even get
into the gaming benchmarks is the
graphics card driver won't install
whether we get the old Windows driver
the console Windows 10 or we try to
download the latest AMD driver we'll see
here that it does bring up this message
with an exclamation mark in device
manager this just means that it's most
likely got a different V by Asin in this
case this card was used for
cryptocurrency mining so whoever updated
the BIOS put on a mining optimized BIOS
and so what this now does is renders
this card essentially useless for gaming
in its current state because it was sort
of manually configured and it doesn't
relate to the check sums on the actual
card itself and there's a few reasons
why it doesn't work with the AMD driver
set though how we get around this is we
go to the tech powerup database and we
get the gigabyte rx 570 gaming BIOS and
we can make sure that the card looks the
same and in this case I couldn't find
the gigabyte one so I use the Auris
which is in this case it is exactly the
same card and it was one of those weird
things but what we're gonna do now is
get a program called ati flash and use
that to now flash this back to a gaming
graphics card and then hopefully our our
driver will install just like a normal
card that we bought brand new off the
shelves would otherwise if we don't it's
essentially a useless card for gaming
and we can see right now that the
exclamation mark is now gone and this
card is now ready to rock and roll
Rumble run from Run Robel Robles
so this card right here out of the box
with only a bias flash applied scored a
maximum temperature of 74 degrees and
that happened in Tom Clancy's division
to benchmark so what we're gonna do now
is take it off the bench
give us some tech yes loving and then do
a little before and after
so upon pulling this graphics card apart
we can see right here that the thermal
paste has dried up and this is both on
the die and the heatsink itself so
taking this off and then putting on new
thermal paste is the most important
thing but we can also see just next to
the memory chip here there's some real
weird kind of dirt so we're just going
to use some used underwear since I've
run out of alcohol wipes and just clean
up this graphics card then get the
thermal paste off and just apply some
new thermal paste
so after five minutes this card is now
looking so good
rumor has it though apparently after
some tackiest loving these cards can
perform even better than you that's
right so you see that condition on an
item it says new you've even got a step
above that nowadays check yes loved with
that aside let's see the beautiful after
effect
so we just finished up testing these two
rx 570s one being used the other being
new now in the case of the gigabyte the
performance was pretty much
neck-and-neck with the gaming ex but I
will say one thing I did do a little bit
of research and after we put an aura
spice on this thing apparently it does
give it a bit of a boost over the stock
gigabyte rx 570 so if there's one
difference between those two models is
that this one now with the Auris BIOS is
clocked a little bit higher so it will
help with the performance figures but
that being said the gaming X did do
better both in temperatures and FPS
figures when we were comparing them
after the tech yes loving now the tiger
is loving in this case that's where we
changed the thermal paste and cleaned it
all up it did make a very subtle
difference it was only marginal if we
look at Tom Clancy's division - we got
one FPS higher and we also got one
degree lower I don't really - did show a
three degree drop and giving out the
same results Tomb Raider gave us a very
slight very slight dip in temperatures
but the same fps but this time around
you may be wondering why didn't that
before enough to make that much of a
difference and the answer was simply
because this one wasn't that dirty I
think the person who sold them on really
didn't use them for that long at all and
we can tell by the actual dust that came
off when I was actually cleaning it up
was very minimal and then when we
changed the thermal paste over even
though it was dry it wasn't that dry
I've seen thermal paste just pretty much
crumble as soon as you take it apart
this stuff still had a little bit of
moisture to it so it was still doing a
pretty good job if anything I guess
gigabyte are using decent thermal paste
on their graphics cards - but also when
we saw the neck-and-neck results that
was two different cards that we're
comparing one having a beefier better
cooler than the other so it wasn't
really that apples-to-apples but the
value argument of going used is so good
because we can see the price performance
here is unstoppable it's unbeatable but
we can have those potential problems
like the fact that the v bios was a
mining bias and we had to change it
otherwise would be left with a card that
wouldn't be working properly at all but
now use versus new this ties into the
next video I'll be making with the gtx
1650 perfectly because there's these
arguments at the moment of you know used
RX 570s being such good value for money
and that argument is a hundred percent
true this price performance is just
through the roof right now but again we
are comparing a new graphics card versus
a used one they are two different
markets but in this case of whether you
should run the risk of buying a used
card you always going to run the risk of
I guess more complications happening
with the used graphics card but when we
look at the value proposition I could
have bought two of these for the price I
paid of this well actually probably
almost three I think in Australia now
looking at the AUD pricing so is one of
three cards going to work definitely yes
statistically it's more than two out of
three cards are going to work I'd say
closer to more like nine out of ten
cards are going to work at least in my
experience over new cards like ten out
of ten new cards will most likely work
nine out of ten news cards will most
likely not give you problems that's sort
of like the rough statistics to it but
in terms of the value then that would
become eighty-eight ozzie dollars and
that's sort of the price premium you
should kind of weigh in to use parts
when you're looking to start buying them
yes there is that risk there but over
time especially if you're buying a lot
of use parts that risk is going to
average out and that's going to mean you
are getting much better value for money
anyway hopefully that tech yes math made
a bit of sense if it did then be sure to
hit that like button and let us know in
the comments section below what you
think of used versus new graphics cards
today here it certainly was punching
very in favor of the used especially the
rx 570 this being one of those cards
right now that is very popular in the
use scene and in the new scene simply
because of its price performance but it
is one especially in this terms of this
video I'm gonna be referencing this
video in the 1650 review because there
is something to talk about in relation
to this versus the market and the
sort of especially a lot of the comments
I'm reading you have to stay tuned for
the 16:50 review without aside let us
know what you think of use versus new
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always everyone check us out on
social
I'll put insta Facebook and Twitter in
the description below with that said
I'll catch each and every one of you in
another tech video very soon peace now
for now bye
but yes I am back from I am as well and
in this month's going to be a bit of a
roller coaster in terms of the amount of
tech yes loving that can be administered
on this channel so it's gonna be an
interesting month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
