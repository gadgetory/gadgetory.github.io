got your request to explain as to why
your mouse would not be working properly
so basically it doesn't matter if you
have a Mac or a Windows computer a mouse
is a mouse and it's going to run you
know on any computer if it's USB port
and the drivers support that operating
system so anyway basically there's two
types of Mouse's right you're probably
your problem is most likely because of
this basically there's two types of
Mouse's and I've gotten both here for
you to see this is a laser mouse which
actually uses a laser sensor I can't see
it with the human eye but you may be
able to see it from this camera as it'll
copy the may be able to see the actual
laser now the laser if you can see the
more I pull it back the light source is
still the same strong light source
regardless of the distance which means
that this this will track on any surface
pretty much you can track it on you know
reflective surface it'll still do pretty
well because it's a laser and this is on
the right here this is an optical mouse
okay so this as you can see I can
clearly see this as well it's a red
light especially a red light that if I
pull it away the light source gets
weaker so it's basically the optical
mouse is only suitable for a non
reflective sort of surface okay so if
you use this optical mouse even on this
lack of timber here you can easily see
that the laser mouse performs just as
well as a would on a non reflective
surface pretty much but if I put this
optical mouse on for instance this desk
since this desk is lacking a bit this
optical mouse starts to sort of glitch a
bit so the basically the difference is
is that yeah if you're having problems
with your mouse it's most likely it's an
optical mouse and what you want to do is
you want to get a non reflective sort of
surface for your mouse to work on this
is an actual custom gaming mouse pad and
yeah as you as you can tell it's non
reflective and it works really well both
Mouse's work exactly the same like they
work really well on this mousepad
however this mouse is more versatile so
if you're traveling and you were you
know you didn't have a mouse pad with
you I'd recommend getting a laser mouse
as opposed to an optical mouse but laser
mouse is at the same time are also
generally more expensive because they're
using the laser so generally that's just
in a nutshell what is happening here is
basically you're using probably I
guessing you're probably got one of
these Mouse's that's an optical mouse
and you're probably just using it on or
a reflective surface and it's causing
you problems so those are if you get a
you can either do two things you can
either get a new mouse pad that's not
reflective or you can get a laser mouse
so it's up to you so these are this is
the laser mouse this is the infrared or
optical sort of optical sensing mouse so
they're both really good and when I use
them on this mouse pad they both from
really well so if I use them again if I
say if I use this on the reflective
surface this will perform a lot better
so anyway I hope this has helped you out
tonight and if you got any questions let
me know
and I'll be sure to comment as soon as I
can and if you guys got any other
requests you want me to do and want me
to look into I'll be glad to help you
alright guys peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
