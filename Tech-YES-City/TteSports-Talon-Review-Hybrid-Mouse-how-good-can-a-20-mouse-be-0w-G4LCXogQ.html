was at my local tech store trying to
relieve my addiction or trying to
alleviate my tech addiction I thought
this mouse from thermaltake and it was
$19 it was a Jap in Japanese yen it with
1900 yen which is probably even cheaper
in a dollar equivalent and so I thought
to myself wow how bad or how good can
this thing be for $20 so I decided to
buy it and put it through the test since
I was testing a lot of gaming mice
recently and man this thing surprised me
kudos I'm going to say before we do this
review kudos to Thermaltake for bringing
in a product for $20 that is in my
opinion exceptional value for money so
anyway let's get on with the review and
I'll talk about this mouse so soon as
you get the product I mean the good
experience just starts from the get-go
it's boxed really well it I mean will
take a beating and shipping and it also
gives you a feeling like you're getting
a good product especially one for $20 in
my opinion it comes boxed better than
products that cost twice its price for
instance the Logitech G 302 which I have
to review but on that note when I took
the mouse out of the box I was impressed
yet again the build quality of this
mouse was actually pretty sturdy
I mean this thing weighed in at 104
grams with the wings on and without the
wings on it weighed in at about 95 grams
and now this is an interesting mouse
because essentially it can do a both a
claw grip and both a palm grip and so
for those people who play FPS and prefer
a palm grip this mouse will do that but
probably won't do it as well as for
instance my Logitech G 400 however it'll
still be a great option for people who
want a palm grip or people who
especially want to try out both grips
and don't know which grip they prefer
yet and so when you took the wings off
the great thing about it was it reduced
the weight of the mouse by 10 grams
which in my opinion if I'm clawed
gripping I'd prefer a lighter Mouse also
a smaller Mouse so it made the sides
smaller it also dropped the weight down
to 95 grams which I consider a little
bit too heavy for a claw grip but it's
still at the same time it was very good
I mean it was
in my opinion that was better than the
SteelSeries color which I recently
reviewed so kudos the Thermaltake for
introducing a mouse that does claw
grouping and palm gripping pretty well
for $20 now under the sensor itself when
I was using the actual mouse in practice
the tracking was pretty good it wasn't
as good as my Logitech G 400 and I
couldn't do flick shots as well as my g3
but it was still a great mouse in terms
of the sensors I think it has the AB ago
3050 sensor in there which is an optical
sensor sort of like a budget Abigale
optical sensor though it did a good job
of tracking I didn't notice I mean if
there was angle prediction I didn't
notice it so the sensor itself does get
some points now let's move on downs with
clicking the clicking which is an
important part of the mouse the clicking
was exceptional the very consistent I
believe they put on Ron switches in the
main left and right click which honestly
I love these switches they're very
consistent they sound identical to one
another one I was clicking them in
practice the middle mouse scroll button
that is a little bit loose but I could
still reliably use the up-and-down
scroll function for instance when I'm
changing weapons in advanced warfare I
can reliably use that and not count on
the overstepping or double-double
scrolling the actual middle scroll
button it was a nice click although I
never personally use the middle scroll
button as when I do I tend to actually
move the scroll wheel up and down as
well let's talk about the side buttons
though they've got a solid click to them
and they're actually really reliable and
easy to use in practice it's got the
back and forward if you're using
Internet Explorer or Google Chrome or
your web browser you can use that to go
back and forward with pages as well as
well as assigning them to buttons in for
instance league of legends or whatever
you play you can assign them to item
slots now moving on to the feel of the
mouse which is an important thing to me
this mouse felt fantastic both when I
was palm gripping it and both when I was
call gripping it not as good as my g3 or
my G 400 though they are more expensive
mice however it did feel really good it
felt comfortable the sensor was pretty
good and the Teflon feed on the bottom
of the mouse allowed for it to track
pretty well on generally a lot of
different surfaces so I found myself
being impressed
the build quality and press with
everything on this Mouse it didn't I
mean it wasn't great in everything it
wasn't the best Mouse I've tried but it
was a good Mouse overall it did claw a
gripping pretty well did palm gripping
work pretty well so ultimately it was a
great hybrid Mouse so let's quickly talk
about a few things before we move on to
the conclusion and that is the grip of
the mouse the surface is like a matte
surface on the top there and you can
pretty much it grips your hand really
well it's not too grippy it's not too
coarse
at the same time it's not too smooth as
well you'll be able to grip this mouse
perfectly fine when I remove the wings
of this Mouse it was more of a glossy
feel although it was still very grippy
so it was like they put no lacquer on
their soles gripping this Mouse was
perfectly fine in my opinion now let's
move on now to the lighting quickly
before we move on to the conclusion and
it's got now you can see probably if you
sit in the background here you'll see
that it's breathing that's not
changeable I don't believe there is any
software for this mouse which honestly I
don't like personally I don't like
gaming mouse software I believe some in
some cases it can add input lag so the
favor this has no Mouse software is
actually a boss for me I like it the
lighting effects though it's only a you
can only do it in breathing mode so
that's all you get essentially is the
mouse it'll just cycle through five
different colors in normal operation
however those colors are not just there
for fancy gimmicks they actually
indicate if you actually press the mouse
button they'll indicate what dpi setting
they're using so if you press it the
first time I believe red is for 705
hundred dpi the next color is for 750
dpi and then the next color after that I
think it's light blue is 1500 dpi
then the next color after that is 2500
dpi and then the next color after that
is 3000 dpi
so personally I found myself using 750
dpi in fps and I found myself using 15
dpi 15 hundred dpi in RPS so ultimately
the home settings on this mouse are
really good I think anyone will enjoy
it's got 5 different settings therefore
dpi now also about the cable it's a
braided cable but something else about
this cable impressed me it's very
malleable if you bend this cable it will
pretty much stay in that shape
so I was very impressed with the cable
again I had to remind myself this is a
twenty dollar mouse so it came
feature-packed
one thing I will point out though there
was no mention of a thousand Hertz
poling and it does kind of make a little
difference on the mouse though so it's
only going to run at 125 Hertz as
opposed to most gaming grade Mouse which
will run over thousand Hertz I mean it
might have a thousand Hertz palling I
just couldn't find it on the box
anywhere so I'm going to assume that it
doesn't have a thousand Hertz calling or
at least the option to enable a thousand
Hertz point anyway that being said let's
move on down to the conclusion so in
conclusion what can I say about the
talent man I'm very impressed this is a
$20.00 Mouse that pretty much does
almost everything I mean it's not the
best at everything it's not the best
claw gripping mouse that I've tried it's
not the best palm gripping mouse that
I've tried but honestly it hits all the
marks pretty well it's got a nice
braided cable on there it's one of the
best braided cables I've seen in my life
for a mouse the clicking has got Omron
switches sensors got a navigation sir in
there the clicking on the side is very
solid and reliable the mouse scroll
wheel was pretty decent the lighting
it's useful as well it lets you know the
DPI settings and there's five different
dpi settings to choose from without
installing any bloatware so honestly
what can I say man but I can't be
nothing but impressed with this mouse
it's a great sort of gateway Mouse you
know just like marijuana is a gateway
drug right it's a great gateway Mouse
sort of if you don't know if you like
using a claw grip or a palm grip you can
get this mouse and you can try both help
you might even like this mouse or might
even become your most favorite Mouse out
of all Mouse mice out there so who knows
right
marijuana's some again marijuana it's
some people's favorite drug so who knows
anyway all I'm going to say is I really
like this mouse for twenty dollars
amazing value for money then we'll take
a great job on making an affordable
product that everyone will I'm sure
appreciate the twenty dollars one thing
I will say before I go is this mouse
honestly if you guys want to check out
there's this anchor mouse pad at eight
dollars so if you're looking for a
gaming mouse pad that actually goes
really well with this mouse then you may
wish to check out this I found this was
exceptional value for my
in terms of a nice solid mouse mat it's
eight dollars I believe really good
mouse pad really goes well with this
mouse anyway guys I hope you enjoyed

CT sports that will take Talent please
