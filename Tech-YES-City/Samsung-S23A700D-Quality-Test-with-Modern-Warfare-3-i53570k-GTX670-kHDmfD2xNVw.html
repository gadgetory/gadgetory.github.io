coming back to you guys today with a
quick look on modern warfare 3 so this
is a video game and it's called modern
warfare 3 it's on a my 23 inch Samsung
23 a 700 beam monitor so we're gonna
look at it today and we're gonna look at
what it looks like on this monitor so
basically guys first of all it's on
windowed mode no border because I gotta
use Camtasia to record it and basically
everything is on max except for the anti
analyzing which is on to usually if I
turn Camtasia off I get such fluid-like
frames it's not funny I can't actually
tell cuz I don't know a way of actually
bringing up the frames in this game and
you know I don't play it that much to
really really care so much but yeah
basically guys we're gonna be a maxed at
30 frames because I'm recording with
Camtasia Studio 8 so let's just play
team deathmatch and guys I really suck
at this game so but anyway I'm gonna
show you guys what it looks like but
basically guys I haven't uh sorry it
took me a while to make this video I had
allergies yesterday so I didn't want to
make the video with me just sniffling in
the microphone so yeah but basically
guys if you're looking to get this
monitor it offers an awesome package so
it's a 23 inch mono which is great for a
desktop I'm standing if I'm about 50
centimeters away from it and the colors
for tan panel guys the colors and
everything else looks really good on
this monitor I mean there's reviews out
there that do color tests on it and it
performs really well now it's the best
thing about it is it's got a 2
millisecond response time so it is a
fast monitor so you're gonna get
absolutely no ghosting at all and yes
compared to an IPS monitor it's faster
okay not viewing angles are definitely
not as good colors probably a little bit
a little bit you know better on the IPS
but you're gonna get the more sort of
120 Hertz fast monitor that you you know
it's awesome so the price points pretty
good plus your backed by Samsung now
you're back by Samsung's awesome
three-year warranty on it so sure throw
a granade that's how bad I am guys so
I'm play this in the wall so I'm used to
playing well and the strafe keys are on
the grenade keys
I bet I tell my dpi down for this game
just on the fly from my mouse whoa this
is nasty so yeah and basically you guys
you know I had someone comment on my
Samsung video saying you know why not
buy a car yeah McCarthy from Korea it
looks awesome
like I looked at the reviews on it looks
like a really good monitor I personally
wouldn't take the chance as you know I
need a good warranty and I rather buy
from a local someone local so you know
if you get stuck pixels or dead pixels
you can then get the monitor replaced so
it's you know it's up to you guys but
you know oh shit
so now you can get the monitor replaced
and no problem split see if you buy from
Korea guys and you get a stuffed monitor
you really got no chance of getting that
monitor sort of fixed so yeah I really
recommend that you sort of if you're
looking to buy a good monitor for you
know just for a desktop gaming at 1080p
this one is certainly recommended so
let's try and concentrate and see if we
can get some kills I am pretty damn bad
so don't know hating okay I'll do of I
do have first recon and sort of maps
that are close up like this so this guy
I'm not even used to playing this game
that much so I can't even see if there's
a guy there trying to kill me it's it's
horrible
now I got to look at my radar more so
and that's that's what I'm when you
don't play games like this for like over
a week you just you know really bad but
I am bad at this game regardless as you
can see there
in deathmatch it is fun yeah you liked
it oh yeah give us that awesome gun
all this night is really slow to move
they blonde that's good she's gonna
check
okay let's just camp a little bit see we
can do yeah see you guys highly
recommend smaller though sorry I can't
say it enough and it's awesome so if
you've got any comments guys leave in
the comment section below and I'll reply
as soon as I can and yes I know I'm bad
at this game
please don't say I'm about this game and
if you've got any if one if if you've
got any requests guys let me know too as
I do requests so as this was a request
as well so hey guys keep watching if you
wanted but it's just gonna be me getting
owned so let's have some fun anyway or
me owning can I own that's the question
okay some sneaky guy gonna carry is say
out so just some sneaky guy was gonna
come from there and they will get this
leave this guy oh yeah that's why you
don't stuff around like if your stuff
around you don't get the kill you know
and then if you don't get the kill you
know get the kill so I just quickly I
saw that guy just didn't didn't want to
play around ice quickly killed him yeah
that's how you first recon stalsberg
yeah let's keep y'all oh my God look at
this what is going on here
flashbang
someone here Oh God just just a spray
and pray that's that's from
counter-strike oh my god don't stand in
front of me oh my god it's just like
saying like yeah shoot us both at the
same time get an easy double
Walsh it's
shit
yeah let's kidding I can't wait for
Black Ops 2 as well that's that's sort
of like that's really good and I you
know really good guys and yeah black ops
2 I can't wait for it it's more of a
like a sort of yeah this style map where
everything is closed off you just do
some killing
triple kill I got the triple kill man
that's why I love if I get a triple kill
in one game I'm happy so I really like
getting a triple kill alright guys uh
that's about it for today I'm probably
just gonna log off soon I'm gonna do a
few things I gotta make an SSD tweet
