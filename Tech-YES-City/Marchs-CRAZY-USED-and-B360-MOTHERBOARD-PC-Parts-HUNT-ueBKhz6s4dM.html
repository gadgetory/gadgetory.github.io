gentlemen today we are in Thailand so I
was docked in last night and I was super
tired and pretty much crashed out and
now it's the morning time freshened up
gonna go eat some breakfast and then
we're gonna go hit the streets and we're
gonna see what used parts we can find
now the word is that fortune valley here
in bangkok is the place to go to get
some deals so last time I wouldn't think
we went to pantip Plaza I think even the
time before that we went to pantip Plaza
as well so wouldn't mind trying
someplace new and also last month you
guys requested I do an ink and an accent
I just got no idea how to do that but I
will try that for you since that was the
top up food comment I don't know how
it's gonna go but today we're gonna be
looking for h61 motherboards that's the
most important as a subscriber called
Bret he sent in 5i5 2,400 s so big
thanks for that and of course with that
many CPUs we now have a pent up demand
for getting all these motherboards also
ddr3 memories well so we're on the
lookout we've got some ideas in mind of
course if there's any secondhand gravis
cards snap them up too but I do know
that in Thailand the last time I was
here there was a big mining Crais so
hopefully powers or electricity is
expensive here and then we can pick up
some cheap GPUs because we're at that
breaking
so we just docked into this place called
fortune town and it is pretty big like
it's one massive mall except there's
only two floors that are dedicated to IT
as my first time being here so it's a
little bit exciting there could be some
good deals here but at the same time
could also be a bust so let's go take a
tour on these two floors and see what we
can find
so now I just got done scouring the
third and fourth floors of fortune town
and for news parts unfortunately it was
a bit of a boss we'll talk a bit about
that a little bit later but right here I
managed to pick up a be 360 M - a from a
Zeus so there's one store just had these
sitting on the shelves and I'm like what
I haven't heard anything about these yet
I haven't read up any solid rumors about
when these boards are hitting the market
and this guy's just got him sitting on
the shelves two models he had this the a
version which has four slots of memory
and has dual PCIe nvme and also HDMI out
and then they have the K variant which
is a bit cheaper but it only has two
slots of memory and one PCIe nvme so I
guess that answers the question of other
beings 360s coming I'm guessing they're
coming very soon because no other store
was selling any of these on the on the
shelves so pretty crazy because I'm like
not under NDA I don't have any idea when
these series of motherboards are coming
out but in regards to the use parts we
asked around all around the stores and
they all pointed me towards this j1
they're all like yo go to j1 they've got
the used parts they just got everything
you need I go there and he starts
pulling out like these dinosaur
motherboards LGA 775 boards and he's
like how much do you want for that he's
like a thousand bar which is like $40
I'm just like dude I'll give you 400
baht which is like $15 and he's like no
no no no no so I'm just like well I'm
gonna head over to pantip Plaza and also
palladium Plaza because I know they got
deals there and I'm gonna start hunting
and that's exactly what we're gonna do
right now so let's get it on
after looking around here on the top
floors we did find one motherboard and I
bartered them down from 1800 baht to
like 1000 baht so that would be like 30
something dollars I think this is for a
H 55 M asrock motherboard so LGA 1156
pretty damn good considering you can
whack in one of those 34 forties eons
and you've got really good performance
for the dollar now there are some other
stores here that did have some good
motherboards but they were asking way
too much in my opinion like the asking
like 1500 but they wouldn't budge and I
think at that price you can just head
over on Aliexpress and get the board's
delivered to your door for cheaper so of
course I'm always looking for those
deals and now with this deal I actually
didn't buy it yet because I was just
gonna sort of lay by that deal maybe
that's a new meta going into 2018 just
lay by your deals where you go around
and look at the next place which is
where we're gonna go now and that's
palladium Plaza so we're gonna head
there see if we can find some deals and
but on another note I did see two other
stores here so I think opened my mouth
too soon with that other place of for
toontown there's two other places here
selling that B 360 motherboard from a
zoo so only two other places there was
no other places and for some reason it's
only the zoo's models so not sure what's
going on here but you can definitely buy
these boards on retail shelves here
maybe I'll kind of hoping I'll see some
gigabyte models and msi and Azeroth
models on the shelves but okay maybe
they're just shadow launching these be
360 NH 300 series motherboards who knows
so now here we are back at n Tech and
it's really good this place I found my
way back here I've scoured the fourth
and fifth floors at played in Plaza and
it's actually quite funny because
they're in the elevator they've got the
sixth floor that's coming soon but
that's been coming soon for over a year
so perhaps they just canceled off the
soon and put never in front of their
coming but right we've come to a deal
here with five motherboards and two
sticks of ddr3 and because I'm starting
to need memory just as much as I'm
needing these motherboards and so we
struck a deal for 6000 Bob which would
be a little bit under 200 USD it's
probably about two hundred and maybe
twenty Australian dollars so it's
looking like a really good deal
and they're even just letting me now
hook these motherboards up and test them
out so let's go through all these
motherboards and see if they all work
so now we just finished off at ntek and
that just went awesome that was so much
better than expected because I ended up
getting two in total for motherboards
and a gigabytes of RAM for like five
thousand bucks so that would be around
about a hundred and fifty US or in
Australian terms close to like two
hundred Ozzie dollars and what we got
was a h77 motherboard and I didn't even
realize this but what happened with the
h77 was they swapped it for a h-60 one
because two of the h-60 ones didn't work
and now I didn't realize what was going
on until I went to the p55 motherboard
and I noticed the power hole power
switch had been switched off so one of
those heat 61 motherboards must have
blown out the whole powerline and I
really wanted that p55 motherboard to
work because that was like the cream of
the crop so we ended up switching the
power back on and the p55 worked and I
was over the moon because that was like
the the gem of all those motherboards
and so we ended up yeah getting to h-60
one of Zeus motherboards a h77
and a p55 and a gigabytes of RAM so that
was just an amazing deal and so I might
go grab that as rock haitch 55 m from
the other place if that works and then
get back to the hotel because I'm really
satisfied with the deals I also asked
around about the B 360s and why some
retailers were selling him and the other
retailers just had no idea they've got
no idea when they're coming in stock
either so that's a really crazy bizarre
thing that's going on and I don't know
maybe I'll ask around and see who knows
any answers to this this is a mystery
that needs to be solved
so just got back into it ended up being
a really good hustle thanks to ntek
they're just awesome to deal with if you
guys are in Bangkok you want to check
out some used parts definitely go there
they're at the Palladium Plaza so that's
in wherever the town is it's just called
palladium Plaza it's near Panda Plaza so
just check that out if you are here and
you want to check out some good use
parts but we went back to that place and
to get that hatred t5 motherboard and
they said to me we want 1700 baht
Nightblade no way we agreed on a
thousand baht I showed her the 1000 baht
and she said no how about we do 1500 and
I'm say what I got a thousand baht for
you and that's what we agreed on then
she's like no 1500 now I'm just like see
ya knows you've jumped in a taxi and
bailed so back at the hotel now and it
ended up being a really good hole got a
gigabytes of RAM and five motherboards
so for a total I think it just came
under 400 Australian dollars so that was
really good and yeah we've got that p55
I'm over the moon about that because
it's a really solid board also ntek they
had these um I know the mining things
kind of dying down but he had these
really good shelves for him and he was
selling him for like $60 or something it
was incredible oh he was like oh do you
want a review one I was like I wish I
could but I couldn't get that back on
luggage for my suitcase but yeah if you
got mean I mean you're probably the same
if you're travelling to Thailand you're
probably not gonna be picking up a
mining mining chassis but yeah it was
really cool I asked him though if he
could do a custom motherboard a
benchmark tray for us because I love the
look at that and he could get the black
acrylic and put that as sort of a cable
management to hide cables so gives me
some ideas he said he might look into it
if I send him the design the maybe when
I'm back at home I might look into
making something because I wanted to
make a benchmark rig with two computers
connected to each other so like one
benchmark rig two pcs got some crazy
idea going on but but also you're
probably wondering asked on Twitter if
people wanted me to check out some other
things they said people save graphics
cards thanks for the recommendations I
checked out graphics cards and CPUs and
honestly guys they're just a ripoff here
they probably like the gum tree sellers
in ours that are just asking too much
money that
around about your starting point and
then you've got to try and barter them
down and of course I tried that failed
so it's like now look when I get back to
Oz I'll hunt some graphics cards and of
course leapin used they're just much
cheaper off Aliexpress to to get the
CPUs the memory I did try hunting more
memory because I do need ddr3 memory and
pretty much ntek was the only good deal
I got solid deal I got on ddr3 so that
was a thousand bar eight gigabytes and I
am running out so I do need to keep
stocking up ddr3 whenever I can yeah
guys that pretty much concludes the use
Potts hunt for March it's been a crazy
journey here definitely hustled around
all of bangkok city to get the deals and
just really tired now but also the bee
360s I asked around at different
retailers and I'm like yo you got some
b-36 T's in stock maybe something from
gigabyte or something from ours or
something from MSI no like not we don't
know anything about this and I was kind
of like okay and yeah two other
retailers at the Panda Plaza have the B
360 azuz in stock so not really sure
what's going on there
Steve on Twitter he did mention that its
NDA so there's that but anyway if it's
out in the wild I didn't sign the NDA so
I don't know anyway guys I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now and I hope you enjoyed this
one as well too and don't forget to hit
that like button if you can and yeah
catching another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
so I need to do a little bit of the
practice for the next month's gum to the
part hunt to get the deals with the oom
