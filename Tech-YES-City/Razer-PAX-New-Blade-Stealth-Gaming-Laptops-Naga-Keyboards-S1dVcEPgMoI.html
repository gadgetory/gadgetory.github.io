joined by vincent how are you I'm good
how are you really good man Jun just
loving packs I see here the razor booth
is looking off the chain I'm absolutely
loving some of the things you do and you
want to talk about these little laptops
in the background here sure of course
yeah so at PAX we've made some pretty
big announcements for our laptops our
razor blade and our razor blade stealth
I'll start off with a razor blade
basically if you guys are already
familiar with our notebooks we've are
always focused on form-factor thin and
light systems and that hasn't changed
with this new refresh and update so
what's changed in the new razor blade
we've actually switched over to the next
generation of Nvidia graphics which is
the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 Pascal
graphics card so this is a desktop grade
graphics that we've managed to fit into
our form factor jassi's without having
to you know make it thicker or sacrifice
any of our iconic razor designs so I'm
sorry they're definitely looking very
thin you guys are packing GTX 10 60s in
these thin ones - yeah yes that's right
and and because they are GTX 1060
graphics you're capable of pushing VR as
well so on a very portable and light
system you can run HTC vive oculus
directly off the system wherever you go
and basically the only gaming station
but it's also if we are ready station 2
you know I only got the cosmedix today
you've also got the power to back that
up
exactly and that that's always been our
philosophy for our laptops is you want
that power and performance to strike
that perfect balance there and some
other changes with our new razor blade
systems is we now increase the storage
capacity options to one terabyte so we
have 256 gigabytes 512 and then one
terabyte and that's PCIe I've got two
SSDs at rates wow so you're checking
them to hit up twos and those things
yeah I'm not too sorry it wasn't rate
it's just M that is by itself and also
16 gigs of ddr4 memory as always
then the introduction of a new display
option so as you guys know we had the
qhd+ displays with touch screen we still
have that with the next generation
blades now with the new generation we
also introduced the option for a full
sheath so that's a non-touch display but
it's a really great looking display
perfect for optimized gaming so if you
guys want to have the best gaming
experience we have the folio definitely
covering a lot there on the laptop side
of things what about other products so
you guys got excited about coming into
quarter for maybe 2017 is there anything
that's coming that you're really excited
about well I mean we do have a lot of
plans in the works I mean we've been
expanding on top of the other release
announcements we made a pax like we have
you know a partnership announcements
with main gear so we have the manga
razor editions we have the antic cases
as well the mini ITX cases we have we
also just announced a new razor or not a
keyboards as well I have the show so we
have and a lot of this products like the
Bing gear those are available now but
like the antic cases those are coming in
October so we have a couple of things
kind of coming up that will be available
fairly soon definitely notice that main
gear I went over their booth before they
definitely put out some very nice pcs
over there so glad to see that you guys
have teamed up with them and also notice
some of these overwatch headsets and
stuff is that an in-house razor think
coupled with Blizzard yeah no yeah we
partner with Blizzard this is our our
licensed razor products with overwatch
headsets overwatch keyboards mice mouse
pads they've been really great they've
been one of our top selling license
products people love them and you know
of course like with an integration of
chroma not only is the keyboard you know
licensed has a overwatch keeper but even
the effects of the keyboard are synced
up with a game with a razor razor chroma
integration so you got you know as soon
as you start up the game you can change
the theme of your keyboard automatically
to match the game's theme say characters
can we expect some very cool lesion
products to hit the market with that
green thing going on with lesion and
notice of razors got the green thing
going on there so I would you know I
would think we would have stuff like
that in a work so I don't I can't I
don't have the information to really say
for certain but you know that's always
something you guys can look forward to
you know
well definitely with lesion it's a big
hit on the manga people loving
this expansion pack now notice this
razor arena as well going on some of you
want to comment on that as well yeah
razor arena is our online competitive
platform that we're developing for you
people to easily create their own you
know online competitive games or even
offline like here at raise packs so we
have a stage of a six versus six for
overwatch and you know it will we have
support for multiple games with razor
arena so it's a it's a really user
friendly easy to set a platform for
people to just do their own tournaments
run their own games however they want
and you know we have this same set up
here at packs of our people to
experience that as well so definitely
thanks for the coming out and taking the
time to do this interview Vincent and I
hope to see some awesome more razer
brats hitting the markets very soon so
