thermal paste and you're hungry well
let's find out if a one dollar piece of
chicken can solve your problems
or better yet can some Vegemite help
cool that CPU down let's find out
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes City this is brian coming back
to you guys today with a very unusual
video this time we're going to be
talking about thermal pace and if you
run out of your traditional thermal pace
that's your MX for your artic silver 5
or whatever you use can you use
something in the meantime to bridge that
time between you waiting now and
ordering something so today we're going
to go through the contestants which are
chicken tomato sauce mayonnaise nothing
toothpaste and then last up Vegemite and
we're going to compare all the temps and
see which one scores the winner out of
all these household other or
miscellaneous items
so first up here we have the 7-eleven
chicken which costs around a dollar
fifty and then we have a feed and then
we use that oil from that chicken to
then put on the CPU cooler and see if it
acts as a good thermal paste and with
this piece of chicken we scored sixty
degrees at four gigahertz on the 5820k
at one point one two volt at 17 degrees
ambient temperatures so the next batter
up here is tomato sauce and this will
set you back around about one to two
dollars depending on where you live and
I think I've got an 800 ml tube here so
a lot of this stuff largely for a very
long time putting that on the cpu we
managed to get 59 degrees at 18 degrees
ambient temperatures this is after 10
minutes of I 264 on full load there on
the 5820k with the nm ax T 40 might add
so tomato sauce definitely did pretty
good but again those hygiene or
long-term use with this I'm not sure how
that would play out
so the third contender in line here is
the mayonnaise now we've have heard
stories about mayonnaise being good as a
thermal paste and I just decided to get
to try some generic stuff that I got
from the supermarket
by the way I do love my mayonnaise and
putting this on the cpu here we managed
to get 61 degrees at 18 degrees ambient
temperatures there so losing out against
the tomato sauce however scoring a tie a
net with the chicken there the oil so
mayonnaise not too shabby
so the fourth contender we have up in
now is nothing at all a lot of people
are saying look if you're doing a
controlled test you
to just test no thermal paste at all so
we just got a bare-metal on bare metal
and after 10 minutes and night of 64
this scored by far the worst thus far at
76 degrees at 18 degrees ambient
temperatures so I do not recommend using
no thermal paste at all it is by far the
worst options so far so the next
contender we have here is the much
requested toothpaste this has even got
some whitening in there so it may even
make your CPU a bit shinier after a few
days usage and here we had 61 degrees at
18 degrees ambient temperatures there so
again coming in a tie with the
mayonnaise and the chicken there so the
toothpaste didn't do bad as well however
I must have met with the toothpaste it
did let it let off a pretty good smell
after I pulled the heatsinks fan off so
coming in last now for my fellow aziz
down under is the Vegemite this is just
putting a dab of this on the cpu there
and we managed to score 61 degrees at 18
degrees ambient temperatures there so
the Vegemite again tied with all the
others except tomato sauce however let's
find out the last test here and that is
the mx4 so now i trusty arctic mx4 this
is renowned around the internet as being
some of the best thermal paste you can
get now trying this after about 10
minutes i 264 100% load we got 58
degrees at 18 degrees ambient
temperatures here and now contrasting
this and just pulling up a shot there of
all the contenders for you guys we can
see that the mx4 beat the tomato sauce
by one degree now tomato sauce did very
impressive it beat all the others by
around about 2 degrees so if something
is to come out of all these benchmarks
than it is that you should have at least
something in between that CPU and the
CPU cooler personally if you've ran out
of thermal paste and you're waiting in
the mail to get some then i personally
recommend using a bit of baby oil in the
time being as that will not risk
shorting anything out on your
motherboard and you know it'll do a
decent job of cooling as we saw with the
fried chicken there which even had some
food thrown in so any guys that's about
it for me today if you like this video
then please give it a big thumbs up and
I will catch you guys in another
video very soon and also don't forget to
check me out on Twitter and subscribe if
you haven't already for more juicy tech
news and reviews and gaming and all that
goodness
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
