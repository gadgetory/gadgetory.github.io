Barone's coming back to you guys today
with a video on how you can spot a fake
SD memory card or any memory card for
that matter the easy way now there's a
lot of fake SD memory cards going around
on the internet they get sold they're
counterfeits they get you know
especially the expensive brands like
SanDisk samsung so here's a fake one
here so a fakes and a Samsung memory
card and the easy way to tell instead of
comparing them side by side and looking
for the minor differences and flaws the
easy way to tell is to get this program
called crystal disk marking now I'm
going to put this in the link I'll put
this in the description below below the
link for this program and just download
this install it and then open it up here
so you just open it up so it's made by a
Japanese guy and I use this to test all
my SSD benchmarks and I figured hey why
not use this to test memory cards so
basically just install this program open
it up insert your memory card in and
connect it to the computer and then once
you've done that I want you to simply go
to one so we want to do this one time a
thousand mega 1000 megabytes is good one
gigabyte is good it tests these you know
consistent read and write speeds of the
memory card and here I have my Plex ah I
have that inserted in its F Drive so
select the drive you want to test and
then hit sequential that's the only
button you need a hit and we'll test the
sequential read and writes and so it may
take a little while it may take five
minutes and that's what you do you hit
there hit that button and as you can see
here it's preparing the SD card and
that's what you do so let's get on to
the next video I'm going to show you the
three memory cards that I had and
actually two of them a fake and I'll
show you the results after the memory
cards so two of these memory cards are
actually fake we've got here this
samsung micro SD the SanDisk standard SD
and the Alexa platinum 2 SDHC so I think
this is SD HD as well but two of these
are fake and there's an easy way to tell
and I'm going to show you guys now so
after running the tests on each card
separately we found that the Lexx are
platinum 232 you give my model
even with data on it about 20% of the
data field it still managed to get 20
megabytes read speeds and 19 megabytes
write speeds and if you guys put these
things in your DSLR cameras or recording
on them then the write speeds are pretty
damn important
so the second card here is the SanDisk
Extreme sixteen gigabyte will so-called
SanDisk Extreme that actually empty that
was an empty card and that managed to
get sixteen megabytes per second read
speeds and only nine megabytes per
seconds write speeds now this is not
it's advertised as a class ten product
which means it should be at least
getting ten megabytes per second write
speeds and it's not so this means that
it's pretty much a fake and it's pretty
damn close like it's a pretty good fake
and I have to admit admit that this
almost came close to the 10 megabyte
write speeds and that's I mean most
people are gonna put this card in their
camera and probably not notice that this
is a fake however the benchmarks don't
lie and this is not a class 10 product
the next card here is the Samsung 32
gigabyte class 10 micro SDHC card this
was as you see here the read speeds were
actually pretty decent I mean 18
megabytes read speeds but the write
speeds were horrible it only scored 6
megabytes per second on the bright
speeds and since its advertised as a
class 10 product their class 10 means it
essentially should be at least writing
at 10 megabytes per second guaranteed
and this is not doing that and it's
clearly a fake so in hindsight you can
see that the to a more expensive models
that were fakes performed worse
you know on the right speeds not even
half as good as the Lexile Platinum to
you and the lesser platinum to is a
mid-priced memory card and the good
thing about it is it's just the Lydia
are you getting a legit product I think
in recommendations I'm gonna say unless
you need these extremely fast write
speeds or these extremely good products
and you're willing to pay the money for
a legit one from the store from a
trusted store or online store then I
recommend go with mid-range cards
because there's not going to be many
fakes of them about
the Lexile platinum - is I don't know if
there's any fakes of them out which is
one of the reasons why I bought this for
my Canon camera as it was pretty much a
guaranteed I'm not gonna get a fake but
yeah these are the two cards I bought
these off the internet and they're both
fakes and it's really sad you know it
really sucks when you get a fake I
actually got a refund for this Samsung
the SanDisk Extreme I didn't actually
know this was a fake until recently when
I tested it now so I bought that a while
back so but yeah it's pretty
disappointing when you get these cards
and you actually test them so this
program is a solid way just to test if
the memory cards fake and to know if
that seller or that online store is
selling bad fakes good fakes in this
case yeah these fakes were actually
pretty decent so I'm pretty surprised
anyway so yeah the Lexile platinum 2 is
not a bad memory card it's only only
cost me twenty to twenty dollars twenty
dollars for a 32gb model and it's right
speeds are insanely good so works on my
Canon camera flawlessly it's a really
good card I can recommend it and yeah
guys so if you have any questions about
this overview and how to spot fake
memory cards please leave a comment the
conversation below and I will get back
to you as soon as you can if you guys

fake memory cards and also if you
