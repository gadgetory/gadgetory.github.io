coming back to you guys today with a
review of the gigabyte r9 290 now this
is an AMD graphics card and as you can
see here it is one big graphics card now
you guys are probably wondering you
haven't tried an AMD graphics card in a
while and yes I haven't however when I
saw this thing pop up on Amazon for two
hundred and fifty five USD with free
shipping I was just my jaw dropped I
mean you're getting a flagship card for
$250 that's really good value for money
however I did have to pay a little bit
more in shipping and import duties since
I do live in Japan however it still
worked out a lot cheaper than I
otherwise could have got this thing
domestically for anyway well today we'll
be having a look at the graphics card
I'll be benchmarking it talking about
how I think it compares to the GTX 970
I'll also be making a separate video
comparing this graphics card directly to
the GTX 970 as I do believe they're two
of the best graphics cards out there at
the moment and also be telling you guys
some extra Augmented things with the AMD
graphics cards there's still a few
little things that I nitpick however
they're not such a huge issue but anyway
let's get on with the review so if
you've followed me for a while you'll
know that my history with AMD ATI
graphics cards is complex to say the
least I've either had problems with
drivers cards overheating or cards just
simply not overclocking at all however
I'm pleased to say that this is a
different experience and it has in ways
renewed my faith with the AMD ATI
graphics section of their company
however let's look at this card directly
at the moment so this is the one
kilogram beast now this card is actually
pretty heavy it's a lot heavier than my
GTX 970 that I have around here this
thing weighs in just over one kilogram
so that at that weight it is pretty
heavy it's actually a really solid build
card but looking at the front of the car
we can see here we've got three eighty
millimeter fans they're also they do a
fantastic job of cooling by the way they
also don't get too noisy though past
about 50% they do start to make a little
bit of noise so be careful therefore you
hate noise they've got the here the
steel shroud here this is actually made
of steel so it's not plastic
I like what gigabyte have been doing
with this lately as the GTX 670 I had
years ago that actually had a plastic
shroud on it this feels a lot better
gives the card a more solid feel makes
it look better you've also got this wind
force logo sticking out here which I
personally don't really like a lot I
think the GTX 970 implemented the wind
force logo a lot better than this did
however looking at the slide here we can
see that the shroud over extends the
side here and actually looks cool we've
got an 8 pin and 6 pin connector at the
side here
that'll give this card ample power for
overclocking if you need to add the back
we've got the shroud slightly coming
over and this isn't much of a problem I
mean it is a bit shorter than my GTX 970
this measures in around about 280
millimeters let's look at the rear of
the card we've featured here no
backplate personally I do like the back
plates that gigabyte have been adding to
their cards lately I would like to see a
back plate on this card as well the back
plate or no back plate it doesn't really
bother me too much as I buy a graphics
card for its performance not it's looks
anyway looking at the back it does look
pretty cool here you've just got a
mountain of resistors on the back here
it's got a black PCB as well which
actually looks pretty cool looking at
the rear of the card we have here two
DVI connections here they're both two
DVI
dual port connections as well no DVI a
which is interesting so something to be
mindful of there you've also got a
DisplayPort here and you've also got a
HDMI port here so connections is pretty
good I personally like to see a DVI a as
I meana some people might want to
overclock this thing and use an analog
input also some quick features before we
move on to the benchmarks this card
itself it also has the ability to use
our AMD's mantle and it also has the
ability to use AMD's HDL trueaudio so
where process is the audio off the
graphs card itself so anyway without
further ado let's move on now to the
benchmarks
okay so let's move on now to the
benchmarks and I'll put my description
for my rig in the description below for
you guys it's a 5820k clocked at 4.2
gigs
I'm also running 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory clocked at 2.4 gigs and the rest
of it's in the description below if you
want to check it out
also another thing that's very well can
actually concerns me about the r9 290 is
before I reviewed this card I actually
spent a long time gaming on it because I
wanted to do this review for you guys as
best as I could people were telling me
for a long time try out the r9 290 from
a good vendor and I consider gigabyte
one of the best vendors out there and
something I noticed about the UH 1990
was when I initially benched it - when I
benched it two weeks after using it it
was using I mean the benchmark scores
were lower and I couldn't I just can't
get my head around this anyway I'll talk
about it a bit more but let's get on now
to the benchmarks that I did before I
took it out of my computer and this was
done on a fresh install of Windows as
well so anyway let's move on now to
Battlefield 4 1440p ultra on the test
range here the GTX 970 scored 110 point
8 frames per second and then the r9 290
out of the box scored all the factory
settings scored 78 point five six so it
actually got quite a beating in
battlefield 4 moving on now to Crysis 3
1440p ultra now this time I decided to
max out everything people like look man
your Crysis 3 results before vary a
little bit high so I decided to max out
everything and man does this put a lot
of stress on the GPU the GTX 970 out of
the box called 35.9 to average FPS and
the r9 290 scored twenty nine point nine
six so both of these graphics cards were
getting a hammering in Crysis 3 I'm a
three this is mainly a CPU bound game
for what it's worth as if you guys saw
my comparison between the 5820k and for
670 K the 46 70 K was beating this
because it was clocked 400 megahertz
higher so for what it's worth it's still
very CPU bound even at 1440p on ultra
but it managed to score 70 3.8 frames
per second versus 69 point 3 6 and while
I'm pointing it out with the CPU bound
thing I'll show you later when I do to
show you the initial benchmark scores it
doesn't make sense but anyway UniGene
valley extreme HD
preset the 1080p schools I've thrown the
uh nine to seventy out of the box in
there for reference but you can see here
both these cards are in a different
caliber to the online 270 with the r9
290 scoring two thousand five hundred
sixty five when it was overclocked to
1089 megahertz and the RAM I also
managed to get over a gig out of the RAM
so the overclock on this thing I'll talk
about a little bit later too but it was
pretty impressive
yeah GTX 970 overclocked as well that's
called 2638 the uh nine to ninety out of
the box scored two thousand three
hundred fourteen verses the GTX 970 out
of the box which scored two thousand
four hundred and thirty six so let's
move on now to the fire strike scores
everyone loves to do a fire strike
benchmarking it's a good reason it's a
really GPU intensive benchmark so here
we have the GTX 970 out of the box
scoring twelve thousand two hundred
right on the flat line there and the r9
290 out of the box scoring ten thousand
four hundred ninety eight so both these
cards did really well in fire strike
also the r9 290 when I overclocked it
it's scored eleven thousand six hundred
again was weird it was right flat on
eleven thousand six hundred with the GTX
970 overclocked scoring thirteen
thousand two hundred and eighty nine so
both these cards did really well in fire
strike let's move on now to overclocking
with Crysis 3 so this is a bit of an
anomaly I mean this is pretty funny but
again this was just such an intensive
game on the GPUs the GTX 970 overclocked
managed to score forty point three six
as opposed the uh ninety to ninety which
scored thirty two point zero four moving
on now to the GTX 970 out of the boxes
scored thirty five point nine to first
at twenty one twenty nine point nine six
was I showed you guys before so
overclocking battlefield 4 here is
another game which is pretty GPU
intensive for what it's worth the GTX
970 overclocked scored 120 point zero
eight versus the UH nine to ninety
overclock which scored eighty six point
seven four average frames per second so
in battlefield 4 is a clear victory for
the GTX 970
let's move on now to power noise and
temps so this is power consumption this
was measured from the wall on a 650 watt
bronze earth watts power supply and we
can see here that the r9 290 out of the
box this is with the 5820k which is
quite a power
consumption beast in terms of CPUs so
it's good 570 watts from the wall this
was in unity and I did these scores in
UniGene and the 970 out of the box
called 480 both these cards on idle were
actually really good they showed really
good power consumption on idle mainly 30
watts over the 467 TK that would be
mainly for the due to the 5820k but for
what it's worth it used up about an
extra 90 watts on load then the GTX 970
did I went to overclock these the GTX
970 actually scaled better than the r9
290 with the r9 290 scoring 615 watts
from the wall as opposed to the GTX 970
which I need not to 505 watts let's move
on now to temps and honestly with temps
this was done at ambient degrees of
around about 15 degrees Celsius or was
pretty cold in here but the GTX 970
did I mean this was overclocked I
decided to show you guys the overclocked
results 60 degrees overclocked
I mean the cooler didn't even get hot
this is after gaming sessions as well
the I mean the GTX 970 they all run
pretty damn cool and they're not card
they're not hard to keep under control
the r9 290 was kind of an interesting
thing because when I tested this card in
the benchmarks I mean it didn't even cap
74 degrees on the on the ten rings in
MSI Afterburner
but one thing I did notice after using
this card in heavy gaming sessions after
a long time was that the cooler got
really hot to touch and this was
something that I wanted to point out
because I don't know ms I mean sorry AMD
where are they putting their temp
sensors because I mean it was getting
like sizzling hot to touch with my
finger but the temps were still reading
like around 70 degrees so I'm kind of
scratching my head about the temps there
because my GTX 970 if I touch it anytime
like in this about 15 degrees ambient
temps it's just really cool I could
leave my finger on there all day every
day and not after it's just literally
really cool to touch so the uh nine to
ninety after a heavy gaming session
especially in advanced warfare that I
was testing that out recently it just
got really hot to touch and so it makes
me wonder if AMD are putting their
senses right on the core of their
graphics card
so that's something I'll point out
because if we look at here the initial
benchmarks this is before I got the
graphics card before I used it for a
long or for a while this is when I first
installed it I ran some benchmarks and
as we can see here this is the UH ninety
to ninety when I initially got it it's
got ninety point four eight and now
before I did the benchmarks after two
weeks I tried everything reinstalling
the drivers everything like that to no
avail
my installed beta drivers as well I was
getting the same scores of getting lower
scores than when I initially got it so
I'm kind of wondering what's going on
here why is it scoring ninety point four
eight out of the box it's beating its
own overclocked settings so it's
something that I'm scratching my head
about look at Crysis 3 this is when I
initially got it thirty point thirty
four point one thirty three
it's beating the overclocked scores why
is that
same with ARMA 3 and then now ARMA 3 is
the most interesting thing because it's
called seventy eight point seven two and
my four point two gigs 5820k and I know
this is a CPU bound game so I'm kind of
wondering what's going on here with the
AMD r9 290 there's it's it's weird like
it shouldn't be the graphics card
because I know this game I overclocked
my GTX 970 and I was getting the same
results with ARMA 3 I wasn't getting any
higher scores so it makes me scratch my
head what's going on with ARMA 3 yes so
anyway that's something I'd like to
point out another thing that I'll point
out before I get to the conclusion is
the stuttering the AMD my crostata it's
something that it's a it's the reason
why I left AMD graphics cards and I went
to Nvidia graphics cards years ago I'll
show you I'll pull up a simple video
here this is me opening a video on
Windows and on the armed it on the AMD
and this is it's 60 frames per second
from my camera 720p and then I'll run
the same video playback on my GTX 970
and you guys can see if he self this is
just a simple video because I noticed in
some games there was some micro
stuttering mainly mean here is a new
earth had it the triple-a titles didn't
suffer from this my crostata
but something that concerns me it's
still there to some degree I mean AMD
have gotten a lot better with their
drivers but it's still there something
that does bother me but anyway with that
being said there's the two video files
I'll move on now to the conclusion where
I'll talk about a lot about this
graphics card in death
so in conclusion what do I say for 250
USD if you can pick an online 290 up for
that price then it does get recommended
it's a good card it's just not a great
card so if you guys have skipped at the
conclusion then i really suggest that
you do watch the benchmarks section
because that's where i've explained all
the anomalies of this card but I'll give
you guys a quick recap if you didn't
basically this card it ran better for
the initial like when I initially got at
the benchmarks ran better than when I
tested it two weeks after using it in
heavy gaming sessions so that was
something that really made me scratch my
head especially the ARMA 3 benchmark
which I know is a CPU bound game for
what it's worth
so something was really was weird that
was going on there I don't know what it
was but coupled with the fact that
there's still that micro stuttering it
still exists especially in here as a new
earth which is a game I play regularly
it was still there I mean I showed you
this the video where it's just a simple
video of me watching a video my intro
the one that you no longer you can no
longer see but is the initial intro
where it sucks in you can see that it's
got a little bit of stutter on the AMD
and on the Nvidia absolutely no stutter
at all that's just a simple example in
some games it has this micro stuttering
it still exists it's basically a driver
problem because in triple-a titles
warlords of draenor and advanced warfare
this card ran is smooth as butter on
1440p it was a really good experience
and so Andy have come a long way since
when I used to use them back in 2010 but
it's reasons like the micro stuttering
it's reasons like the two weeks lower
benchmark scores is the reason why I
switched to nvidia and i've never had a
problem not one problem with any nvidia
graphics card i've used over the past
few years the game you know the
overclock well they've run cool and
quiet and then there's another thing
about this card and that's even without
the overclock settings applied the card
was in advanced warfare was getting
sizzling hot to touch like really damn
hot i'll surprises like what's going on
here this is it like 15 to 18 degrees
ambient temps in this room so this card
gots sizzling hot you know like and then
the tempura dings will like on 60
I think they'll just just a little bit
over 60 degrees like 64 degrees so it
makes me wonder where AMD are putting
the temp sensors on their grabbers cards
are they actually putting them inside
the cause or are they putting them after
the cause sort of right near the cooler
I don't know I'm not too sure but it
does raise some concerns honestly should
you overclock this graphics card I'd
save a 24/7 gaming no I'd say it where
it's at out of the box is probably
around the sweet spot even in the summer
get probably a bit hotter so I'd be
concerned but honestly look let's look
at it this way for $250 USD it gives
really good scores so this is a 1440p
card it'll play games exceptionally well
at 1440p and then yeah I mean and then
the stuttering I mean if you're playing
triple-a titles you'll have a great time
on this graphics card so for me honestly
though if you guys are asking me for a
personal recommendation
I mean having experienced what I've
experienced with AMD ATI graphics cards
verses and video graphics cards
I recommend paying the premium for the
Nvidia graphics card as I always do now
I don't even bother with AMD graphics
cards but you know and I want to bother
I know if you guys have watched me for a
while I want to give AMD a chance all
the time you know I love the fact that
there's competition out there and these
guys are trying to give you guys good
value for money it's just like there's
just these issues that seem to never go
away with an AMD graphics card and it's
kind of it just makes me wonder like AMD
just come clean don't try any trickery
or anything like that and try and work
on your drivers a bit more because yeah
I don't know anyway so on all you guys
can take it as you will
out of this review I mean look I'm gonna
make a separate video comparing this to
the GTX 970 and at the end of this video
I'm going to also run a heap of new
games as well so I'm gonna be running
warlords of draenor and you will a
Warcraft game I'm gonna be running
watchdogs I'm gonna be running shadows
immortal and advanced warfare so there's
some new titles in there that will get
stressed I'm dropping Skyrim and I
dropped it in this video as it's pretty
much just a CPU bound game even at 1440p
and also I am dropping ARMA 3 as well
but
cuz that's pretty much cpu-bound because
i want to be testing 1440p i also still
be doing 1080p for when we gets through
those real low low to mid-range budget
cards of what it's worth this is a 1440p
card it does get a recommendation at
around 250 USD if you can pick it up for
that but you know is it is it the GTX
970 killer I don't think so because some
issues that I pointed out in this video
but anyway guys if you enjoyed this
review if you have any questions which
I'm probably sure you will then please
drop a comment in the comment section
below and we can discuss things as
always I love discussing this with you
guys and if you haven't ready subscribe
to take your city where you guys get the
truth and you always will get the truth
anyway I hope you enjoyed this review
and peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
