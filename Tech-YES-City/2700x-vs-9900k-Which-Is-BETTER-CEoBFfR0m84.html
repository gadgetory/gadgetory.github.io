horizon 7 2700 X and comparing it to the
I 999 hundred K and what we have here is
two CPUs that really are worlds apart in
pricing honestly the appeals straight
away with the 2700 X is there and I
would say it's there for the majority of
people it comes in at around $300 u.s.
includes a very nice RGB cooler which
does a great job of taking the CPU to
four gigahertz day-in day-out and the
best thing is you can couple it with a
be 350 motherboard granted the
motherboard supports 2000 series chips
and you can call it a day knowing you
are getting phenomenal performance for
the dollar that will play games well and
do productivity tasks equally as well
now before we get a little bit more in
depth I will say that there are cheaper
rise in 1700 chips out there going for
even less than this they represent good
value on the surface though personally
I've used a rising first series 8 core
in my main workstation last year for
quite some time I even had it
overclocked to 4 gigahertz and I feel
like the rise in 2000 series processors
are a step up in many ways first of all
they clock higher in general and they do
so at lower voltages this means less
power consumption and higher performance
they also have lower latencies this to
me was a big one and was noticeable in
everyday tasks especially when you are
plowing through a lot of actions per
minute whether it be mixing music to
editing videos it does add up over time
in my opinion so although the value
appeal is there the rosin 2708 is just a
more desirable chip then it's 1000
series counterpart and I feel is worth
the premium though the 9900 K it's just
been released and it's one Hot Chip all
pun intended it can easily go over a
hundred degrees even with the
out-of-the-box settings with a solid 240
millimeter all-in-one cooling solution
like the cooler I use the corsair h 100
i pro for example the temperatures were
very hot and in this particular case I
am NOT comparing coolers to one another
so I didn't use a static fan speed also
most people I don't have their CPU fans
running at 80 to 100 percent at all
times I mean if I did I don't know how
you guys would watch videos if I
recorded them for you because I just
simply be bombard in your is non-stop
ladies gentlemen we are now approaching
Texas City before we begin our descent
make sure your seats and gpus are
position don't want that note out of the
box settings it will get to 4.7
gigahertz with ease this is a 9900 K and
at these levels it will produce quite
fast numbers beating the 2700 X in games
and productivity though doing so at
nearly double the cost then you have to
factor in more expensive costs involved
with a bigger cooling solution better
motherboard and also possibly a higher
rated power supply - and in doing so the
appeal does start to wear off a bit in
my opinion the power consumption over
time will also mean more money spent
daily on the electricity bill and let's
face it electricity isn't cheap nowadays
especially after the cryptocurrency
rained the scene for over a year and
more and more people are accessing
things like air conditioning and having
Auto appliances left on in their homes
all the time though let's talk about
gaming specifically frame rates were
higher in general when I tested the
1080p settings and this was tested at
low by the way which I doubt only the
most competitive of pros would actually
use me personally even in a game like
Call of Duty Black Ops 4 for example I
put my settings on high because it
allows me to see things easier in this
particular game and when we do start
increasing the graphics and turning up
settings then the power of the graphics
card then takes more of a strain and we
see the frame rate gap start to close
quite fast and this was tested within a
Zeus RTX 20 ATT I pretty much the best
card you can get out there at the moment
for gaming so the Rison 2700 X is still
a solid choice for gamers and the better
news is if you are streaming from the
CPU then the 2700 X will yet again do
very well in this particular toss so
unless you need those frame rates
desperately then AMD solution is one
that has a lot of appeal especially when
it comes to value though under the next
factor and this is productivity here's
where the 9900 K does score more
victories though they aren't a whole lot
more if we were to look at the raw
benchmark numbers it only comes out on
top by a marginal victory most of the
time and I'd argue the real benefit of
the 9900 K versus the 2700 X is actually
the ring bus verse saying cause and it's
infinity fabric the ring bus
architecture is the snappiest CPU
architecture out there at the moment not
just because of its higher
clock speeds but also because of the
designer self it beats that of Intel's
own mesh architecture but as we have
seen in the 8700 gave us the 9900 Kay
video if you haven't seen that already
I'll put the link up here it comes at a
cost of poor scaling in that when you
add more cores and threads to this
architecture then the heat dissipation
and also the power consumption start to
go through the roof of the IHS like
literally this thing gets quite hot and
Intel raise the t.j.maxx thermal
threshold on this chip to a hundred and
fifteen degrees Celsius which I'm not
sure if that's a good thing in the long
term as most people I know don't even
like running their CPUs above eighty
degrees for a lengthy amount of time
however when we move over to AMD Zen
core architecture these are the cores
going in the Rison 720 700 X for example
we can see that AMD is utilizing smaller
silicon die size areas and then
interconnecting those by what they call
the Infinity fabric this design itself
has some great benefits especially when
it comes to the likes of scaling as
we've seen in their higher-end CPUs like
the 29 50 X or even the 32 core 2990 WX
for example
also since the inherent die size is
smaller they do benefit from running
very efficiently and also very cool and
so you don't need a massive cooler to
keep these things under control as
witnessed with the 2700 X and it's
included cooler they also tend to run
pretty cool in terms of their overall
temperatures compared to the Intel
counterparts however one disadvantage to
this architecture of course is that
there are increased latencies across the
calls themselves they do have to talk
across the Infinity fabric this does add
up the more cause and thread you
introduces seen in the 2990 WX AMD
themselves are doing however a fantastic
job of shrinking the note and also
increasing the core counts as time
progresses so ultimately though when it
comes down to it the 2700 X is a big
value play represent some of the best
value we have seen in the CPU market
ever and it comes so it being a very
practical CPU with IPC that is so close
to that of Intel it's not funny AMD also
have their seven nanometer rising two
chips ready for 2019 so that isn't that
far away and we could possibly see a new
king of main strain desktop lines when
it comes to a PC when that drops but
until then the 9900 K is the
strange King that does come at a
considerable cost if you need this extra
speed and are willing to pay for it then
be my guest but if value is your main
concern then the 2700 X is the winner
he'll anyway guys hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button let me know in the
comment section below which would you go
for at the moment the I 999 hundred K or
the Rison 720 700 X love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
