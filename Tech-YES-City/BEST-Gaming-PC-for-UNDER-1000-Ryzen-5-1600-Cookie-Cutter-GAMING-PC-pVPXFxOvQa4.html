risin cookie-cutter PC building today
I'm just going to do just that and give
you the best parts for the best money
welcome back to tech city this is brian
coming to you guys today with a pc that
comes in at nine hundred dollars it
features a six core 12 threaded cpu it's
going to be overclocked and you're also
getting a really tight graphics card in
there the gtx 1070 so the performance
for the dollar is insane with this build
but without further ado let's take a
look at the parts list and then we'll do
the build and then the benchmarks so the
cpu were using the arisin 5 1600 this is
hands-down one of the if not the best
value for money cpu out there at the
moment it comes included with quite a
decent cooler and is overclockable and
has six cores and twelve threads it is
an absolute beast in gaming as well and
productivity and for two hundred and
twenty dollars you just simply cannot go
wrong and then with the motherboard we
can couple that with an inexpensive be
350 motherboard and still overclock I
opted to go with the fatality which does
have a heatsink on the v RM and does
have good onboard audio and then with
the graphics card we're going with a gtx
1070 these have come down in price
recently to the point where you can pick
one up for around three hundred and
fifty dollars and at this point they
provide exceptional price performance
and even start to go into high-end
gaming and for the power supply we're
going with a 500 watt 80-plus power
supply this will give us enough juice
for all our components
even when overclocked and for memory
we're going with a 16 gigabyte ddr4 kit
so make sure you get to a gigabyte
sticks as this will enable the memory to
run into your channel mode which is
quite important for performance I went
with some crucial memory that I do
recommend you just grab the cheapest
option available as memory is quite
expensive at the moment and with the
case we are using the Corsair spec one
this is a really hard-hitting
entry-level case
it's currently $50 and you can also pack
a lot of components in there it even has
a little bit of cable management room
and the included fan is actually quite
decent and you get a side panel so you
can invite your filled once you've
finished it and then the last component
we're using is a Seagate one terabyte
Barracuda really good price performance
and the read and writes are very
consistent and now this brings the whole
total of this bill to nine hundred US
dollars or if you're in Australia around
about twelve hundred and ninety
Australian dollars
now a Slovak locks on the CPU we managed
to get 3.8 gigahertz on the horizon five
1600 on a be 350 motherboard with a
stock cooler now you may want to go
higher if you want to but I don't really
recommend it with this combination of
parts as the stock cooler will start to
get overwhelmed by heat if you give it
much more voltage which you generally do
need going past around 3.8 gigahertz on
Reisen and also the be 350 motor boards
especially the entry-level options
generally don't have as good of erm as
the more expensive option and as for the
graphics card we managed to get an extra
100 megahertz roughly on the core which
are enabled this to go all the way up to
2.1 gigahertz on the core and also with
the memory runs to get an extra wine
gigahertz affective out of the memory so
this raised the memory up to 9 gigabits
per second speeds essentially and this
was a very impressive overclock
considering we didn't have to give it
much more cool voltage at all
you
there it is guys the benchmarks show it
all this PC performed incredibly well at
1080p and also 1440p gaming I was really
impressed at not only how well it did in
the games but also the temperatures were
very controlled even with a budget $50
case such as the Corsair spec one and
now I do highly recommend you overclock
if you do get these parts I have a GPU
overclocking tutorial and also a CPU
overclocking tutorial for horizon which
I'll put the links in the description
below or quickly hotlink them up here
they're taking a closer look at the
frame rates we were getting from this
machine if you are a highly competitive
player for games like dota 2 or csgo
then this PC was scoring really well
with frame rates that we're going
phenomenally high at 1080p and then if
we look at the later titles like Mass
Effect Andromeda or even battlefield one
which I know a lot of people play at
1080p and 1440p the frame rates were
incredibly good so I've got nothing bad
to say about this PC in terms of
performance now what about some of the
other parts that we used in this build
well I did use an entry-level power
supply from silverstone and if you are
in australia this is my highly
recommended choice for the best bang for
buck power play if you are in America
than EVGA really hit hard with some of
their 500 watt power supplies and
honestly for this build I didn't even
get up to 300 watts being consumed from
the wall when I was on full load in fire
strike combined and while Styles
overclocked so a budget entry-level
power supply is a good idea if you want
to save some money and keep in mind
though anything cheaper than this then
you are starting to get into that danger
category where some of the components
used in those very cheap options just
won't do the job and your computer may
even cut out they can power supply may
even start smoking up which has happened
in the past to me before and lastly with
the be 350 motherboard the fatality it
has great onboard audio it also is a
pretty decent overclocker everything
worked
and then we've got the crucial 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory - 8 gigabyte
sticks that performed really well I got
it up to two thousand six hundred and
sixty-six megahertz which with the gtx
1070 is a really good level anyway guys
I hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then don't forget to leave a big
like and let me know in the comments
section below if you had a similar
budget what would you do differently if
you would do differently and I'd love to
read your comments as always and with
that I will recommend if you have a
little bit of extra money then you can
get an SSD even a 128 gigabyte version
which will speed up your overall desktop
experience and also will allow some of
your favorite games because you won't
have a lot of room to load up a lot of
faster and of course all the links will
be in the description below and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
