whatever chemicals are in throat
lozenges we'll see how that goes well in
Seattle you don't know what's in those

even know that yeah I know I my
brother's awesome he's here actually
along with like my dad and all the rest
my friends anyways they probably don't
care is he as tall as you know my
brothers built completely opposite to me
he was like a fullback in American
football if you seen that he's he's
shorter and like wide and beefy when we
were like 18 19 he could pick me up and
throw me across the room so he used to
win the brawls oh yes yes all the time
oh yes although he was a nice guy so
it's fun never got any serious so that
beautiful face heals never go here still

popular request ivana is coming back on
from dex racer do you want to do the
hair thing again yeah I'll tell you what
happened this morning I woke up and I
couldn't open my eyes and I don't have
allergies right and I was talking to one
of the other exhibitors before they open
and I was doing this a lot and she goes
you know what happened is it's basically
packs plague but for your eyes because I
do this with my hair with my us getting
my bangs out of my face I said oh I need
to learn the dicaprio
Foley
good I think a lot of people wanted to
know more about the girth and frame size
okay i was going of me these guys were
going at it in the comments so what it's
like what is your girth in frame size
well or of the frame size that I would
prefer I got it well the girth and frame
size are important but it's how it moves
that's what's really really important
does the chair go back and forth the way
you want to does it lock into place at
the certain right time or does it get
released at the right time those are all
things that need to be I think you're
gonna get that out of the day x-ray so
yeah that's exactly what you're gonna
get out of the deck Sosa also there was
another thing you had going on with the
was it the gamer girls saying ya know
about that I do I would love to because
you're from Down Under right yeah so I
would actually love to have some guys

so we just finished playing Final
Fantasy 15 and I thought it was actually
really positive like it's got that story
that single player campaign thing going
on where you're just going to get
immersed in it the combat felt good one
thing I will critique those 30 FPS was
noticeable on the ps4 there so there is
word that it is coming out on pc though
a little bit later than the ps4 so I'm
bleeding for it on the pc and hopefully
we'll get 60 FPS plus and it'll be just
amazing so I can't wait for that it's
definitely one of those games it's going
to hit the market hard I'm looking
forward to it oh my god oh yeah well the
