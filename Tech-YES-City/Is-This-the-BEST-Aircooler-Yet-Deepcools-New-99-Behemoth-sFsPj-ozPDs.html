booth for CES 2019 in Las Vegas Nevada
and right here they're announcing their
assassin 3 air cooler this thing is
handling a ninety nine hundred K of five
gigahertz absolutely fine now you'll
know from experience that some of these
coolers just can't handle this CPU it
just gets too hot this thing's been
running it for over two hours and
they've actually got some new technology
going into the cooler itself seven heat
pipes with grooves sent to heat pipes
that takes the best of both heat pipe
technologies and combines them to help
with 15% thermal conductivity over the
predecessors on top of that they've also
got hydraulic ball bearing 140 ml fans
two of them are included the first of
the fans you can either mount it at the
front or the rear of the cool if you
mounted at the front of course you're
gonna be saving a bit of space it will
cover your ram however if you do mount
at the front like this it'll only cover
normal and low profile memory if you
take it off you're then able to support
higher profile memory the ones with the
big heat sinks on it then you can put it
on the rear of the cooler to accommodate
for that if you wish too so this cooler
is slated for a May 2019 release it's
gonna come in around about $100 MSRP so
stay tuned for it as well as the design
itself features a sleek black and silver
theme going on so the fans are new
they've got double blade technology
they're very quiet I'm standing right
next to this thing while stress testing
the 9900 kay and dare I say it's
probably gonna be better than a lot of
water coolers out there however what
else is here at deep cool in 2019 let's
check it out
welcome back to Tokyo City and right
here we've got the magic cube which is
abbreviated in this case to the Mach
cube 550 it's gonna come in black or
white the black being 110 dollars the
white coming in with a hundred and
twenty dollars this is slated for a June
2019 release now on top of this it's got
a clear sleek design so they've enclosed
off the front and closed off the top so
it's more I dare I say for a business
look but inside is where the
customization begins you can mount a 420
rad on the slate itself or if you don't
wish to wear it on the slate you can
mount a 360 mil rad at the front and on
top of that you've also got these drive
bays which can be switched around from
the front or the back and they can
support two drives each so for a total
of four 3.5 inch drives inside this case
and on top of that you've got the
additional support for three 2.5 inch
SSDs on the side it also features
tempered glass which is a magnetic side
panel more of a premium option and then
at the rear if you're worried about air
flow they've got these unique grooves
that allow the airflow to be pushed in
or out depends on your preference in
mounting the coolers but at the front
they've also got inserts on the left and
the right hand side to allow airflow to
come in through the front moving on to
water coolers with deep cool they've got
the castle 360 RGB which is being
released right now it's coming in with a
price point of one hundred and seventy
dollars it's essentially a 360 mil rad
with an extra RGB fan they've also
included a six port magnetic hub for the
RGB fan controllers themselves it can
run into it and of course alleviate any
problems with the RGB fence you may have
it plugs in via a three pin 5 volt to
the motherboard so you can control it
via that it essentially uses the same
pump block and head as the 280 which we
took a look out here on the channel I'll
put the review up here if you haven't
seen it already but moving on to the
left of me right here is the addition of
the 240 pro it's got what they call a
pressure relieving system where inside
the unit itself or in the radiator it's
got a rubber capsule which contracts the
more pressure that's being applied once
the water heats up and starts flowing
through and so this helps or pretty much
they as deep pools say guaranteed to
stop leaking in the cases of other or a
all-in-one cause if you've noticed in
the past some of those can just leak out
of nowhere and that can
in effect take a whole system with it
that alleviates this worry as well as
having a three-phase winding motor in
the pump itself which is gonna help with
cooling performance as well as help stop
the leak in terms of pricing a release
date this is actually already out there
in the wild it's coming in at 140 US
dollars and on top of that it's got a
new RGB effect on the Block itself so
RGB lovers are gonna be impressed that
it comes with two 120 mil RGB fans and
that new cool design which can be
plugged up to any of the other syncing
technologies so you can control those
RGB effects if you wish to in terms of
support for different sockets we've got
all the way up to TR for support on
these water coolers the Assassin itself
won't come with TR for support that will
indeed just come up with a M for support
and Intel support 2 on the other side
right here beside me now is a little
case that I've got a history with if you
guys didn't know I had one come in the
mail and the glass broke but this is the
white version and honestly after I took
a look at that matrix 55 I really liked
it for its price point this is the white
version of that it's of course just
giving you essentially a different
aesthetic if you guys haven't seen the
matrix 55 review already I'll put the
link up here where I did a full build in
it and it was quite pleasant this one is
coming with an extra $10 on top due to
the process of making the white design
itself being more difficult in the black
design in terms of release dates this
will be on the market next month
in February and then the last case on
display here is the matric 70 we saw
this at Computex last year if you guys
didn't remember it's coming in at $70
u.s. it's gonna be released finally in
April 2000 nineteen now they have made
some improvements on the original design
that they showcased at Computex the most
noteworthy being the ease of access with
two screws at the back and two screws
with the fold-out design at the front
and a easily detachable front panel also
looking inside they've changed a few
little details around a tempered glass
power supply shroud just going over the
power supply unit itself and then you
may notice inside this particular b-roll
that I've been shooting there's also an
additional RGB bracket that can help
with GPU sag as well as add a bit as
ascetic bling to the build itself this
is coming in a $15.00 and is labeled the
gh - 0-1 RGB and will be released neck
month in February but there it is all
with the deep cool suite in 2019 they've
got new coolers coming I'm definitely
looking forward to the assassin three
they've got those RGB updated water
coolers as well as the cases which are
looking very sleek very clean if I don't
mind saying so myself the matrix 70 of
course having support for extended ATX
so I may be just able to do some big
Xeon building and who knows but if you
guys enjoyed today's booth coverage then
