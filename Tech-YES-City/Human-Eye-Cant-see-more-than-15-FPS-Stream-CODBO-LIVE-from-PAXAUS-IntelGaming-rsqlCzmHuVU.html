he's looking for some deals all right
let's go find some deals here Cowboys no
no one's interested in finding deals in
call of duty by that they were ready to
find deals but they didn't find any
deals pop G versus blackout man I've
like I've got a bigger a bit of a fanboy
ISM forearm for call of duty since black
ops 2 like I absolutely loved black ops
2 so when this came out black out for
black out sorry it was just like it
reminded me of black ops 2 and that's
why I love this way more than pop G it's
like it's the better the battle Royales
the problem is it cost money so it's got
to see Basking prices as opposed to
fortnight that's free
pop pop G is a this 20 bucks but I think
pop G's on the way out like that's yeah
it looks a little bit Skippy yeah
actually that made the frames on my PC
is really good yeah hopefully hopefully
it's not too bad hopefully you can see
me get rekt or we can get rekt in time
hold on we'll try the overlay maybe
that's better no that's even worse
yeah okay brothers let's go do this
we're deploying right now call of duty
right now let's go to the big feet look
at this I got the stream deck to go big
face cam okay let's go

did a selfie to show you guys on
Instagram what to do to win a free knock

literally have a chance to win and last
time around I think like three of my
viewers one eight zero eight six K's so
that was really good yeah let's do this
so we do a bit of a that way if I get
rekt I can at least probably get some
frags in the process so yeah join the
pact is really cool if you guys ever in
Australia near Melbourne in October then
definitely head down and play it's a lot
of fun they got so many cool things like
they had some headphones that have cold
plates in them that keep your ears cold
that's how crazy some of the stuff is
here
and yeah I couldn't believe it so I
jumped into black jumped into black out
and just got rekt I tried I tried
I did try yeah I don't know how bad the
background noise is but it's right yeah
thanks for watching guys longtime
viewers thank you guys so much so much
cool content as I said before sr2 bills
coming soon I've done all the health
videos as well something about the
health videos man like I copped a bit of
like flack for that but it's like okay I
mean I'm sure there's better ways to
working out but um I really didn't it's
just how I do things so like whatever
man I feel really good got a lot of
energy fittest I've ever been in a long
time as well so I think the main thing
is just to get to the gym anyway and
find your sort of your workout flow and
then
okay we'll go from there so this B see
here is actually don't even know because
there's there's like I think after me
there'll be a heap of all the people

Archie I'll be showing our the cold
plate headphones in a video very soon

following him around I before I could
met off he geek yeah okay come on let's
go let's go
oh yeah so now the game's not lagging I
think like the stream is coming out a
little bit okay we're healing off oh
yeah let's kill some boys oh I didn't
work okay we got this oh okay okay this
is not right
I am the biggest noob today and I'm
gonna blame myself and my bad skills the
arm there's one thing as well like okay
okay I'm just gonna start I'm gonna
start blaming the hardware
no God let's just try something here
these boys are pretty good okay come
watch Tech yesterday right boys I'm so
bad it's not funny you can just me me do
whatever you want to do okay let's try
I need I need to change class get a
shotgun there we go let's try something
a little bit different like I swear
they're just doing like some know before
I die before I can even see the dude
he's killed me I'm just I all right when
I get back when I get back to the studio
I'm gonna restream Call of Duty and just
see if it's just see if I'm just that
bad or if it actually is what's gonna
know what's going on because hopefully
I'm not on a Wi-Fi what okay
can I like can I jump in a stream with
some other news yeah let's talk about
deals you know what like what while I
get straight-up
wrecked we could talk about deals yeah
what why they say basically it packs
basically it packs they have basically
at PAX they've got heaps of deals on a
different booth so you can get like
monitors really cheap you can get okay
yeah okay here we go
I'm not I'm not even gonna tab to show
my to show my score if I do that I'm
just gonna get rekt not no no no what I
just this is not fair
this is not fair
yeah I just I mean I I was telling
rocketjump ninja like I'll sell and
rocketjump ninja that I'm washed up and
he's like not dude you're not washed up
I'm like yeah burn okay let's try
something different
oh that's all I get is a grenade okay I
thought I'd go like a rocket launch oh
okay sorry team I apologized
come on I had him if I get one kill yeah
okay I'm okay I'm gonna just go I'm
gonna get a web cam soon because I don't
know what's going on with this and we're
just talking about some deals guys
because I'm just getting destroyed like
people are complaining that it's laggy
and I can't even get a kill it feels
like people are just killing me before I
can even see them okay I see it my Sam I
say him oh boy yeah boy okay we got a
kill we got a kill okay
so better I played this game at launch
and I played this game at launch and I
got no idea what the matter is now so
there's just like there's just literally
grenades what is that at this point I'm
just feeding but hopefully we can win
live I get carried by the team that'll
be awesome
that guys on like story of my life bro
during my life okay I think we got this
now
oh yeah what up we're just gonna get
hipfire oh yeah I got these guys numbers
oh yeah oh yeah we got two kills before
I died now we're getting somewhere now
we get someone so best value mobile and
CPU for different price range $60 budget
yeah okay I'm gonna get some budget
stuff right as soon as we get the sr2
bill done and after that are you back
home already rocketjump ninja god damn I
thought you're still here you can see
bro I'm gonna show you how washed up I
am guys we got some just shot some come
in for a selfie it's a blob stop show me
a mess yeah come on in let's do it man
let's take a selfie brother so yeah man
awesome guys awesome yeah like who cares
about this game like I'm getting rekt
I'm getting rekt anyway so it doesn't
matter was we'll just have some fun I'm
just gonna switch to full cam like after
this game is finished I don't want to
let the team down but after we're
finished we'll just go to like face cam
and just chat he's like I am just these
guys are killing me before I can even
get a shot off
oh go one health oh yeah ah he got me
okay try the rocket launcher okay I have
to change I'll have to change cloth come
on at least those baits they light if
anything we can try and win this game
based on me fading just wasn't meant to
happen just camp yep
okay I'm camping that's it cat-boy knows
what's up camp with some lag oh I think
this guy's worse than I am like I'm
really I think I think the verdict there
is that we do not
we're not playing call of duty anymore
we'll just go to chat guys if you got
questions drop them in the drop them in
the live chat this was just like a
absolute blunder but if you haven't seen
before we'll make sure you get a selfie
in and my score is terrible dude and
it's not even my account so it's all
good someone else's account at the booth
here so he can get the back he could get
the terrible stats so okay yeah Dan I
only played yeah I only basically I only
played call of duty for the PC at the
start and after that
what happened was I I go back to work so
Call of Duty was really fun I played
blackout and then after that I sort of
just here we got like a palm grip Mouse
and I do not like admittedly I don't
palm grip at all I'm use the claw of
fingertip grip so you got to figure out
what you are and oh yeah a lot of booths
here have palm grip or fingertip and
it's like a lot of them have more palm
grips so let me know in the comment
section below your fingertip or a palm
grip palm grip ball love reading your
thoughts as always because I'm yeah I
can't do palm grip that well at all so
yeah so do you think those gel x58
multiples are any good like with the gel
x58 motherboard basically what's going
on with them is that you want to get
them and then get like a cheap i7 that's
got a high multiplier then you can
couple it with a decent graphics card
for very cheap and you go to gaming PC
that you can just read flip so that's
what goes on with them I in terms of
using it for my own personal rig always
go with an X 58 custom build yeah so X
79 is always really good I'm gonna be
doing some coverage on that as soon as I
get back from pax so stay tuned for that
x79 it's gonna drop that is so wicked
and also the 9900 K there's a lot of
stuff going on at the moment I'm going
to be doing more tests with that the d
lids I mean look we can play some more
games but hopefully I've learned my
lessons now basically what's with the
mic quality is bad okay it's a razor
that's probably why
like yeah judge I don't use any razor
gear personally so like just camp and
bro just camp in the sunlight just
taking it easy
I'll even crouch men yeah what yeah who
said camp I'm just gonna camp yeah I do
have to raise my voice yeah basically
you can't do it oh you can't do anything
about it so this is my kind of map I'm
just gonna keep camping and hopefully we
can rack ups hopefully we can rack up
some kills oh that guy's like he's doing
some hey see he's a step up so okay oh
just just okay oh no someone radiated us
I think that's the yes oh okay so what's
going on with chat is it worth to
upgrade I 533 thirty quad core three
goes to three by gg-get serve oh yeah
3770k is a pretty good CPU man you can D
live that as well get around 4.4
gigahertz yeah 2500 K yeah that'll be
fine for black ops say yeah I'll just
like I'll play for a little bit more is
I'm just I'm bad I'll let the team down
and then we'll talk some Zeon see you
guys love token Zeon so he was will chat
Zeon's at this event yeah
this is just again let's just go to face
cam okay forget about forget about black
ops there might be there might be some
background noise but whatever I guess it
makes for BGM Call of Duty BGM so let's
go to chat you guys are talking about is
eons now so the W 30 680 is good but I
do believe the X 56 75 is actually
better it's a better bin the TDP is
lower so therefore it's got the a
certain box speed but it doesn't at low
power consumption and that's tested out
of the factory so that being said you
can generally get a really good
overclock on next 56 75 that's what I
found with that and packs itself so yeah
had a lot of people come up and say hi
so far packs it's been amazing such a
good atmosphere of course there's a lot
more gamers here then there are
enthusiast tech heads okay someone got
me at the spawn and so I'd like to see
more like maybe in AWS if they had an
enthusiast check event that'd be really
cool because it sort of seems like
there's all the enthusiast tech here but
it's just the game is like a lot of
people are playing for tonight a lot of
people playing on a lot of people
playing for night Call of Duty pop G and
just I did try the I did try the new
Metro Exodus the RT X on thing basically
like my personal opinion was the RT X on
is it just it's bad like that's that's
my gut reaction I don't know if anyone's
played the demo or not but it's really
bad like the RT X 2080 I was getting
like 60 frames per second at 1080 1080 P
so whatever I mean don't go with that so
yeah guys the stream soon if you've got
any questions then make sure you drop a
question comment in the comment section
below I don't know what's going on with
this stream like it's a little bit
choppy the face cam seems to be so
smooth but the game just seems to be
coming out really like really weird so I
don't know if that's the whole like the
wireless or something who knows
yeah so anyway how well does an ex 56 60
at 3.8 gigahertz pair with the GT X 1080
really well but you want to overclock it
a little bit more if you can 4.2
gigahertz we'll take the X 56 60 higher
so 3770k 3.4 Q go that's only okay yeah
you want to get a 3770k - like 4.2 at
least man you can even do that on non
overclockable boards I believe so the X
50 675 multiplier is not unlocked what
the B clock on the motherboards is so
you take that to 200 you take the
multiplier 223 4.6 tika Hertz
overclocked on the X 56 75 and you can
do that on most setups so that should be
pretty easy to do yeah so I'm just
reading chat now cuz like I'm terrible
black ops so let's just yeah skip ahead
and would you move over so you could go
with the Intel a5 26.97 b35 grading the
video 20k yeah that's a 14 core CPU and
it does have very good stats especially
if you pick up the multiple achievement
off problem with going with you stuff
with ddr4 is of course the ddr4 itself
and then you've got rising out there as
well so whenever I think ddr4 rise and
does definitely bring a lot of value to
the table same with like if you're
gaming of course you've got 8400 that's
a really good CPU I don't know if you
can hear this stuff in the background
but it's so noisy here so I apologize if
it was like the stream was a little bit
i'm streamable but this event is really
good the atmosphere is so cool so I
wanted to sort of do a live stream let
you guys know the love is coming soon
we've only got like I go are doing a
roundup video and we take a look at some
custom breaks really soon and that'll be
packs finished and then we're doing the
sr2 build and the next health video
video will be dropping as well so stay
tuned for that
I might just yeah jump on out of here
and try and give you guys a proper
livestream when I get back to the studio
so make sure you stay tuned for that
ah ok if the sounds really cleared
that's pretty good
yeah oh thanks Roy yeah the gentleman
I'm just gonna keep doing what I do like
people say like I should do this and
that and this and that like I just do
what I enjoy now so a lot of it is you
and use parts so I mix the both of them
together obviously you get the synergy
out of that you can compare the new
stuff cutting-edge to the old stuff I
think that's the biggest benefit of my
channel as well as looking at different
sort of all the different stuff so yeah
love doing what I'm doing I hope you
guys are loving the content as well I'm
sort of just like I literally cannot
even hear myself talking I hope this
isn't coming out on stream because it
feels like they met I closed back
headphones on and this is really painful
so I don't know if the mics picking it
up or not but yeah I've never been like
streamed i've never streamed like this
before so hold your tour guys I don't I
mean don't hold me to it so if you guys
enjoyed this one then be sure to hit
that like button I'm just like I mean I
can play some zombies or something but
like I shouldn't have played the
competitive because it feels like I know
what's going on in my wall a wireless
connection or something oh yeah I'll
definitely strain more for you guys when
I get back to the studio but yeah if it
sounds good that I'm really shocked if
this actually sounds good because the
background noise is overwhelming my ears
and I got close back side it's just it's
like damn so anyway guys stay tuned to
more Beck's videos love each and every
one of you make sure you get in with a
chance take yourself selfie of yourself
I check out my Instagram if you haven't
already check your city slash tech your
city get a free chance to win a knock so
even I'm apparently I'm in the chance to
win one but if I win it I'll give it
away we give it away to one of you guys
in the audience not a problem
hope you've enjoyed so far the PAX
coverage so far I've been trying to make
it a little bit different I guess a
little bit more buzzy a little bit more
fun possibly doing some different stuff
while we're on the showroom floor
as I gave it a thousand FBS testing on
some of the stuff so
cool like that's really good at the
background noise is not good like this
is the thing now this this must have
some kind of dynamic mode going on
because the background noise is
literally overwhelming my ears and oh
yeah like I can't believe it so yeah
yeah if that was fun seeing me feed man
I mean we do we can play a little bit
more if you want to see me feed you're
like oh I don't I kind of I want to play
like yeah
hardcore control okay all right look
give you a bonus before we get on out of
here let's watch me feed a little bit
more oh yeah let's have a little bit
more feed every cuz yeah I've got two I
got a little bit of time anyway so yeah
so it is it is pretty crazy there's a
lot of streaming booths here there are a
lot of streamers so see if we can find a
hardcore control game so one shot and
it's actually it's actually a really
good game like I just I haven't played
it since I did the PC build so yeah I
get enough time to game unfortunately so
