upcoming review on a graphics card and I
was looking at the ranking system on
Amazon and four of the top five cards
looked absolutely fine and in fact some
of them are really good deals at the
moment but one of these cards in the top
five just stood out like a sore thumb
this was a graphics card that should not
be in the top five selling cards
especially at its given price point of
fifty five US dollars now this is the GT
710 which was a GPU released in early
2016 making it now well over three years
old and the worst thing about this card
is it's got horrible performance in fact
the performance is so bad on this
graphics card that it is worse than a
Pentium when it comes to using it for
its graphics performance that's right a
dedicated solution for graphics is
performing worse than a budget CPU but
that said let's take a deeper dive into
this topic and see what actually is
going on
anyway looking further into what I
believe is a scam or at least a ranking
scam on Amazon it sort of ties in with
the recent video I did on eBay where we
had a seller asking over three hundred
US dollars for a gaming PC that couldn't
even play games at least modern games
properly at all if you guys haven't seen
that video I'll put the link up here but
in that comment section a few of you
guys were telling me that you think this
guy is ranking the PC up because that PC
was the number one search term when you
typed in gaming PC what was theorized
and I don't have proof of this because I
haven't tried it was that the seller and
a other party are simply buying a lot of
these PCs in a short period of time and
then somehow canceling the purchases but
in that process ranking up their PC or
their item to the top how exactly this
works is the seller has their product
for sale they have a lot of stock in
quantity and then they get the third
party seller in this case we'll call
them person why and they then buy 500
units at the asking price that then goes
through and pushes this graphics card to
the top of the list because so many
units are being sold person why then
after a few days cancels their order but
in the meantime this product is ranked
so high in the listing that the damage
has already been done at least from what
I can see and gather and what I hear
from you guys and feedbacks and what I
read in articles this is what is going
on so if we now relate this back to our
GT 710 we can see that something is
awfully wrong here the card of course is
terrible value terrible performance but
it's standing out it's actually if you
type in graphics card it is coming up on
the first page and now I did test this
in a different browser so it wasn't
anything to do with my cookies or cache
that's stored in that browser and then
believe it or not yes it was still
showing up on the first page which I do
believe this card is somehow
artificially being pumped through the
ranking system up to the top that is
done by perhaps a seller and a third
party then buying this graphics card in
mass and somehow pumping up the ranking
system artificially to where it can
deceive people and make them think that
are indeed buying a popular graphics
card that is being purchased at a good
price when in fact it's just horrible
value period so now Amazon in the u.s.
is the most popular online retailer in
different countries like Australia for
example eBay is actually the most
popular retailer so somehow getting your
items up the top of the ranking system
is beneficial for a seller though doing
it in a non legit way and deceiving
people is completely wrong in my opinion
and there should be something done to
stop these sellers and now first of all
there are some people that do comment
and make a valid point though that is if
someone is foolish enough to waste their
money on something like this then they
deserve to lose their money and my
counter-argument to that is is that some
people don't even know much about tech
but they're getting deceived and it's
that deception that I really dislike and
so by doing videos like these I want to
help people in the tech community and
then they can help other people and make
people aware of what is going on and
that is you shouldn't trust in this case
the ranking systems as I believe they're
partially broken and if anything if you
are buying something that you're not
familiar with then comments sections are
always a great way to get feedback I
know if you guys ask the comment in this
comment session you'll get an honest
reply pretty much instantly from the
awesome viewers around here so for
example I had a university student who
wanted to buy a PC off me this morning
and she asked me if the PC would be good
for Adobe am I reply to her was in my
experience you do want a bit more memory
than what this system has for Adobe so I
do recommend going with something better
so I didn't recommend her this PC but
I'm sure there would be some sellers out
there who would say yeah it's absolutely
fine coming by this thing I don't care I
just want the money and in turn I
believe that's just bad kamar it will
come back to bite you sooner or later
but another reason that I do what I do
is because I treat others how I want to
be treated so if I went to this
university student in the future and she
has a profession in X Y Z and I asked
her advice I would really appreciate it
if I got that honest advice in return
but anyway moving on from why I hate
deception and back to the Amazon ranking
system in this case the GT 710 horrible
graphics performance for the money at
fifty five US dollars not only that if
you do want something like this that can
go in a single slot
but you can then buy something off
Aliexpress it'll be much cheaper you get
a gtx 750ti
that shipped to your door for 50 US
dollars has much better performance and
of course will have more display options
than this GT 710 and even then if you do
want this specific gravis card which I
don't even know why you would want it
since the GT 710 will suffer the same
problems a lot of the times that a lot
of gtx 750 s in budget graphics cards
will suffer and that is that they won't
work with some of these older OEMs which
i'm sure there would be people out there
that would just want to turn a pc into a
home theater pc for very cheap but even
then your $55 is much better spent if
you want to go brand new for a whole PC
you've got the rise in 2200 G 87 bucks
will have literally like 10 times the
performance of this GT 710 featured in
this video and there are honestly just
so many other options out there I'll put
some links in the description below if
you need a budget graphics card solution
instead of this ripoff that I'm talking
about here but on the other hand there
is another possibility and that's what
I'm gonna ask you guys for your opinion
on could this be legit I mean perhaps
there is a seller out there like the
eBay seller in the previous video that
we did that is buying up a whole heap of
these PCs in preparation of the next
round of eBay gaming pcs with RGB LED
lights plastered throughout the build
I'm just not entirely sure of the exact
workings but after seeing the eBay
gaming PC and now this GT 710 ranking so
high in the system on both eBay and
Amazon I am becoming very skeptical of
these sellers and just exactly how
they're pushing their products up to the
top of the list because I refuse to
believe that these sellers are getting
their product to the top of the list in
a non deceptive honest way anyway guys
if you enjoyed this video then be sure
to hit that like button also let us know
in the comments section below
do you think I'm right on the money in
saying that these things are ranking
scams or is something different going on
altogether
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always but if anything 2019 I just I
am seeing a few more scams pop up here
and there and everywhere I mean Greg
from science studio a good friend of
mine he did a video on a hype drop scam
I'll put the link in the description for
that where
apparently they're selling these boxes
and they're marketing all these cool
products you can win but really in the
chances are you're just gonna get
sticker I mean if you guys want to see
me have a go at this and see how much of
a joke it is then I could give it a
crack for you guys with that said I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon if you want to check us out on
social media get the inside scoop before
it even hits YouTube then I'll put my
socials in the description below like
ends to Facebook and Twitter and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
