to you guys today with the video
addressing some big changes that have
happened around the channel depending on
how you look at them well the first one
is that big giraffe in the room tech
gaming weekly why am i no longer on the
show and why did i decide to step down
now I decided to step down because of
things that happen to pacts between
Joker and I what exactly happened to
pact well I'm going to extend joke of
the courtesy of not talking about that
and also going to say I wish him all the
best from here on in now as for a new
texture I know you guys want to see
something coming out of the channel
every single week something live
something fresh
some with a bit of humor some with a bit
of sexual innuendo you know I can
provide that so there is something in
the works it is concrete and yes I will
be hosting it towards the end of October
with a brand new co-host
brand new name so stay tuned for that
now as for the channel name just
yesterday it changed from tacky our city
to text City we're going to keep it
clean gonna keep it simple after talking
with a few friends and getting some good
advice from them
I decided yeah I'm going to go with the
simple and clean look with the channel
even though I love tech yes City I
thought it was me I thought it is
exactly the channel name that I needed I
think when I was handing out business
cards as well
I noticed people's reactions to the name
initially was like tech yes City why is
the yes here so I figured well we can
just drop the yes and move on there was
for the man behind the camera you guys
do not have to worry here is going to be
100% yes man all the time every time
it's pretty funny because someone
identified it in the comments pretty
much spot-on it's like the all the
suffering and pain that I've endured
over the last year it has made me a
stronger person has made me appreciate
life that much more made me stay
positive and focus those for the content
I'm gonna get right back to it now and
keep banging it out like metaphorically
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did hit that like button if
there's anything you want to see on the
channel then let me know in the comment
section below and I'll get onto it as
soon as I can if it's a good idea it's a
terrible idea I'm just going to like be
just and pretended I never saw that
