gonna be going on good old gam tree and
also Facebook and we're gonna be hunting
for some used PC parts hopefully we're
gonna get some good deals but this month
already I've picked up some rx 570s for
70 Aussie dollars a pop that's about 50
USD Joseph he actually contacted me he
was from Sydney and he said I've got all
this stuff I also got some 60 gigabyte
SSD 410 Asya pop which would be like
under 8 US dollars and seven US dollars
so that was already one epic deal that
we've scored this month and also there's
another thing but you're going to touch
on later and that is the used PC parts
market at this very point in time
especially where I live around that
South East Queensland I've been getting
a lot of messages from either friends or
just people about the market in general
and it's something that I've touched on
in the past but we're gonna talk about
it more in depth but with that aside
let's go pull up some deals and see what
we can find
so the first deal we're pulling up now
is they're asking 650 ozzie dollars and
they say an i7 3770 770 so 16 gigabytes
of RAM and a GTX 980 although it does
say two gigabytes so maybe they
misplaced it for a GTX 960 but
regardless we're gonna give them a call
and see if we can drop in an offer of
500 oz e which would really make this
whole build worthwhile especially if we
repurposed it in a better case cleaned
it up gave some tech yes loving plus
there might be some other goodies loaded
in there like a really good pathway SSD
hard drive who knows let's find out so
he didn't answer his phone twice I just
sent him a message also dropped him and
offer on gumtree for 500
so we'll update that later and see if he
gets back to us next up people got
another PC this one includes a 22 inch
monitor it's a 6600 KZ 170 I also got a
gigabytes of RAM SSD they're asking 550
Ozzie dollars I'm gonna drop in an offer
of 400 as they do say or nearest offer
maybe someone else hasn't dropped in a
solid offer yet if we got this we'd
definitely replace that gtx 550 ti and
put in something else so let's give it a
shot so it's the exact same as last time
when she's gonna set of a message and
drop in an offer on gumtree see if
they'll get back to us so the next
potential deal we've got up here is a
whole system again but this one is
missing the memory and also any SSDs or
hard drives
however they are asking 230 Ozzy dollars
for the system I'm gonna offer 170 the
specs include a GTX 760 also an i5
Haswell and also a h87 motherboard and a
cooler and a power supply so and a case
as well the case is decent too so if
we're able to get this deal we'd take
out that gravis card sell it
individually then we could put in a
better graphics card RAM and hard drive
and we'd have a decent system on our
hand
Hey what so now three four three we're
gonna drop in a text message and also a
offer on gumtree the next listen got up
here is a little bit of an odd one it's
only five bucks and it's a ati 5770 so
an old-school card it's got one gigabyte
of VRAM if I got this it'd just be for
the sole purpose of seeing what games it
could play in 2018 and they live right
around the corner so definitely give
this a try we are now on the longest
running streak here on the channel for
someone not picking up their phone next
up now we've got an ASA x3 990
motherboard and a three and a four
gigabytes of RAM and also a 500 gigabyte
hard drive but the thing about this is
going for $70 I'm gonna call them up see
if they'll take 50 Aussie dollars and at
this price I guess it's worth the gamble
seeing as the CPU also come with the
cooler - and the good thing about Acer
OEMs is they're some of the best they
generally have the standard 24 pin
there's no problems with any errors when
you boot it as well as most the time
they don't have the secure boot feature
enabled from the get-go and even if they
do you can usually disable that to get
graphics cards like gtx 750ti is for
example to work on this board so let's
give it a ring another one the last of
the deals on gumtree that were pulling
up now is an i7 2660 Aussie dollars it's
got a gigabytes of RAM but it's also got
a 2 terabyte hard drive which does raise
the value a little bit but I'm still
gonna come in with an offer of about 170
dollars so it is quite a bit under the
asking price but since the case does
look hideous I'm guessing no one else
has probably put any offers down so
we've got this deal we could repurpose
it very quickly and add a lot of value
in no time
Oh seriously this is I don't know it's
like going to the casino and betting on
red and getting black like six times in
a row
wait it's calling back spoke too soon
hello Brad speaking ah hi Peter
I yeah was this an ad on gumtree for a I
720 600 system yeah yeah I made a you've
got 260 on there what's what's the
lowest you'd go you negotiable I mean
I've got come pick it up for 170 cash
you became yeah yeah it's up to you man
I mean I can just come take it off your
hands and then do what I do
do some magic with it and clean it all
up and stuff and put it in a new case
and all that stuff so I just it's an i
it's a sandy sandy ridge processor you
know they kind of some people nowadays
are sort of getting turned off them but
yeah they're still all right
okay I 170 all right I do want to Texas
your address and I'll come around and
pick her up off yeah all right thanks
Pete
right late that time around we did play
a little bit of a tactics instead of
saying Sandy Bridge we deliberately said
Sandy Ridge that means it's unimportant
there's actually a little bit of art to
it with these deals so now the last two
deals were pulling up here on the
Facebook marketplace and the first one
is a fractal design r3 I really like
these fractal design cases they're only
asking I think $70 for it they've got an
RGB 2700 x-ray the prism cooler 425
ozzie and then they've got a B 350 as
well for 50 bucks so I'm gonna see if
the three of these components mix
together if they'll take maybe 120
dollars who they're asking a hundred
fifty for the lot but 120 would really
make this a sweet deal and then the next
deal up is a 4790k they asking 180 Ozzy
150 flat would be a really good price
for this CPU since it is in pretty high
demand the Haswell a non-words support
all the latest stuff like the VR
features that do lock out some of the
older processors so in terms of making a
modern gaming PC the 4790k still has it
so now we've got a bit of an update some
good news and bad news the first PC that
we've dropped 500 Aussie on I was
actually texting the guy initially
accepted the offer but then he said it
had a 2 gigabyte GTX 980 and I messaged
him back I said there's no such thing as
a 980 with 2 gigabytes of vram so then
he checked around and he said oh it's
actually a 960 and I said okay can you
budge on the original $500 off me and he
came back and said no so I just said ok
man sorry for wasting your time and just
moved along that was for the Facebook
marketplace deals the person with the i7
hasn't gone back to us but good news
with the fractal define r5 is that
they've come back and said they'll sell
the case and also a raised prism cooler
which is a 2700 X cooler for 55 Aussie
dollars pickup so that's about 38 US
dollars that's a bargain we're gonna go
get that but also the good PC that we
dropped in $400 on butter had a 5
gie they came back and said no and then
the last offer that came back and they
said 220 was for the motherboard the h87
the Haswell CPU the case and power
supply so this is going to segue
perfectly into what we're gonna talk
about next like this we're going to take
a seat because there's been a lot of
talk about prices and the whole use
price performance they've been people
messaging me saying hey man can you help
me with builds I'm losing money and
stuff so maybe it's time to sit down
relax grab a cup of tea and also we're
gonna talk about this whole use price
performance gig a little bit more in
depth because lately like I said just
before I've had people messaging me
saying that they're just clearing out
this stuff they're losing money on
builds they tried to get into this I
guess with the purpose of making money
and then there's other people that
message I guess behind the scenes saying
that I'm responsible for destroying the
use price performance market and I
certainly disagree with that because at
the end of the day I'm not forcing you
to go pay what you're paying for those
use parts what you're seeing in the
deals hunts with me is straight
discipline here's what I'm prepared to
pay for that part if it doesn't meet
that amount then I just simply don't buy
the part for instance with that Haswell
CPU and motherboard combo with the case
and power supply if I pay 220 for that
and then I go overpay so I'm already
paying $40 more than what I would want
to pay and then I go pay more for a
gigabytes of ddr3 memory and then I have
to go buy a hard drive SSD and then a
good graphics card if I'm overpaying on
every single step towards that final
product then a we've got a PC that costs
a lot more than I originally intended
and B is not good value for money so
this is the whole purpose with
especially a lot of the previous deals
hunts and especially over the last six
months I've noticed a lot of people are
going out and paying asking price for
these parts and it's simply a ripoff at
those asking prices you're giving
someone amazing money for something that
they've used for either a year a couple
of years and it could be on the way out
at any time you've got no warranty on it
so use price performance in itself
generally you want to be coming under
half of what you would pay for new price
performance that's
general rule of thumb for me personally
ever since I started doing it
if you come under that's great you're
gonna make a little bit of a profit when
you flip your stuff even a 50% you can
then mark up to 60% and that 10% is
yours to keep
now in certain cases of this message
where people are accusing me of making
five times what I buy the stuff for
that's ridiculous I don't make anywhere
near that when I flip a PC I'm likely to
make a hundred bucks here or there and
I'm happy to do that because it's a
passion it's a hobby and I really
enjoyed doing this furthermore when I
first got into this gig it was all about
picking up PC parts that people
otherwise thought were useless and
they'd chuck them in the bin or just get
rid of them and they maybe put it off
the sale on gumtree for 50 bucks and
they're like okay I'll try and get
something for this and little do they
realize how good performance those parts
still have nowadays the market
especially in southeast Queensland where
I live that's the Gold Coast Brisbane
and Sunshine Coast it's flooded there's
so many people now trying to sell gaming
pcs it's not funny and so with that
extra competition means it's a buyers
market and for those who are desperate
to sell they're going to be accepting
lower offers and hence not making any
money and they may get frustrated
especially if they're not enjoying the
process of course for me personally if
something's not a deal it's just not a
deal however I attributed those prices
to those parts that's all a learning
experience that's all stored up here the
more experience you have the better
you're gonna get and quickly identifying
what's a good price for a certain PC
part and what's not just through
experience and unfortunately I just
can't teach you that through a video I
can show you what I do and how I do
things but ultimately a big part of
doing these video series for the viewers
is that they've enjoyed it and they
continue to enjoy it and they love
watching me hunt for deals and then see
what I can do afterwards with those
parts and do a use price performance
built lately it has been getting dry and
there's no real deals up for sale so I'm
not buying at all I'm sort of just
laying back because I refuse to buy used
parts when they start to approach that
barrier of not being good value for
money so what we're seeing now in this
use market is certainly a
from people paying for builds that
people would otherwise want to chuck out
and just get rid of to now people paying
certain rates for used parts and so the
market is now definitely saturated in
terms of competition there's more people
out there trying to hunt for use parts
and I guess that's going to lead to
frustrations and who better than to try
pin the blame on me Buddha comes down to
guys if you're doing this to make money
then you're not doing it for the right
reasons
I'm doing this because I love doing it I
do this because I love making the
content for the viewers who love
watching it and I'm not going to stop
doing that however the irony is I'm not
gonna be getting many deals if there's a
lot of people out there overpaying for
used parts but no guys if you're getting
frustrated that you can't sell you use
build then just blame it on me or you
can blame it on dad man or in my case
sometimes I like to blame it on Yousaf
yeah I'm the kid displayed the market on
me actually blame it on me yeah just
when I got all night blame it on me
actually blame it on me blame it on me
it's now the next day and I ended up
picking up the PC on my way to see a
rocketjump ninja who's a good friend and
also another youtuber and just hang out
with another couple of friends and the
night just went away but also the deal
in Brisbane for the fractal define r5
and also the Wraiths prism use of my
video editor he's gonna pick that up
because apparently it's right around the
corner from where he lives but let's
take a look at this pc and see what is
inside so here it is here it's a Dell
it's got the 2 terabyte hard drive it's
got a random motherboard there and an i7
2608 gig of ram so the possibilities
with this PC are looking pretty good so
far I mean we could put in an RX 570
change the power supply over and then
put in a cheap SSD and we'd have one
really good budget build I'm not too
sure about changing the case if you guys
think I should change the case over
spice it up a little bit or just leave
it as it is for maximum price
performance let us know in the comment
section below we've also got a GTX 970
we have a r9 380 so possibilities are
endless let me know what you want to see
in this perhaps even that gtx 750ti but
I think with an i7 2600
570 I think that'd be a really good
balance and especially since I got these
cards for an absolute bargain I think
would make for some of the best price
performance so this month sparks hunt we
didn't get a whole lot but we still got
successful so there was still a couple
of good deals to be had a lot of people
message me back just either rejecting
the offers or in the case of that other
rig that actually had a GTX 960 instead
of a 980 which is a huge difference in
numbers but also on top of that the 757
70d l' which I thought was a deal at $5
they messaged me back saying they wanted
$40 for it and I'm just saying it was of
a you can keep that card for $40 it is
nowhere near worth $40 like actually $5
is a pretty fair price for something
that old and also the i7 4790k that
already sold to someone else so but also
one of my usual contacts they go get PC
parts off he's actually on holidays at
the moment so I'll be seeing him
hopefully next month and next month's
deal Sun will be
in America so stay tuned for that if you
guys enjoyed today's youth price
performance hustle then be sure to hit
that like button and let us know in the
comment section below
which is the better of the two deals the
PC that we got or the fractal define r5
and that raised prism cooler there's not
much to choose from but also let us know
in the comments what you think of the
current situation of used price
performance parts love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and I
hope you have a Happy New Year and I'll
catch you in the next year peace out for
