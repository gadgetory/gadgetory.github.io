I've got a new meta for you guys a meta
is basically most effective tactic
available it came from MOBAs when they
released updates and they changed heroes
and then those new strategies that were
more effective so when it comes to used
parts hunting we're gonna start using
that word and what's the most effective
tactic available to pick up them deals
so now this all came about because my
brother wants to finish off his corsair
bulldog and basically the corsair
bulldog only comes with a mini ITX
motherboard in this case it's a Z 270
from MSI comes with a cooler as well a
120mm cooler and a small form-factor
power supply and you also get the case
but it doesn't have a hard driver and
SSD it doesn't have ddr4 memory doesn't
have the CPU and the GPU so I've already
sold him a GTX 1080 Ti so now he just
needs a CPU some ddr4 memory and an SSD
and so I thought to myself with the
prices of ddr4 memory being the way they
are at the moment why don't we just
check out good old gam tree and see if
we can find a deal now if you're gonna
go out and buy ddr4 memory honestly guys
just save yourself some money go outside
grab a hose and just hose yourself down
because that's exactly what you're gonna
get if you go out and buy brand-new ddr4
memory at the moment so with that I
thought go look for some deals see what
we can find and this came up straight
away 1000 Australian dollars and now of
course you're not gonna pay the asking
price so it had 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory now this would cost about at
least half a grant in Australia at the
moment it's ridiculously expensive but
also had a 6700 K z170a Corsair 780 T
and a 1,000 watt power supply and a 250
gigabyte SSD and a cooler on the actual
CPU itself so I thought damn you know my
brother he could pull out the 6700 K the
memory and also the SSD and that's
practically his whole build done and
then I could use the rest to do some
really cool stuff and I'm thinking EVGA
sr2 motherboard Corsair 780 T thousand
watt power supply we could do something
with the parts left over now he offered
to pay 600 Australian for all those
parts he needed the memory the CPU and
the SSD and that's a bargain and I said
okay all the extra I get to keep but
I'll get a deal on this so I offered the
guy
least 750 Australian and he came back
like almost straight away with 850
strength so I knew he was keen to sell
so I came back with 780 and I held on
that and he accepted so now we're gonna
go outside and go pick this beast up and
see exactly what kind of a deal we're
getting
so we just got back now from picking up
the 780 T that we picked up with all
this hardware inside so it's got a cool
mask looks like a tx3 cooler we've got a
6700 K 32 gigabytes of memory as well
ddr4 memory in Australia alone I think
this is like $500 on its own at the
moment ddr4 memory is just a ripoff at
the moment that's why I went to go out
and buy this PC was this memory here so
it's actually I just checked it out
before it's 1.2 volt 2400 megahertz to
so it's really good stuff if you're into
overclocking memory manually as you be
able to up it to 1.35 volt hopefully
will at least get three gigahertz out of
it and I've got the graphics card here
this is the reason why I believe this
whole build was cheap
there was a HD 7970 in there and so
generally when people go to buy pcs they
look at the graphics card first because
it's the most important thing for gaming
and they probably saw the 79 17 they're
like oh this thing ain't gonna play
games - well like table G and stuff so
they probably moved on yet the whole
case itself the 780 T I believe in
Australia this thing goes for like 250
AUD it's a very expensive case and the
reason I'm just like over the moon about
this whole deal at the moment is because
I'll be able to I believe put the SR 2
inside this case so I think I've found
the case for the Jules Eon build that I
was gonna do on the channel so this is
the first piece here we've also got down
the bottom here a 1000 watt power supply
modular as well this is the rmx-1000
what really good power supply awesome
I'm glad that that came included with
the build and of course we've got a z170
pro gaming I think from as rocks so
that's a pretty good board on its own as
well hopefully I'll be able to get maybe
even an Aliexpress 4 core and drop that
in the Q hqg or something like that so
also included was a hundred fifty
gigabyte SSD from Samsung and Evo and
man I I really can't believe the value
we're getting out of this so this is
just a really good new strategy if you
guys are into bargain hunting then
seriously don't rule out the x99 systems
for these z170 systems because I'm sure
a lot of people are gonna be selling
these to upgrade their pcs even to
pre-built because this may
being a prebuilt itself but I kind of
doubt that with all these scary cables
but upgrading people are looking to
upgrade and with that they probably
don't realize that ddr4 memory is so
expensive they probably just think the
new graphics cards and all the latest
and greatest stuff is adding to the
build of like a 2k plus PC and they're
letting bargains like this go for next
to nothing so I'm shocked I mean even if
you were like a just wanting to build a
new PC you can take this grabs card out
clean up this whole PC give it a techie
air city cleanse and you would have a
awesome gaming PC for like maybe 1k USD
and you'd have the latest and greatest
IPC and they've even thrown in a blu-ray
player as well but with that said let's
pull this thing apart clean it all up
and get things ready
so now here's another awesome deal to
top things off when I was over there
they asked the guy who said do you want
to monitor and I was like how much you
want for it and then he said a hundred
Australian dollars which would be like
75 USD and I came back and just said you
know I just sat there and paused and
kind of literally like 10 seconds I just
sat there and paused and he's like fifty
dollars and I'm like okay cuz yeah when
you get when you get the sense that
someone's desperate to sell that's when
you're in a position of power so I was
in a position of power here pick this
monitor up for 50 Australian dollars
it's a 1080p azouz 27-inch monitor so
that's a crazy deal for the money so
that was just a top everything off on
the awesome deal we already got
there's all those parts they're looking
brand-spanking-new after a proper tech
yes city cleanse we use the brake
cleaner we used all that degrees i and
the degrees is really cheap i went
overboard this time because I didn't
have much brake cleaner but I had a lot
of degrees up so I used that to clean up
the majority of the parts and that
graphics card that 7970 was just so
filthy and dirty so that got a proper
cleanse as well that's looking like
brand-new that 780 t is going to go
really well with the build that I've got
planned for it we're gonna drop that SR
to motherboard in that case gonna make
it fit and we've also got the 1000 watt
power supply now to boot with that so
we've got two extra pieces that we've
picked up on a bargain so all these
parts they costed me 230 Australian
dollars because my brother he wanted a
kid out at 6700 K like I said before and
SSD and some ddr4 memory and he got a
really good deal so he's paying $600
towards this build to get those pieces
and I'm getting the rest sort of like a
reward for my hustle and so I got a
really good deal 230 a strain which
would be like a hundred and seventy
something USD for a monitor 1080p
monitor 1000 watt power supply corsair
780 t case a cooler a z170 pro gaming
motherboard and also a 79 70 and a
blu-ray player too so that was just an
incredible bunch of deals the
motherboard even had the sticker on it
so got some cool b-roll where it looks
like it's brand new so that's awesome as
well hopefully I'll be able to get an
Aliexpress 408 threaded skylake CPU for
cheap like a qhq gngo sample drop that
in and make a really cool build for you
guys so stay tuned for that but also one
thing that I posted to Instagram as well
was a big mistake that I made today when
I was cleaning and that was using tire
shine I accidentally just mistook it for
the brake cleaner because they're both
bloob cans and I started using and
realized all damn this stuff's a little
bit different and I realized it was tire
shine so we're gonna check out now and
see if the HD 7970 still works after
using tire shine
so that's such a bummer like the the
screens like flickering and stuff now I
think I might have broken it yeah I got
you didn't I got you now this is the
HDMI cable was pulled out halfway so
that we have it tire shine even works
okay I just seriously wouldn't recommend
it at all it's just I made a mistake in
the graphics card still works okay but
keep in mind I did use the brake cleaner
and degreaser after that so that
probably cleaned off any conductive or
capacitive chemicals and with that said
today's parts hunk was just a major
success I hope you guys enjoyed it new
meta to the game if you guys are in the
market for PC parts then be sure to
check out some skylake builds or some
x99 builds because if you're in the
market for new parts too you can piece
out a really good PC on a budget and
save a lot of money especially with ddr4
prices being as expensive as they are so
hope you guys enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below what was your favorite
piece of today's bug and on love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
