you're not gonna believe this awesome
deal that we got up on the table here
this is from the Facebook marketplace
$30 and what we're getting here is
essentially a whole palette of computers
and I'll shocked when I first saw this
use of let me know is like look this has
just come up on Facebook marketplace and
then we contacted the guy 10 minutes
after he listed it he had initially
listed for $40 and I think he said
initially in the listing there were two
pallets available I said I'll take both
of them but then he said he's merged him
into one so we would do it for $30 I'm
like look I'll be there as soon as
possible that's sold and that's what
we're gonna do right now we're gonna
jump in the ute with dad man and we're
gonna go pick up this whole pallet of
computers in 2018 a lot of people are in
the market for used parts but if you're
not the nazarov you covered with the Z
390 phantom gaming six bringing that
premium value with a 12 phase vrm that
will handle the ninety nine hundred K of
five gigahertz juicing over 200 watts
coupled with awesome onboard audio and a
2.5 gigabit per second next solution
that will prioritize gaming packets this
is what it's all about if you're in the
new parts link in the description below
so now we're on the road I'm driving
with dad man his keeper control of his
ute and this is such a crazy thing
because I'm going to actually drop off a
computer I don't know if you guys
remember this PC with a 1080i and the
5820k it's literally next door to the
place where we're picking up the pallet
of PCs so we're taking out two birds
with one stone here and I'll update you
guys as soon as we get closer to the
destination
so we just go back now is quite a drive
to get back from Brisbane and here we've
just got as you can see a whole pallet
of computers so what we're gonna do now
is get a box cutter cut all this plastic
off and I'm gonna be very careful with
my thumbs don't worry about that but
after we do that we're gonna check out
everything inside these pcs because I
think a lot of them are 775 LGA 775 but
I'm hoping some of them will be first
gen LGA 1156 as well so run loading now
we've got a total here of 15 pcs already
gutted this one and we got the lottery
out of this one a 2 gigabyte ddr2 stick
so that's already some good news but I'm
thinking we may even have a $2.00 League
of Legends PC here maybe make a separate
video and we also got some cool stuff as
well like routers and switches and DSL
modems so this is looking pretty cool
let's lay these all out on the concrete
and then I guess we'll just cut them up
here because it'll save us a but I'm
bringing them down to the studio
anyone keen on a pentium 4 well you said
it's got a motherboard but has it got a
father board so we just got this one
down here it's a Core 2 Duo not really
much going on power supply is really
mediocre but we did get a 2 gigabyte
ddr2 stick out of this one too so that's
not bad going so this one here it's got
a Core 2 Duo we just pulled for one
gigabyte sticks out and then the one
beside it we've got two one gigabyte
sticks and again a Core 2 Duo so we
might actually rip out these CMOS
batteries as well as the side of cables
as well and try and maximize the value
out of this one there's this one here we
pulled out one two gigabyte stick out of
this but also the motherboards pretty
good I might pull this motherboard out
because it looks like it's just a
general standardized motherboard does
have an AK bell in it as well this power
play is pretty much garbage yeah I might
pull that out as well moving for us to
here we've got 2 1 gigabyte sticks in
this one another Core 2 Duo so it's
looking like there's a lot of LGA 775
dinosaurs here I'm kind of hoping I'd
get some like real juice out of this but
again we've got 2 sorry 3 1 gigabyte
sticks in this AMD Athlon x64 machine
here the motherboard definitely looks
decent so I'll pull that motherboard out
as well and they grab its card and
actually to be honest I might even just
keep the case it looks like a pretty
cool case so this one here we got a 2
gigabyte ddr2 stick so that's a little
bit better in our luck and then moving
on here this is I guess the grand prize
of it all because it's got a really nice
600 watt power supply of four 12-volt
rails dual CPUs there's Aeons as well so
we're going to be bringing this inside
as well checking it out a little bit
more in-depth
seeing what CPUs it has seen if it even
boots because this might look like it is
the League of Legends PC so now here's
the little HP we've got three of these
and they got 1 gig laptop memory in them
so it's a little bit of a bust next
thing we've got a here's an old AMD PC
we've got the graphics card out here the
power supply is actually really bad so
you know it's a really bad power supply
when that essentially that 5 volt rails
posting bigger specs on the 12 volt rail
and then we got here a 256 megabytes
graphics card so welcome back to the old
school maybe that'll play League of
Legends so we'll keep that around and
sort of take that inside and then we've
got the Pentium 4 rig which is nostalgic
got a heap of DVD drives but I've
already got so many of them and then
we're back to square one here but we're
still going to open up one two more pcs
so we're gonna get inside of those and
see what they've got
so this one here we've opened it up
pulled out for 1g by 6 of ddr2 and then
this Dell here was a similar scenario
but it had to 512 sticks and to 1g by
sticks it's got a garbage power supply
in it but not a bad case and not a bad
motherboard so it will keep this
configuration here and then this is the
last PC we are pulling apart which has a
400 watt power supply so that's pretty
decent we can utilize that cases okay so
we're going to sort of stack up the
stuff that we're keeping now and sort of
putting the other stuff that we don't
need on the back of the truck so now
we've sort of sifted through all the
good stuff here and that is a lot of
ddr2 memory like an absolute crap ton so
that's the positive thing to come out of
that that's easily worth I'd say
probably worth over $100 at least and
then we've got solder cables as well we
can never get enough solder cables then
we've got five cases here with some
intro but that just came out there and
it's like pulling apart already but
we'll fix it back up with some silicone
or whatever and so we got that case we
got this case this case and this one
here which looks probably the best after
I give it some tech yes loving it's
going to come up really nice especially
for a gaming PC but this one here
actually no I think it was this one here
with the jewels eons this one's
definitely going to look like it will be
the League of Legends $2 PC it's the
perfect candidate because it's got sort
of more of the specs that we're looking
for it came pre-installed with 4
gigabytes of RAM it's got 2 CPUs looks
like it would have some decent onboard
graphics but I'm kind of actually
curious and know you guys are probably
curious as well to see what kind of
Zeon's it's got in it so I wouldn't mind
it booting it up right now and then
taking a tour or a test drive in the
BIOS so booted this computer up it is
super loud and that's pretty sure it's
due to this fan here which pushes a lot
of air unfortunately for this computer
it's only got like really old Zeon's and
then don't even have like a actual
number moniker two of them they're just
called like officially xeon 2.8
gigahertz but that's what they're called
so I think this one will we're going to
turn this off and see what else we have
around here in the studio because I want
to do I want to get the best pick for
the $2 League of Legends PC
so here it is here this is the Core 2
Duo machine we've whacked in that 256
megabytes gratis card four gigabytes of
ddr2 memory and it's got a Core 2 Duo
4500 at 2.2 gigahertz this could be it
ladies and gentlemen this could be the
$2.00 League of Legends PC that you've
all been waiting for and people have
been asking me to do a sequel to that PC
but I've wanted to make it something
that was even cheaper something that was
worthy over the adventures of tech yes
City and this looks like it is finally
it so let's move over to a conclusion
now and see what we've got here for this
$30.00 so there it all is $30 haul and
in USD terms that'd be like $22 or
something incredible we've got fifteen
pcs and we just pulled out so much ddr2
and I'm actually going to go back and
pull out all the call to joy as I
decided I'll do that tomorrow in the
morning it's actually dark now because
maybe I can switch out some of the co2
joys and get the best possible spec for
that League of Legends PC so we did five
dollars in the past this time we're
gonna go even cheaper and go for a
pro-rata $2.00 League of Legends PC
looking forward to giving you guys that
video I've actually been waiting
personally to beat that PC in terms of
value for money and I think we're
finally going to do it with this PC it
will place one of the 15 pcs we picked
up but other than that we've got so much
ddr2 that's at least as we said before
worth $100 in my opinion I could
probably flip that for $100 and some of
the other pcs I might be trying to maybe
put together some scuffed Office pcs see
if it's a new metal see if some people
are interested and I'm gonna see what I
honestly can turn this thirty dollars
into I also gave use of some of the
routers and switches and stuff he was
interested in that some of those real
mini PCs as well but I think with this
haul I'm going to definitely grab that
$30 changing into something and possibly
give you guys a new series maybe this is
the birth of something new maybe it's
that opportunity we've been waiting for
to see what we can turn thirty dollars
in to see if we maybe turn it into it
$2,000 PC in due time and vlog the whole
process for you guys because I'm naughty
been demanding that I do something like
that and this I think is the beginning
of that and we've also finally got
Youssef on he's helping out it out the
videos we're getting ahead of schedule
done the health videos sr2 is dropping
very soon part one and then after that
we're gonna be completing the build so
all that juicy content is coming and I'm
personally gonna be giving you guys each
and every one of you that's right
individual tech yest loving I don't know
how yet but I'll find a way and with all
that aside let me know what you think
was the best part or best PC in today's
$30.00 haul love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always and also don't
forget to hit that scuffed slash grazed
slash injured thumbs up button and I'll
catch in another tech video very soon
peace out for now goodbye
I just literally finished playing this
Judy up yesterday and it's already
filling up with potatoes but they
admittedly are beautiful potatoes should
I give them names each and every one of
these the five with the silver duckling
I don't know if this is weird but my
favorite part of today's whole whole is
this Intel Inside Zeon sticker bring
back the zeal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
