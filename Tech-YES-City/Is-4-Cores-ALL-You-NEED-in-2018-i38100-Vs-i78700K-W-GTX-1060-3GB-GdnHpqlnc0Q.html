you really need for gaming well to
answer this question instead of pairing
it up with a high range gtx 980ti or gtx
1080 which i do see a lot of people
doing instead of that we're going to be
pairing it with a mid-range graphics
card the GTX 1060 we're also going to be
comparing it against the 8700 K in some
of the most demanding titles because in
previous videos you guys tell me that
I'm missing out on testing some games
that really stress the CPU games like
far cry 5 assassin's creed origin so
we're gonna be testing those but also
we're gonna go down a trip down memory
lane and see why four cores four threads
may still be relevant for a few years to
come
welcome back to tech yes City I hope
you've all been deal hunting or if
you're not deal hunting then you're
probably buying new PC parts and right
beside me here I have the i3 8100 which
comes in just over a hundred dollars
however a lot of the times people say
that four cores four threads is coming
irrelevant in 2018 and to that I'd say
when it comes to PC building you always
want to balance out the money that you
spent on a CPU and also a GPU this has
been a trend that I've always
recommended people do when they want to
build a new PC and get the best value
for money so today we have the i3 8100
coupled with a gtx 1060 from Galax and
the first game we're going to pull up
here is far cry 5 when we coupled it
with the i3 8100 we score an average FPS
of 68 frames then we got a minimum of 61
comparing that against the 8700 K that's
called 69 and then a minimum of 59 so we
saw that a 1 FPS difference and on this
I did set the memory to 26 66 megahertz
on both configurations
then we where the project cars to the
trend didn't really change a whole lot
here as well on the 8100 we've got 96
average FPS then 85 and 61 for the one
in point one percent lows move over to
the 8700 K it did score 2 FPS higher
however since this game does not have an
inbuilt benchmark I did have to do a few
runs and then average those runs so
there would still be a little bit of
variance in this benchmark per se
however moving over to
Creed origin a very demanding title
especially in 2018 I believe this is a
console port so it's optimization for PC
is still not the best in today's
standards
first up the 8100 scored 58 average FPS
was the 1% low of 49 and then a point 1
percent low of 10 move over to the 8700
K it scored 60 and then 48 and 12
respectively so there wasn't a whole lot
of the difference again in Assassin's
Creed origin and even though I turned
off vsync this game didn't have an
inbuilt cap of 60 FPS moving over the
last title that was demanding we had
Witcher 3 scoring 60 average FPS and
then 52 and 47 move over to the 8100
that scored 60 and then 51 and 27 this
is in the latest expansion as well so
witcher 3 far cry 5 and project cars and
even assassin's creed origin didn't see
a whole lot of a difference we did use
an SSD in both the builds and as I said
before we did overclock the memory to
2666
from 2133 which in my opinion is a very
obtainable memory overclock even on the
most budget of budget ddr4 memory so
what does this all mean for you as a
gamer well when it comes to building a
new PC you generally as I said before
want to balance out your CPU and your
GPU that is the money you spend on both
so sure I could put the i3 8100 in
couple of with a gtx 980ti and that
would show more of a gap between the two
CPUs however when it comes to
practicality and if you just want to get
into PC gaming to get on that 8700 K
first of all you have the extra price
for the CPU which is at least an extra
$200 then you've got a custom cooler
because the 8700 kate doesn't come with
a cooler as opposed to the i3 8100 which
does and then you most likely will want
to get a better motherboard anyway so
that your CPU doesn't throttle because
we used a budget motherboard in this
build and it's absolutely fine for the
i3 8100 however going back down history
Lane it's an interesting trend that
we're seeing here back in 2005 AMD
released their dual core consumer CPU
the Athlon 64 x2 then two years later
Intel released their Core 2 Duo quad
named Li the most popular model was the
Q 6600 and then 10 years later we still
have four cores being released
that are still relevant in gaming so
what's with this trend why hasn't the
market adopted more cause more threats
especially when it comes to gaming when
we look at the server side we have
definitely seen an increase in the core
count and also the prices of CPUs in
that respective field however when it
does come to gaming and especially
consumer n CPUs we haven't seen that
same trajectory in the increase in core
counts and so this does come down I
believe to programming the actual games
themselves when I look through posts on
the internet about threading for
multi-threaded applications it's
actually very difficult even in 2018 it
is still very difficult to perfectly
optimize a game and hence budgets and
also developers at Studios don't have to
outlay the extra money if they quickly
put together games as the case with pub
G when that was first released it was
very single core dependent and sure as
that game did blow up they did go and
reoptimize the game to utilize more
cause and threads but the problem still
exists where titles are still constantly
being released and they do only utilize
one two or even four threads as opposed
to utilizing eight or sixteen especially
perfectly I know in the past that a
company called dice has been renowned
for optimizing their games for many
cause and many threads though dice is a
company that has been around for years
and they do have the budget to make
their games more polished and optimized
especially for PC another example of
this is Blizzard especially overwatch a
game that was incredibly competitive yet
it was incredibly well optimised for PC
they may be thinking this is a problem
that will soon be fixed with new api's
like Vulcan and dx12 and the PC title
doom was certainly a poster child for
how well optimization can get on the new
AP is but unfortunately that's where the
sort of trend gets bucked Doom is really
the only good example for games on new
AP is that run really well when it comes
to a lot of other titles that have dx12
support or even Vulcan support a lot of
people don't use them because the games
actually end up running worse so what
does this leave us as tech enthusiasts
and gamers or even people like me making
recommendations well it leaves us at a
point where I am always going to
recommend get what's relevant for you at
this point in time we don't know what
the future will spell for optimizations
cause and threads but one thing is if
you
Gaming in the now then you want to enjoy
your experience and that's what an i3
8100 definitely for the money or a
Verizon 2200 G or arisin 3 1204 cor will
give you coupled with a gtx 1060 or an
rx 580 for example which a mid-range
grab is cards and even better news if
you're into competitive multiplayer
titles like csgo a CPU like this will at
1080p give you around 300 fps all the
time every time and I hope you enjoyed
this video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button and let us know in
the comment section below
what do you think about these 4 cores 4
threaded CPUs in 2018 I think they're
absolutely fine though of course if you
do want to get into streaming then you
may need to spend extra money on
something like a six core 12 threaded
Rison or Intel CPU anyway guys I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
