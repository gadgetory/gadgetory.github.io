City we took a look at the x79 Wan and
board from Aliexpress and it was cheap
it came in with a pretty good price but
it wasn't a true x79 motherboard and so
I was left a little bit disappointed
because it could just barely handle a
six core 3930k with out-of-the-box
speeds and you couldn't overclock or do
anything like that however here right
beside me is an upgrade this is the
running x79 motherboard now it is a true
x79 chipset you've got eight dims of
memory also got what looks like a seven
phase vrm we'll be taking a closer look
at that very soon but you've also got
four sixteen speed PCIe slots and
support apparently for slight overclock
so I'm gonna be running temperature
tests on this thing today telling you if
it can survive the 3930k at overclocked
settings or if it can overclock or how
far can overclock because actually
haven't tested this board out yet but
another thing to you guys have been
asking me to take a look at the dual CPU
socket at wanan boards and honestly guys
I actually have gone through dual
socketed CPUs in the past and I'm not a
big fan of them they have problems with
games and they also have other little
problems that you can run into
especially when you're using it for
desktop usage but besides all that they
feel in my opinion a lot larger than
single CPU solutions but anyway back to
this running motherboard you can
currently get it for around 180 Aussie
dollars and that's shipped
internationally I think that's around
130 US dollars which isn't a bad price
for a brand-new x70 9 motherboard also
another bonus is the build quality
actually feels really solid they've used
the stick PCB you've got 10 USB slots at
the back to those being USB 3 as well as
having a black PCB and eight solder
ports and on top of that you get USB 3
front out and MDOT two Wi-Fi
connectivity supports so this board
looks pretty promising but let's open up
the box check what else is inside
take this heatsink off and do a little
bit of analysis of the vrm for you
so taking a closer look at this vrm it's
actually looking like they're doubling
the phases so you get fourteen phases
instead of seven but I've got no idea
what these chokes are they have no
branding on them the capacitors just say
r-la to a twenty and then the MOSFETs
say 69 like that looks like that's the
actual brand that makes the MOSFETs with
the codename of em three zero nine eight
em so if you guys know any details about
this VRM then please let us know in the
comment section below we can help
everyone out but in terms of how it
performs I guess there's only one more
test to do and that's put this heatsink
back on and then see what we can get out
of the boss in terms of overclock
ability as well as heat and give you
guys some numbers but also inside the
box itself you get the i/o shield as
well as a very flimsy manual and the CD
driver which you can use as a frisbee
but let's say this thing is indeed ultra
true I think they've ripped that off
from gigabyte I think that's the one
that gigabyte uses
here you've got very basic options for
memory speed we can go up to 1866 or
1600 which isn't too bad I mean having
1866 at your disposal is decent
especially if you can make it quad
pumped so we can leave that alone it
should be automatically on auto should
rank the four memory sticks in
quad-channel if it doesn't we'll find
out in Windows but going back to the CPU
settings there should be options to
overclock the CPU itself so going over
here I think it's in CPU power
management and right down here we've got
power technology you can disable that if
you want custom I do like to have the
turbo States on especially when you're
idling on the desktop they help save
power but we do have overclocking down
here and so it's a got a ratio limit of
maybe you know on Sandy Bridge you could
easily get these CPUs up to 4.6 but just
for overclocking sake to test if it
works out properly we're gonna overclock
this to 4.4 gigahertz just to see if it
works in terms of voltage control it
does look like it's very limited on this
board I will just have a look and see
what I can find but again this BIOS is a
very simple BIOS I've seen this before
when I had the jewel Xeon rig it looks
like it's pretty much the exact same bar
so there isn't a whole lot of control
but you still do have some basic extra
features which you can take advantage of
and now it's it's staying at sort of 3.9
gigahertz maximum it's sort of
fluctuating between that 3.6 to 3.9
definitely not the 4.4 that I try to
lock in there so I gotta go back into
the bar straight change a few things
around because it does look like this
wants to max out at pretty much 3.9
gigahertz since it is using the C 600
chipset so it's actually not using I
don't think an official x79 chipset
because looks like the options are
limited and as I said before with that
Jules II on Bill dated in the past the
BIOS looks exactly the same but let's
try to take one more peek back in the
boss and see what we can do before we
actually start testing this thing so one
good thing about this board so far is
that it is indeed displaying
quad-channel memory with the 1600
megahertz Corsair that we locked in
there
so we've almost been stressed testing
this motherboard for a good 30 minutes
now and there's some good and bad news
the first of all the good news is is
that the V RMS okay we're in a pretty
hot ambient temperature here of 28
degrees and it's got to around 94
degrees maximum with the IR sensor and
so this is alright at 140 watts the
problem is however is that we can't get
above 3.9 gigahertz managed to get the
3.9 gigahertz completely stable by
changing the power limit settings in the
BIOS with the seconds on the limits but
besides that we just can't get any
higher now I have heard that you can get
higher limits and we'll talk about that
in the conclusion but for what it is
right here and what we're staring at 140
watts delivery through the vrm should
ideally be good for around four point
two to four point four gigahertz at
least since at this 3.9 gigahertz
setting we are indeed over vaulting for
that 3.9 gigahertz so I would like to
see some manual control here because
what it's doing at this 3.9 key goes
it's just overall ting and essentially
that 140 watts is just too much for this
set clock speed Bob with all that aside
let's put this motherboard back on the
test bench and run it through all the
tech yes paces test out that onboard
audio onboard NIC and also the USB ports
and play some video games on it and just
see if it's smooth with something like
an RT X 2070 for example
so finished taking this motherboard now
through all the paces here and the good
thing is is that it includes a one
gigabit per second
NIC and now you might be stopping and
laughing they're like does that stand it
on all motherboards that you get right
gigabyte our RK m SI su some
motherboards but the thing is some
chinese motherboard manufacturers will
actually only put even in 2018 and 2019
a 100 megabits per second / 10 megabits
per second nic solution and a lot of
people wouldn't even notice because
their internet isn't that fast or
they're not transferring files over the
network at those speeds but this
motherboard does include one gigabit
solution 2 USB 3 speeds as well I
checked them out they were working fine
but an odd thing about that was seemed
to cap my Kingston Drive at a little
over 200 megabytes when this drive is
easily capable of going into like 300
and 350 megabytes so that was a little
bit odd on the USB 3 also as we saw with
the vrm temperatures as before when
we're testing that out they got a little
bit hot but it was capable of running
the 3930k to its max advertised turbo
multiplier I would like to put in a 1650
v2 as a lot of people are buying the
running combos with that CPU in
particular perhaps it has a higher
native multiplier and because it's on 22
nanometer as opposed to 32 nanometer it
can utilize that max power limit and
clock higher I believe some people have
got that CPU to 4.2 gigahertz on all
caused on this particular motherboard
but here today we only got 3.9 and in
Cinebench it got close to a thousand
points we had quad-channel memory
support and also another bonus on top of
that is I decided to test out the
onboard audio and it's pretty bad I mean
there's no noise filters which is okay
but anything over plus 20 DB 100 noise
level starts to really bring some noise
into the mic so you want to keep this on
plus 20 DB volume level or 50 if you
decide to get this board but also the
audio out that's going to your
headphones I did a frequency response
and there was a massive amount of bass
roll-off 20 Hertz and under so if you
like sub bass you're going to
missing out with this motherboard but
not only mentioned that the actual
frequency response curve itself was very
shaky which is indicating of cheap
components used throughout the audio
process there so I wouldn't be buying
this if you're an audiophile or if you
are an audiophile definitely have a
separate piece of DAC amp solution ready
for your headphones but then the last
thing I tested with audio was the
crosstalk levels and they were actually
very good about minus 80 dB and the
funny thing is on this motherboard even
at a volume level of 100 there was no
leaking like we've seen with practically
all the major motherboard manufacturers
with Z 370 z 390 and stuff in 2018 where
their left channel was leaking over to
the right channel past the volume level
of 90 this problem doesn't exist on this
motherboard so it can be fixed and I
would like to see that fixed on those
high-end motherboards in 2019 but all
that aside let's move on now to the
verdict with the running motherboard is
it worth your money and I mean at 130
u.s. it is a step up over the WAN and
board I would definitely buy this over
that one on board even though it cost a
little bit more it's got more memory
support it's got a quad channel memory
it's also got native features that work
properly and it just actually is an ex
79 well not really it's a C 600 chipset
which does have better support than I
think they were using like the H 77 in
the one and from if I remember correctly
so this is good that they're using a
proper chipset and the vrm does seem to
do a better job than the one and did
when it came to supporting the six core
it's just if you're into overclocking
and you're looking to get say for
instance a 4.6 gigahertz or 4.8
gigahertz overclock on a 3930k then
you're going to unfortunately be out of
luck with the running board as well
but it did have good build quality and
it was a step up over the one and it is
kind of recommended if you want to get
or if you say for instance you come in
to cheap ddr3 memory or a cheap 3930k or
a cheap Xeon 1650 v2 for example which
you can pick them up for very cheap I
believe I picked these 3930k is up for I
think it was $60 or something this is
very cheap so if you can get the six
cause for super cheap and you're looking
for a motherboard and you just can't
find one or they're overpriced the x79
boards out there then this one will do
the job but just know it does have some
limitations I'd say the audio and also
the overclocking do kind of let this
down and the vrm temps they weren't that
bad considering the ambient temperatures
and considering that we were pushing 140
watts through it so not all that bad for
the running board and of course the last
benefit of this board is if you do get
the Xeon chips then you can run
registered ddr3 memory on this board too
so there is that option and when it came
to gaming it was very smooth quad
channel memory is a good thing
3.9 gigahertz even on Sandy Bridge over
6 cores 12 threads will do a fine job in
2019 even with the latest and greatest
titles up until maybe in RTX 2060 or in
RTX 2070 but after that you may come
into some problems depending on the
title and depending on whether it's CPU
hungry or not hey guys hope you enjoyed
today's video about the running
motherboard I pick this one up off the
actual same way that I showed it in the
video today I got it on eBay with 5 or
10% off I think I got it with 10% off
because there was like a sale going on
at the time and this was actually a
while ago so I had to go to America for
3 weeks so didn't get a chance to do it
do anything with it until now and so I
hope you enjoyed this random look at a
random unknown motherboard maker if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
also let us know in the comments section
below if you like this board you liked
the aesthetic or you just liked it in
general you think it's maybe a decent
option I do definitely think it's a
decent option just I did want a little
bit more especially in terms of
flexibility in the BIOS and overclocking
but if you guys want me to take a look
at that dual socket one and board a can
but I'm going to tell you straight up I
already know the conclusion with it I'm
not going to be recommending it to
pretty much the majority of people just
for those who need cores and threads for
specific application
on a specific budget anyway guys I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon if you enjoy the content as always
and you want to see it the moment it's
uploaded be sure to hit that sub button
