check lounge and I'm joined here by my
Coast care from tech showdown how you
doing I'm doing great Brian how are you
man how's your week been really good man
really good I have just been out of
control people have been loving the
youth parts um yeah it's just as good
man I've just been getting back into it
I mean there's a lot of new parts that
were had to get done through the backlog
but the backlog has kind of been pushed
aside mind you I did show you guys what
in the vlog if you guys missed it or he
didn't see it in the vlog I did I did
show the backlog the new backlog it just
you know keeps coming in but of course
I'm like no I'm going to dedicate more
time to the use price/performance stuff
people love it and we picked up this
here the 290x so cheap man you got such
a good deal they're so good now I yeah I
got people telling me like they're
really really hot cuz I forgot I think
out of 290 and ages ago and yeah it was
I think it was throttling so they do the
reference ones they throttle the 290x
the throttle horrendously make sure
there's I you know about this switch on
the side right so if it the switch is
pointing towards the fan that's in
boo-boo mode and the fan speed will go
up too and I like 40% but if you have to
switch facing away from the fan that
will be silent mode and the fan will
stay at 20% and then you'll see boy
you'll see some strolling then what
about a well what about an excel or on
there that'll do good yeah that'll fix
the problem well that's uh yeah now they
were they were absolutely shocked as I
mean they would sit at 95 degrees for
forever so yeah so we are not the case
yeah also launched a new kind of series
and you put out a new filler out there a
PC house called people loved it I mean I
was just like at the spur of the moment
I was like I went my friends like dude
let's have some beers Peter I was like
yeah dude I haven't seen you for a long
time and it's like yeah and then he's
like dude I saw you on YouTube and it
was like just came over like bring the
camera on my films like yeah what
so we just made this series people loved
it so I could see what other friends on
the Gold Coast need their pcs tuned and
see what performance we can get before
and after because the llege it's the
this re the gains were legit like we saw
that you know especially in Elder
Scrolls online that was huge it was like
25% performance so James did nothing and
he's getting 25% more performance so
overwatch was the same deal it was a big
jump so yeah I mean and we had just a
lot of fun so that was really cool like
oh that was probably some of the most
fun I've ever had in terms of doing like
tech and sort of track drinking with
friends and this pretty is really it was
really cool so house calls definitely
going to be continued it was just it was
epic it was a good time beers whoever
thought beers and overclocking would be
so much fun just don't don't try it with
Alan - you know I could imagine some guy
out there like everybody I try got bit
drunk and L into overclocking now I've
got no fingers that's like yeah like
daemon feel sorry for you so but what
about you what's been going on dude I'm
just a sick Brian I'm just wondering the
fact that we only have three people
watching and it's not showing up on you
made the this isn't public right
yeah it's public as usually is public
dude I don't know why it wouldn't be oh
yeah I've got no idea YouTube might be
doing something YouTube's been crazy
lately so I know we'll carry on because
people watch it on the the afterwards
anyway um yeah on the archives I mean
the bottom line is those well the sad
thing is is that apparently the lately
YouTube has not been giving people
notifications so it's Ã«they yes it's
shocking sometimes yeah it's all over
the place at the moment um I really
don't understand it even now like I've
got my life like I put episode 24 so I
don't know why it's streaming with the
title episode 21 like I made sure that
was all fine to go before I it's fine
online saying at the Tech lounge 24 yeah
yeah it's it's fine it's just for some
reason I was
it won't come up on the main page which
is YouTube what do you deal with do us
so yeah I mean I've heard like a lot of
stories about YouTube lately like just
yeah I mean I've been feeling it as well
right we've all been feeling it even in
even in the tech scene dropped views
dropped revenue dropped everything it's
like a I didn't even know what's going
on with YouTube at the moment are you
know but I'm just going to keep making
content doesn't matter right so you can
do really I mean I feel sorry for um
well I mean it's hurting that the
smaller channels a lot more than the
bigger ones but yeah it's still pretty
not ideal but I think it will turn
around kind of soon what we wouldn't
imagine it was hope it would hope at
this yeah hope it will so but yeah I've
just been getting through more rising
content being making the most amount of
AMD videos ever did a the one of my
videos very popular the 1500 X versus
7700 the anon K so called a core
comparison that did quite well um via
people liked it good to see Wendell
retweeting me had retweeting that video
so thanks window such a great guy is
that is that what is that Wendell
Wendell Wendell that's oh that's how you
would say here w/e in yeah bro hey in
New Zealand and he becomes an AI doesn't
it mean do I mean in the best country so
yeah mid or that I'm yeah now so that
was pretty that was that was pretty good
and quite an interesting comparison
quarter core there isn't really that
much in it I'm considering the huge
price difference between them as well so
that's quite a nursing yet it's strange
ace no no no yeah how did you go dude
how did you go with the arm how did you
go with that showdown I haven't seen it
yet so what was the verdict kind of
thing ah it's the seventy seven hundred
wins even in productivity but they're
pretty close together with the 1500
exits stock this quite a decent
discrepancy but once but once the 1500 X
is overclocked and I managed to get four
gigahertz out o which seems to be the
standard I mean I've tested like
6-7 rise and CPUs now and the most I've
ever gotten out of any of them is 4
gigahertz like can never seem to get 4.1
but yeah at 4 gigahertz 1500 exit brings
them very close together 7700 still wins
by like maybe 5 6 FPS on average but
yeah be the one more expensive right
yeah it's a lot more expensive so that's
what I was saying you know you're much
better off with the 1500 X or buy that
the 1400 but the 1400 I've tested won't
go over 3.8 it's interesting these low
ones I've been testing now they seem to
not overclock as good which is maybe
what people were saying from the start
that as Rison goes on you'll start to
see a bigger and bigger discrepancy in
terms of how far you can overclock from
the higher end like X models and the
lower non X models okay I mean I've got
to do a lot more testing with that I've
just been yet busy with the sort of yeah
a lot of people want to see the use
stuff people they look dude I'm over
rising we know what it's got to like I
mean the thing is with rising when we
saw the 8 cause we kind of knew how the
six scores and for-cause would perform I
mean it wasn't going to be like worlds
apart right though we're going to
overclock pretty similar levels you know
you just like that's the thing I guess
after I do all the eight cores I've
still got to do the multiplayer
benchmark showdown and stuff like that I
will be doing that again with the six
core but as for the four core I mean
it's kind of like yeah the four core is
going to be good and especially when we
do that I think if we do a four core
comparison
I'll only use like a mid-range graphics
card for that as opposed with the six
core and the eight core I'll be using a
1080 Ti to sort of show all the massive
differences but for the average gamer
yeah who likes high graphics settings
it's not going to be much of a
difference at all it's not really going
to matter and you probably want to save
your money and go rosin but there is
that element that I do really take I do
focus on and that's competitive gaming
so like a lot of my friends a
competitive game is we all met back in
the day because we were competitive
gamers on brood war and CS not CS go CS
point six you know and that's sort of
like an element that I always carry
because I know there's a lot of people
out there that can't play these games on
a different level and they love playing
them as best as they can so I'm going to
cater towards that audience as well
because I love it
you know I love watching eSports as well
man I love some of this talent coming up
man these guys are incredible they can
do something you know you see them on
the keyboard man 200-plus APM they're
just going nuts so and they're not it's
not fake it's not fake a pin when you're
playing the sc2 bro and you're just
banging keys to get your APM up it so
might be yes everything gives us a class
you just can't have Steven Steve will
write in the comments - did Steve will
attest to this as well when we're
playing three versus three cabs got fake
APM he's a faker just a place it man
like you know my APM's just crazy
because I'm doing like you know four or
five face thing you know crazy economy
that way to the late game bro bring to
the late game Jersey fun your fave
faking that APM bro real it's like
really it's about 8080 APM so oh man
I've never seen mine that look like it
might be hit it usually is about like
150 something so it's actually not that
high not as like not like you're making
out like it's like 300 and all this like
fake spamming all the time okay so we're
gonna move on to this first benchmark
man we got this first benchmark here
apparently Elite is a time spy at times
by Ron with the Vega graphics card and
the the score is really bad like let's
be honest here this is really bad
hmm I mean I don't know if it's someone
faking it we would just hope it is I
mean it could be someone with a was it
the fury acts right it could be someone
the fury acts maybe and they may be
making it for views but if I'm if this
is Vega yes is looking this is just
looking terrible like yeah it's not
that's not ideal I know you guys are so
in the actual picture there it says the
graphics score which the guy kindly
highlighted says of 5721
now many you probably don't know what
that translates to so to give you an
idea
err a gtx 1080 on average depending
which model you have in a course vo sip
let's say you have a just a non
overclocked GTX 1080
like what I have a g1 gaming 1080 that
will be about 7000 so that's already
quite a bit higher than that apparent
Vega if you have something like a 1080
Ti you'll be hovering about ten thousand
to believe until I just I tested like I
tested mine out of the box before I just
ran it where's my overclocks like I put
in the 1080 I found it because I'm
testing the horas on another rig for the
showdown and it scores like 10 at 10 K
out of the box without doing anything so
damn you know what I mean like 1080i and
1080p pin mine day again it's only
twelve hundred megahertz I'd hope it
would go higher but this is the thing
this is a bigger piece of silicon it's
bigger than the rx 480 or hour now the
RX 580 in the RX 570 is going to be a
new piece of silicon too so you can't
expect it to clock I guess a lot higher
than twelve hundred megahertz I mean
could you expect it to clock a little
higher than twelve I'm saying about 1300
cap out it I'll be a guesstimate I mean
what would you yeah you would hope so I
mean this is yeah this really is an idea
I mean it would be a huge letdown if
Vega comes out and it cannot beat the
1080 because that's kind of it needs to
for me anyways I think it really needs
to at least go toe-to-toe with the GTX
1080
the 1080 TI yeah that's not so much the
concern I don't think because that's
sort of out in its own league but it's
also out in its own sort of price
bracket so I would say that yeah this
isn't looking ideal and it was something
I was weary about because of the huge
clock speed difference now that doesn't
that's not the end of the world remember
because we have a good example as the
GTX 1060 versus let's say the rx 580 now
there's a big discrepancy there in terms
clock speed a lot of people have 10 60s
going up to 2000 megahertz
2000 over 2000 megahertz and yet many of
their RX 5 80s for example even
overclocked will be pushing maybe 1500
megahertz so you got a full like 500
megahertz difference there and speed and
yet and a lot of tests you'll find that
the RX 580 will win so it's not all
about that I think a lot of people tend
to just see the clock speed and think
like oh wow well that's no raisin versus
cable X another perfect example I mean
it it does count um but it's not like
the be-all end-all like some people seem
to think it is just like kind of cool
counts sort of the same thing so yeah
it's this is interesting I would hope
though that it would be a bit high 1200
in this day and age does seem a little
bit lowdown if it was less something
like 1500 I think most people would be
fairly happy with that but again it
depends how it's being designed but this
is a very low so a lot lower than what I
think a lot of us would have hoped for
twelve hundred megahertz I mean it's
just I mean the memory probably could be
doubled effectively but it just depends
on how they're specking that so one
point four on the HBM - I mean but the
core clock twelve hundred megahertz is
low I mean of course you've got eight
gigabytes of vram there and so that's
why I think number of cards is one so it
couldn't be a fury X because it's got a
gigabytes of vram on it so this could be
legit like it very well could be legit
and it could also be that that they're
smaller Vega you know there's going to
be there there are two types there'll be
the full full bore chip um and there'll
be the cut down one to go against the
1070 and this could be the one that's
going against James even then a 10-7
he's still knocking it out of the water
from memory the 1070 will do about 6,000
I thought so that would be 6 1/2 I
thought 6 8 if you know they're pretty
aggressive man so I mean this is again
it's one benchmark we shouldn't be
basing it all this but this was like
where so much hype was coming into this
Vega Vega Vega
you know we're at an AMD event quite
recently an arm you know they were
really good like the event was awesome
I'm going to make a separate vlog a
video about that but yeah it's kind of
like I was always the whole time I was
like Wes Vega and then I have a go to be
secretive about it where's Vega I just
kept asking you know like where's Vega
West Vega hopefully I could you know
sneak some information out but I'm
hoping this isn't a case of AMD doing a
180 where now they're CPUs are really
good and their GPUs are falling behind
by a lot because it was the opposite a
couple of years ago that GPUs are really
good really competitive and their CPUs
were behind by a lot so I'd like to see
them I'd like to see Vega get a lot
better I mean like as it stands like if
this comes out in the wild and it's just
you know it's a thermal nightmare and
it's just thermal throttling like they
just can't get those cores under control
which might be a possibility considering
how many shaders there are and how much
of a big that piece of silicon is it
yeah yeah this is definitely going to be
a thing I just said some quick research
then ah you are right it seems to be
like if you have a kind of lower clock
1070 at stock speed you'll get about
6,000 but people overclocking them seem
to get them up to about six and a half
thousand some people that went real
crazy got them up to about 6700 so yeah
this is a if this is the one the
cut-down version meant to go into 1070
if that's in stock form and a reference
model then that will be competitive with
a 1070 once you think there when scope
good drivers is good non reference
models of higher speeds
I'm you should see that go up so if
that's the case then this isn't bad news
but if this is the full board ship then
oh well thing is they're putting HP m2
on it that's not cheap this is the thing
you know oh it's going to be competitive
against a 1070 but if they're putting
HBM 2 on there they're putting all those
streams this isn't cheap to make it's
not like AMD can be like hey guys we're
going to sell these things at 200 bucks
and just kill the market they're going
to be losing a heap of money in the end
of the day they got shareholders who
want to make profit on the dividends or
whatever
they want the company to grow they got
to be profitable and that's the thing it
comes from competition and releasing a
competitive product I don't know how
this is going to perform in the real
world but this score here is really not
looking good so that's what we wanted to
point out I mean wow I was really sort
of shocked when I saw that score and of
course compared it to my ten atti score
and then the 1080 is just even 1/10 70s
beating this at the moment so yeah I
mean looking forward to more
developments in this story and how it
performs in a bit of course people like
I read an article on wucf tech without
like either core clock slow a mere
twelve hundred megahertz it's like know
considering the 580 which is a refresh
that's been out in the wild for a while
silicon's matured that's really hitting
one point for something gigahertz it
it's not that far-fetched that this
thing wouldn't go that much higher than
twelve hundred megahertz like it
probably thirteen hundred I mean yeah so
it is a bit warmer that's not the end of
the world though I mean ideally we would
want it higher but if it can like going
back to my our expiry D example I mean
it's not the end of the world it is
broad is the end of the world okay maybe
it is bro judge he's going to take off
if this happens if this card releases at
these speeds with these with his
performance Josh I was going to be
taking off his red robe and putting on a
green robe he's going to be converting
to a Jedi so yeah on that note i galaxy'
released their hall of fame KF a to I
guess they're the same company we got
the hall of fame here I'm really digging
this side LCD display that looks so
awesome
yes your GPU memfs I've always been a
fan of the white the all-white cards I
mean they recently released this sniper
or EXO see that card was looking awesome
Mon some people like damn I hate the
look of it I was like damn it looks
awesome it was so clean it was just so
clean this looks a little bit more fancy
with like curves and stuff and I'm kind
of not a big fan of the curves and the
fancy real side styling if you ever
remember vo side body kits they were
just out there man
there were just too much for your car
yeah some people loved it I was always a
fan of the clean body kits you know that
this clean smooth no extra dimples and
dents and no speed bumps but this one
yeah it looks good of course it's going
to perform so damn well you're 12 plus 3
phase power design this thing's going to
be absolutely huge really wait yeah
triple-a so whoever needs to take their
good Eric well whoever needs to take it
to the next level can so yeah yeah
Sencha Lee okay yeah Microsoft do you
want to add anything on the cafe to do
you like now that looks cody's did you
show the back play that look quite nice
as well yeah I am half back so yeah so
essentially this is going to be one of
the fastest I think the fastest GTX 10
ATT I clocked out of the factory I think
so it's not just looks it's not just the
adding all this gimmick stuff on here
even people who want the fastest 1080i
out the box can get one of these things
and that would just be you know
performing really damn fast out of the
factory so yeah it's looking like it's
1683 boost clock from the factory which
is pretty high I think that horse
extreme is a bit higher I thought I read
seventeen oh look at the bottom edge
again specification 83 thought I had an
overclock mode going into the 700
somewhere so yeah well yeah I mean the
Auris is just a beast and we'll talk a
little bit about that later in the QA
because we got another story here
Microsoft trademarks direct physics so
Peter you know there's a great article
from WCC up that we like is this a new
physics API for DirectX 12 now we know
what Microsoft have been wanting to do
for a while they've been wanting to make
deal that they already proved it by
making dx12 proprietary on Windows 10 so
I guess now they want to make some more
incentives and bring in an exclusive API
or exclusive feature for the director 12
API and that's physics so they actually
purchase havoc I believe off Intel and
havoc so huge and it goes in a lot of
games so having have it's really huge so
they want to guess make a
for our physics API for direct x12 so
and then you know with that they can say
Oh play on direct x12 because you're
going to get a better experience and of
course play on Windows 10 DirectX 12 so
so it's actually a little bit concerning
I mean personally have you do play any
games in DirectX 12 and if so why and
what game no because none of them and my
testing have done better and dx12 and
they have in DirectX 11 so I would just
leave it at DirectX 11 now when that
starts to change which I'm sure it will
then I would trend towards it but uh no
there's no real reason because unlike
with the MD cards with the people that
would play games like doom for example
um you would actually see that benefit
of turning on Vulcan rather than using
the dooms are sort of special snowflake
of a game but losing a special I mean
the thing is though that's what I was
gonna say no DirectX is a bit different
I know I open GL and volcanus I know I
know that I know okay but like this is
the thing with doom it was the only game
that I knew had Vulcan and I played it
on Vulcan as opposed to dear so many
games at dx12 support and I don't play
any of them on dx12
well that's because there is a good
benefit though if you have an AMD card
and you play it on OpenGL and then you
switch to Vulcan you actually do see the
sort of good performance increase
whereas I don't think with the Nvidia
cards you see it as much so I'm not sure
how many people actually do play it with
an Nvidia cards in Vulcan I think most
of them just would play it in OpenGL but
yeah the I'm not 100% sure on that but
that's more my reasoning is that there
you can actually see the benefit whereas
DirectX 12 versus DirectX 11 right now
you sort of it only seems to make things
go backwards for a lot of people so um
they're not really seeing the point yeah
maybe on maybe on lower end systems it's
different because I can only talk about
using a
high-end system so maybe if people on
the lower systems I mean I know I said
about how I thought game mode was
pointless but then some people messaged
me saying hey I have a you know mid tier
system and it's been fantastic for me so
maybe it does actually help the people
out with mid level system yeah I don't I
don't doubt that like Windows 10
creators update us so I'm still going to
update to that soon I'm just getting a
heap of videos done and then I will be
updating so I've heard they've released
some updates to make it more stable now
I've heard that as well it makes a
difference on the lower SPECT systems
and of course yeah
that's where you would want the game
that gains and games yeah so that's what
you'd want the gains because obviously
you know like the higher the higher
spectral system is the less resources an
OS is going to take up anyhow so I guess
it's a double whammy for people on low
spec systems if you've got you know OS
overhead there and it you've got more of
it than it's going to eat into your
performance knowing that you're going to
get things like stuttering just that
it's just really a terrible idea to have
a system that has a huge OS overhead as
opposed to something like creators
update which if it could make a
difference and it is making a difference
from what I hear that it'd be great to
use that feature the game mode so of
course I'm going to get into it do a
whole optimization guide for it so we
get the best performance out of it stay
tuned for that and at the meantime
Microsoft yeah dx12 they go on
proprietary baby they're like look we're
going to implement a physics engine and
you can use it but you got to be on
Windows 10 DF 12 so yeah hopefully they
are of course there is one game sorry
that I do use ds-12 on and that's ashes
a singularity but it's only for a
benchmark doesn't really count how does
anyone actually play that game like
forefathers had asked if there there's
anyone actually everyone I talk to is
just like oh yeah I just use it for a
benchmark what have you actually tried
playing it is it just a really bad game
with something I tried and I just quit
instantly why is it just what's wrong
with it
that's just like a control or something
I was loud and I yeah it's like I can't
get into this a nice this wasn't for me
man yeah just like one of those nights
out on the town where
things happen you're like I can't do
this you can't do Cheryl oh okay all
right so we got up next year we've got a
the latest AMD risin chipset so good
news so basically they've implemented
some updates and we spoke to them at the
moon Steve we spoke to them at the AMD
event no really forthcoming with what
they've got planned for rise and they
say there's a huge update in the works
it's coming that's actually going to
bring performance improvements I believe
it's going to be the system-on-chip
voltage improvement because what I've
found like especially when I did my over
going to tour as well I only had one
1,800 X at the time or 79 anyway when I
did my tutorial I just set this
system-on-chip voltage to level to load
line calibration and I didn't have any
problems though since then I did test
the 1700 and that actually needed to go
to like one point zero four files one
point zero five volt somewhere around
there in order to be stable with the
exact same gear you know so it was like
wow okay system-on-chip voltage makes a
big difference for some CPUs on the rise
and line up so I think what they'll do
in a BIOS update is they'll just up the
automatic system on chip voltage to
maybe one point zero five or something
like that or one point one maybe and
then a lot of people will be able to get
higher memory over clocks and probably
high stability out of three point ninety
four gigahertz over clocks but on my
1800 X it really didn't make a
difference I was like wow okay so I must
have a good system on chip portion that
doesn't need to be over what doesn't
need to be over vaulted so I missed that
out I did add it to the description on
my overclocking tutorial but this is
that's probably that was I didn't even
know we're just but we're going off
topic here but anybody do have updates
in place and they are coming out and
they are going to fine tune
Rison and get the performance right on
the money and I guess this is another
thing here the power plants with the
chipset update the rujuta introduced a
new power plan that is essentially Rison
balanced so you can still get the power
savings like you could in the just the
balance mode except of course you've got
your cause not being parked
with that the latency you know when they
come out of the core parking state
there's less latency or whatever they so
basically they're making it so that it's
just more responsive it's more ready to
go like high performance mode except you
get some of the power savings there and
so they pulled up some benchmarks here
and that's one thing I liked about the
presentation tour in Sydney
AMD now their marketing team I think is
starting to get things right they're not
there they're not hiding anything now
and this is what I love about these
graphs here they're not hiding anything
they just say okay high performance mode
still does give you overall better
performance but we've still got the
power savings in the rise and balanced
plan and when we're at the presentation
they were saying look our CPUs don't
beat Intel at everything but overall
they're very disruptive and they do do
excellent job there yet and they're so
good for the money
that's why I liked their marketing teams
getting it right now there's no need to
sort of you know inflate everything and
bloat everything just put it out there
and say this is the best we could do for
you guys and here it is and people I
mean people already love AMD anyways a
lot of guys that love AMD but I think
their marketing team is really starting
to get better like it's really good when
we went to this event I was really
impressed I was like damn these guys are
really cool and this is another thing
but they're now there they're getting it
right like this Power Balance plan is
really it's just a graph that just says
hey high performance most still a little
bit better still edging it out but of
course you get those save power savings
in the rise and balance mode so really
cool to see that my theory is really
bizarre though that's yeah that's a soy
suit why does that the performance go up
like 0.5% in balancing and everything
else goes down that um yeah I mean on
average it being down point four percent
that's not really that you know that's
pretty good if it's going to have better
arm power savings I mean it is just
Ridge as Brian said reducing the delay
when switching between the power states
but when it parks course so yeah I think
this is pretty good but all of them if
you don't understand the graph all of
them this is compared to the balance the
default balance plan
that you get with Windows which it runs
automatically unless you've gone and
changed it so regardless of if you run
the rise and balance all the high
performance you will see five to five
point four percent gains which is
definitely good so if you're running a
rice and CPU definitely go into your
power plan and set it to either one
flows because you just want to why
wouldn't you you're not going to get any
better power efficiency I don't think if
if Andy's done a good job with this
balance plan it should be very good I
mean the Mavi 3 thing of course is it'll
be a little bit of variance in there of
course not every not every not every
benchmark is going to be a hundred
percent saying yes to apples so there we
go so that's pretty cool I like it like
yeah average versus balanced so you guys
want to get on that if you've got a rise
and chip just whack it in high
performance mode if you've got the chip
set update and whacking in verizon
balance mode so awesome update there and
now onto the coffee lake making its way
into the news coffee lake so this is the
six core it's going to be coming this
year I'm actually pretty I'm getting
pretty hyped about this one because this
will be apparently eight this will be
the new architectural improvement ya
know cannon Lake will be coffee lake is
still the 14 nanometer you know cannon
Lake drops down to the 10 but aren't
they like are they making like a new and
architectural improvement like not not
know me they know shrinking on cannon
whatever 10 millimeter but isn't this
meant to be like the Sandy Bridge to
nalem sort of thing all the as well was
to IV so we're kind of getting a change
up in the architecture um which is
always was getting the same thing just
like so they're just re releasing a CPU
twice because cabbie Lake was just like
skylake it was the exact same thing
except just boosted up the court and the
core clocks yeah I think there will be a
bit of change here I think the main
thing is going to be the
the core difference between them after
iron UI sevens will all be a six-course
by comparison to previously always been
quad cores so that might be how they do
it that all the i5s you'll be able to an
i5 quad core with hyper-threading and
then with the I Simmons you'll be able
to get a six core with hyper-threading
and obviously six core with no hyper
threading so that could be an
interesting situation you see I mean
they sing in the UH the article that it
would be a I five that would be the six
core six thread maybe I'm not sure about
that it's got nine megabytes of level
three cache okay I like saying cash
count man cash cash cash money
level three money so it's got nine
megabytes of that on board interesting
designers I mean the i7 will probably
have 12 12 megabytes because they
usually have so the i5 usually has a
portion of that cache chopped off so
it's like it's still really when you
think that the 1500 X is what 16 yes
well it's kind of like the pimp the
pimps paying these girls a bit more with
the i-5 lineup so he's given a bit more
cash away um as opposed to the i7 you
know it's keeping it all so it sprays
out a good analogy oh I'm not so sure
but they're but this would be cool
though the yeah hopefully I mean and
people have been complaining for years
now but it's now really come to a head
with people saying well Intel's been on
this quad-core bandwagon for since Sandy
Bridge and they need to start making six
cores not not making them because
obviously we had that with the higher
live ones but within that lineup that
sort of core gaming lineup that they
would usually have that the whatever it
is the 8700 K I suppose you would say
will be a six core or hexa core as
opposed to being a quad core like normal
and I think
that in of itself even if we don't have
any major changes otherwise would maybe
pull some people over given you know
depending on the price points is coming
in and the performance but if you think
a six core say like a six core KB lake
with hyper-threading and can overclock
to four point nine gigahertz I mean
imagine the power there I mean yeah if
it had the latest architectural
improvements this is the thing I those
always bugged me about x99 lately it's
always been one step behind the
mainstream chips like and it's annoying
because a lot of people still want to go
for those four cores because they
overclock better they've got better IPC
with a six core hitting the mainstream
that would be really hard hitting if you
get architectural improvements I think
that's the main point for Intel to hit
here is coffee late going to have a
legitimate IPC improvement if there is
no IPC improvement then I think this
thing is going to be left in the dust no
one's going to care about it so it's
really I think they have to get that IPC
improvement if they do hit that with a
six core on the mainstream I think
they'll have a really nice chip on their
hands of course how much are they going
to charge for it I'd guess about $400 I
mean yep it hopefully would be yeah I
mean the fact yeah I think the selling
point is they really need that IPC
improvement if they want to compete with
AMD's chips
I mean 1700 K is still kind of
competitive in that it's you know still
the gaming chip to get or whatever but
if they want to actually be competitive
on sort of everything have a chip yeah
cuz Verizon is currently doing that
gaming productivity hybrid so well I
think if until want to do it so well
they've got to hit this chip right the
8th gen chip and in order to do that
they need those IPC gains to really set
them apart of course yeah
they're going to have their chipset
naming in the 370 as well that's going
to be so confusing I mean ah he says you
know sure as e 370 tip said it's like
there's an X 370 I could only imagine it
okay imagine the guy going to the store
and he's like bought an AMD CPU and he's
like oh there's an
x3 70 boarding a Z 370 I'm gonna get the
Z 370 gets at home he's like what the
 pin on pin contact what is this you
know yeah but even worse will be the
higher platform if you think the next
Intel for the big boy chips will be X
299 right but then AMD's already
announced that they'll be bring out
these crazy risin 16 cores and stuff and
that will be on the X 399 platform for
them so what happens to Intel after that
are they going to copy it so then we'd
have to lots of X 399 so nd X 399 and
Intel X 3 99 how confusing would that be
unless they're just going to skip over
it but then you see like the the other
thing to note is the socket if they're
saying it's going to be LGA 1151 again
yeah that's like okay and the other
thing I would really like to see is the
thermal interface material on upgraded
that if they don't do that again people
are just going to explode um of the 8000
series is just high temps again ah be
interesting I mean Dex I'm getting sick
a deal eating chips I mean it's annoying
because a lot of people don't want to
deal with chips especially if they're
enthusiastic lockers because they want
that solder there that I mean even the
new guys that come in with their
all-in-one coolers want to be able to
get relatively the max overclock they
can and avulsion I unfortunately on
cabbie Lake you generally have to deal
it and in my case I think I got like an
extra 200 megahertz stable and that's
huge like that is actually pretty big
for deleting a chip not only that for
longevity you want to at Kubik chip cool
so hopefully they hopefully they don't
put paste on there again I mean
hopefully they've learned their lesson
by now but hey I guess sometimes I don't
care but I mean their desktop like
speaking of that we've got the financial
results up here we had the financial
results of here okay they're kind of up
again
okay so their revenue has dropped on the
desktop market like the revenues up like
we go down to the figures here their
revenues actually up 8% but it's due to
like the memory division and a lot of
other divisions within tenth Intel
they're actually there's only q1 as well
I would expect to that Q there to be
more of a discrepancy between q1 and q2
results it's not just that we're talking
about comparing q1 versus q1 2016 so
they're comparing apples to apples
really and in the same time last year in
there they're down 7% on the desktop
sales and volumes so that's pretty crazy
so desktops of drop for Intel and it's
no surprise yeah that they're making all
their money not all of it that's sort of
ridiculous but they're making a lot of
their money with the server CPUs um
people don't really understand that that
that's where a lot of thin revenue comes
from is them having such a good grip on
the server CPU market and all the Zeon's
and stuff so that's something that I
think a lot of people just
overestimating this way Naples will be
so important for AMD if they can start
catching that market um from Intel
Intel's really going to feel the bite
then they will there they are going to
feel it with rising with the desktops
but those services are where they'll be
really worried and that's where AMD
needs to focus now if they can if Naples
is really good
then Intel will feel the bite a lot more
there I would imagine yeah I mean so
army I just had to turn Skype on dandy
Steve was messaging me I'm like dude I'm
live-streaming here I just think yeah
everything's okay now
sorry okay so uh yeah Intel so I missed
a flight as I was turning my Skype on
dandy but um yeah until obviously have
to get back in the game I think like
into I mean not get back in the game
obviously they are in the game big time
they're the big boy but
they I think in terms of being
competitive they have to get back into
it and it's that like AMD's sort of like
dealt their hand in poker and it's like
you know you'll turn to either get a
better hand or fold so we'll see how
that goes
yeah on some other news here we've got
the GT 10:30 being announced from a
video a little card little card with a
little bit of balls on it so it's a
little card got some a little bit of
power in there 80 USD retail so a bit
launch price but you probably see this
thing go down to 70 I mean maybe even
possibly $60 that would be incredible
for just a little card that people I
guess playing csgo League of Legends you
know all those little games and they
want new parts they want new parts and
they just want to play these real easy
to play titles or even something for I
guess you know maybe 4k movies or just
something really little I guess this
card would fit that purpose of course if
you are dropping it in a gaming PC of
course you always should be going for
those mid-range cards if you can afford
them for double the money you get like
an RX 570 now or a gtx 1060 that would
be the cards that definitely hit up if
you can but if you can't knows you want
to do is you like a although like doing
is playing csgo or like doing is playing
these easy to play games and they're
very popular they're very popular then
why not like I don't really see a
problem with this graphics card you know
I'm sure when it's released you may see
channels saying completely useless card
don't buy it completely useless and then
I'm sure it won't be a popular car but I
could see it
hitting a price point for some people
who just don't need the extra power I
guess yeah I mean the ah so you just
checked it fine
the I date Asia at this straight ah I I
don't even know what because I bought it
I bought a flight to Taiwan I'm guessing
it's surely that guy I'm not like look a
schmuck after my ex-wife often buy ad
after my ex-wife guys I'm done like
dating Asian women I'm sorry
I guess it's this website or God let's
zoom that in a bit and get rid of that
that's that's pretty sad eh what the
hell video cards calm no it's not me
like it's not me because there's two of
these ads coming up these guys like
pushing this stuff on the other side
before like you're they don't have the
cookie I've I've never been on I'd a day
I don't know about this website dude
snow hey your your day your your
girlfriend's Asian yeah yeah hey so you
sent me the link so you sent me the link
with the cookies embedded I'm blaming
you for this one usually looking for you
looking for a new one on the side bro no
that's what I Steve for Jesus yeah yeah
the the difference between these two is
quite interesting 550 and 1030 so it's
actually going to be at the 10:30 this
thing is actually only going to have a
30 watt TDP which is kind of crazy
versus the 50 watt I mean this is just
an in response to the 550 they're pretty
much the same otherwise well similar arm
in terms of their specs in terms of team
team use and ROPS interesting thing to
note though they'll be coming in both a
2 and 4 gig model which is quite
interesting that these little very
entry-level go discards will have four
gigabyte models even more interesting is
the memory bus the 1030 will only have a
64-bit memory bus compared to the 128
you get on the 550 hmm I don't know why
you would want to get a 4 gigabyte model
of these little guards to me anyways I
feel oh yeah
instead you would just go with the 2 gig
these are just supposed to be get you in
the door get you off integrated um and
for that I'm sure they'll do quite well
but play again I missed ya play your
games on your cheap monitor if you've
got a cheap 1080p model you can pick
them up very cheap for like a hundred
bucks I mean one of these cards would go
well with that especially with the G
4560 men like wow you know what I mean
like the value there you pick up
something really cheap like maybe even
do something like that on the channel
just a brand new csgo potato you know I
mean like because I'm sure there'd be a
lot of people out there that just
to build a really cheap PC for playing
csgo because it's a hugely popular like
an incredibly popular game I think a lot
of people don't realize like especially
people like I don't play csgo
religiously but everyone I know plays
csgo like literally everyone I know is
like csgo man csgo Sears goes all I hear
about so it's a very popular title and I
think something like this would be
perfect for it
it runs on potatoes so and you want
potato with warranty then you could make
something for maybe $300 even so yeah
yeah I mean it would be very solid yes I
definitely I mean when we talk about
value for money it's as Brian was
talking about earlier which is a very
good point is the fact that you can go
as you go up there you end up you are
spending more money but you're the extra
performance you're getting makes it
worth it up till about you reach that
mid level and then it starts becoming
more diminishing returns after that so
once you get to the rx5 7580 level on
AMD and obviously the gtx 1060 level on
nvidia those are the very good ones and
that's where you basically get the
optimum performance per dollar so your
money will go the farthest in terms of
the amount of performance you get
obviously 10 70s 10 80s 1080p eyes get
more performance but the value for how
much extra you have to spend goes down
so that's why we always say if you can
when you're doing it if you're doing a
value for money rig try get one of those
GPUs because they will take you the
furthest especially if you're doing
1080p gaming something like the rx 570
which I've just finished testing just a
superb graphics card absolutely superb
so ya know that's I had another article
on coffee late we'll close that down I
guess no one wants to talk about until
credit so the Triton 700 the gaming
laptop I checked this out have you
checked this out yeah I watched the
video man it looks like it looks good
apparently they're dropping a
either a new skew of the tan ad in there
or they're dropping a 1080 TI in there
and that actually looks like it looks
solid like it looks sleek it looks like
it's not going to be as big as the
really big laptops and I mean this is
what I guess a gaming laptop should more
or less be hopefully it's not really
heavy but yeah I really looking this
thing looks really good and there's like
a hands-on video as well so it's yeah
it's sort of like laptop size and it's
just got incredible amounts of power I
think this one looks like it'll be a hit
if people want to get into that gaming
laptop market I don't see the point of
putting two GPUs in a grap in a laptop I
mean to like you know I recently
reviewed the MSI and like it was the to
power bricks to GPUs and it was just too
heavy yeah they're just not really mean
I think you're just supposed to put them
on your desk or something then just
leave them there um they're not really
meant to be taken around all the time
but yeah that mean weight-wise hopefully
comes in at something standard for a
gaming laptop like they all seem to have
around 3 kgs I think is a good good
amount yeah if it's more portable I
guess the one who raised yeah yeah
no it looks solid though does did
doesn't look too bulky either like some
of those big ones the people have been
testing lately well you're the laptop
guru man yeah give us some more insight
on this it's probably gone ah yeah I
mean SL is it the did the funny thing is
when I started doing my channel I never
actually liked laptops at all and then I
started doing laptop reviews and then
all these people like bro you're one of
the best laptop reviewers on YouTube and
I was like how on earth is that possible
I've never really done this before and I
just kept doing them ever since but I I
mean I do enjoy doing them they're very
they're probably one of the most time
consuming videos I do but yeah they're
they're pretty fun beer that that what I
usually look for in a good gaming laptop
obviously wait is one thing if you're
having to carry this thing around work
or uni and stuff you know you don't want
it to be breaking your back or your arm
if you're carrying in a suitcase
it looks quite thin that's quite good as
well to see not too thick I usually like
to think
it is the like a triangle and you get to
pick two so you get either like it'll be
noisy or it'll get good temps or it'll
be like sighs so you get to pick two so
if you want ah if you want good temps
and it to be thin it's going to be
really noisy and if you want it to be
very quiet and but very thin then it'll
run really hot and so this there's
always a compromise there but the
compromises are getting less and less
now that all the CPUs and GPUs in them
getting more and more power-efficient
TDP zhanna's crazy and stuff so yeah
that's always a good thing to see the
the screens on laptops have been getting
better as well because some of the
gaming laptops I tested like maybe 18
months ago to two years ago a lot of
them had a very bad frame times there's
a lot of what's it called on the screen
I've got blank the term you know Brian
when you're playing game and it's like
you could still see the last tiny bit of
the last frame it displayed ghosting is
it are you joking yeah dosing yeah yeah
ghosting yeah that was an issue with a
lot of the gaming laptops I tested last
year yeah I saw on some of them that
there was ghosting issue so that was
something I didn't really like to see
demonsaw one was really good like that
didn't have it like hardly like I didn't
notice any godus ghosting on that laptop
they released with 120 Hertz screens so
that was really good oh you wouldn't on
that surely know when God there there
would be a shocker this - yeah sure yeah
yes some of the more did the standard
not not those super high in ones I mean
the lower mid-range $2,000 New Zealand
price point where you're just getting a
1080p 60 Hertz TN panel and that that
could be an issue not an Alanis plinian
them that were pretty good but yeah
that's that's what I see also but yeah
we don't have much information on that
one so have to see and I'll probably
check it out when it comes up all right
so we're going to move over to Q&amp;amp;A now
join the forum's if you guys haven't you
get Tech City TV slash forums sign up
and I'll be making a new thread for next
week's episode 25 next week so I'll have
the thread up
you guys can ask questions anytime you
want we've got here the first question
from the night sirak he said what is it
worth buying a hybrid kit from EVGA and
strapping it to a 1080 Ti he's planning
on buying the founders vision 1080i from
EVGA and of course it is cheaper it's
like 700 year 700 pound versus the Auris
extreme for example which is 800 pound
you know in America I'd say go for the
Auris extreme writes only an extra 50
USD even in Australia - 180 but 100
pounds is a lot of extra headway well
it's a lot of overlay for that am that
the extra power target essentially so I
guess what the what he wants to ask is
is it worth it and it's really only
worth it on the founders if you're going
to do the shunt mod and that's
essentially where you are tricking the
GPU into thinking it's getting a low
power draw and it essentially gives it
more power Headroom of course if you
yeah if you'd really I just say go with
your extreme if that's the case it's got
a 150 percent power target out of the
box so you would want to maybe just go
with that because you know shut mods do
carry risk it's not all risk free right
so yeah so I'll be my recommendation
there of course you just go with the
founders Edition and just be happy with
the 120% power target as well I mean 700
pounds just call it a day and then wait
for them I mean because the founders
edition cooler is really not that bad
either so I'm just a big fan of the
Auris extreme out of the box it is a
beast of a card oh that was excellent
when I tested I like to do it by an
asset go scout gigabytes still haven't
gotten back to me I've asked them twice
now like look and you find out if the
non-extreme has the 150 percent power
target Boston two times now they haven't
gone back to me it's like I might even
just call them up today and be like look
he's got people asking me doesn't have
that power target - because if it
doesn't then of course that Oris
extremes price is even more justified
then yeah because then people I I don't
think you to the best of my knowledge
from when I was investigating the
difference
is between the two models of orsten ATT
is I don't think there's any changes in
terms of any of that sort of stuff I
mean components in that so hmm I would
assume it wouldn't they would both have
it but that's only an assumption but I
would be very surprised if it if it was
only 120 percent okay um yeah so that's
one of my Ross I'm waiting on you to get
back to me dude I said what do you think
about the 1080 SLI instead of a single
1089 rather got a single 1080 and just
save you money that would be my
recommendation
so yeah just went yeah with an
all-in-one slapping a cooler on it it's
it's fun it's cool you can get slightly
higher over clocks but on the 1080i the
biggest limit is that power target so
you can either get a Norris extreme with
150% or you can shunt my jacquard so
it's up to you personally I just got the
Auris extreme that's just been my choice
so yeah next question we got here was do
you think Rison 3 will bring out another
I do you think you will bring out
another cookie cutter build with rising
3 because parts in South Africa are
extremely expensive and I want to get
the best value for money definitely yeah
we'll be bringing out some really cool
budget builds hitting the channel
I don't know when because you know so
many videos to do so little time there's
going to be a bit of a while I think Joe
Rosen 3 comes out anyway but I think a
lot of people would be doing rice and
three budget builds around the Rison 3
1,100 CPU which looks like it's going to
be just crazy crazy value for a fork or
for thread a little CPU so yeah but
there's still well away from what I know
they're not going to be up for a bit so
yeah my guys I left awake yeah so yeah
there will be though that would be built
hitting the channel for sure yeah
ok he's only running 8 gigabytes so
Jonny RC was confused yep sorry I was
confused too we're all confused episode
23 questions it wasn't there yeah so
he's only running 8 gigabytes right now
would you guys recommend buying another
80 by 24 hundred megahertz
and overclocking it to 2666 or just
buying an 8 gigabyte 2666 memory condone
overclock it assuming I want to keep the
original Ram and had another yeah I just
go four by four that would be my
recommendation you've already got two
for two by four sticks there just run it
four by four and I'm 2666 should be
obtainable I don't imagine you wouldn't
be able to get that overclock so yeah
yeah I just yell fear with that I just
get four by four so any chance of doing
a segment where you sort of critique
build sent in civically for that segment
yeah I mean hot used setups I did it I
did announce that was coming I mean I
just started doing the house call series
and I'm looking to do more series hot
yourself so it's definitely on the on
the cards I'm looking to do something
like that I mean a lot I know the
viewers love it I'm looking to sort of
make some very brave breathe some new
life into the channel I think just
starts a new series you know like I just
yeah that that's definitely on the cards
so what about you keV you looking to do
some new series breathe some new life
into the channel um well the channel
sort of found its own life lately
anyways it's been going crazy the the
growth has been phenomenal so I'm just
going to keep doing what I'm doing
that's good I got so much tech to get
through anyway so I got so much stuff
and there we going to be busy for the
next few months guys we got so much CPUs
and everything out and GPU is probably
to get through there for sure man so
there's lots of work on the plate we
don't have the next question is there
any way to raise the voltage limit past
the standard one 20% to the power to
power limit that programs like precision
and afterburner cap you out with a 1080i
without modding the hardware of the card
itself at the moment I mean not that
really so there there's the shunt mod
that's the the shunt mods for
pacifically to get past that limit of
course the only other way I noticed the
by Norris extreme which that's why I
said in my review when I was over
clocking both cards that
Oris was going to like a hundred and
forty percent like in games so it was
utilizing that extra power target that's
that's why it was beneficial that's why
I like the or
extreme over the other tenets as over
the founders edition it's just simply
like it can overclock higher and then
utilize that extra power draw other than
that I mean you might be able to get
accustomed by I didn't even know because
you'd have to get accustomed boss made
up from for that Pacific card and then
there's the chances that it won't even
work lately cost I find lately custom
biases are really been finicky a and
they really haven't been working
properly so and yeah
can you do a video comparing the qh8 G
with that with the asrock mobo versus
the risin r5 1500 X again he wants a
very Pacific in Paris in here gaming
video having pros and cons of each other
and say between the two for a build one
thing I'm still testing the 1700 then
I'm going to move on to the 1600
honestly I like these are five 1600 I
think it's a much better buy than the
1500 X I mean I know Steve was like
saying the 1500 I love the 1600 I just
pay that extra a little bit of money and
get that 1600 you got two more calls for
more threads really for me it's like
that that would be worth that so it
depends I guess on the user though like
for you and someone like me of course we
would want that six core for the render
at times and everything else but if if
you're just a pure gamer I don't think
that there isn't much difference so you
would be better off with that I think
that's what maybe Steve was trying to
say is that in gaming the difference is
so negligible that you may as well just
save your money but if you're a a doing
productivity stuff as well then yeah you
will notice that that difference there
yeah so I kind of got here lots of stuff
going on soon lot of stuff gone down
soon we better get to the end of this
one so yeah I mean I'll look into it and
like people requests and bids guys I got
so much on my plate I'll try and do what
I can
can't guarantee anything of course we've
got the patron like I will like that's
the thing we've got the patron set up
like you know I do have a goal there if
you know I do get a certain amount of
money we're bringing someone on to edit
videos and help you know what I mean so
it's something that yeah they let okay
here for for I don't really know what's
going on never yeah we've got the patron
account put the link in description
below if you guys want to see more
content it's you know I'm as a one-man
band I'm very limited in how much
content I can produce so yeah of course
I'm going to be I really want to get
someone else on to help out edit videos
and stuff and so with that would would
come all these in all these more
comparisons everything just the yes-man
will be back on camera more so yeah a so
he from demo gamma gaming he shares our
concerns
he's waiting so long for failure to
produce the GPU yeah I mean these these
are just legit concerns right AMD is
taking so long to produce Vega and again
that's limitations of their company
right they don't have a lot of R&amp;amp;D and
we spoke about this in the past
AMD are limited in what they can do in
the amount of money they have so what
you're seeing here is a limitation and
it's it's starting to show with Vega
being released so late in the cycle and
will it even be competitive in video
grabbing the ball and running with it so
it's crazy yeah yeah it's it's not so
III mean this there's going to be stuff
behind the scenes that we don't know
yeah there's more reasoning to this then
it's not as simplistic as a lot of
people think it is there will be big
things going on behind the scenes which
we do not know which is causing that
delay yeah
we've got last question here Brian
totally off topic no nothing's really
totally off topic mean but is Aki Harbor
a good place for rich or a game hunting
I'm going to Tokyo this autumn any
recommendations for the shops I should
go to have either you've been scammed on
eBay or other sites what's the worst
experience you've had okay so the first
question Archy Harbor is amazing like
there's retro game hunting there there's
everything there I mean there's that
super potato I'm pretty sure every retro
hunter knows about super potato but
there's a lot of other stores
I'd recommend even renting a car and
going outside of the city and just
getting a navigation system and typing
in hard off all the other ones you know
hot off outside the city's so good for
retro hunting there's so many cheap
games my brother used to do it all the
time when he came over and
just be tagging along and looking at all
the PC parts and so yeah retro hunting's
hugeinjapan like you can get really good
deals it is a lot of fun I just say in
Tokyo though the prices of course they
know what that stuff is worth in Tokyo
so you're generally going to be paying
market value for it as opposed to being
scanned on eBay and other sites you have
been hosed before I've been hosed on all
sorts of auction sites Aliexpress I'm
yet to be hosed on Ali you know I've
heard people getting hosed on Ali but
I'm yet to be hosed and I bought quite a
few things off their eBay I've been
hosed yeah with some artwork voice
recorder thingy jizz ago when I was
learning Japanese I got like just like
2005 I got hosed on this little voice
recorder thing that sort of translated
Japanese or whatever I was just that it
was just miss advertised and I got hosed
I've been hosed on a motherboard have
been hosed on a CPU I got recently I got
hosed on gumtree for a graphics card
completely hosed men go I met me at a
arm at a gas station and yeah just said
oh yeah the card works and everything
brought it back home and once you the
drivers loaded up the card bricked
itself so something really wrong with
that cards that was the r9 280 so yeah
I've been hosed quite a bit how about
you keV no I haven't I mean I don't buy
much you stick but I went I have I've
always had good experiences even when I
bought things that were people honest
about but they were maybe like when I
bought the r9 290 that was used for a
Bitcoin mining and and there was a
reference to 90 as well and their thing
was fine even though it had a hard life
but oh yeah Akihabara when I was there
it's so cool man like it's just that's
just such a cool place to be even though
I wasn't really going there to buy retro
games of by PC hardware I was going
there to be a tourist it's so cool it's
just such a fun bustling busy place than
there's so much to do so many stores to
go into yeah I really really enjoyed it
do you like being there is that you
enjoy the sort of atmosphere October is
always
on the go too I would want to live there
no way way to heck no no you win one
it's so busy yeah that's crazy so yeah
man anyway I got to pull I got to pull
the pin short on the live guys sorry
about that I will have to get going so I
will talk to you guys and thanks for
care for coming on link to his channel B
in the description below so we'll catch
you guys next week for episode 25 of the
tech lounge and hope yours had fun
any closing words give you guys just uh
thanks for tuning in and catch us next
week alright see you guys next time
peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
