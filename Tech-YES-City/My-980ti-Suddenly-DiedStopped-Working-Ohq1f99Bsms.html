how-to on installing a budget water
cooler on your 980ti gravis card however
upon getting back to Japan and
installing the cooler and putting it in
the system it just gave me no signal so
this is going to be today's video on the
story or the death of the 980ti
so today's video was supposed to be a
much more upbeat video where I was
installing the NZXT Jeep and the corsair
h 55 water cooler on this gravis card
and showing you guys the much lower
temps and the higher overclocks which I
had already previously tested in America
so I already had this unit fully
functional in America and was working so
well however I decided for transit when
I was coming back here to put the air
cooler back on and then because make it
more safer and then when I got back here
I'd do it again for you guys and make a
vlog and I just finished doing
everything and then it bricks itself and
so I've tested this on the computer
downstairs here I've tested it upstairs
on all different display ports and it's
just giving me a black signal and then
upon closely looking at the PCB I cannot
see any damage whatsoever so I'll pull
up some slides there of this PCB and you
can just see there's no damage there's
no smells coming from it either which is
kind of weird I mean if it was damaged
from overclocking which by the way I
haven't changed the BIOS I didn't intend
to but I hadn't changed it yet so
there's no damage there from
overclocking because I didn't push it
that far at all so I'm kind of perplexed
as to what it could be but I believe it
was damaged in shipping but on that note
that is still under warranty so I'm
gonna try and send it back and hopefully
get it fixed for free because it still
has another like six months warranty
left on it which is a really good thing
so I'm gonna be doing that very soon but
in the meantime I've got my GTX 970 at
4k which is pretty bad and I've got the
msi on line 390 which is surprisingly
those two cards didn't suffer any damage
at all just unfortunately it's my 980ti
which sucks however on a more positive
note this kit here was actually going
really well I mean installation was
pretty straightforward it was a nice
little unit especially when it was in
action and it was working I mean temps
especially in like a 25 degree ambient
room we're not even going over like 50
degrees or barely going over that and
the scores in 3d fire strike were
incredible I was getting like 20,000 and
60 that was the highest score that I
clocked in there off this kit as opposed
to the air cooler when I reviewed this
unit which only scored 19300 and that
was really noisy and the
temps were much higher so I mean this
little kit here for $90 is definitely a
good buy the reason I got it was because
I already had this for free my friend
gave it to me and I got the H 55 for $60
and I mean it did work really well I
should have maybe have just maybe put it
in super layers of bubble wrap and it
might have survived shipping better so
guys if something is to come out of this
video I guess it is just that be careful
what airline you're flying with no no I
mean on a serious note you should be
just very careful with your parts
especially I mean I should have really
padded it a lot more than I did I guess
I took that for granted and yeah I guess
another thing is true that these water
cooling units for the grabbes cards are
actually really good that was a positive
note of this video I really did enjoy
both they're working with the G 10 and
the H 55 I was surprised at how much
better water cooling is for a high-end
graphics card then air cooling so I mean
for a CPU I found it hasn't doesn't make
much of a difference but I will be
making a video on air cooling versus
water cooling in the future I'm just
want to get some more numbers hopefully
if my 980ti can get fixed and come back
then I will do that for you guys but I
mean if it doesn't need it because I've
already taken the cooler off I don't
know if that voids the warranty I'll
have to check my warranty card or I'll
have to contact the store so I don't
know what goes on from here but I will
keep you guys updated via Twitter and
that's about it really I mean if you
guys have any questions or comments and
be sure to cut drop a comment the
comment section below and I mean there's
probably some people out there wondering
why I'm not too devastated and I was for
like an hour but I mean the thing is
you've just got to learn your lessons
and move on because there's always gonna
be times in life and this is a
time but it's like okay learn my lesson
just gonna be extra careful and pack my
stuff a lot more than I already am in
the future so it doesn't happen again
and I guess this applies to every walk
of life not just tech so hey guys hope
you enjoyed the video I'll catch you at
another one very soon peace out for now
bye I'm still gonna be very rough with
my low end pop now worried about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
