for pax 2018 in Australia Melbourne and
this has been such an exciting event
from start to finish of course I've been
going around covering all the different
booths checking out all the different
technologies and in this video I'm going
to share with you guys what I thought
was the best at least experiences in
terms of coming here and what to try
baby for next year you can get a ideal
angst as well - Intel and course after
sponsoring out this trip but let's take
a look
first things first we have to talk about
HP omen and their booth they had on
display it was so good it's not funny
they had literally everything I just
enjoyed the most at this booth but start
as they had the Red Bull cars where he
could play Forza horizon for it was so
exciting and then they had the wingsuit
which of course wing suits are banned in
a lot of countries and you can
experience it with VR and it was just so
exciting and they had different sorts of
VR experiences on display and then at
the back they had some real innovative
products we saw a headset with cold
plates inside using the thermoelectric
plates that take the heat out so it
keeps your ears cold and it was such a
cool concept that I believe will work in
the real world especially in hotter
climates like Australia so the headset
was really cool but besides that there
was a keyboard and mouse that uses
optical mechanical switches so I guess
it's the next step up for getting the
fastest response times possible because
it uses a laser instead of an actual
mechanical switch now to actuate the
keys and this is also being introduced
on the mouse itself so it's in the
keyboard in the mouse and to top that
off they also had competitions and
streaming booths at this as well as a
massive truck from Intel and HP this
booth definitely scored number one in
terms of not only function but also
experience so now moving on to the rest
of the event there was so many different
PCs consoles VR experiences a lot of it
was free-to-play they even had a 100
play a battle royale within the own
vicinity of the booth and packs itself
so you're only playing against other
people at the event which was really
cool concept even though the game was
for tonight I believe they were trying
some other games at least when I jumped
in and gave it a try and they had
console free play they had a lot of
people playing card games
they even had chess so there was just so
many different things from start to
finish to try out if you weren't into
something specifically you could
definitely go over and two minutes later
you were trying something else so
they've really got it well organized
I mean Saturday and Sunday were very
busy and there were some big queues but
with the sheer amount of consoles and
PCs to play on at all different
boos it just really made a good
experience anyone could just go to a
booth for instance the azuz booth they
had the triple ultra wide surround I
really enjoyed this and I didn't have to
wait long at all to jump on and have a
go with call of duty black ops 4 now
moving through the whole event itself I
do have to give props to the
coolermaster hermit pod this was so cool
knowing the fact that it was just really
comfortable it was actually a good
concept I do see this taking off
especially with people who live inside
apartments and they want something that
they can chill on watch movies but also
play games and relax while they're
playing games and I funny thing is about
the hermit pod was my aim with the mouse
was actually really good it didn't deter
me it wasn't uncomfortable as opposed to
sitting down in front of a desk it was
really well done and it even had a cup
holder so you can put a coffee or tea in
my case would be a cup of tea and just
really enjoy your games but then we move
on to the custom builds and this is
where the hermit pods were attached to
the sea tea and the tea and then going
through the whole event there was just
so many different costs and builds
already plugged Athens bills as well
they were really innovative next level
and I was just enjoying seeing so many
varieties of hardware and different
loops different concepts even reflective
builds like we saw with the faze clan
build and also the how builds on csgo
we're in the dark they just look so nice
and they were packed with the latest
graphics cards RTX 28 ET is and also the
I $9.99 hundred K and the anniversary
edition i7 808 6k which if you haven't
already I'll put the link in the
description below for a video where you
can get in with a chance to win an 808
6k so be quick and good luck with the
chance on that now speaking of giveaways
every booth you went to though either
giving away some merch like hoodies or
shirts or even frisbees in the case of
Alienware and I'm actually wearing the
Alienware neon jacket where a lights up
and it's just really cool you can change
it to three different modes I think
mine's run out of battery now actually
but moving through there if you couldn't
get some merch given away they had
discounts on everything - so like you
could go get a shirt really nice shirt
for four dollars for instance or you
could go get a hoodie for really cheap
and then there were so many giveaways on
products
on enthusiast tech or even deals like we
saw with a Zeus with their monitors so
you could really get and extract your
value out of purchasing the ticket for
pax Australia itself and then lastly of
course we had unreleased games for
instance in the case of Nvidia they had
Metro Exodus on display now I'm really
looking forward to this title I really
enjoyed Metro last light it was such a
fun game such a good experience I jumped
into it it's a really fun game it's
going to be awesome but at the same time
the r-tx
does look pretty good but it comes in my
opinion at a significant cost now I know
this games not released yet
but this game was running 1080p full HD
on a r-tx 28 et I believe and it was
still sort of stuttering here and there
it was like a little bit choppy and it
just wasn't like I had really smooth
experience I'm like thinking 20 atti
1080p I even with Archie exon I believe
we should be getting a really good
experience out of this Hardware
combination but besides the game itself
it did have those extra features they do
look pretty good of course I'm waiting
for the finished products before I make
my final judgement but from what I'm
seeing so far like when look at a game
like Crysis 3 for example that looks
beautiful and it plays really nicely
just need high-end hardware again so
whether it's RT X on or off I'm sure
you're really gonna enjoy a good-looking
game regardless and finally to wrap up
everything with this event itself it was
just so well organized I had absolutely
no hiccups except of course when I
started streaming black ops 4 blackout
mode and we told had got into streaming
and it was like a 15 FPS stream and it
was really funny because I didn't see
this sort of being a problem on day 3
but of course was streaming in the past
when I've tried streaming on my channel
I've had problems as well but when it
came to the event and just meeting up
with all you guys out there who were
here and I came up to us and said hi
thank you so much
we did take some pictures together was
really cool all the competitions as well
and also big thanks to Intel and Corsair
for sponsoring out this event as well as
providing the giveaways there was a NOx
being given away every day
there's also demonstrations of all the
new hardware you can play on it at
various different booths and then of
course you had the cheaper hardware
itself so they had discounted Knox
going for sale as well so the whole
event just came together to just be epic
and I really come out of this enjoying
it I look forward to coming next year if
pax would be so graceful to have us
again and if you guys enjoyed this video
