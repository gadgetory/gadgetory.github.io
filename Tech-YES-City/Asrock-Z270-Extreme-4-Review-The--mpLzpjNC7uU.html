motherboard to review this is the
extreme for which got my CPU to 5
gigahertz so maybe it should be called
the extreme 5 welcome back to Texas City
this is brian coming to you guys today
with a review of as rocks latest and
greatest motherboard lineup on the LGA
1151 series and this time we have the
extreme 4 which has always been that
sweet spot level in terms of value for
money and features and this time around
as rock have added in three areas that
have RGB LED learning that can be
controlled either via the UEFI bios or
windows itself and as many cool effects
and colors to choose from
there is also an RGB 4 pin out to
connect to other modules which can then
be controlled from the motherboard
itself by moving away from cosmedix the
board features a 12 phase VRM which
shows Nikko's pz0 9:03 BK on the high
side and Nikko's PK 6 1/8 ba on the low
side the chokes are as rocks traditional
20 amp chokes and also the board
features 12 K solid caps all round there
are four memory lanes with dual channel
support and overclocking up to 3777
megahertz around the board there are
five different four pin fan connectors
two of which support double the wattage
for water pumps moving down the board
there is two vertically mounted USB 3
headers eight side of three connections
six of which have raid support and two
of which are controlled by a separate as
media controller in between that there
are two MDOT two slots supporting either
side of three or PCIe for speed
connectivity which can also be set up in
a boot and raid configuration continuing
on there is a dual BIOS and when going
into the bias there is two modes
advanced and simple where in advanced
mode you will have all the options you
want for serious overclocking with
options for saving up to six
overclocking profiles updating the BIOS
hassle-free via pre rated internet
connection and also the fantastic tuning
software for tuning your PWM fans at the
speeds and temps you want continue on
with connectivity there is a TPM and
thunderbolt add-in card connectors six
front port USB connections from three
headers comport clear CMOS and front
panel audio connectors to moving up the
board there are six PCIe ports three of
which are one-speed ports and three of
which are 16 speed four
with the board supporting SLI and
crossfire and also having steel armor on
two of the top two slots with extra
added on strength because you never know
when you just might use your graphics
card that is connected to a motherboard
as it frisbee looking at the rear input
and output we have dual be NAC Wireless
support which is built into the
motherboard a VGA HDMI and DVI outs one
ps2 4 USB 3 one USB 3.1 AM 1 USB 3.1 C
inputs which when quickly doing a
transfer test provided solar speeds
maxing out the kingston device with room
to breathe
below that is a juicing intel i to one
9v onboard neck and lastly there is the
realtek 1120 codec powered audio which
supports 7.1 out by optical 5.1 via
analog and has ATI any five five three
two headphone amplifier built in
crosstalk levels were phenomenal and
we're honestly at some of the best
levels I've seen to date also when
testing the audio the volume did go
pretty loud and will do a good job for a
lot of different headphones all the way
up to 600 ohms impedance though very
hard to drive headphones may still want
to get a dedicated headphone amp the mic
import was solid as always and with that
said here is a quick test here's what
the audio will sound like with the mic
in port on the azrog z2 70 extreme fall
with the v-moda boom Pro connected
directly into that mic import with a
volume level of 60 and a 10 DB boost
there so the extreme fall really takes
things up another knotch
decent vrm 8 laid PCB which in this case
enabled my 7600 k2 bench at 5 gigahertz
in height 30 degree ambience and reach
90 degrees max temps at one point three
ninety five volt I did also manage to
boot up at five point one gigahertz at
one point 42 volt though the screen did
start having some sort of weird
flickering issue going on and putting
any more voltage into this thing really
isn't something you should do on a lone
CPU either and this is all with the die
still being glued to the IHS so after
Abdi lid you could expect some solid
twenty-four-seven numbers on this board
with the right CPU factors though this
board is decent for overclocking and the
temps on the vrm remained cool under 40
degrees even while stress testing at 5
gigahertz so now it's conclusion time
and I would have liked to have seen a
clear CMOS button and an extra 2 USB 3
port connections added at the back but
besides that everything else on this
board
they hit the spot support for as
rockhard overclocks on aaron all-in-ones
consistent on board NAC and integrated
dual band wireless RGB LEDs and
controller also implemented for the hash
tag RGB the world movement and a really
damn solid onboard audio solution plus a
dual BIOS to boot the cosmedix also look
really clean and coming in at 165 USD
MSRP or 250 AUD if you're in Australia
it is a board that is sure to please and
one that I can recommend for people who
want that board for long gaming sessions
or someone who just wants a solid board
all around in general though if you are
an extreme overclocker then you may wish
to go with a higher grade board as the
chokes and MOSFETs would limit this
board for hardcore overclocking anyway
guys that's about it for me today if you
latest video and be sure to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comment section below what do you think
of as Roxy 270 extreme for would love to
hear your thoughts and opinions as
always for me personally I think it
would be my favorite pick from their
lineup as it really hits the sweet spot
for the money anyway guys I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now Bay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
