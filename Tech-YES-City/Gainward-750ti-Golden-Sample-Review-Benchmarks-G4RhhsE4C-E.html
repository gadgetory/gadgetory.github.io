these 750ti from game wood
welcome back to tech yesterday this
biryanis you coming back to you guys
today with a review of the 750ti golden
sample from game wood now two things
really excited me about this product and
I'm gonna tell you straight guys
straight away I was really impressed
with this graphics card one was that
Maxwell I got to try the Maxwell
architecture and see how good it was in
terms of power efficiency and two I got
to try a card from game with my first
ever graphics card from game wood and
man was I impressed but anyway let's get
on first of all with the build quality
and the features of this graphics card
then we'll move on to some benchmarks
and a conclusion
so first up as soon as I unbox this
graphics card I was immediately
impressed with the build quality I'm
gonna pick the card up shook it around
and there was absolutely no rattling at
all everything felt really solid and
well put together the card weighed in at
about 500 grams and man was I am just
impressed with the cosmetics of this
graphics card I mean it looks really
damn sleek on the top here we have
minimal styling just a nice clean and
black look to the card it's got two
eighty millimeter fans on the top here
which sound very quiet in operation it
has minimal branding with the game wood
logo on the top there a little G and a
gold and sampled GS in gold with geforce
gtx 750ti written on the side there so
that's the front of the card moving over
to the rear of the card we have a VGA
connection here which personally I wish
they'd just get rid of it I never use it
personally I mean do any of you guys
ever use a VGA connector if so let me
know in the middle here the most
important that's the dual DVI port which
will support 120 frames per second on
the left here we have a mini HDMI port
which if I was that could take something
about this card I'd be protecting this
because personally I don't have a mini
to HDMI cable I usually use Full HD full
size HDMI cables and if you use a mini H
the problem is if you put in a mini HDMI
connector you then will maybe hit B
hitting a dual the DVI port if you're
using both the connections so that's
something to keep in mind there on the
rear of the currently as you can see
though it is a full dual slot sized
cooler as well so if you are installing
this card into a mini ITX rig be mindful
of that as I wasn't
moving on to the rear of the card we
have here a black PCB and man it's a
full rich jet black so it looks really
good we've got the aluminium heatsink
covered in a nice overlay with a black
little metallic heatsink there so again
this is made of metal on the back here
not plastic which is something I really
like and suddenly the game would have
really paid attention to over there on
the side here you can see there's
they've used a nice very clean looking
aluminium heatsink as well and boy does
this thing do a great job of cooling I
could not even get this card past 65
degrees Celsius in like the middle of
summer
at 30 degrees Celsius ambient
temperatures which kudos to game wood it
cooled really well and this was an auto
fan speeds I didn't even touch the fan
speeds and that was with my max
overclock as well so that was really
good let's talk about the overclock so
before we get into the benchmarks this
graph is card Wow as soon as I pulled
out of the box I've hooked it up and it
was the fastest ever greatest card I've
had that's will burn out of the box
that's overclocked so high this thing
ran at 1,300 and 33 megahertz without me
even touching a thing and that was just
so damn impressive I mean that's like
almost 30 percent more than a reference
card and you don't even have to do
anything and the temperatures don't get
affected and the power drawer wasn't
really that much extra as well so really
damn impressive
the noise minimal at best you couldn't
even hear it it's the same as my GTX 780
lining but that's a 1.5 kg cooler on
that thing
so the Maxwell the build quality this
card game would get a big thumbs up
anyway let's move on now to the
benchmarks where I do have the
overclocked results and the reference
results however keep in mind that the
overclock I only managed to pour an
extra forty two megahertz on the core
and only an extra hundred megahertz
on the memory so I couldn't even get
that much extra out of this card that's
how aggressively overclocked this thing
was from the factory which is really
good anyway let's move on now to the
benchmarks so the first benchmark here
we have is Crysis 3 and this is done at
Ultra at 1080p I think both the 750 Ti
and the r9 270 are both sort of 1080p
graphics cards if you want to step it up
to
in for TP then you manage to look at a
780 or an r9 290x or something like that
but let's look at the results here the
GTX 780 lightning overclocks just for
reference but that managed to score 60
7.2 frames per second reference speed
it's got sixty point two for now the gtx
750ti
overclocked has scored twenty four point
seven two when it wasn't overclocked and
that was when it was basically only
overclocked an extra forty two megahertz
because that's all I could get but when
it wasn't overclocked it's got twenty
four point four eight and that was damn
impressive out of the box it even
managed to come into the territory of
the r9 270 which got 26.5 two out of the
box have the r9 270 did overclock a lot
better
it did scale better and it got up to 30
frames per second when I overclocked
that one thing to keep in mind though
the 750ti uses a lot less power than
either of these two graphics cards and
it also runs a lot cooler than either of
these two graphics cards so let's move
on now to the next benchmark we have
here and that's the battlefield 4
benchmark ultra 1080p the overclocked
sorry I've got these mixed up the GTX
780 overclocked scored 150 3.2 frames
per second it just blitzed again the
750ti though out of the box this was the
most interesting thing it's got 69 point
5 2 and it managed to compete with the
i9 270 in battlefield 4 which only
scored sixty five point eight four
however when we overclock the r9 270x
scored 72 point eight eight and the
overclocked 750ti only scored 71 point
two eight but one thing to keep in mind
was that this 750 Ti was sort of
competing it was trading blows with the
r9 270 which is something I didn't
expect at all let's move on now to the
next game I'm sorry next game in this
benchmark and this is UniGene Valley and
they look at the FPS scores here the GTX
780 lightning scored seventy three point
eight frames per second that was just
huge this is extreme HD preset as well
750 Ti measure score twenty four point
nine and twenty four point two when it
wasn't overclocked at the r9 270 did
beat it in this in this particular
benchmark by a look by a bit and that
was thirty one point four when I was
overclocked thirty four point two moving
on now to the scores they're pretty much
correlated to the FPS so the
nothing really big there the GTX 780
scoring a beast score there are 3,000
and the 78750 ti scoring 1041 and the r9
270 scoring 1431 though i overclocked
let's move now to the 3d mark 11
performance preset tests and the 750ti
here it managed to the GPU school these
are the main schools are gonna be
looking at because the cpu score and the
combined scores tend to relate to well
they can to have a little variance but
the GPU scores are generally pretty
solid so the 750g I've managed to score
around about 6,000 the r9 270 when it
was overclocked to scored over 8,300
which was impressive the online 270 at
reference scored seven thousand five
hundred seventy and the GTX 780
overclocked man that thing was a beast
at sixteen thousand two hundred twenty
one reference speed that was fourteen -
eight - so overall these scores here
represent generally the I guess the max
graphics power these things have and the
750ti it does impress I mean considering
how little power it uses so last up here
we have power consumption and this was
done during UniGene and I just tested it
with my power meter from the wall we see
here that the 750 Ti did look impressive
I mean the the graphs here it's got 234
watts
it used 234 watts from the wall when it
was overclocked the 780 lightning
managed to score 542 which was pretty
damn huge I mean this thing loves to
chug power when it's overclocked the r9
270 overclocked that managed to chug 341
watts now this is total system of total
power consumption from the system I'm
using which is a 4.6 gigahertz
overclocked Haswell CPU we've got four
sticks around we've got and Intel and I
see on that motherboard we've got all my
USB ports are pretty much but you've
been used and I've got three hard drives
in a DVD drive as well so you can see
there that the 750ti in this case it
doesn't shine as hard as it would if it
was coupled with a pentium or and two
sticks of RAM on a mini ITX rig so
that'll be that'll be the base of my
conclusion anyway so let's move on now
to the conclusion in conclusion I don't
even know where to begin this thing as
knocked my pants off and it almost
knocked my underwear off too but this
thing Wow out of the factory 1,300 and
33 megahertz the most aggressively
overclocked graphics card I've ever
pulled out of a box
next up the build quality my god this
thing is really well built it's quiet
it's cool and it just looks awesome as
well the last thing I guess when you
couple that with the Maxwell
architecture it really does impress I
mean this thing had absolutely
next to no power draw when we compared
it to the other two graphics cards I
mean couple this thing and I'm gonna be
doing this in my next video where I'm
coupling the Pentium and I'm pairing the
Pentium against the G to the four 670 K
but this thing when you put it in a mini
ITX rig it shines and it uses little to
no power a couple it with low power draw
Pentium and you get yourself one
efficient gaming machine especially for
1080p gaming now another thing that
impressed me was the I mean it's only
$150 and it was pretty much trading
blows with the r9 270 in some cases I
mean an r9 270x I would expect it to
beat this by up quite a bit however an
r9 270 this thing was shooting in the
same ballpark which was actually really
damn impressive so kudos to game wood
for releasing an epic card I'm gonna be
recommending these things a bit more in
the future probably a lot more in the
future the golden sample name is legit
and keep in mind this was a retail
sample I did not get sent this from
anyone it just Wow impressive anyway so
in conclusion I will say this is a
highly recommended by it is a bit long
however so if you're fitting it in some
mini ITX reach you may wish to check out
the slides I managed to measure it in at
about 22 centimeters in length so keep
in mind it is quite a long card however
it is well built and it is hell worth
the money anyway if you liked this
review please give it a thumbs up and if
you haven't really subscribe to tech
your city become a yes-man today anyway
if you have any questions about this
Graham Scott let me know in the comments
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can
anyway peace out for now I'm gonna be
bringing you guys the Pentium video very
soon I know you're looking at looking
forward to it anyway
and I'll give you guys a sneak preview
the Pentium runs really
well with the 750ti anyway anyway pays
off for now and let's roll that out
drawer bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
