brand-new PC or you just want to build a
PC for a friend and you don't want to go
use deal haggling like I do every single
month then today's build is going to
cover you for some of the best price
performance that money can buy so
starting off here we've got an RX 570
these are on eBay at the moment readily
available for about $88 shipped
even if you live international this
seller will ship it for $22 still making
it a very good deal now going through
some of the other parts because the
tally of this build is three hundred and
forty-four dollars making it extremely
good price performance for gaming not
only 2019 but also gaming at 1080p
medium or high settings depending on the
game but the CPU $18.80 now I did a
video I'll put the link up here where I
tested this CPU out and it was a great
combination with this rx 570 basically
this CPU has gone down from $24 to $18
and this seller has over 9000 of these
available meaning you're not gonna have
a problem getting one of these if you're
in the market for one now next up we got
the motherboard 48 dollars and 88 cents
plus eight dollars and 81 cents shipping
that brings it to a total of 57 dollars
and sixty nine cents shipped
internationally great little board
especially since it does support MCC
registered memory which is also going to
play a role in today's bill because
we're gonna be saving money on the CPU
save you money on the memory and now
also saving money on the motherboard
since it's not going to break the bank
now if you want the fast experience of
having an SSD but also having more room
for games and also movies then usually
this combo here 120 gigabyte SSD plus a
one terabyte hard drive is the way to
going I will be going that that today
but after checking prices online you can
get a 720 gigabyte SSD for $64 shipped
worldwide this kind of value is starting
to beat that of the hard drive in the
120 gigabyte SSD option which tallies
around about the same money but I'd
rather have SSD storage which is a lot
faster than your typical one terabyte
7200 up
storage and last up on the list is the
case and power splay here I got this on
a sale this is the MX 330 from cougar is
costing about eighty ozzie dollars it
should be about 60 USD comes with a 500
watt Value Line power supply which isn't
too bad it'll do a great job of powering
today's system which isn't really to be
overclocked but speaking of a non
overclock build although we won't be
getting the benefits of ramping up the
speeds on our CPU and GPU we will be
getting the benefits of saving power in
that this bill will use pretty low
wattage so that means in turn less heat
will be dumped in our case and that
means we don't have to fork out extra
money for a more expensive case and also
power supply all the links for this
build will be in the description below
but with that aside let's build this
thing see how it looks and also more
importantly see how it performs
so we've just pulled about the gravis
card now and this is so dirty I'm
actually surprised it's this dirty since
it is an rx 570 it's only been on the
market for a couple of years but whoever
used this for cryptocurrency mining
probably used it since it was four at
least but that's not a problem because
we're gonna now clean it all down with
our trusty friend here wd-40 in
Australia I use a brand called
multi-purpose spray it actually is
better than wd-40 then we've got besides
that alcohol wipes these are fantastic
for getting off all the dirt and grime
initially off the card and besides that
we've got our trusty friend the data vac
which is going to take care of hosing
this thing down with a lot of air
so now this RX 570 is looking really
good except in between the vrm
components that's the MOSFETs chokes and
also capacitors there's a little bit of
dirt stuck in there but not to worry
we're going to use a bit of brake
cleaner and that's going to get out all
this dirt and grime now I'd only use
this usually if it does get very dirty
on these parts and this is exactly the
case here this thing needs some brake
cleaner aka
tech yes love it
now typically in this fashion your bill
would be complete but since I'm gonna be
flipping this thing afterwards I'm gonna
be adding one meter of red LED inside as
well as two red led 12 centimeter fans
at the front of the case - none of these
spice things up but also give it a bit
of bling and of course just like sports
cars red will make this PC go faster
so we just finished up playing those
three titles and before we talk about
those results we're gonna talk about the
PC itself I've just blown away by this
price performance and although I do get
better deals the one-time deals every
month on the monthly part science this
is different because it's readily
available you can go on Aliexpress and
get these parts delivered worldwide
pretty much for the prices that I stated
in the title so it's coming in under 350
bucks and we go to Zeon here that's only
coming in at 18 dollars and 80 cents and
the cells got over 9000 of these things
available and even then the better news
on top of that is since it is a low
powered CPU it's going to have a long
life to come and the other benefit of
that is the motherboard which people are
like Brian this motherboards cheap man I
can't trust it since it's only using 35
watts the MOSFETs on this vrm are doing
absolutely fine in the previous video I
tested this motherboard it was only
getting up to around 60 degrees which is
absolutely fine and then those low
powered components coupled with the fact
that we going with the budget case
budget power supply and the rx 570 we
were only seeing maximum of two hundred
and sixty watts on the power meter
whilst we're testing Apex legends and
also Crysis 3 csgo did use a little bit
less power but that is a less demanding
game especially on the GPU side of
things so all that heat or should I say
lack of heat being dumped into a case
like this is so easy to handle you don't
have to worry about going out and buying
maximum airflow cases and really big
power supplies because sight like this
is not going to juice much power at all
but it's still going to get great FPS
when I put my hand at the back whilst
playing games it was like a lukewarm air
coming out the back the power supply was
basically cold which in this case we
were using a budget 500 watt power
supply so 400 watt power supply is gonna
be a similar story but you're not gonna
be strained really at all but in fact
it's gonna be a great thing since it's
gonna be hovering around its 50% sweet
spot so unis maxing out the efficiency
curve on the power supply which means
you will on top of voltage low power
consuming parts in this build
gonna be saving even more power get your
power supply it's gonna be running and
it's
efficiency peak but now going through
some of these parts individually and
first off the cooler on the CPU that
things got a little bit of bling and
certainly coming in a 14 bucks and it
does an absolutely fine job of cooling
down the 24 20 V to but keep in mind
practically anything could keep 35 watts
under control but also coupled with
cheap ddr3 memory which you can pick up
for next to nothing and the motherboard
and the CPU and RAM are all readily
available and so something like this is
a great choice for anyone in the world
and that's why this budget build is
pretty much so special for me because
it's pretty much hitting a point where
it's a staple for someone who wants to
get into PC gaming and now you probably
think in ok the 24 20 V - it only goes
up to 2.5 gigahertz across those six
calls and 12 threats but here's the
thing a lot of the new titles like apex
legends and other titles coming out in
2019 they're utilizing all those cores
and all those threads so you are pretty
much getting the best out of the CPU and
at those six cores and 12 threads at
their max speed it'll pretty much keep
any GPU in the budget area under control
like the rx 570 and also the gtx 1650 if
you want to go that route though that's
what makes this combination so powerful
for someone who wants to get into PC
gaming but doesn't want to go use deal
hunting like I do every month it still
wants to get really good value for money
I mean under 350 bucks it's seriously
giving out a lot of price performance
though the last two things I wanted to
talk about before we get onto the games
is the bling as well I managed to add a
strip in here that only cost me $2 then
I added 2 red fans at the front which
added more bling but on that note I want
you guys to let us know in the comment
section below what do you think of the
looks do you think it's a bit too tacky
or do you like the red LEDs inside so
we've got the bling and we've also got
the performance and the rx5 70s you
don't have to worry about them going out
on you any time soon because a lot of
the theory and - that's a cryptocurrency
they bought these rx5 70s and then in a
few months or even half a year maximum a
year a theory among cryptocurrency went
bust especially for GPU mining and they
brought in all these asag miners which
basically did a much more efficient job
of
in cryptocurrency then a gaming graphics
card ever could so that's why you're
seeing just a continual flood of these
GPUs on the market and so with that you
really don't have to worry about getting
hosed especially if you're buying these
parts overall Express or eBay where you
get buy a protection and the worst thing
you're going to come into with rx 570s
is the sellers just too lazy to flash
back the gaming v bios and this is
exactly what happened in the case of my
RX 5 70s that I bought up here and
that's just a simple thing you go to
tech power up download the V bios and
then quickly flash it on and you are
good to go though the gaming performance
with this PC was a little bit of a funny
one I mean apex legends rent absolutely
fine csgo giving out really good fps and
the 1% in point one cent low is really
good on both those games the Crysis 3
man this game even in 2019 1080p high
settings like I didn't go for the very
high settings that just went for the
high settings it was still ridiculously
hard for this setup to run the GPU was
getting maxed out at a hundred percent
and this is an Rx 570 which was released
years off to Crysis 3 was released so
it's such a demanding title I believe
the 2080 ti even has a hard time playing
this game at 4k at least from what I
remember with the testing so Crysis 3
man that came ant going anywhere soon
very demanding title and I mean that can
it run Crysis it's not just a joke not
just a meme it's the truth anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did and be sure to slap that like button
right on the chest and also let us know
in the comment section below do you like
this build how it turned out
aesthetically do you like the
performance is there things that you
would change personally if so drop a
comment in the comment section below I'd
love to know what you guys think but I
just think what we've got here
personally is a value King and we've
also added in a bit of bling on a budget
I don't think you could ask for much
more especially if you don't want to go
out and get local deals if you want to
sell in a computer jump on the internet
by the pots and get them shipped to your
door and that's what this thing is all
about
and with that said I'll catch you in a
nother tech video very soon and if you
enjoying the content around tech yeah
City I know I say it all the time but if
you really enjoy these videos be sure
subscribe and hit that Bell notification
to see these videos the moment they drop
and I'll catch you in the next one
peace out for now BAE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
