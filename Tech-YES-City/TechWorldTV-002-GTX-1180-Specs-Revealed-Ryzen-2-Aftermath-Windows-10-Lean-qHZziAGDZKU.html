joined here by tech deals how you do man
I'm doing awesome how you doing hello
everybody
yes everyone should be out there and
they were loving the last week I got so
much good feedback from last week's show
thank you guys so much for that everyone
just yeah I thought the show was really
good I like the way it float there was
some complaints about the donations and
how they were flowing through so I've
changed the noise it's only gonna be a
little noise but I spoke with tech deals
and we both agreed that if a good topic
does come up then we will talk about
that midstream because I actually really
like the specter meltdown discussion we
had last week and that was really good
so absolutely yeah and so in the last
week what's been happening you know I
hear this thing called rising to
launched I don't know if it was a big
deal or not but apparently uh some
people are excited that it came out do
you what's this the risin risin - yep so
it risin - came out and it's it's
getting spammed everywhere like
everywhere I go risin - in my face
rising - run - I just did my review and
I'm gonna get so much other stuff done
it's ridiculous but I don't know we can
talk about the other exciting topic then
yeah well I mean with risin - what is
the like if you think risin - what is
the most appealing thing about it to you
what cpu and what upgrade over the
previous generation well unless you're
stepping up from a lower end chip
I don't think cross upgrades from risin
1 make any sense like a risin 5 1600 to
arise in 5 2600 is not enough of a
change it that doesn't make sense but if
you for example bought into risin 1 at a
budget maybe you bought a be 350 you
bought a risin 5 1400 and now maybe you
want some more performance are you doing
some more multitasking the the chance to
keep your motherboard and RAM in place
and step up to a 6 or 8 core chip
without having to change motherboards is
a really cool
opportunity and I love the fact that the
good coolers now come with every chip
which is a nice change
yeah the 2700 X was is is nailing it in
terms of value for money there is that
fine line I'll probably make some more
content with the 2700 X versus the 8700
K the risin 5 1600 how do you I mean
start 2600 how do you feel about that
with the stealth cooler like I when I
tested the stealth cooler on the X it
was like you could do benchmarks quickly
but if you did like it I 264 stress
tests and you just watch the heat slowly
go up in other words the cooler
there's no Headroom yeah if you
overclock the 2600 on the included
cooler runs out of if you want 2600 X
speeds you're either buying in 2600 X or
you're replacing the stealth cooler yeah
and so well I found if I'd opt it to 3.8
gigahertz in the is 64 stress test it
just over like you watched the graph
slowly go up and then it just don't like
clipped off and crashed so that was I
guess that was probably the only
disappointing thing about the second gen
Rison series was the included the
stealth cooler because the risin 5 1600
came with that bulky spire cooler and
that was good for 3.8 gigahertz well my
advice in my review was simply if you're
spending now of course this was mostly
tuned towards the 2700 X I haven't
properly reviewed the 2600 yet because
AMD didn't send me one but that's ok so
I I rushed and I got the 27th the 2700 X
versus the i7 8700 K out and in my
opinion the 2700 is probably the most
pointless CPU in that stack in the sense
that I get why people might buy a 2600
because they see that $1.99 price and
they're on a budget and they're trying
to find a middle road and I get it but
if you're spending 300 if you're at the
$300 price point another $30 is 10% and
you get such a better cooler completely
so if you're buying horizon 7 just buy
the X chip which is different than the
advice I gave in Rison one because the
20 the 1700 came with the rate
you know spire and the 1700 didn't come
with one at all and if you remember it
launched there were what $70 a part in
price yeah
399 versus 329 or something mm-hmm so
now there are $30 a part in you get a
wraith prison no brainer
so I had 2700 X plus I mean I don't know
about the binning I haven't tried any
2700 non X's but 2700 X might be better
been not too sure but I hazarded guessed
is to say yes it would be the cream of
the crop as well so there's that - on
top of everything but do we will talk
about rise into a little bit later do we
want to jump into the probably the most
talked about topic at the moment that is
the gtx 1180 the rumors so yeah okay
what we got our way so will far away
with those specs we got 12 nanometer
FinFET so they're dropping the node down
from 16 nanometer to 12 nanometer we've
got a increased die size but when you
look at the die size here 400
millimeters squared it's not really a
drop in size considering the amount of
CUDA cores is going up to 1080 TI levels
so the gtx 1110 atti sorry has a die
sighs I think of 471 millimeters get
squared scared you getting scared of
this 1180 quietly so what a what I'm
seeing here really is just a refresh of
an 11-10 ATT I just shrunk down to 12
nanometer so and of course GD r6 so
really on is 16 gigabytes per second
versus 11 of bandwidth yeah so I mean is
it going to make a big difference in
gaming of course you're gonna get the
power consumption efficiency that's
coming out of that with 12 nanometer but
are you going to see a big leap in
performance when you look at the 1180
versus the 1080 Ti do you have one place
I see it making a difference is 4k the
memory bandwidth for larger textures at
4k gaming may show like 1080p and even
standard 1440p may not show the big gap
but it's it's a if you can get another
10 or 20% perform
at 4k that you know if it takes you from
50 to 70 frames per second that's a leap
for people who are struggling to begin
with of course if you already own a 1080
Ti is it gonna be worth replacing a 1080
TI with this probably not but if you own
a 1070 or a 1080 and you're struggling
at 4k then it makes sense but how many
people are using a 1070 at 4k anyway no
I don't know anyone so if anyone can do
yes
overwatch will do it but you know um you
do drop the textures down like if you
got 1070 at medium it looks was in my
opinion in 1440p high in some games low
you know low vs. absolutely yes go into
4k and turning to medium is silly I'd
much much rather lower the resolution
and if you want proof of this I realized
this is consoles but if you want proof
of this they learned a long time ago
that running at a lower resolution with
better textures actually makes the
average person think it looks better
really then then to run at a higher
resolution with lower textures so you
know like in any case yes I agree with
you I should have pulled out that study
that would have been awesome so but
really yeah just as an example I mean
most Xbox one games for example either
run at 720p or 900 P they don't run at
1080p because they didn't the horsepower
yeah that's exactly right so when they
I'm scaled because it's better to have
the textures than it is to have the
resolution that's true never think I
never really looked at consoles a whole
lot but I know the the latest Xbox one X
is at the probe the the big one the 4k
yeah the Xbox one X claims to be a 4k
console but only like indie and really
lightly loaded games are for most games
for at like 1440p upscale yeah well it
feels to me like they've got the games
that are perfectly optimized and they're
just showcasing them and then when you
had a game like pop G run on it just
brand like absolute crap like 30 frames
per second yeah but the stuttering as
well like those reports are just massive
stuttering and this and that so yeah
I mean it is what it is so I mean my
brother's a console fanboy he went and
bought one like day one
and then he's like even watches me play
PC you know the sad thing is he built
like a really good PC but I helped him
build this really awesome PC and he just
jumps on he's like I don't like mouse
and keyboard and then he goes and flips
it makes some money and I'm like dude
you want to hook us up a bit of like
because I got all the deals for him and
he's like nah yeah so I got I got
screwed I've got my brother GJ but yeah
that's what you do for your family and
on all the news though back to the 1180
so it looks like refresh is that like in
terms of the architecture itself it
looks like it's actually a refresh but
they're naming it touring yeah it's it's
I mean this isn't new basically what
competition does Nvidia really have I
mean sure there's the $3,000 Titan V or
Titan 5 depending upon how you read it
but since AMD has no competition to push
against the 1080 Ti why would NVIDIA
beat themselves because they can't
really raise the price point $6.99 is
about the most they can charge for
consumer card regardless of the mining
market and so by coming out with a
refresh for a year they can hold their
good stuff for another year and just
keep milking money I mean they're
selling every card they make and plus
the power efficiency makes the biggest
deal for - so dropping down 16 nanometer
to 12 nanometer is just Bank so do you
think this might mean that we start
seeing use deals on 1080 T eyes if this
is comparable and performance but uses
20% less power absolutely I mean if they
can get if someone can get $500 for that
1080 TI and buy one of these for $700
and they're going to do the calculations
where it's going to draw less power over
time because another big thing that
these massive miners face is heat like
putting out a lot of heat so they've got
to keep that heat under wraps obviously
they can't have their graphics cards
outdoors getting weathered so they're
gonna have min doors and they're gonna
keep that whole room clean no cool you
know what's going on with me English
today but yeah so they're gonna keep
that whole room cool so they it's in
their best interest to keep power
consumption as low as possible so with
that twelve nanometer drop it's going to
be
very popular for - unfortunately I know
people aren't gonna want to hear that
but you come around attack yes City
you're gonna get the truth you're gonna
get the hey guys like let's make
everybody happy
well if if this does come out in the
summer like the current rumors are
stating what is it saying here July yes
a July 2 to the article quickly so we're
gonna hit July 2018 sometimes so if it
comes out in July and you want one of
these
I would preorder it today it goes up
because I'll bet you on launch day in
the week after you're not gonna find one
very true I I think that will be the
case absolutely don't wait for the
reviews if you if you're a high-end
premium gamer you've been waiting for
this if you wait for reviews I think
you're just wasting your time I just I
just order one yeah so well honestly
you're looking what five five percent
more performance ten percent at best
than a 1080i but of course you're
looking at better power efficiency
possibly better overclocks it depends on
the new node itself yeah more vram yeah
and the end the gd-r gd-r six as well of
course big factor there so does look
like it's an improvement but it's more
refresh than than a new whole new
architecture bike but at least it seems
we've fresh and not a rebrand you know
like that exactly yeah it's not like the
400 to 500 series rx cards which were
just a rebrand they were yeah with
higher clock speeds and more power
consumption so you're exactly right
that's that is exactly right so great
fresh is up generally better than a
rebrand I think we can both agree
they're risin to what would be the
answer refresh so what would you say the
4790k was to the 4770k that would be
interesting they called it a refresh
what would you call it I to me it's a
rebrand um I have both a 4770k
and a 4790k both installed on Z boards
both with liquid cooling actually do in
the other room I have both still my 47
k.will overclocked higher than my 4770k
will but that's a sample size of one
each so that doesn't mean anything but
my anecdotal evidence is that visit my
47 90 does go higher but we're talking
about 200 megahertz higher that big deal
um okay 200 megahertz that's it I wish
they were soldered yeah
well that's a funny thing I was gonna do
a video on the first-generation LGA 1156
chips there they were pasted on and it's
a huge thing for me they just use paste
that was when they first I think tested
the waters with using pastes on
overclockable chips and no one really
noticed it and then the 2500 K came out
and they decided to solder it again
which is very weird because they
released x79 x79 was the x58 improvement
and Zee 67 was the p55 improvement so I
found it funny that they went from paste
back to solder that was very weird I
don't know what happened there but they
didn't have two different teams working
on those architectures at the time so
maybe that other team that made sandy
but like no we got to solder this thing
and it was a big improvement but where
the maybe they thought with the first
generation they're like no one noticed
that it was pasted on so we'll just roll
it out with Ivy Bridge and the problem
was with Ivy Bridge when people got the
chips though like wow these don't
overclock anywhere near as high as the
Sandy Bridge chips and then they started
to investigate and then yeah that was
where the pace thing was exposed and at
that time YouTube had grown a lot more
video media and you know people ranting
and whatnot had grown a lot more than
the first gen chips like YouTube still
non-existent I think when those first
chip first gen chips were released
everyone was doing unboxing videos just
with the crappy vlog cam at that stage
so no no no interesting times I hope I
really hope Intel goes back to Seoul
during again and I think they will
believe it or not I think I actually
will now if the rumored we talked about
this last week if the rumored 8-core
sixteenth red coffee light ship on the Z
390 comes out and they don't solder it I
don't know how they're gonna get clock
speeds and heat under control because
you know 8700 K is fine but if you added
two more cores and you try to maintain
clock speeds yeah that's a lot so so you
have a do you have an i7 2609 2600 just
picked over 2600 another 2,600 hi I've
got a 2600 K on my old a soos z68
motherboard and using a basic cheap 120
millimeter a IO it runs 4.5 default
settings everything all day long cool
and quiet no complaints and my 4770k on
a larger cooler will not hit 4.5 and
well but it's toothpaste versus
soldering I mean the 2600 K is soldered
and the 4770k is not so did you try to
deal it no you just don't believe in it
at all I don't have a problem with it
but I don't have enough motivation to do
it well I got a vise now at my home a
house studio so I'm gonna be deleting
like everything that comes through that
can be deleted one thing I found though
I'm gonna go back to using liquid probe
versus the conductor not stuff I just
like working with it better I don't know
what it is call me old-school I know
there's like liquid ultra out there I
just like using the liquid pro stuff I
guess when you get used to something you
just I don't know you know it inside out
just like my old Zeon's but also I was
gonna ask so you think just just a quick
question though you think with the new 8
core that Intel will release you think
if they don't solder it we're gonna have
a lot of photo on our hands if they
don't solder it I think they're gonna
have to lower the clock speeds to
basically make it pointless from risin 7
2700 X if they want if they want the
clock speed
2700 X they're gonna have to solder it
yeah and we'll get a lot of photo from
that solder fair enough I didn't make
her fun I'm not making just making fun
of the solder this is sort of thing I
just love the way you say this is funny
I don't know
god oh okay they loop it this way Intel
makes these wonderful claims that the
toothpaste lasts longer it doesn't have
the risk of cracking it saves them a
little bit of money I read something
somebody made a comment the other day
beneath the video and said no this is
Intel's way of trying to force people to
upgrade more often it's like I've spoke
to extreme overclockers about it like
I'm not gonna name who and any they just
told me straight away it's a money thing
that's all it is it's just money
his saves cost and that's all it is oh
you somebody made a comment you see that
yep so thanks Steve thanks dude
ultimate six core showdown is coming
very soon just go to review the Tai Chi
ultimate for asrock that review will be
dropping very soon
I finished the NOC review so that'll be
coming very soon - they're all the two
videos I have to get done before the end
of the month
and then the six core show now should be
coming in like the next couple of days
that'll get released straight away like
as soon as I finish that video it'll get
released so look forward to bringing
that out I know a lot of people dying
for that I'm gonna bring some more
budget sort of old-school showdowns
versus new that's gonna come as well
can't wait to deliver that because yeah
this whole studio has just enabled me to
really get back on track I had one guy
though why do I comment it is like I'm
unsubscribing until you do the sr2 build
and it's like I just facepalm to me and
I was like dude when I do the sr2 build
it's going to take me like literally a
week I'm not gonna be able to make
content because that build is gonna take
so much time and I want to do it but I
gotta get all through all my backlog I
got a new videos new products new
products do pay the bills and if I do
the sr2 bill there's gonna be no content
for a week that the video will get
released there's
nothing new about it is not feel it
links or anything so it's gonna be a
straight up me losing money for a whole
week and it's only really for the
diehard enthusiast of the channel I love
them I'll take care of them but I have
to get my backlog done first and it's
just like he's like unsubscribes like if
that's how you feel about the channel
and the way it goes like please when I
release the SR to build just don't watch
it like if that's your attitude you know
what I mean like I don't know is this
for me it was this I've been delivering
on the broken promises every broken
promise I've made I'm slowly getting
through them and delivering and it just
made me upset that was probably like
them yeah I'll get guys trolling me
every single day with like horrible
comments they don't bother me but that
one just got to me I don't know what is
I was like dude come on you know I've
been I've been sweating my ass off here
just remind him and Johnny he is always
welcome to a double his money back
refund of how much money he's paying you
to make videos if he's unhappy with his
free content yeah I mean I don't mean to
disrespect anybody but at the end of the
day there are actually a frightening
number of people who go why aren't you
making the videos I want to watch mmm
because you weren't paying any well my
patron view if they've got big requests
I always listened like they're the guys
have been supporting me for a long time
like so that was one of the patrons
supporters but that i7 scam he contacted
me and he said can you help me out and I
was like sure because I've known him for
a long time as well and so I look
forward to the day where we meet in real
life and have a beer he is just like
things like that it's just I don't know
man that whole sense of like guys I'm is
my job I have to live off this kind of
thing and if I if I just did use content
I would I know people love it I love
doing the use content but it makes me no
money and Adsense doesn't pay like crap
all so I'd be yeah the channel would be
dead in the water if I just didn't use
parts and it's funny because I met up on
the used parts hunt I met up with a with
Matt and he said oh I love nerd on a
budget and
I love Danny too man Danny's got an
awesome channel and he said but he
doesn't upload enough and I just laughed
I said dude do you know why Danny
doesn't upload enough scuzzy doesn't
make any money off doing use parts like
on the video content so it's yeah it's a
tough game but that's sort of like the
dilemma that we're faced with doing use
price-performance there's only a handful
of people large enough that they can
focus a good example would be um do you
know lazy game review I've heard of him
I haven't watched his content he's gone
and I could be wrong about this he's got
like six hundred died maybe seven is it
700,000 subs now and he but he's been
doing it for like five six years he's
one of the old-school guys okay and he's
been doing it long enough now that he
can get hundreds of thousands of views
per video and he does exclusively
old-school stuff and I mean really
nothing new occasionally like you know a
Sims game review or something he enjoys
but the number of people like him I use
him as an example the number of people
like him who are now big enough that he
can make money just off the ad revenue
hmm you could probably count on two
hands all the guys like you mentioned on
the budget are it's a hobby yeah cuz it
just doesn't pay there's a there's a
bunch of 50,000 sub hundred thousand sub
YouTube channels which make good content
but unless they have affiliate links
unless they have sponsors a fifty
thousand seven a hundred thousand sub
YouTube channel doesn't pay enough it
does you can't make a living on that
yeah so that's what me like I'm just
trying my hardest man I'm doing my best
here so it's it really is what it is and
I can't do anything I can't really
change anything cuz I'm gone I'm full
throttle at the moment I'm waking up in
the morning I'm doing YouTube content
it's funny on Twitter someone's like
dude you're gonna go get yourself a
girlfriend and I'm just like yeah I do I
do I'm just not really keen to go get
rekt again like my ex you know did a
number on me so really not too keen for
that girlfriends are on money and time
investment
now figure out a way to - what you need
is a girlfriend who helps you with the
channel where do you find a girl like
this please tell me no I ain't on tinder
I ain't trying tenderizer people I try
Tendo I'm like no not going near that
thing I remember I tried it once in
Vegas and this is a true story try when
I was in Vegas like year and a half ago
whatever packs before we had to pack
Seattle and I jumped on there and I was
like cool there's some nice people here
started chatting and then the chicks
like oh by the way I charge 300 an hour
and I'm just like and then this was like
all the girls I matched with on it like
I charged 300 and now I'm like that okay
I'm not looking for that you know yeah
so anyway that was my experience with
tinder so far so I really haven't been
keen to try it again but yeah maybe
after I get through like a heap of
content and the S ought to build gets
done I might try dating again just the
FYI if people especially Karl on Twitter
he was wondering so there you go this is
a I don't know tech world TV maybe we
should get back to the tech here next
article so we were talking about the
risin 7 here the 2800 X and this is
going to take on Intel's 8 core coffee
lay chips so what do you think the 2800
X is going to have some people have
rumored that it could have 10 cores and
I mean I watched a Bauer as video and he
said that the die size was the same but
they shrunk down to 12 nanometer which
was interesting to see so watch what's
your thoughts and opinions on that I
mean I've got no idea when it comes to
that like I'd love to see Dobara
do another sort of how he sands it down
and he just sees the exact you know like
you did for the thread ripper chip so
there there is in my opinion ok so just
on another account there is in my
opinion Z I don't want to say 0 cuz your
is a small number there is virtually no
chance that it's going to be a 10 core
chip and the reason I say that
is because AMD has built their entire
Zen architecture on a four-course ECX
complex design yeah they'll do a 12 core
rising at some point but I mean yes they
could do a 10 core with they could do a
10 core with 3 cc X's with two cores
disabled for bidding purposes but 10 is
an odd number I they would say that
present too in my opinion but what do I
know
I mean it's here's the thing the general
consumer platform hardly needs 8 at the
moment it's nice really most people
could buy rise in 5 2600 X and be happy
as a peach by a hundred our motherboard
by a 230 dollar 2600 X and be good for
years to come the only reason I think a
lot of people if you have the money
should buy 2700 X is just future
proofing because you don't know where
games are going you don't know future
applications and just extra cores are
nice but it's a hundred bucks for two
more cores and yeah I mean I think it
depends on how much your whole system
cost is whether that's worth it well
want me to think about 6 cores 12
threads back when the 5820k is released
it wasn't like relevant for gamers
really but now it seems like 6 cores 12
threads is where it's at for the
majority of people like who want that
top of the line performance so I already
find 6 cores limiting though I try live
streaming on one computer Ghost Recon
wildlands on an i7 8700 K and unless you
cap the frames it's choppy not really ok
I've done that actually it's on my
gaming channel um okay what should you
software do you use for streaming though
OBS with NVIDIA encoding
ok yes was I find xsplit whenever I do
my streaming benchmarks I never have one
problem with streaming and I've strained
on 84 hundreds even and I just don't get
a problem I mean maybe I'm testing the
wrong games I test dota 2 I've even
tested pub G babji's very intense so I
just find a pub G is not using all of
your course and threads whereas Ghost
Recon does ok I'll take a look ok so
maybe for the streaming benchmark
take a look at ghost recons in the
future that's probably something that
comes out of this right well I mean and
I did a number of games and many games
are just fine on it but it's if you set
the you know I mean if you either turn
vsync on or you cap your frames the
problem goes away but the problem is
your cores are being used your graphics
cards being used and in my opinion if
you're live streaming Triple A games
they like the Far Cry 5s of the world
the latest and greatest big-budget
titles
I mean dota 2 league of legends csgo
rainbow succeeds though those are no big
deal um I would get a rise in 720 700 X
all day long for live streaming over in
8700 K personally well be a great video
idea for you guys Rock
ghost lens recon ladies making videos
can't everybody just take my word for it
people want a video there's always you
got to make a video about some like I'll
just okay well I can I can take that
logic okay guys just picture it in your
head sr to build 2 X 56 90s in a Corsair
case hardline tubing done there it is
there's a video ok let's move on
done I see how much work I have now
saved you I just saved you a week of
work I expect a fruit basket out of this
so sorry I didn't catch the name he
asked is the gtx 1060 for $280 as well
is that a good buy yeah that's a very
good pie I'm looking for a 1060 at the
moment just to do like a real budget
1060 to do a comparison because the last
one that I bought off ebay I Freddie
talked that into build that's awesome it
to a tau D for a date 1060 is really
good how much are you guys paying in
America at the moment have they dropped
a little bit
his last week I thought I saw one for
like 270 US which is quite expensive
still for a 1060 what's the cheapest you
the tents the good 1066 gig cards are
300 and the good 1063 gig cards are 250
they were about 20 bucks cheaper than
that a week
but those cards are gone okay just a 250
and 300 for the three and six gig is
about what they're going for at the
moment yeah so okay sorry back onto the
topic of the 8700 K do you think the
most game as though like say for
instance they're playing ghost recons
but they're not streaming I mean how
many people actually stream nowadays and
do it day in day out like the average
person's like I'd say like 99% of people
who a game as a gamers I'd say well sure
there's a lot of people who stream
casually but the number of people who
stream seriously are are up 1% less than
1% it's a trivial number yeah but that's
what I mean I think six cores 12 threads
is relevant now but how long do you
think that's going to be then you for
call how long do you think that'll be
that long for when do you think 8 cores
16 threads will be more relevant like
it'll be the new thing to have I'd say
about a year and a half's time is when a
core 16 threads will be the sort of
mainstream enthusiasts go-to choice I
have two answers to that question the
first answer is if you're the kind of
person who upgrades every three to five
years and plays games for a while and
it's ok to wait for games to be out for
six months to a year to buy them on the
10 and $20 steam sales and you don't
have to keep up with the Joneses on
every game you don't buy the Far Cry 5
or 6 that the day it comes out you're
okay to go Wow wait till it's on sale if
you're that person horizon 5 2600 X
should easily last you five years in my
opinion because you're not a demanding
person if you if you're gonna maybe do
one graphics card upgrade in the next
five years and you skip maybe two
generations before you upgrade you don't
need to be on the latest and greatest on
the other hand if you're the kind of
person who goes well gee my gtx 1080 is
getting long in the tooth i'm gonna buy
the 1180 and then I'll buy the 1280 as
soon as it comes out and then I'll buy
the third because you buy every
generation of card and you buy Far Cry 5
and then 5 6 the day it comes out I
would buy a 2700 X all day long cuz
you're the kind of person who's on the
bleeding edge and you'll hit that 6 core
limit before the average casual gamer
will okay so one more question though
with the 2,700 X
have you felt the difference have you
can you homed in on your Jedi senses and
can you feel the snappiness compared to
the 1800 X I could feel it are you
playing on a Hydra frustrate monitor
numbers just like every little things
like little things you know you just you
move a little file into Premiere Pro or
something just doing these little things
it just feels more snappy
yeah 2,700 X to the 1,800 X that's all
if I tell you no are you gonna be upset
with me no boobs your opinion I don't
care like um I just got done testing the
the 1800 X the week before this launched
in fact I did a bunch of benchmarks on
four different graphics cards I
published some actually I've got one
coming up tomorrow that's in a Turner
there but actually did spend a week with
the 1800 X before it dropped
I took the 1800 X directly off of my
test bench put the 2700 X on and
immediately started benchmarking yeah
and you notice the snappiness okay would
that make you feel better I gotta tell
ya I mean the 2700 X is faster than the
1800 X but if I found in 1800 X for
cheap uh it wouldn't dissuade me from
buying it in fact I Chi did a week ago
by a rise in seven 1,700 believe it or
not Newegg was having that sale a week
ago which you probably didn't pay
attention to because you're in Australia
um what do you think to 210 dollars
delivered for a risin 7 1,700 with the
Wraiths bar RGB cooler wow that's a
really good deal and you couple that
with a solid B 350 meltable and you're
in heaven so I I was it was about 208 50
after the cash back in the credit card
you know discount delivered for a rise
in 7 1700 no one had bought one of
course I'm saying you know what the
second just coming out in a week
but this price hmm just over 200 bucks
and I got a stack of e350 boards to put
one on 200 bucks for an 8 core 16 thread
prop that's it that's a steal
it is so it's funny now I'm telling
everybody this and they can't go buy it
now which is probably making them upset
they missed it but you know hey that's
the rhyme the rule of a deal hunter is
you always get the deal for yourself
before you recommend it to others that's
like top 10 commandments of deal hunting
don't worry
so I am I mean I bought it because I'm
sitting you're going would I recommend
this yes this is this is such a good
deal if you if if you come across a
risin 5 1600 right now for what would it
have to be I mean if you came across it
for 139 would you snap it up in a
heartbeat which one sir horizon 5 1600
139 yeah yeah snap it up for that that's
that's dead sheep that's just great
so there's a price at which the previous
generation ships sea I would not have
said that so much about the FX chips
when rise and launch because risin was
such a breath of fresh air over the FX
chips huge improvement huge different
league in tire so even though the FX
chips were cheap at the time it's like
you know I don't know that I'd buy them
even cheap because it did so much change
but I would take a rise in first gen at
the right price than I did a week ago ok
well I mean it depends like 179 I'd take
the 2600 over that so 139 is getting
pretty cheap I can ignore I can ignore
the snappiness just for that price yeah
like that's the main how much of a price
tag do you put on snappiness
that's what you got to ask yourself that
is the question ladies and gentlemen and
when does the snappiness factor take
over so Dora I've got the thousand FPS
camera that's another promise that's
coming I'm gonna see I'm just gonna
prove myself right or wrong if I'm wrong
I'm gonna make fun of myself doesn't
matter but it was all in my head placebo
the kind of doubt that
it's placebo I doubt it highly doubt it
highly doubt it
anyway I just think it's worth pointing
out that as wonderful a deal Rison is
yeah the average gamer is still rockin a
three to five-year-old four core
processor with a three year old graphics
card and frankly doing just fine with it
well that's yeah that was the
interesting thing I mean I'm really
looking forward to seeing the x50 675
it's gonna stick it to these two brand
new 6 cores I know it is it's already
compared to the 8700 K but of course
people want to see if the X 50 675 can
actually beat the rise in 5 2600 that's
one of the biggest scenarios people want
to see I want to I'm gonna test that
very soon that's gonna be very
interesting so and you can I make a
prediction before you do it yep
benchmarks will look great but I
wouldn't trade a rise in 5 2600 X for it
because there's too many things missing
on it in terms of a modern platform for
my personal tastes mm-hmm I do think
that from a know the lack of PCI Express
3 isn't the end of the world the USB 3
you can always add a card the DDR 3
versus 4 Ram but the DMI link wait
actually that's on a qpi isn't it mm-hmm
that's not even my concern is that the
platform is so old that even with
overclocking the benchmarks look great
but day to day I mean I still have on
Anna Sue's p60 my i7 920 and it's
overclocked what you get but man I tell
you something the benchmarks look great
but I can feel the difference ok so
where can you okay so back to this so
this sort of correlates oh sorry nice
ties in with the snappiness argument you
can feel the difference where can you
feel the difference we're going to
explore this using using using Windows
launching programs task switching and
I've got a simp Sonny 840 SSD in there
it's not like I've running on a hard
drive or anything you know it's
um if you try to do more once you're in
a game and you're playing a game it's
fine
the actual in-game experience is good
yeah I wouldn't want to multitask in
Windows running Chrome on it how's that
okay fair enough
so what isn't machine at this point but
it's a fine gaming machine
so what speeds did you get what speech
did you get him up to and also what's
his name what is he on a every Zealand
has a soul what is your age doesn't have
a name what dude you got an a museum X
56 75 what's his name Nicholas thanks to
its sorry I will get checked EMS on
Twitter sorry man I'll have to come up
with a name okay my name's oh yeah I'll
let you name I'll let you name him okay
is it a him or her it's a him
oh it to him yeah what's his name
wah-wah so Josh I got Jah Jah he and
we'll call him Wawa
he's killing me man wah-wah kinks that's
easy all I can say is that CPU CPU
performance is not what holds back most
games I mean if you run gaming
benchmarks and you compare the risin 5
2600 to the you know to the old Xenon's
if with monitor graphics cards you're
gonna be fine I know but if we do get a
victory if we can score a victory on the
X 56 75 in a game even if it's a
benchmark if we score a legit victory
I'll do a dance in that video I mean
dude it's that old Verizon 526 hundreds
that new and I'm gonna be overclocking
them both there's gonna be no excuses
so 4.5 gigahertz vs. 4.2 Westmere vs.
Rison it's go it's going down and then
we're gonna throw it in the 8400 as well
if it can be the 8400 I'll do jumping
jacks off my table all right let me
offer a stipulation yep adjust the
performance to both chip
original price original cannot use the
current price it's not fair okay fair
enough okay well you can do it both ways
but here's why I say that that
performance existed back then but how
much did those e nines cost back then
because they were not $1.99 no like
1,400 bucks and that's what makes them
so good is like people selling for 30
bucks now you just feel right but my
point is is you couldn't buy that level
of performance for $200 back then what's
amazing about Rison is not just its raw
performance but it's what that
performance costs that's so amazing but
for me when I buy that zik you're right
like you are right it's what it costs at
the time right now but when you buy that
Xeon for $30 my immediate thought comes
to my head like hey someone just lost
thirteen hundred and seventy dollars and
I just picked up 30 bucks like it
doesn't make you feel a little bit like
yeah I got a even better than the deal
that I got because you know someone's
lost all that money in this CPU when
they first bought it now I'm buying it
for this price winning yes but only so
many people can do that because only so
many of those chips exist it's sort of
like saying it's sort of like the advise
against buying a new car because if you
buy a car that's three years old it's
such a better deal yeah but if everybody
did that there'd be no three year old
cars to buy exactly you go true thank
you
all I'm saying is those deals on Xenon's
exist because Intel had such a
ridiculously good CPU X number of years
ago sold them for a lot of money they
were sold for servers and workstations
they've been used and now they're
cheapest chips because all those
machines have been retired but how
here's an interesting question how many
of those X 56 chips do you think exist
in the wild oh sorry so we just got a
donation as well check the easterlies
case I will I'm sorry to say that
question again how many of those X 56
Xenon's
exist in the wild to be bought like look
say for example all the big youtubers
were to immediately tomorrow go out and
do exactly what you're describing and do
an X 56 vs rise and 5
comparison and immediately cause a rush
on the chips on ebay besides the fact
that the price would then be run up it's
not really busy with the available stock
be run dry
it's the motherboards that's the problem
it always has been with x58 motherboards
are always gonna be so hard to snap up
at good deals
Japan's full of them love you even
though if you know someone in Japan or
you're in Japan you can pick up x58
boards for like under a hundred bucks
and that's where it all began for me in
Australia they come up from time to time
people just sell their old computers and
don't know what's in them and you get an
ex 58 board out of that I would
recommend instead of looking for an ex
58 motherboard look for a PC that's
eight years old and someone doesn't want
it anymore and then just sort of check
from the pictures if you see six Ram
slots bang like you're getting that deal
go get it ASAP it'll probably have RAM
in it a harddrive power supply most
likely a good pal and they'll probably
sell it for hundred bucks
yeah and so that's where you get the
deals from x58 so the problem is there's
just there's countless eons available
because they're all put in these server
Dell motherboards dual slot motherboards
and whatnot and all those motherboards
are useless because you can't overclock
on them so you've just got this influx
of xeon chips that far outweigh the
number of x58 motherboards but also we
did get a question quickly about the six
cause six threads and do we think it's
too late no I think the 8400 is I really
like it I'm gonna say why I really like
it
full load it uses like full load on a 64
just the CPU its uses 60 watts or
something it's ridiculously low in its
power consumption for what it is
now you couple that with the GTX 1060
there's gonna be absolutely no
difference between that and a GTX 1060
on and 8700 K overclocked so it's it's a
real relevant CPU I think for a few more
years for two more years at least now
the problem is is at the moment Intel's
not really making a compelling option
for people to buy their platforms
because their platform is just simply
don't carry over there not upgradeable
if you're buying if you bought a be 350
motherboard with a risin 5 Verizon 3
even 1200 you're in a really good spot
you've got that 7 nanometer to look
forward to
the problem is like I'm gonna be doing a
comparison later we would do achieve
motherboards and whatnot but one of my
recommendations is going to be B 350
it's so relevant it's so good but what
do you think with the six core six
threaded 8400 I think it's obsolete the
day you bought it really okay elaborate
for me I think it is but a speed bump on
the way to 12 and 16 threads becoming
normal for mid-range - enthusiast
machines I think the six core six thread
chip is equivalent to the old Athlon X
3s when they tried to try core chips and
the whole market just ran flat right
over them in a year and I think that yes
you absolutely can buy an i-5 8400 today
and use it for the next 18 to 24 months
and it's fine but it will age poorly you
I realized that a I fully acknowledge
that from a benchmarking and Gaming
point of view and i-5 8400 is generally
going to be faster than horizon 5 1600
but I think that the 6 cores 12 threads
of the Rison 5s will age ever so more
gracefully ah both the Xbox one and the
PlayStation 4 are eight core a thread
chips and the rumors are that the
PlayStation 5 may even be coming either
this Christmas or next year with Zen
cores in it and if that's the case and
it has an 8 core 16 thread chip most PC
high-end game development sister is on
consoles these days now that they share
and we're starting to see more
multi-threaded use because of those
consoles if we actually get a
PlayStation 5 in the next 18 months that
has an 8 core 16 threads n core in it I
think you're gonna find six threads
should be wholly inadequate Christmas of
2019 for the games now obviously that's
just a fiction I could be flat wrong but
if you're spending a hundred plus
dollars on a motherboard one hundred and
eighty dollars on a CPU if you're
building a nice mid-range system which
is an i5 8400 I think eighteen months
from now Christmas of 2019 I think
you're really going to notice a lot
of threads at that point no it's not an
issue today hmm
but that's just my opinion can I just
bump you off with a quick question so he
got an on he got an 8700 9k anyway so my
thing is have you always been an i5 or
an i7 guy though that's the thing I've
always been the i5 guy like when I've
gone back to it I've been on like an i5
750 or an i5 2500 care and I 535 70 K
I've always bought the i-5 option as
opposed to the i7 option just out of
curiosity have you always been an i7 guy
or an i-5 guy I have been both and one
of the biggest mistakes that I ever did
is I went from an i7 920 to an i-5 2500
k thinking games at the time the back in
Sandy Bridge didn't need the extra
threads and it would be fine and two
years after I bought the i5 2500 K I was
really even feeling it back then now
some of that is not gaming some of that
is also productivity work but I I should
have done an i7 2670 4770k and an i7
4790k both of which by the way were
bought before I had a youtube channel
those were bought from my previous work
and I I did it - I didn't early upgrade
to the 4770 because I was noticing the
lack of threads and I was like I I that
was one of the biggest regrets that I
ever made was I went down from an i7 2
and i-5 thinking do I really it's there
because I'm thinking well they're both
four core chips so the hyper threading
is nice but those aren't real cores does
it really matter
ever since then my attitude has been if
you have the money buy everything you
can because you'll grow into it if
nothing else two years ago in the summer
of 2016 I was making videos along the
lines of do you buy i7 6700 K or i7 6800
kids abroad well II and I was comparing
the price of the board and chip and was
about a hundred and fifty dollar price
premium to do it a 6800 K
sixty seven hundred and twenty sixteen
obviously this was like eight months
before Aizen came out so my argument at
the time was if you're building an i7 if
you're going premium if you're gonna do
something nice a hundred and fifty
dollars more gets you 50% more cores and
threads had you done that you could have
skipped Rison one rise into coffee like
I mean if you're running a 6800 K today
that you built two years ago you're
still good you're still golden know the
clock speeds not quite as high but it'll
do four point oh four point two and
unless you need 144 hurt gaming it's
fine so the reason I built that for my
channel was because 4k video editing on
a four core processor even an i7 is kind
of rough and it's much smoother in Adobe
Premiere Pro to scrub video now here's
the funny part when I built my i7 4770k
what was the enthusiast chip at the time
ivy bridge-e yeah instead of doing the
i7 4770k if I had done Ivy bridge-e back
then which also would have only been
about a hundred and fifty ish dollars
more I could have skipped my Broadwell
II build and I actually could've had a
machine that would still be good today
I mean so if you had now if you're on a
budget I get it if you're on a budget
you only have the money you have but if
you've got the money my opinion by the
max you can afford because even if you
don't use it today what is the ultimate
value for the money
I mean people people have criticized me
because when the 1080 TI first came out
and I did benchmarks I said if you've
got the money
buy this even if you're playing at 1080p
and a bunch of people are like that's
ridiculous it's seven hundred our card
for 1080p I said yes but you'll have it
for the next three to five years in well
you can skip the next three graphics
card upgrades versus buying a $250 card
every other year sorry for the long rant
I mean this is just a subject that's
near and dear to me is the idea that I
buy the most you can afford it will last
longer
that's not mean that's where we differ I
think is like for me I've always and
it's sorry I I just like change
hardware like a change underwear you
need to see my Mini ITX I ate Brian's
got a new Mini ITX riggies change from
this one to this one up Brian's rigs
changing again I love changing hardware
and I don't know what it is and so I
think the biggest regret you would have
was getting rid of that x58 board
personally but one thing I do want to
know is because I gamed on I 5s up until
whoa
like 2016 I have never had a problem
like I'd I don't know man
what is this sort of like like and I
noticed you've nailed singled out
gostrey cons like do you do you like
seek games that just utilize all the
cause and threats icon that so that's a
fun game I don't know I've never had a
problem on the four core fourth it I
honestly think four cores four threads
especially flight mainstream titles like
fortnight's and the next fortnight
that'll come out and the next dota2
that'll come out I think four cores four
threads will be absolutely fine for
those games for years to come and the
reason I've said this in the past is
because a lot of the third world Asian
countries those net cafes if you've ever
been to one they're just packed with
like dirt cheap computers and they want
see the game developers desperately want
those people playing their games and if
they can't then they're not going to
play them so there's a there's a big
thing going forward why I think four
cores four threads will still be
relevant for mainstream titles of course
they're demanding titles will be
utilizing more cores for threads and
more cause more threads are set for
threads but yeah I've just I don't know
I've always played like here's new earth
dota 2 FPS games even the black ops
series I never had a problem on four
cores four threads we differ we differ
in what we call mainstream see I would
not call fortnight in dota 2 to be
mainstream titles really I would
consider those to be eSports or to be
casuals okay they're free to plays no I
am NOT saying that means they're not
played by millions and millions of
people yeah I'm what I'm saying is
you're correct there's a category of
game fortnight dota 2 league of legends
csgo Rainbow six siege which are
playable on mid-range to low range
potato computers because they've got
millions and millions people playing
them yeah I would completely agree with
you that games that will play on four
core four thread chips will continue to
be popular for years and years to come
for exactly the reasons that you said
and frankly arise in 320 200 G or arisin
520 400 G is perfect for those kind of
games well actually not real well the V
integrated graphics is kind of rough on
fortnight I've done that and it's you
want a better graphics card than that
but putting that issue aside for the
cores and threads that's fine but when I
think mainstream game and perhaps it's
just my thinking I'm thinking a
battlefield one for example multiplayer
64 player multiplayer in battlefield one
on a fork or four thread chip is an
awful experience hmm I know that I can
tell you that it's it's choppy and rough
the difference between AI 5 and an i7 on
battlefield 4 multiplayer is dramatic
and noticeable but here's the funny
thing
if you benchmark it it doesn't show up
in the benchmark unless you frame time
it because the graphics card has no
problem displaying the frames but the
CPU can't keep up with the need the game
engine so does being yeah so I guess I'm
thinking Far Cry 5 Ghost Recon wildlands
battlefield 1 battlefront 2 when I say
i7 I'm thinking of those games yeah ok
so we're we're just talking about two
different categories of games that's ok
yeah exactly I completely agree like for
those sort of more heavier titles
definitely it's just how many people are
into the heavier titles it's something
I'd love to get some stats on but also
there was ok so do we want to move on to
some of the topics as well we're getting
through these topics people very like oh
yeah what's going on he showed this
slide before Windows 10 is going on a
diet
apparently so we've got Windows 10 lean
which is apparently going to be released
what's coming very soon and it's
replacing Windows 10 s
so what do you think about this I mean
Windows 10s I never even heard of it
before you showed me this article do you
want to tell us what Windows s is about
the s well Windows Windows 10 s was an
attempt by Microsoft S was supposed to
mean
secure or Windows 10 store it was a
version of Windows 10 that would be it
would be pre-installed on basic
computers or appliance computers or
low-end machines that you could not
install your own programs and
applications the only programs that
would run it was kind of like an iPad so
to speak you could only download and
install programs from the built-in
Windows 10 store and the idea was well
it's secure because all apps are vetted
by Microsoft you would not be able to
download and install your own programs
well you can imagine how well that went
over um sounds useless to anyone that I
know it's like hey Windows 10 stores I
know some games I just don't buy them
because they're only on the Windows 10
store like I just specifically just
don't want to get them so I just don't
want to deal with the Windows 10 store
they tried to do this with Skype Windows
10 make it like store only in an app but
there is a workaround for that you just
download the 8.3 version and then right
click it go properties and then install
it as Windows 7 and that's how you get
around that it's a little bit of a trick
job that's the only way I know to get
around it at the moment so hopefully
that helps a few people out there if
they're having problems with that but
yeah so this Windows 10s stuff really
wasn't that sounds like yeah we haven't
heard of it for a reason but Windows 10
lean like what do we I mean is it going
to be okay I mean it just looks like the
same thing just rebranded it's basically
it's two gigabytes smaller in the
installation and it's missing the
desktop wallpaper registry editor the
MMC management console and some other
features it is actually live on the
insider build at the moment so you can
actually download if you're on the the
test versions of Windows 10 it's
available to download and install now
exactly what the point is and who this
is for I mean
two gigabytes of space these days I mean
that's nice but another version of
Windows I kind of missed back in the old
days remember we need to install older
versions of Windows and you could
actually choose what to install when you
installed it yeah that wasn't really
cool I mean I was gonna say as well it
doesn't have the still got the telemetry
I'm guessing because they haven't
mentioned of course out it yeah it's
funny no one yeah windows getting feels
like windows getting worse and worse but
no one bothers talking about it but yeah
every time you do an update as well like
the thing the big reason why they have
you noticed with Windows 10 - they're
releasing so many updates like hey we're
anniversary update and anniversary fall
update
oh there's another one coming and like
people like Brian you make another
optimization card Brian yeah you make
another it's like guys I don't want to
make an optimization guide every second
week and then it's become changed detect
yes Windows 10 optimization city if you
if you really want to hear some Windows
10 offense there's all I'll say is is
that Microsoft has different people
running at these days than the old days
and they're trying to copy Apple what
they're always updating nonsense and
there you know locking everything down
and I can't wait for real competition
I wish Apple was doing something with
their Mac's that would give us decent
competition but my understanding is that
Mac OS is actually not in that great
shape either yeah and also on that Oh
can you name one game that runs better
on dx12 I I'm yet to find one no no yeah
like I remember I was running ashes of
the singularity for the rise and
benchmarks it ran like crap
I think Volk and ran like crap too and I
just like well let's do the test and
dx11 ran the best out of all three so is
this like I don't want to be a tinfoil
hat person but let's talk about DirectX
12 for a second because right around
when DirectX 12 was coming out with
Windows 10 what also was coming out now
Vulcan is the current name for what was
AMD's thing back then before they
renamed into Vulcan what do they call it
man tool man
so there was mantle and then member
steamos which seems to have disappeared
gone right but here's the thing
Microsoft came out with DirectX 12 and
they were sort of like well gee if Steve
valve wants to create their own OS then
maybe steam shouldn't run properly on
Windows 10 and valve was like hmm well
maybe we don't need to do that steam OS
and Microsoft is like well maybe we
don't need to interfere with steam
running on Windows 10 then yeah let me
take my tinfoil hat off hey that's good
that's okay so we always love actually I
think every mother every week on the
show we're gonna go into a conspiracy
theory people love people tell me Brian
love a good conspiracy theory so you
think there was a handshake with steam
and windows the windows like look you
want to go make your OS that's fine but
we'll give you a culling on Windows 10
if you do then they scratch their heads
like yeah okay we'll do a steam OS we'll
just quickly just let it go sort of die
down as a concept okay you're fine
Windows 10 okay it'll work fine don't
worry guys move along you play and all
that they're still gonna be irrelevant
compare this thing I bet you thousand
bucks that's exactly what happened I
floored if anything else other than that
happened because both sides had too much
to lose and both sides were like let's
just not have this fight that's I
actually this is like I think this is a
conspiracy theory that is not like it's
getting some more traction it's it's
really big that's it
when I look at this much look at it you
look at it that makes sense makes a lot
of sense but I feel sorry for steams
they made those steam controllers steam
OS controller or something I people like
I remember how quick like that's brought
actually that's probably one of the
biggest fads going through like remember
this steam controller everywhere in my
inbox and sub feed and then just like a
couple of days later you never really
heard about never heard of it yeah okay
why and then everybody stopped talking
about and then DirectX 12 which was the
big threat yeah it was the big thing
that was gonna knock mantle and and
Vulcan down and then you notice that
DirectX 12 has become kind of nothing
yeah and you're right I can't think of
as
single game that runs better on 12th and
it doesn't on 11
in fact think there's actually a bunch
of new games that have come out which
don't have DirectX 12 support yeah
that's true well I was gonna say - like
I've spoken to some people about
previous Windows versions now we got a
donation as well thank you ever Linux
and they said wine was the real reason I
guessing that's the Linux version I
don't really have any experience with
Linux sorry wine is a Windows emulator
on Linux it's its it uses the native
api's to attempt to run native Windows
executables on Linux
ok and he said that it's no reason ok
hmm interesting so I just found it now
Windows 8.1 skom pletely dead 7s like
dying Service Pack 1 that's dying
Windows 10 is taking over and yet the
big benefit of Windows 10 was dx12 you
know people like I myself I'm guilty of
saying it Oh guys just jump on Windows
10 you got dx12 support yet there's just
years later there's not one game that
runs better on ds-12 it feels like it's
a flop and so I'd love to go back to 8.1
pro I loved 8.1 pro when I had my custom
Start menu just felt better
it felt yeah doesn't it - lemon tree
baked into it it was just for me it was
the real OS I got used to it I learned
to appreciate the 8.1 initially I hated
it now we have hardware that is not
officially supported I mean risings not
officially supported coffee lakes not
officially supported yep little is and
it's and it's only going in that direct
you know if you want to buy the next
generation graphics card and test things
it's I know there are people still
running Windows 7 but realistically how
much longer can they keep doing that and
upgrade their hardware yeah I mean I
don't know so yeah there's the Windows
10 thing Windows 10 they say we got next
article up here and what do we got what
do we got
Amazon key so lost I'll actually two
more articles will try and actually Bank
their own quicker this shows running
really long but that's good guys the did
the deals I mean the deals we got that
we got the hot topics
I've been told I talk a lot it's a good
thing I love having a chat so awesome
Amazon key expended so I pulled the
article what am i doing off my game
Amazon key expands to deliver packages
inside your car so this is very
interesting when I looked at this
article you were telling me that Amazon
now can get remote access to your house
and your car and just put the packages
in there and then lock it for you and
Bale
don't elaborate a little bit more about
yes I well this is me but you know uh
thank you but no I've seen the quality
of delivery drivers that Amazon has
working for them um not just no but heck
no there's not even in fact I showed
this actually earlier today I showed
this to my wife and she just looked at
me with the oh yeah I don't think so
look because we get we get deliveries
now we live very close to an Amazon
warehouse so a bunch of our Amazon
deliveries are already coming from their
quote local courier service rather than
UPS or FedEx so we're already seeing
what the Amazon delivery people look
like Amazon actually hires independent
contractors like uber people to drive
their own personal cars and let's just
say well you don't have Walmart there in
Australia but do you know what Walmart
is yeah I've been them in okay it's that
you're getting that level of employee um
also you're saying like okay so you guys
like hey I got my delivery today
but like all these other PC parts are
bought down a marker center are missing
what the delivery man is like hey I
don't know what happened well the funny
thing is that is the way it works in the
house and this has been running for a
number of months now but the the Amazon
key service for your house the short
version is you replace the lock to your
front door with an electronic Wi-Fi lock
that Amazon can unlock remotely and then
you install a camera inside your house
that turns on when the driver gets there
so he gets there with his phone he
punches in the code Amazon remotely
unlocks the front door to your house he
can open the door
um he can put the package inside your
house and there's a camera recording him
which you can either watch on your phone
or watch the recording of later and then
he leaves closing the door and then the
lock is relocked remotely by Amazon the
idea being of course is he's recorded
and so he can't come inside and touch
all your stuff because they would be
able to see that and obviously do
something about it
now the flipside of course is he's now
seen inside of your house and so his
buddy can come by a week later and find
all your good stuff but but ignoring
that detail you aren't going to have a
camera in your car for exactly the point
that you made the idea with the new car
service is if you're at work if you're
out driving or somewhere you can it only
works with currently Volvo's and GM
vehicles that have OnStar but you your
vehicle could be parked at work you
could order something for like two hour
delivery and instead of coming to your
house the amazon driver would drive to
wherever your car is because your car
has GPS and so he can track your car oh
boy there's a wonderful idea yes so he
can see where your car is
and this $10 an hour contractor drives
to your car pushes a button your car is
remotely unlocked and he can either put
it in your back seat or your trunk and
then close it and then it relax and then
he leaves and you're not even there yeah
I told my wife about this and let's just
say yeah I completely agree man I was
like okay there'd be there'd be some
loopholes guy puts on a ski mask
it wasn't me delivering the package I
just got beat up down the street and
then there's like I could just imagine
the amount of excuses these guys could
pull and just even if Amazon even if
Amazon says oh but we'll be responsible
you know what it's my home and my car
and I don't want anybody in it when I'm
not there most I don't rent my car out I
don't rent my house out I know mmm but
people are doing it the funny thing is
we were out for a walk today and my wife
looked at me and said you know our kids
are gonna do this when they get older
and they're gonna look at us and think
we're as old-fashioned as our parents
you don't use email yeah it's it's
pretty funny um yeah is there anybody in
the audience who's okay with this I'm
curious - chat is there anybody who
thinks this is a good are we crazy do
you like this plan
that's actually the last article so we
know we've got the 970 Evo but maybe we
should just cut that short and go to
chat we can talk about the Evo next week
the Evo's of 60 second conversation
anyone okay
okay I'll try and oh I see chat is
crawling pretty quick now okay cool
all right so let's go so well quickly
cover the Evo and then we get to chat
here so 970 Evo has been at an antic
it's AI looks like they're the first to
publish a result here I mean if someone
else was under NDA technically they'd
still be under NDA and strict NDA but
there's some numbers here for the new
drive here from Anandtech they got the
numbers up 970 Evo doesn't look that
impressive especially compared to the
960 Evo except this like latency
benchmark which is weird I don't know
how the Evo is formed that far behind
was a 250 gig version there so the
biggest jump from looking over the
article that I see from an in tech is
that the write endurance is is supposed
to be higher the capacities there's now
a 2 terabyte version of the m-dot to
drive whereas the 960 Eva only had a 1
terabyte m dot 2 version yeah and the
warranty is 5 years on the Evo mm-hm
sorry oh do you do you think this is
impressive the 970 a vile name from what
you see with this I just think it said
no I think this is a product that saves
them money because they're using the new
64 layer 3 demand and so it allows them
to make the nan for less money I would
buy a 960 Evo over this if it were
cheaper good thanks for that matter I
would buy an 82 SX 6000 because it's a
lot cheaper yeah that's what's gonna say
like these are good like sure these
improvements and maybe it may be an air
nerf when you look at that
nan that's going in there but that's
what's gonna say in these benchmarks
from an intact
why don't I see the budget boys here
ring and true like where's the a data
where's the especially the a data and
the what's the Z there's easy 280 I
reviewed on the channel that's that's a
value for money play when it comes to an
nvme PCIe solution and dot to where are
these options cuz they're there for no
no where's the where's the Western
Digital blacks own oh there it is there
it is I saw it but this and they do have
it yeah if they don't have the a data
drives that's a huge mess and even I
mean for me personally even the Corsa
np-500 Z they go on sale and they're
really competitive to they go down to
competitive prices and I've reviewed all
of them and they're they're good they're
solid they're phenomenal I think they've
all got the fire Sun controller on board
so it's not a huge difference the
biggest thing with SSDs and that's why a
lot of people say when I go to a nvme
storage device I don't notice a
difference the biggest thing is the 4k
random reading rights and I've been
harping on about this for a long time
now they're not improving that much when
I did see a massive improvement was nvme
raid zero with the right I forgot what I
said it threw the case right back
and it made it unstable but the 4k
readin rights they doubled and that was
phenomenal but the 970 Evo just looks
like another release it's yeah solid
looks like it'll be a good value for
money but not as good value like I think
there's some other options out there
there are really good value for money
they don't get mentioned enough I still
think the average person is fine with a
SATA SSD as far as I'm concerned yeah
for me it's especially if you're paying
less per gigabyte it means you get a
bigger Drive yeah well for me the
scratch drive thing it does help like
when I'm editing videos people have
people saying dude you do your whole
channel single-handedly and it's like
yeah it's a one-man band at the moment
and the reason I get things out it's
because I've got the 8700 K overclocked
I've got nvme storage they're just
little things that help with the whole
flow saving time saving time got a lot
of presets in Premiere Pro as well just
get bang flicking the effect and you
just you know getting getting the whole
workflow done but let's move over now do
you want to move over to now chat
what's chats cracking what's checking
with a little bit what's checking with
crack chit chat chat had a lot to say
about fact if I scroll back up chat had
to do I will make one comment somebody
in chat specifically called my name out
and said that he bought a 960 pro based
upon my advice the one thing I will say
about the pro drives versus the Evo's
for anybody watching right now is that
as good as the Evo drives from Samsung
are they're still try level cell TLC
drives with SLC cache and once you fill
the cache if you are a heavy heavy
professional user the speed falls off a
cliff the benefit to the pro drive as
expensive as it is is it can maintain
full write speed for the entire length
of the drive because their mlc drives
and I use a pro drive in my main box for
that exact reason as I never have to
worry about saturating its SLC cache
does didn't have one I like that's the
thing I have used I think I've have to
go back through memory lane though I
have used some select few TLC drives
that have not slowed down like after at
least a hundred gig transfer which is
massive I haven't done updated with it
I think was the crucial MX 300 perhaps
did that use TLC
that's a TLC drive with an SLC cache yes
off the top of my memory that didn't
slow down after a massive file transfer
so I have to go back and look and see
how big it is the the nines I want to
say the 960 500 gig drive Evo has a I
think it's a 32 gig to the 32 or 64 gig
SLC cache the average person is never
going to run into it but if you move
around 100 gigs or the files on a
regular basis or you are running
multiple VMs or you're doing heavy
timeline at its pulling from multiple
sources because that's reading not
writing you gonna be a pretty heavy user
yeah that's true to saturate I'm oh
here's the other reason you buy the pro
drive double the write endurance eight
hundred terabytes written
versus 400 on the 500g drive I think I'm
going from memory anyway I only wanted
to mention it because somebody in chat
specifically called my name and said
that he bought the pro drive and I just
wanted to mention there is a difference
with the pro drive and it's not
performance it's anyway back to chat
sorry yeah that's okay um we've got so
we got asked a few questions except
they're just scrolling so fast
okay sorry guys this is probably the
worst Q&amp;amp;A now moving over okay so the
chat chat looks like they're keeping it
themselves entertained anyway so that's
a good thing so apps we can roll down
the show a little bit if you had a
donation hang on you had a donation a
while ago we're so Britt the master said
Amazon is like that crazy girlfriend
that once your password yeah I've got
some funny stories about that I'd
probably save that for the patron chat
I'm sorry that's a yeah yeah like yeah
would be ex and stuff like that yeah
anyway okay what's a good deal for a
core i7 2670 k is a nice chip but when
you looked at when I went to Japan for
example that's when I bought 3770k I got
that for a hundred bucks and that's sort
of what I'm prepared to pay for it
because you can get them in sort of like
I call them just giveaway pcs where
people just don't sell them for a dirt
cheap price and it's got a 3770k in it
that's what I'd value at 3770k at a
hundred bucks for me that's what I'm
willing to pay for one 2600 cabe like
maybe eighty dollars in that's the thing
and I'll express they're more expensive
at the moment which is why I hands-down
go for those Zeon's DX 34 40s they're 15
bucks overclocked them and you get a
great experience even up to like a ten
sixty you're not going to notice a
difference really
so the 2600 K is a nice CPU which is I
think people charge too much for it so
me personally I don't buy them at retail
whatever I don't really look for them
because no one sells them individually
and if they do they asked like 130 140
bucks for on its late
it's not worth it do you mind you when I
go back to Japan when that happens I'm
going to be gone hand man I'll pro even
buy another suitcase just two suitcases
use parts and she goes where we go so
moving that to chat what what other good
maybe you can if you want to line up
some good questions what would you pay
for 2,600 k2 well you know the thing
with the 2600 K is do you have a
motherboard for because my bigger
concern is the motherboard not the chip
so are you saying that you already have
a motherboard are you saying you have to
buy one you'd have to get a motherboard
but you can get the Z 67 za volley they
actually are pretty well priced I mean
you can get one plate I don't even know
the last time I checked see 67 was like
60 bucks maybe it's not too bad 55 for
for a good one my four DS I mean for one
little overclock to a sweet spot like
4.5 4.6 I think it'll do the old school
boards that's one thing about the old
school motherboards that the new school
doesn't really get right the old school
i i've got to h 55 gigabyte in that
pickup i just got on the weekend you
look at the vrm that's like exactly like
the p55 he said it doesn't have a
heatsink on it that's what the older
quality just had it had even the cheaper
options had solid VRMs that were good to
go and it's something that I miss the
new schools like you get vrm throttling
and it's just sad sucks so and yeah
overclocking is completely out of the
picture so back in the day it was like
it was really good because of that
though they were over design and
components were cheap and admittedly
components were cheap do you know prices
of minerals have gone through the roof
since those days and so yeah VRMs now
actually cost money to make proper vrm
designs so anyway
somebody just asked if an i-5 46 70 K is
a good CPU for 1080p for 4670 a 46 70k
sorry a 46 70 K you
since that was one like I had the 46 70
K when it was first released it was a
base man I liked it
I've called tech deals II done like four
cores sorry well I'm you know you can
you can give me a hard time about that
if you want its UNIDO to get along
really well from what I gather
well I'm sorry what you and adored TV
The Scotsman Jim oh you'd get along well
all I know is that with with stuff that
old I don't mind playing around with the
different CPU choices because I've owned
all those boards since new my P 60 X 58
my z68 board I've had all those boards
from day one inside know how they were
treated I know they were taken care of I
would be you know my mindset is also
probably different coming from the
corporate IT world where reliability and
dependability is everything if my system
is not 100% stable it's useless
and so my viewpoint on these sort of
things is if I get a used motherboard
off of ebay and I get a used CPU off of
ebay and I have a system that's stable
97% of the time I consider that to be a
bad system but that's also because I
spent 15 years managing and building
systems for companies where all that
mattered was 24/7 reliability if it
crashed it was useless so that's kind of
that's where my thinking comes from yeah
I know my thing is just a straight up I
also made a living off of getting
companies to replace everything every
three years so you know yeah my thinking
comes from just I've been a guy who was
PC gaming since Warcraft 2 and then I
just got into like value for money and
that's what the price News profit
performance is just really kicking at
the moment that's what's why so on we go
sorry we have donation buddy sorry guys
that's probably go a little bit greedy
but it's probably the best way to get a
question through oh did you get that
question just flick through man this
chat is cracking way too hard it's only
about a 290x
to 90 to 90 X with the reference cooler
it gets very hot there like 90 degrees
and I'm not comfortable with having a
graphics card in my computer that runs
at 90 degrees day in day out I'd rather
go for the r9 290 which is a little bit
cut down but it also uses a little bit
less power and so I've just bought two
of them so I got to r9 290 s I think I'm
getting that deal as well just got a
friend to pick it up in Brisbane so
there's two and 290 so I'm gonna put in
builds so I'd go for the uh nine to
ninety and I'm paying about 150
Australian dollars for it which is like
a hundred and fifteen hundred twenty
u.s. that's the max I'd pay for it I
mean that's what I mean people like
critique me on my used GPU guide but
that's is what I'd pay it's nothing
about market rates I mean you want
market rates go pay market rates
that's why market rates exist you want
to deal go get a deal so I just just is
that just as a heads up I think he was
asking he's not asking shitty buying r9
290x he's saying if he has in r9 290x
what should you upgrade to my bad okay
that's actually sorry not completely
sorry but those good chat anyway right
it's just fine if he has a 290x I would
upgrade wait for the 1180 like it's
seriously coming it seriously is coming
it's a refresh it's got to come soon
otherwise nvidia can't push out another
refresh when na'vi comes out for example
1180 this rumor
really makes sense it makes a lot of
sense to me so i just wait for the 1180
pre-order it like tech deals said
because the crypto miners will be all
over it and happy days man what do you
think I think that if the if the
temperature and the vram does not bother
you the 290x
evolved into the 390x I mean the 290x
has four gigs of e RAM if you're playing
at 1080p and you're willing to mess
around with a few detail settings I'd
yeah I'd actually I think I'd agree with
you the 290x the that because that's
really what about our X 480 speeds give
or take a 290x sorry so much which is it
again soon IX is what's the 290 X is
roughly
our X 480 speeds our X 472 now XD I
would be around 480 470 somewhere but if
you're if you're at 1080p
you don't need an upgrade no not at all
ah I would I mean you're getting here's
the funny thing if you'd bought an r9
290x at launch how many years of value
have you gotten out of that card come on
yeah it runs hot on the reference cooler
I mean sure but you've gotten a lot of
years of use out of that card do you
reckon you need to take out life
insurance though just in case it blows
up oh I actually had don't laugh
I had the r9 295x2 do you remember that
one the online 290x - Wow
like you could feel the heat coming off
that thing yeah that's what I've heard
stylist that was that liquid-cooled and
crossfire on a card ridiculously
expensive although I got a deal on it of
course it launched at $1500 I paid 650
cuz I got it like nine months later
Newegg had a deal and it was stupid
cheap here's the thing when crossfire
worked it was amazing but that was back
in the days do you remember the frame
pacing and stuttering issues with
crossfire oh you betcha man that's
that's like engrained into my brain
because I went through those days way
back when I was water warcraft like I
played that game religiously there was
this big argument going on in the world
of warcraft community don't buy an AMD
card because they stutter they suck that
was the argument and I was an AMD fanboy
at the time so I was like value for
money you know is there was always that
like the fanboy wars i think used to be
worse than they are nowadays they would
that were getting there there was i was
a rabid AMD fanboy back in the day and
there was rabid nvidia fanboys rabid AMD
families so in nvidia fanboys were
spawned from what a Warcraft and that's
when I I saw the light when my friend
let me play World of Warcraft on his
Nvidia graphics card I saw the light it
was I was like I couldn't deny it
he we had our computers
side by side jumped on his computer and
I noticed it it was like wow this is
stutter it was clear and obvious the
efference I was and that stage on you I
was a fanboy but at that time I was
angry I felt betrayed by AMD no no sir
yeah what was AMD at the time they just
changed from ATI to AMD but I felt
betrayed
I was like there is something and then
ever since that day I was a believer in
the stuttering and the frame pacing and
then it was PC perspective and other
sites the tekwar tech report they came
out with proof and that was a shocker
that was a real shocker and the good
thing that came out of that was plac'd
people thought it was placebo but it was
it was rumors and opinions that caused
the objective testing which then in May
the improvements in AMD overhauled their
drivers and it was all fixed so it was
good well the interesting thing is I
replaced my 295x2 with the 980ti that
day the 980ti came out and objectively
if you have a game that supports
crossfire a 295x2 is faster than the
980ti but I was never a World of
Warcraft player but I played Star Wars
The Old Republic yeah and the smoothness
and the change in how well the game ran
on the Nvidia card yeah you would like
to be honest my name machines have never
had an AMD card sense because Andy Carr
family cards are theoretically faster it
all compute in in in in mining in
mathematical compute in FP 32 AMD cards
are our superior but Nvidia cards are a
better gaming experience so stuff I will
say the RX 485 80s were pretty good in
that ya know good AMD has improved a lot
of things here's what I will give a me
credit for what AMD does for the size of
their R&amp;amp;D budget versus Intel and NVIDIA
is R&amp;amp;D budget yeah is incredible that's
true that make sense yeah the value they
get for how little money they actually
is pretty cool yeah but that moment when
you change to the 980ti did you feel
liberated was there like a did Novogratz
did gaben come down to you and just say
you have been liberated my son it was it
was a million times the right decision
even with the performance loss in
certain applications there were some
games in a few places where I noticed it
was slower but the question is do you
want faster and choppy or slower and
smooth Oh Florence smooth any day of the
week any day that's what that was the
big argument back in World of Warcraft
so I remember I tried that in video card
and then after that booked up my GTX 670
and never looked back
never looked back man Nevers I've been
like using Nvidia my main rigs ever
since kept blah and never looked back
somebody in Chad has a question for you
yep would you replace an i7 920 these
days or stick with it for gaming only oh
my god replace it with the Zeeland
it's a cheapest upgrade I'll bang
afterwards streams finished I'll put a
link in the description specifically for
the guy with the 920 you just have to
get rid of that so should I replace the
thermal place on a new 10 1050 Ti
actually a great question um
no like a new tempered ET I should be
fine if just run a benchmark on it
should be getting under 60 degrees 10 V
DT I shouldn't go that hot at all if
it's going into 70s definitely replace
the thermal paste something's wrong if
it's been mined on even if it's a few
months mining if you buy a car that's
been mined on replace the thermal paste
regardless yeah you know with my
experiments I did some of the cards were
okay but some of the cards you took him
off the mining bench even though they'll
find on the mining bench as soon as you
took him off they started running hot so
most of the cymbal place must have
contracted or lost its viscosity or
something happened maybe someone who's
technical about that can elaborate why
but the thermal place was shot after
they got off the mining bench so that's
one thing if you buy a card has been
used for mining you might get it for a
really good deal but do replace the
thermal paste
are you finding this questions for you
are you finding used graphics cards
deep enough to be worth buying versus
new oh yeah like I mean I'm calling like
you say that didn't you watch the used
parts hunt man I'm getting them deals I
mean they're getting less and less
because there's a lot more I know guys
on the coast now there's keV he's
running around he's like his hunting
deals he's on his game I got respect for
a man like I don't hate him or anything
they just did their hustling man but
yeah there's a lot more guys looking for
deals now and one guy was mad in the
comments on that used parts and he's
like thanks to guys like you Brian I
can't get my used parts at a good price
it's like it's like hey man I got an 8
burn why just I'm sitting I mean it's uh
all right would you buy a 1070 or 1080
used or were you talking about nine 70s
and I know these I'd buy anything used
men I'd buy anything used that's just me
I just yeah I think a lot of people
because I came from Japan like I lived
in Japan for a while where their
mentality with you stuff put it this way
a lot of my savings money that I've
saved has been from that mentality where
people think use products are no longer
good and they've just got rid of them
back in Japan I did I mingled with car
parts and there's another guy I'd love
to meet there's a guy over there one of
my friends was telling me there's a guy
he used to do car parts as well I really
want to meet him because apparently is
doing video work in Tokyo now and yeah
there's just this I grew up flipping
things I like flipping things I like
turning trash into treasure and in Japan
it's a gold mine because they've got
this mentality that used is just
terrible
anything used is just trash and so
you'll get Layton's weird it's a real
weird dilemma in Japan you've got these
guys living in total shoeboxes the
houses are terrible they look disgusting
you've got a brand new skyline gt-r out
the front r35 sitting out in the
driveway I'm just like I'm scratching my
head it's like man your house I probably
got wind leaking in it and all sorts of
crap in the typhoon the house would
probably shake and it'd just be a
nightmare living in that house but you
know this brand-new car
some of that mentality is just like you
you have to get everything new and then
they go out and like literally overpay
for a brand new house use houses over
there if you spend like you know a
couple of months renovating you could
get a used house bring it up for like a
hundred grand but no you got to go out
and pay 400 grand for a brand new home
you know it locked that 35 year suck a
loan in hey I'm done with life you know
that's me
says I don't know sort of yeah would you
pay here's let me let me give you a
specific then okay would you pay $200
you delivered for a used mid-level
gtx970 versus you we are talking us here
because that's I'm looking at eBay would
you pay $200 delivered for a mid-level
like an EVGA superclocked for example um
970 versus 250 for a brand-new 1063 gig
card yeah I think you know the answer to
that I'd be paying like 130 for that 970
and if I didn't get it I wouldn't buy it
let it sit there on the market because
the cheapest working 970 on eBay for buy
it now at the moment is a hundred and
ninety five dollars delivered has he got
into now that's two message I'm sorry
has he got international postage enabled
he's probably trying to hock it to
someone overseas and if it's 30 $40
postage someone in a remote area or
someone in Europe will probably snap
that up that's what he's sitting on
I guess because what I'm thinking is if
I could find a GTX 970 for under 150 I'd
be interested yeah you wouldn't not on
ebay I mean I I actually haven't got one
yet that I've got for a good price I've
got a lot of seven 80s a lot of 780ti
zlata a nine to nineties for really good
prices haven't yet to pick I've been
offering you know Brown about 200
Australian for a 970 yes I ran about 150
price point that's the max I'll go
because again that argument you state
why would I pay any more when you can go
out and get the brand-new 1060 that's
more efficient just going just be better
like why would you bother you need to
you can use it you can therefore use a
lower rated power supply that's another
big benefit so yeah yeah I mean the you
I'll use things relative to what's new
and that's why I like the GPU market
because we're getting improvements we're
seeing these new cards that are coming
out and they're hitting so hard for
value for money and they're just ringing
the price right down on these use
graphics cards and there's another thing
as well since the old CPUs are still so
relevant we've just got a market that's
flourishing for use price performance so
absolutely flourishing like that would
did you have a flourishing day I had a
flourishing day I spent four and a half
hours editing an unboxing video yeah
someone else two hundred all the 980 I
owe $400 1070 $200 980 I that's a big
one that's an easy win so and perhaps we
should maybe wrap up the show I don't
know how long we've gone for I feel like
we've gone for ages like this is huge
bit I I mean the viewers like the live
viewers over 500 so clearly people are
loving this live stream I'm loving it
tech deals is the man do you want to
briefly mention that last article that I
sent you about TSMC okay I will just
check right now
TSM sync I sent that to you you did
indeed is it no you didn't you gonna hit
me up on Twitter if you hit me up on
skype I rent your windows gonna get poo
what's it gonna be able poppy a flood
off I'm getting it there you go okay
cool tsmc kicks off volume production
let's just give thee this is a bonus
article look at this but we're ready to
go and tech deals did it for you guys
bonus article TSMC kicks off volume
production of sentiment 7th at 7
mananitas that's it that's what I wanted
to say 7 mananitas
okay we've got here so what I'd haven't
read this article sorry I'm a man
you have to fill us in the short the
short version is they've got 18
different customers who are using this
technology starting now
why they've been in prototype phase for
a while but they they plan to have more
than 50 different products by the end of
2018 on 7 nanometre production horizon
will be when it shrinks dye size by 70%
at the same transistor count versus the
16 nanometer we've been using wow I mean
7 anime is a big deal it's funny because
they're gonna go they're gonna go lower
than Intel which will be interesting and
because Intel's going 10th nanometer TSM
sees a shilling 7 they skipped right by
you know 10 and so the current 16
nanometer stuff that tsmc has been doing
a 70% area reduction at the same
transistor count that's huge that's
money saved to that's or we can get
double the CUDA cores or double the
streaming you know cores on a graphics
card why don't we have the hate though
that's the thing like you're compacting
it so much I mean this is like
smartphones will be in heaven with this
for sure how would it mean we can
actually get a phone that has a battery
that lasts longer than a day oh yeah you
begin this what I mean I wonder if
Apple's light doesn't say Apple here but
like apples probably like book down the
whole assembly so well you know they're
all you know I I don't know about you
there on the there are one of those 18
you know that but the frustrating thing
is I remember mobile phones that used to
last a week on the battery yeah I want
one of those
Nakia 8210 I love my 82 10 I remember
maybe 2/10 that lasted a while on its
battery and I had a little snake game on
it too
anyone remember the snake game snakes it
was the snakes and ladders or something
and you played it for like 10 minutes
you like this is boring and you moved
over why just think it's cool that
they're doing that and it'll be
interesting to see what in because
Intel's ice like at 10 nanometers what
coming next year yes under this year
bull Verizon's going to seven animated
next year and that's pretty much
confirmed and is this gonna be what
rising is on next year yes I believe
it's TSMC s7 animate I believe and
that's really crazy so we got asked as
well HD 6870 what's it worth
oh man nothing yeah like it's one
gigabyte dude I did a videos I think
while ago I did a joke video one
gigabyte of VRAM is just lemon your 720p
bound for starters it's a really tough
sell man I'd be paying like 10 bucks for
that might just sort of I'm not really
interested in testing one of those
because this is a 69 this is a 69 50
which is a better coach it's just by
comparison if you go by user benchmark
at HD 6870 is roughly equivalent to
either a GT 1030 or ether of the rise in
AP use that's still impressive just
needs multi gram that but the biggest
problem is the vram because that's raw
compute but a GT 1030 has two gigs of a
ram yeah so two gigs is crucial for
1080p I mean maybe that cards worth what
25 30 bucks yeah like yeah I died great
I broke at 20 bucks I just paid ten for
one that's what I'd pay for one and even
then I probably wouldn't buy it because
there's no one who's looking for a piece
like because I do most the stuff I buy
it has the end intention to sell as a
gaming PC because gaming pcs sell that's
how I am NOT as I'm able to do a lot of
the use content without losing money is
because I make value and then sell it as
a gaming PC if I wasn't doing that I'd
be losing a lot of money and so my
whenever I look at a part it's like okay
can I put this in a gaming PC and market
it as a strong gaming PC at its price
point
I nine 290 pcs oh yeah I'll be able to
say look this is 1060 performance bang
someone will come along and buy that at
a discounted price so yeah and I'll do
the testing and I make the builds make
magic happen
is the so blunt seven nanometer as well
seven nanometer so the biggest thing
that's going to come out of this is the
next-gen Rison do you think the next-gen
navi as well do you think they just get
AMD is gonna go and radeon group is
going to go all out on seven nanometer
because it says it's GPU it says your
GPU everything everything everyone's
gone seven anime seven animator is the
future and yet Intel is still struggling
with ten that's it that's interesting
what's difficult man I remember I read
an article ages ago saying that we're
gonna really struggle below ten
nanometer like any company's gonna
struggle below 10 nanometer it's
ridiculously expensive and hard to get a
node that flourishes below 10 nanometer
if risin 3 AKA zen 2 launches in March
of 2019 at 7 nanometers and the best
that Intel has this ice like at 10 you
know the benchmarks ultimately tell the
tale and I mean that's just a transistor
size and doesn't say anything about
performance or clock speed or anything
else but talk about a marketing
advantage you have to imagine that the
press and the slides and the
announcements and they are going to wave
the banner yeah that they are first to
seven nanometers on a mainstream desktop
CPU they'll be the fit they'll be
they'll be holding the 30 foot banner in
the air yes obviously yeah you know
there's guys in costumes and like the
pizza you know the pizza places they
hire them dudes they'll have a heap of
them waving like seven nanometer flags
they'll be doing this fitting signs
where on seven nanometer and Intel be
like yeah we got higher clock speeds and
then that'll just be this battle but
again I think that's another reason
that's gonna force Intel to Sol to their
chips again because AMD did make a big
point of having their enthusiasts chips
soldered so anyway yep there's that
putting it out well this has been fun it
has been we're going on way too long
guys like amendment I remember you
telling me before the stream you're like
I can only do this for an hour but we
just have so much fun thank you guys for
the suggestions everything we hope it's
been flowing better this week as well
last week we did get some suggestions I
love the I love constructive feedback
always listen to it I sift it from the
hate as well the haters you know they're
just gonna drop in through the boo boo
just it's straight off the market if
you're gonna complain I just yeah I did
ban you too I don't need that crap
around my channel
constructive feedback awesome thanks
guys for that yeah so we got the
constructive feedback was the donation
noise was annoying donations were
bumping up and interrupting the stream
so we're fixed so hopefully we'll fix
that this week and of course we look
forward next week to giving you guys
another live stream in terms of the time
format we don't know when we can give
out it's like it'd be great to have a
scheduled time this day seems great for
both of us in terms of the scheduled
time though it's tech deals is a family
man and so you know his family's gonna
come first so I don't know where if we
could schedule out a time we maybe we
can work together and give you guys a
rough time when the livestream will
launch but don't hold us to it sort of
thing that's what would you agree yes
somebody just said that they need to
provide seven nanometer badges for the
front of your PC yeah I'm gonna go today
I'll just make the seven buildin yeah
seven nanometer runs Final Fantasy seven
emulated it's done
Final Fantasy seven on rise in 787 and
we put a slot machine on the side of the
PC with the 777 it's gonna be it's o7
animator is the future guess I'll have
to launch it on on June 7th at 7 p.m.
today we'll and actually that would be
epic if they did that all right
maybe maybe there probably will be
delays I'm guessing for this guess
there's always delays with new node
shrinks that are massive like that so I
expect some delays but thank you guys so
much for tuning in we've yeah we always
love your company enjoy the viewers over
half a half a thousand concurrence
that's big
so with that number we might be able to
get some sponsors and
just little sponsors you know a little
subtle things like the glasses here and
stuff like that you know they're not
gonna sort of impede on your viewing
pleasure
jaja he's not sponsored he's always
keeping it real and yet any closing
words mr. deals um not really I wish I
had something clever and funny to say
but I really know that's okay we've
think I've exhausted you today anyway
see ya go get some sleep and have a good
break
anyway guys we'll catch you in the next
week this episode and we'll work things
out this is concept that's been you guys
have loved it it's been overly
successful so thank you guys so much for
tuning in once again and we'll catch you
in the next week peace out for now do
you want to see the peace out for now
bye
I love to hear you say it me peace out
for now and bye yep and that's it and
also we've got people requested the
Scottish accent so I'll try that as well
alright guys peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
