international tech deals and let's take
a look while we can pick up this week
long back to exiting before we get on
with this episode i will say be careful
of what country you live in and the
import taxes associated with that
country i know some countries judge high
import taxes even on low value items
i'll put a link in the description below
you can kind of get an idea so hopefully
you're not buying something and getting
hit with an unexpected hi hefty fee
what's up there on the international
texts we've got the Pheo a 10k this is a
USB DAC headphone amplifier now it's
going for $73 shipped internationally so
you get two dollars off if you spend
over forty nine dollars and you can take
that off the 75 bucks or $73 shipped
international another good thing about
this is it will have louder volume then
you're on board or they'll also have low
signal noise ratio especially against
low-end onboard audio which comes in on
a lot of those entry motherboards look
of doing about getting something like
this it will give a lot better sound to
your headphones but at the same time you
can carry it from every build that you
do so if you've got to build it this
year and you wanna upgrade in two years
time you just carry on your DAC amp
combo and not have to worry about the
on-board audio on that particular
motherboard so for $73 this is a pretty
good deal the next deal we've got here
isn't really a deal per se if you live
in a country where computer parts are
readily available but I know there's a
lot of you guys out there that live in
countries that charge ridiculous prices
for things like graphics cards so we've
got a 750 ti here ship international for
110 USD so if you need a graphics card
is kind of going to do a decent job at
1080p especially for those popular
titles like csgo League of Legends and
dota 2 then this graphics card will do
more than well for those games now if
you're looking for a keyboard we've got
the logitech g7 10 plus here this has
got brown switches in it so the
mechanical keyboard it's going for sixty
seven dollars with free shipping if
you're in the US but since the
international shipping isn't that bad
it's only 22 goals I think it's still a
pretty good deal especially for
countries where you're paying a lot to
something like this so really good deal
at this
I so moving on to the US now we've got a
4k TV going for three hundred and
seventy-eight dollars with free shipping
so fifty-seven percent off and you know
55 inches 4k ridiculously cheap for a 4k
TV especially if all you want to do is
watch a casual movie here and there and
do some other stuff now the next deal
we've got up here is a condenser
microphone from MXL so if you guys want
to give your audience better audio then
this thing will definitely do it in a 60
USD so that's free shipping as well if
you're in the States bang what a
microphones for 60 bucks freaking deal
now if you're after a 1080p IPS monitor
they've got these used monitors going
here for a hundred and thirty three
bucks so they're from HP they've got
sixty percent off at the moment 27
inches IPS friggin deal if you want a
cheap monitor that's going to look
pretty damn good especially for the
money chasing a cheap SSD for you or
even your current build if you don't
have an SSD then you can get a silicon
power 240 gigabyte version so $58 so
this will end speed things up especially
food times and browsing internet endgame
load time over a standard hard drive
it'll be much faster in 58 bucks I think
it's time to pull the trigger here after
a new graphics card we've got the king
of the new graphics card price
performance arena this is the RX 470 and
the good thing about this is is going
for a hundred and thirty dollars that's
after a thirty dollar rebate not only
that you get a free copy of hitman with
it and it's the msi armored edition so
it's going to do a great job of cooling
and being quiet moving out of some deals
for aussies we've got some racing offers
gaming super deluxe chairs here they are
going for 90 strangles so if you don't
want to pay 200 or 300 dollars or more
for a chair and have that racing look
these ones are awesome for 90 bucks get
in on this it's cheap it's going to do a
great job it's going to make you feel
like you are in a race car seat well
hopefully plug on to the next deal for a
you we've got the Z 270 gaming inside so
this is e 270 motherboard and the best
thing about visit comes with an intel
600 p n dot to SSD 256 gigabyte so you
get that for free it's going for three
hundred sixty nine dollars so it's
pretty good deal this price for
Australians where we pay a lot
motherboards anyway so you guys will get
a free end or two with it anyway so not
a bad deal so if you're after a speaker
upgrade for your desktop z623 2.1 THX
certified 200 watt rms speaker system is
going for a hundred nine dollars plus
thirteen dollars postage makes it around
122 dollars australian delivered to your
door and i will say that this sound
system is friggin powerful and it sounds
pretty good especially for the money no
lucky we got up here is a gaming
keyboard from a hola this is study a
strain dollars shipped to your door now
the good thing about this we've got too
many men to actuation point it's going
to be pretty responsive and i think
that's what game is need in general
assault forgot LED backlighting as well
now moving all the way over to the UK
we've got these samsung 500 gigabyte 850
Evo m dot to SSD going for a hundred and
fifty pounds so you get a thirty two
percent discount and this thing is going
to be pretty damn quick not only that
it's actually a pretty good deal the
next people got in the UK is the g for

keyboard now the good thing about this
is it's 10 keyless and it also has the
remedy mechanical switches which feel
really good and are very responsive so
you've got a thirty-eight percent
discount they're really good if it took
first keyboard and you want something

this thing will certainly do it for 75
pounds some lobster we've got up his for
Canadians this is the HyperX cloud
stinger gaming headset i tried these
things that packs and they are really
damn good when I heard they were 50 USD
I was pretty shocked and now that
