really good deals you can get on CPUs
especially if you're buying used now
when I do my use PC builds every month a
lot of people tell me that they just
don't simply like overclocking whether
it be they don't have the patience or
they just couldn't be bothered
overclocking there are performance
benefits to overclocking but this video
is going to be focused on that person
who just wants to get a CPU slap it in a
motherboard and then start playing games
so let's get on with the top 5 picks for
2018 or at least early 2018 for the used
CPUs that are non overclockable
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today and let's
get on with that list they're coming in
at number five is the III 1220 this
comes in a $50 now you've got four cores
3.1 gigahertz and you've got Sandy
Bridge architecture at least with the
IPC so this will play well in popular
multiplayer titles especially dota 2
csgo and even pop G now this is variant
that is known as the i-5 2400 and the
benefit of this CPU is that if you get a
cheap om system a prebuilt like a HP or
a dell optiplex for example you can take
that a3 2120 out for example which is a
very common cpu put this CPU straight in
maybe even put in a gtx 1050 and you've
got yourself a very decent gaming pc on
a budget now coming in at number four is
the w30 680 this is a xeon with 6 cores
12 threads and even though it is
overclockable we're gonna ignore that
today because even out of the box it
comes in a three point three three
gigahertz on 6 cores 12 threads now it
is Westmere architecture so it is a
little bit old but the IPC is still very
good and we're seen with games they are
starting to take advantage of more cause
and more threads and so this cpu
definitely gets fourth place and it
comes in around $65 now the benefit of
this WZ on is it will work on
practically any x58 motherboard so yes
you can go on Aliexpress grab yourself
one of those one and motherboards which
are very cheap put this cpu in and you
will have a very cheap gaming PC not to
mention one that will play games
reasonably well especially if you're on
a budget and coming in at number three
is the ex 3470 I absolutely love this
CPU you can get it for around about $40
and you've got four cores eight threads
not to mention it'll work on very
inexpensive LGA 1156 motherboards you
can overclock this CPU of course and you
will get really good benefits from doing
that but of course even if you're not
into overclocking you will get some
extremely good performance
this CPU especially for the money now
you can couple this with some cheap ddr3
memory even if you're managing to find
it now no ddr4 memory is super expensive
and that's sort of trickling down to
ddr3 but if you can get some good ddr3
memory especially out of a prebuilt for
example then you can put this CPU in and
especially switch it up for an i3 550
that's in there for example and you'll
have some really good performance and
also another good thing about this CPU
and also the W 3680
is of course I know this is the non
overclockers guide but if you wish to
overclock in the future you want to
learn on something and you sort of a
little bit nervous to do it on brand new
computer and something like this is a
great learning curve especially this and
number four so now coming in at number
two is the e5 1270 v2 this is the Ivy
Bridge architecture still very good to
this date now you're getting four cos
eight threads of non overclockable
performance that's 3.5 gigahertz base
clock but it also turbos all the way up
to 3.9 gigahertz now if you get a good
z77 motherboard you'll be able to put
this CPU straight in and get 3.9
gigahertz on all course also with the
CPU it will work on z68 and also even
h61 motherboards I believe but you may
need a BIOS update in order for the CPU
to work properly it will have I do
recommend getting a z77 or a b75
motherboard and this CPU will be
extremely good value at a hundred and
thirty dollars so it is the most
expensive CPU on today's list but it is
very relevant especially if you want
something that it'll play really well in
today's games utilize inexpensive ddr3
memory and also even utilize an
inexpensive motherboard now coming in at
number one for the non overclockers is
the e5
26:40 this is 2.5 gigahertz on 6 cause
however it does turbo up to 3 gigahertz
and you will get 3 gigahertz on all 6
cores on most motherboards x79
motherboards you can get those cheap
ones off of Aliexpress and they will
work absolutely fine and even with that
combination you can get ddr3 ECC
registered memory which is extremely
inexpensive it'll go well with this
whole combination and make for a great
CPU for gaming even in today's later
titles you've got Sandy Bridge
architecture which is of course a little
bit dated but that IPC is still very
strong especially in the latest titles
games like pub G this CPU will have no
problems getting 60fps practically at
all times though if you do want to get
something a little more aggressive than
you can step it up to the higher
variants but just keep in mind they do
cost a lot more so $60 this CPU is
definitely worth the money and you guys
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did - be sure to hit that like button
and let me know in the comment section
below do you agree with today's list of
course when it comes to the CPU market
there are just a lot of CPUs out there
that are really good I mean if you are
into deal hunting like I do once a month
then you can get some really good
one-off deals
it'll eclipse this whole list I know
that I've found in the past some really
good one-off deals that are just such
good value for money though this list is
designed for those people who want to
get into PC gaming they don't know how
to overclock or they just don't want to
and they still want good value for money
and the CPUs are readily available and
also on top of that I'll put the
motherboard sockets right next to the
links for the CPU so you guys know which
motherboard you've got to get with that
particular CPU anyway guys I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
