the GD x9 series has recently been
released with the 970 being priced at
330 USD and the 980 coming in at 550 USD
I opted to go with the 970 as I clearly
see it as the best value for money
out of the two and this model here is
the gigabyte g1 gaming Edition so today
we'll look at some features of the
graphics card itself then we'll look at
some benchmarks temps noise and power
consumption and then I'll move on to a
conclusion so the GTX 970 g1 from
gigabyte is not your typical reference
card this model in particular features
the most aggressive out-of-the-box
overclocks for a graphics card that i've
ever seen in my life
coming in with a burst clock that goes
all the way up to thirteen hundred and
seventy-six megahertz
they also this model in particular
features the updated tray wind force
cooler from gigabyte which in the noise
test you'll see actually sounds really
quiet so gigabyte have decided to update
the styling of their graphics cards this
model in particular features a black
machined steel finish all across the
card which I must say looks very sexy on
the rear of the card we've got g1 gaming
here with some aggressive style vent
holes on the rear it shares that same
aggressive look with vent holes and
that's still coming over the uncovering
the heat shroud pipes also on the front
of the card we have here the triforce
cooler which is actually very quiet in
operation and the best thing is they've
gone away with the plastic fan shroud
and they've put this machined steel
black finish on the fan shroud as well
so it makes the card feel very solid and
the cut does indeed feel very solid
weighing in at 805 grams on the left
side of the card we have wind force
which illuminates to a bright blue so it
actually looks pretty cool in the dark
and on the left side here we have that
same aggressive styling with the vent
holes there and the machined steel black
finish encompassing the whole grapes
card now moving on to the rear of the
graphics card we have here a DVI I dual
link a DVID dual link and three display
ports and a HDMI 2.0 so that's right
this will support from the HDMI 60 Hertz
at 4k resolution which is an update on
the GTX 9
series in particular also we can't
forget here that in gigabyte have gone
away with the reference 6+6 pin design
and they've gone with an 8 pin +6 been
designed to help support higher
overclocks also this model in particular
allows you to go up to 3-way SLI which
is giving you guys upgrade ability in
the future so the GTX 9 series you also
get some new technologies from Nvidia
with support for DirectX 12 you also get
the support for the new MFA a technology
which is supposed to give you the
performance of for speed MSAA
with the performance hit of only 2 speed
msaa so another technology introduced
with this graphics card is resolution
downscaling which will essentially do
just that it'll take a higher quality
image down scale it to whatever
resolution you're playing at which is
supposed to give you a better picture
now I'll be testing all these
technologies in the next coming weeks
and let you know my personal opinion on
them but also another technologies don't
have to forget is VR the oculus rift
they're supposedly meant to reduce the
latency involved with that however I
don't personally use the oculus rift and
I don't see myself using it in the near
future so let's get on with the
benchmark
so this is the part you've all been
waiting for at the benchmarks and
essentially I put my system specs in the
description below for you guys and it's
important to note that I am going to
start testing out-of-the-box settings as
opposed to overclocked settings because
as people say this makes sense because
this is what you are guaranteed when you
buy this graphics card I also doing a
separate section for the overclock so
you can see that a little bit later but
let's move on now to the benchmarks the
first one here is battlefield 4
1080p ultra on the test range we have
here the GTX 970 out of the box settings
scored 156 point two for average frames
per second and the GTX 780 scored 138
point one - this is the Lightning
Edition which also comes with a standard
factory overclock moving on to Crysis 3
this is where the GTX 780 actually
scores a victory here coming at a fifty
eight point nine six average FPS versus
fifty six point eight for moving on now
to Skyrim this is essentially a result
that doesn't change due to it being CPU
bound at 1080p you can see here the
results are pretty much identical now
moving on to ARMA 3 1080p ultra the
results here are pretty much very
similar with the GTX 970 slightly edging
out the GTX 780 but it's nothing to be
concerned about moving on to fire strike
and popular new-school popular benchmark
and the GTX 970
pretty much destroyed the net 780 in
this or in this actual benchmark all
surprised at how high this actual
graphics card scored and wait till you
see the overclocked score as well that's
not even more impressive so moving on
now did you know gene valley extreme HD
preset I basically put all the cards
that I've tested recently here so you
can have an idea of how they perform
especially at 1080p as you can see here
the GTX 780 actually beats the 970 in
this benchmark it actually beats it by
quite a bit so I was pretty surprised
here that the GTX 970 didn't do as well
as the GTX 780 however it still does a
lot better than 760 and also the 750 Ti
and the alanine 270 let's move on now to
power noise and temperature
so let's move on now some power
consumption figures for you guys this
was done I measured this with my
kilowatt meter and this was done with an
antic Earth Watts 650 watt bronze power
supply now as we can see here this was
done in UniGene valley extreme HD preset
you see here the GTX 970 uses up like
120 watts on average less than the 780
does which was really impressive in my
opinion I mean this is this is actually
a considerable amount of power and if
you live in a country like I do in Japan
where you're paying a lot for power
this can actually add up over time so if
you're a hardcore gamer who plays a lot
of games like literally eight hours a
day or whatnot then you may wish to
consider getting a maxwell GPU just for
that purpose alone however looking at
the idols there was really no difference
between them
I mean maybe we're 1.5 watt or something
like that it was really not much at all
let's move on now to the noise I want to
talk about the noise of both these cards
the 780 lightning that I had come
through very quiet extremely quiet
that was a try froze all the wind force
as well yeah I've got it in the
background now it is just extremely
quiet it's such a quiet graphics card
and actually I'm really close to my rig
at the moment closer than I've ever been
before in the past so the wind force and
the Tri froze are they're both amazing
coolers the wind force does an extremely
good job of cooling the card though this
is one of the lowest temp air coolers
I've ever seen in my life I mean I'm
going to show you when I overclock to
this graphics card this is a 24 degrees
ambient temperatures when I overclocked
the GTX 970 windforce Edition it only
got up to 64 degrees Celsius so I mean
this has so much more Headroom so in the
heat of summer I can still keep my
overclocks without having to worry about
my graphics card overheating so the wind
force cooler kudos to the updated wind
force cooler it is one amazing cooler
that just let makes literally no noise
and it also keeps the grabs card very
cool as well Wow so let's move on to
some overclocked numbers now how did
this card overclocked well it
overclocked extreme
well I was blown away this is a retail
sample as well I haven't been gifted a
golden sample from Nvidia or from any
vendor this was just me going to the
store picking up a retail sample and my
god this thing overclocked
insanely high it was it went up to I
think my core clock in MSI Afterburner
measured up to like fifteen hundred and
fifty megahertz and that was stable as
well so I was absolutely impressed with
the overclock I decided to throw in some
1440p benchmarks for you guys here so
here it is Crysis 3 ultra at 1440p as we
can see here the GTX 970 actually loses
at the out of the box settings however
when we overclocked the 970 it actually
beat the GTX 780 in Crysis 3 at 1440p so
we're starting to see a relation here
and that is that generally that the gtx
970 or the maxwell series as you go up
in resolutions they actually scale a lot
better than the kepler's did so you'll
see this with the GTX I start with the
battlefield 4 tests here as well we have
1440p ultra on the test range and again
it just it mean it took the ball and ran
away from the GTX 780 the GTX 780
overclocked couldn't even or just about
the same speeds as the GTX 970 one was
out of the box so Wow impressive
overclocking figures there I'm just
going to pull up the fire strike
benchmark a screenshot of it for you
this was the 970 overclocked it pulled
over 13,000 points on the GPU score
absolutely phenomenal I couldn't believe
that I mean people were showing me their
980 benchmark scores in fire strike and
I'm seeing my 970 do more than the GTX
980 for a card that literally in Japan
costs $300 less so in conclusion we'll
move on to the conclusion now and this
card is going to get some big bananas so
in conclusion I can't help but be
nothing but impressed with this graphics
card I mean it overclocked like the
clappers it was virtually noise free the
power consumption was a lot less than
the previous 7 Series card and also the
updated styling just was
I love this stalling it's sexy and it
looks really good so kudos to gigabyte
for getting it right with the wind force
this time around however that being said
let's look at something that concerns me
and that is the pricing currently in
America this card's recommended that
around about 329 retail with his model
in particular being around 369 USD in
Japan I paid about 470 USD and that's
what bothers me I think the recommended
retail pricing from Nvidia isn't flowing
through to the rest of the world
Australia the UK for example where we're
getting fleeced by the retails so I
wished in video would address that
pretty soon as I want to get the best
value for money however that being said
if you live in America and you can get
this for recommended retail pricing then
it is one insanely good buy I mean the
performance for the money is really good
you're also going to have cards that run
cool and use less power so there's just
this card in general is just such a win
at 330 or 300 $69 but if you get two of
them you'll just have insane performance
for the money also I think that the GTX
970 else absolutely surprised that it's
two hundred and twenty dollars cheaper
than the 980 and it's only like 20%
slower so that's just insanely good
value for money this reminds me of the
670 versus 680 all over again with this
this time around being that the six of
the 970 is the card to get even more so
than it was in the sixth series so that
being said if you like this review
please give it a thumbs up if you have
any questions about this graph is gone

subscribe to tech s city because I'm
going to have more videos coming about
the Maxwell architecture and some of the
technologies of this card features in
the very near future so stay tuned for
that
and peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
