released in the wild and so far around
the internet it has been receiving
pretty negative press and in some ways
rightfully so before we get on to this
review I will point out and have to get
it off my chest what the hell are you
doing Intel this is a one thousand
dollar flagship CPUs and you're putting
thermal paste between the IHS and the
day I mean come on it's like buying a
Ferrari and then getting the keys to it
and realizing the paint jobs all messed
up it's not right if you're going to
sell a premium product please make it
premium and or aspect and not skimp on
things like the thermal piece which
actually affects performance that
without a side let's get on with the
review and actually see what's good
about this CPU and how it performs in
gaming and also productivity welcome
back to check yes city this is brain
comity you guys today with a review of
this CPU right here the flagship 7900
axon before we get on to the results
which are kind of conflicting since they
do differ from others I will give a big
THANK YOU to asrock for sending out the
motherboard and CPU to do this review
and also another big thank you to steve
from hardware and box for sending over
an engineering sample to double check
and make sure it wasn't all in my head
when it comes to some of the problems
however you guys are looking for an
awesome X 299 board then asrock do have
a lot of different flavors available
they have the X 299 kilo they also have
the X 299 Tai Chi which I use
predominantly for these benchmarks we
also have the s 299 gaming o 9 which is
a really good motherboard so they have
all price points covered with
exceptional components on the vrm not
only that overclocking was a breeze on
this motherboard and everything worked
out really well even from the get-go
I'll put a link in the description below
where you can find out more so first
things first with skylake X it does have
a similar name to skylake but it
shouldn't be confused with Scarlett
which is also similar to cavi Lake which
is also similar to kV Lake X essentially
in way skylake X uses a different
architecture in the ways that the cause
communicate with each other on skylake
for example they use a ring bus which is
a ring around the outside of the cause
that allows the chords to communicate to
each other in a bi-directional manner
scaling X on the other hand uses what's
called the mesh architecture where there
are additional points and pieces of
communication to allow the course
through efficient
communicate with each other when there's
higher core count because on the ring
bus as the core counts grew until found
themselves with exponential power
increases for the efficiency of the
cores themselves so to counteract this
we now have what is known as skylake X
and AMD on the other hand they use what
they call the Infinity fabric to connect
up CCX modules so it's a little bit
complex but one thing to note with the
7900 X is it does have a reduced level
three cache size and it also has an
increased level two cache size which how
this would pan out in productivity and
gaming had everyone second-guessing ever
without further ado let's check out what
this flagship is capable
maybe
yeah
you
so the results are in and you guys are
probably wondering why some of my
benchmarks are differing to other
reviewers and I also had similar results
to other reviewers a few days ago it
wasn't until I went to finalize this
review today that I went to retest
things and I was shocked I was getting
some games that were getting extra 20%
in certain scenarios take for example
Far Cry primal when I initially tested
this a couple of days ago I was getting
around 94 95 FPS on average out of the
box then I retested it today and I'm
getting over 110 fps incredible and
substantial increase in numbers also I
had conflicting results before I did
today's revisit on the benchmarks I was
getting some benchmarks that were
beating to 7700 K but then some that
we're losing quite substantially even
though now the 7900 X does still trade
blows of the 7700 K is more as expected
with the processor that carries the same
I pcs at 7700 K and also clocks to
similar levels so delving further into
the productivity benchmarks reveals that
these 70 900 X is one mammoth of a
workhorse if you guys saw those Adobe
Premiere Pro final render times this
thing beats everything and when you
overclock it you actually extract even
more performance every other benchmark I
did the 7-zip the excel also the pros
own it's mixed down all this was beating
the competition however that's as
expected with a flagship product and
then when we contrast that with games
you now have a CPU that essentially can
do it all I know people are thinking oh
I want to get a Productivity more cause
more threads or should I have to go as a
gaming CPU that can't do productivity as
well as other CPUs with the 7900 X
there's pretty much no compromise and
even in certain games it was actually
beating the 7700 K with my 1080 Ti
I was really shocked to see this in
certain games we take for instance f1
2016 that was actually utilizing all 20
threads I was really shocked to see this
result and that resulted in a lot better
benchmark numbers in terms of average
and minimum fps so the kicker for me was
the streaming benchmark this thing
performed exceptionally well when it
came to using xsplit at a 5 megabits per
second output at 1080p 60fps
it dropped literally nothing off those
FPS numbers when you compare that to the
rise and 7 1700 which only dropped a
little bit and also when you compare
that
7700 K although it does have more cause
and more threads to thank for that
I also believe the ability to use quad
channel memory also helps to 7900 X a
great deal so basically if you're a guy
that wants to do it all the 7900 X is
indeed doing it all however there are
some caveats to this product and that is
first of all the thermal paste on the
die connecting to the IHS I did test
this with two different CPUs so the one
that I got sent I deleted that
straightaway and in hindsight I probably
should have tested the temperatures
before and after on the exact same CPU
so I thought I had two CPUs I thought
that performs similar but they actually
didn't though we're using different
wattages at the same voltage at the same
clock speeds and it could dip it by
actually quite a lot one CPU was drawing
around 160 something watts then the
other CPU was going closer to 200 watts
so I actually had to counteract this and
down the voltage a little bit on one to
match off the Watts and when I did this
the temperature difference wasn't so big
I was getting around a three degree
difference between a deleted CPU and a
lidded C for you however there was one
thing and that was the delay the CPU was
using more watts so it should be putting
out more heat essentially and this was a
problem it means that the littered CPU
with the cheap thermal piece is
performing worser than a deal in CPU
with liquid metal on it and this really
isn't a good thing for the consumer
who's spending a thousand dollars and
wants the best performance not only in
the numbers that are putting out on the
screen but also in the product itself I
believe it until soldered this thing to
the heatsink to the die don't have a lot
less complaints at least from me anyway
there now it's time to talk about the
power consumption which around the
internet everyone's saying this thing is
a heater it'll serve you well in winter
and it certainly can if you overclock it
high enough I found for a 10 quart 20
threaded processor at 4.6 gigahertz this
thing was burning over 200 watts however
you have to keep in mind that it's the
only 10 core 20 threaded processor that
goes to 4.6 gigahertz when we look at
even the 8.16 threaded processors out
there any of those can't go as high as
this which has two more cores and for
more threads and furthermore if we look
at the out-of-the-box settings which is
4 gigahertz which is really high per
tank or 20 threads that performs at
around 140 watts power usage in i-264
so as
actually not too surprised with the
power consumption figures they weren't
abysmal world-ending
in actually a ways I've got respect for
skylake X because until have essentially
pulled off the safety breaks and allow
the CPU architecture to go sky-high at
the result of being very hot on both of
the RM and the CPU and that essentially
is the option for enthusiasts who want
to overclock this thing as high as they
can get it and if they have extra money
for custom water cooling or not both the
CPU but also the vrm then this will
allow them to get really high figures so
most people out there I'd recommend
getting the CPU getting an all-in-one
getting a $230 X $2.99 motherboard and
then just calling it a day at around
four point four gigahertz or even four
point three or four point two however
above 4.4 gigahertz this thing does get
extremely hot in both cases of the
lidded and the deleted CPU I was getting
around a hundred degrees Celsius and it
was actually starting to throttle after
a little while in I 264 after a good 20
minutes however with that said I was
still able to get the benchmarks done a
4.6 gigahertz so even in the real world
the gaming figures in the benchmarks I
don't believe you'll ever get to 100
degrees but it's still good to know that
this CPU does get really hot and you
will need really good cooling to keep it
under control so the next improbably the
last thing to talk about with x2 9 9 is
the raid keys which I don't agree with I
think Intel if someone's paying a lot of
money for a motherboard next to an
unknown chipset you should just give
them all the options for free however
it's not as bad as people think and with
the raid keys if you have thought a
three for example it doesn't even
pertain to that so for instance if I
want to use my raid 0 raid 1 raid 5 over
my side of 3 which is what I use it for
I'd have to pay and tell anything I just
have to buy next $2.99 motherboard but
what it does relate to is the adding
cards for nvme drives if you have some
of these and you want to essentially
network them and raid one or raid 5
array 10 then you do have to pay Intel
for a license key however raid 0 should
still work with the adding card I
believe MDOT 2's that are added into the
motherboard itself still are able to be
rated at perfectly fine without paying
any additional money so now it's
conclusion time and who is the
7900 x4 what well I think it's actually
for everybody but providing you can
afford it it's a $1,000 CPU and firstly
the biggest thing that I hate about it
is the fact that it's got thermal paste
on it it should have been soldered from
the IHS to the die I think if they had
done that they would have copped
anywhere near the negativity that
they're getting now also those raid keys
that that is an extra feature that is
being introduced on x2 99 itself I think
z2 70 motherboards and also even
previous x2 99 or I mean x99 motherboard
don't support that feature however for
$1,000 it's nowhere near as efficient in
terms of price performance as the i7
7700 K for gaming and also the horizon
7700 for pretty much everything but what
it is is the best in slot in terms of
the CPU it is a flagship and it does
perform like so and also you will need
keep in mind expensive gear you will
need an X $2.99 motherboard which does
run higher than a z2 70 or an x3 70
motherboard and you will generally need
more expensive cooling 240mm radiator
would be a minimum in my opinion for one
of these if you wish to overclock if you
don't wish to overclock you will get
away with an air cooler and out of the
box it actually does run really well and
there actually is no need to deal it and
on the note of deleting I wouldn't
recommend it with such an expensive CPU
even though I did it myself
hey guys hope you enjoyed today's review
and if you did then be sure to hit that
like button this one took me a long time
I just spend days rechecking things just
like the Rison review and then making
sure it wasn't all in my head and then
double-checking things and then triple
checking things and what we have here is
the 7900 ex review but one thing as well
with the two different samples I was
really surprised
the 7900 ex retail sample is actually
different to the 7900 ex engineering
sample for the microcode and that
actually caused issues in the BIOS for
instance on the motherboard I had this
problem where the idle temperatures were
just spiking the BRM so hot and this was
in idle one was only using 50 watt
however when I changed over the engineer
example it didn't have this problem at
the same setting then I changed settings
around and there was a little different
happening but anyway guys I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
