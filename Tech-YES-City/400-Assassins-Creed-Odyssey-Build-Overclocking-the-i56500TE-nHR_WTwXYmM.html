these pieces that have come together
over the last few months and we're gonna
be putting them together and making one
epic assassin's creed Odyssey build and
this is probably the most interesting
part of the build right here this is the
i-5 6500 te now it's a low-power
consumption low TDP rated for core for
threaded i-5 on six gen but there is a
little bit of a trick here with the z170
pro gaming motherboard we can put in a
custom BIOS and that will enable
overclocking on this four core so we're
gonna see how well once we overclock the
CPU the game can run on it we've also
got this right here that we picked up
for a real good price this is the
sapphire nitro rx 580 we've got this for
230 Aussie dollars it's pretty much one
of the best rx 580 as you can get but it
also looks the best in my opinion
- really wicked looking card then going
through storage we've got our typical
SSD and hard drive for backup and then
we've got a cooler here that was just
sort of thrown in with the mix when I
got this motherboard and we've also got
this ddr4 memory that we pulled out of
the build that I recently got on the
channel with the 5820k I'll put the link
up here if you guys want to check out
that deals hunt then we got the 700 watt
and Jack power supply that someone threw
in for free when I bought a heap of pcs
off them apparently it's got a noisy fan
so that should be pretty easy to replace
we'll be pulling that apart seeing what
we can do with that and then down here
we've got a CM storm case this thing is
pretty dirty it needs some check yes
loving but after we're done cleaning
this all up it should be looking like a
race car ready to ride some horses
so we did pass the PALS play and there
was a bit of noise coming out of it I
just wasn't sure if it was the fan or
not so I quickly cut off the fan and
we're gonna test it one more time now
and see if it is indeed the actual power
supply making the noise and it actually
is now something like this is pretty
dangerous too the easiest way to
completely power it off is just turn it
off at the switch and then let this
motherboard here drain all the power out
as you see here the power is going
through the motherboard so let that
drain out completely and then there
should be no charge left in the power
supply but we can pretty much chuck this
in the bin because yeah it works which
is really strange I've never seen this
before a power supply will make some
really weird noise but actually still
works absolutely fine
that's a shame because the cooler as
well the other cool we had didn't fit
either so we're using this knock Shore
cooler I've had sitting around here for
a long time and so things like this do
add cost to the build
unfortunately because now we're gonna
have to use another power supply and
we're using another cooler already but
these are the problems you do come into
when you are building used PCs
unfortunately and this is all I've got
on hand at the moment I got this on an
eBay sale for 40 ozzie dollars never
heard of the brand before game max but
hopefully it doesn't blow up so let's
give it a shot
last night we're trying to overclock
this thing a lot and we got max a big
clock on the motherboard at 180 it seems
to be topping out there and I just want
to go any higher and that's about four
point one four gigahertz unfortunately
I'd like to go higher I know the CPU
definitely can do it but I think the
motherboards holding it back if you guys
remember like back in the H 55 P 55 and
X 58 era the motherboards B clock can
become a limiting factor and I think
that's what's become of this sort of CPU
and motherboard combo here so not to
impress with this overclock we will try
some different memory just to rule out
the ddr4 that's currently in there
and here we are now after playing those
games we're at conclusion time and this
PC ended up now costing me about five
hundred and seventy ozzie dollars or if
here in the US about four hundred US
dollars as we've gone through we had to
change the power supply because it was
literally letting off some weird
crackling noise and that wasn't the fan
either so I've never seen that before
and then we had the cooler we had to
change that over because it just didn't
fit and along the way we came in to some
different problems like the CPU not
being able to get as high as I'd liked
it to so we ended up settling for four
point one four gigahertz even trying
some different memory out didn't help
that so we stuck with the original ddr4
Corsair memory got that 226 66 megahertz
and at these speeds it did a phenomenal
job of playing games with the RX 580 at
first I thought was an RX 570 does cuz I
just had the initial windows installed
drivers that get pre-installed from
Windows Update on that rig and then we
updated the drivers and it was funny
because I was playing Assassin's Creed
Odyssey and the first I was like these
this FPS numbers are way too low and I'm
seeing an RX 570 pop up and I'm like
damn did I get hosed with this graphics
card and I thought no way and then
updated the drivers in the performance
literally doubled in this game just by a
driver update so that was impressive I
then had my rx 580 becoming unlocked
from the driver update which again I've
never seen that before either pretty
weird and then speaking of Assassin's
Creed Odyssey itself it played really
nicely on low and high settings low
settings seemed to stress out the CPU a
little bit more and match it sort of a
hundred percent to a hundred percent
with the rx 580 and we did overclock the
RX five eight and got some decent
overclocks out of that too we go to
fourteen hundred and thirty megahertz
and then the memory went up to 2250
megahertz which is quite pumped and then
going back into Odyssey and changing it
to high settings the GPU was again
sitting at 100% and the CPU was being a
little bit less utilized so the results
were pretty similar though I mean
graphically this game looks really nice
at high settings but low settings you
get a little bit more FPS but I'd
honestly just stick it at high settings
for this title and it did honestly have
lot less stuttering I actually didn't
notice any visible stuttering at all
playing
the normal game mode as opposed to the
previous Assassin's Creed origin which
I've played and that had some real
noticeable hiccups and stuttering so
they've definitely improved it compared
to the previous installment now we
decided to boot up this new game called
Ring of a sea Liam and it was
free-to-play and it was surprisingly
really fun it's like a mix between
fortnight and also pub G except they've
got sort of both things right from the
get-go the game is really well optimised
and it's also a lot of fun it sort of
takes both elements and it has that more
realistic look that I honestly do prefer
with pub G over for tonight's cartoon
style graphics and the good news is it
plays really well so optimize both on
the CPU utilizing near 100% on those
four cores a lot of the time and then
the graphics card as well at 100% at
1080p was being utilized too so it does
seem like it's a little bit hungry for
GPU power but once you stop it down to
low settings you'll still get a really
good look and a really enjoyable
experience but do stay tuned I will be
doing a cheap potato for this PC title
in particular since it is free to play
I'm sure a lot of you guys out there
will want to see what's the cheapest we
could do this title for because I do see
this game ring of a cilium taking off
and being the next sort of pub G &amp;amp;
fortnight in my opinion it's looking
really nice and honestly it's actually a
lot of fun I do from my first get-go
prefer it over pub G in both fortnight
and I played a lot of pub G as well so
that's saying some this title is
actually pretty cool but as you guys
know sometimes I don't get things 100%
all the time I usually come into little
problems sometimes I come into big
problems and this bill just had these
problems that just popped up all the way
through the build is again the biggest
thing that disappointed me was probably
those overclocks not going anywhere near
what I wanted them to go to I would have
been happy with around 4.6 gigahertz
which I know these CPUs especially the
four cores are capable of doing but
since it had such a low multiplier being
the 6500 te it just wouldn't go any
higher than 4.1 4 gigahertz putting the
onus back on the motherboard the docks
were cooler I'll probably change that
over for something like a $10 cool
that's a lot cheaper since it's now not
putting out really
any heat at all and also that problem
with the power supply I mean what was
going on there it was making some weird
clicking noise and that wasn't the fan
either we cut the fan off and that is
really dangerous that could like
seriously I don't know I've never seen a
power noise like that before that's
still booted up the PC so I think it's
something crazy waiting to happen but
with all that aside everything ended up
working out in the end if you're gonna
do the z170 overclock the non k
overclock i'd recommend going for
something with a higher multiplier for
starters but when all said and done this
is a PC that not only has good price
performance still it does perform really
well with that rx 580 doing a great job
it also it looks pretty decent I am
digging that front LED found the red fan
on this build plus the case was a breeze
to build in and I mean we did come into
some problems but that's what happens
sometimes when you build and use pcs but
in the end we still have a PC that plays
games really well and it still has
pretty decent price performance not the
best price performance that I'm used to
providing you guys but nonetheless it
does get up and go and that rx 580 does
look really good and it does perform
really well too but one thing to keep in
mind with the Z 117 on K overclocked
something that's important to mention is
you may come into some problems with the
temperatures sitting at a hundred
degrees even though they're nowhere near
a hundred degrees and so that's
something to keep in mind also the SI
states don't work properly some of those
notes that they said in that custom bias
update will apply depending on the
motherboard you use and of course I
would recommend going with something
with a higher multiplier so probably not
going with these t or te CPU skews
unless you get a good motherboard that
you know goes really high on the B clock
and that's about it for today's budget
build if you guys enjoyed this one - be
sure to hit that like button and let us
know in the comment section below have
you either tried the new ring of the
ceiling or the Assassin's Creed Odyssey
or if you played both would love to hear
your thoughts and opinions on these
titles and as always I'll catch you in
the next one peace out for now
bite and also I deleted the CPU and I
really didn't need to delete it because
yeah 4.1 4 gigahertz such a letdown
