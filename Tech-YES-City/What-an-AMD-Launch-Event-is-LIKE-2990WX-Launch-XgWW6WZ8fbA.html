Maranello and we're near the Ferrari
factory however you may have seen that
video before about the Ferrari and it
being sponsored by AMD but now the real
news comes to light I was here for the
thread Ripper launch and it was
incredible because AMD are bringing
something massive to the table and that
is 32 cores 64 threads and they're
bringing it at $17.99 USD and that's
dropping August the 13th - stay tuned
for the review but they're also
releasing with that another three
different models and that is the 29 70 X
with its 24 cores 48 threads that's
coming in at $12.99 and they're also
releasing the 29 50 X and 29 20 X with
their 16 cores and 12 cores respectively
and they're essentially updates of the
previous first gen thread Ripper CPUs
now you do get the 12 nanometer +
architecture upgrades like you did over
the 2700 x1 now released over the first
gen and also the good thing around is
this time as well is you've got that
backwards compatibility with those
motherboards so if you've gone out and
bought an X 399 motherboard then the
great news is you can just reuse that
board and even if you bought one brand
new one off from previous stock and you
got it at a good price for example then
you can use a USB key without a CPU in
there and BIOS flash it to support the
new second generation rise and thread
Ripper CPUs but only do you get that
really competitive pricing in the
massive amount of PCIe lanes and even
the lower latency is compared to the
first gen thread Ripper
you also get now an introduction of some
new products for instance the raised
Ripper cooler which can handle up to 250
Watts TDP which is the out-of-the-box
TDP settings for both the 24 core and
the 32 core weather all the attention
seems to be focused with this launch
however let's go inside the event and
see what they're doing with these CPUs
because I heard there is some extreme
overclocking so we'll take a look at
some figures and see what comes out of
this especially with the new rise and
master software where you can get the
best out of both single and all core
performance
so now we're inside the event and the
first demo I had got drawn to his Adobe
dimension CC and essentially does all
the ray-tracing and this really
showcases the power of the 32 course
read Ripper CBU you hit that render
button and it'll essentially separate
all the different objects into easy
Photoshop exports so they can then trace
it by layout and you see all those
caused genes just being utilized near a
hundred percent this really just
finishes the job off in like a minute
and seven seconds and it's really a
matter of when the software supports the
32 or 64 thread process that's when you
get the most benefit out of something
like the twenty nine ninety WX CPU so
next up here we've got Maya and here's a
clear demo of how powerful the twenty
nine ninety WX can be for people in this
profession we've got the plug-in here
with Arnold render view and it's
rendering it out real-time way if you
want to get a shot on how the final
price is going to look how the lights
going to bounce off objects and certain
final ray tracing segments of this
initial sketch here you can do that and
save a lot of time so it's really
incredible when these thirty two calls
get pegged how just just really how raw
and how much power you have at your
disposal which is I think in the right
situation as we looked at before with
Adobe dimension CC really showcases the
power of this CPU and you see right here
in live time just those cores being
pegged at a hundred percent and then
it's actually finalizing this image in
our Arnold render view which is a
plug-in for Maya to know who you have
the radio on / render demo and they're
showing a Ferrari being rendered in real
time now this is a balance between the
CPU and the GPU and again the 32 for 64
threads are being pegged at a hundred
percent and these pink squares here
essentially show that that's the portion
of the CPUs rendering while the portion
that you can't see is actually being
rendered by the GPU so they're working
handed
and to get this image rendered out very
powerful software essentially for 3d
modeling and getting a final look what
something would look like realistically
in the real world so of course a massive
part of X 3 9 9 is the motherboards in a
Zeus are offering an upgrade kit if
you've already got a zenith extreme you
can then get the fan for the vrm cooling
but there are some new models as well
coming out from MSI and gigabyte refresh
models with essentially massive massive
VRMs beefed-up beyond that of the leaf
so if you're into overclocking you maybe
we should take a look at one of those
boards but of course the standard X 399
boards we talked about before all you
have to do is drop a BIOS update and you
should be good to go especially for
achieving a sweet spot overclock on the
2990 WX CPUs and with the introduction
of tr4 sockets we have cooling solutions
and here we have the Wraiths Ripper
cooler coming in around $100 I'm not
certain on the price just yet
but it will handle the 2990 WX out of
the box absolutely fine
even with precision overdrive which is a
new feature that they're bringing on
their CPUs basically automatic
overclocking however you will void your
warranty on the CPU if you decide to
utilize that feature but this thing can
definitely handle it Kumasi are also
releasing a.m. a 6 to 1 P as well as a
360 Mill tr4 Edition cooler with a
bigger base plate that will fully cover
these new thread Ripper CPUs Animax have
previously done it Corsair haven't quite
catching on to the trend even though
they do have support for the tr4 socket
they haven't quite caught on with that
massive cooler into passing all of the
CPU area so now on the table here we've
got the 2990 WX on ln2 and we're going
of course the sky high scores in
Cinebench what i've seen so far is 4.9
gigahertz on all 32 cores and that
managed to score a cinnamon score over
7000 100 points I did manage to get that
on camera before this crashed out and
also another thing about these CPUs is
that they are utilizing the top 5% of
dies and putting them in the thread
Ripper CPUs so in other words they will
be the best of the best in terms of
efficiency which means you can get
higher speeds or
in comparison to the 2700 X you can come
close to those eight core speeds without
compromising too much and that about
wraps up the thread Ripper second
generation unboxing and event here hope
you guys enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
but also there may be some questions of
what's the difference now between epic
and thread ripping 2nd generation since
you now have the 32 core on the stack
and there's the 8 channel memory on the
epic versus the quad channel on the
thread Ripper second generation CPUs
also epic does scale you can have more
than just one CPU connecting to each
other so you can have up to 64 cores or
more if you have two epic CPUs on a
workstation motherboard for example or a
server grade motherboard as opposed to
the X 3 9 9 which can only support up to
one seat to you now a big reason for
upgrading from the previous thread
Ripper CPUs which 16 core is that at for
instance admirer or other programs when
you've got a single license it's only
for one CPU so upgrading that CPU you're
extracting a lot more value as we saw
here today on some of those demos where
they were utilizing all those cores and
all those threads so it's just really
cool event here today saw some
performance saw some overclocking hope
you guys enjoyed this one and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye and definitely
handle it
there's also the 360 low radiators and
water coolers that we've seen come out
of the inside the event and see what
they're doing with these CPUs because I
heard there is some extreme overclocking
so we'll take a look at some figures and
see what comes out of this especially
with the new rising master software
where you can control the best out of
the both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
