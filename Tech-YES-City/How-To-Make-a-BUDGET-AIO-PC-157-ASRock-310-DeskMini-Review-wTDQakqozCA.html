mini 300 series this is an upgrade over
the 110 series in that it now supports
eighth and ninth Gen Intel CPUs on top
of the already sixth and seventh gen
CPUs so you got a lot of flexibility
with this unit and you've got two slots
of ddr4 sodium memory support today
we're going to be adding in two four
gigabyte sticks as well as an i-5
9400 since this does support cpus up to
65 watt TDP so you can put the 8400 and
the 9400 inside with the stock intel
cooler you should be ok you can also put
an 8700 in but it will be slightly
throttled at the 65 watt TDP limit on
top of that you've got MDOT to support
and asrock have thrown in to solder
cables as well so if you wish to put a
solder SSD inside you can still do that
too and the best thing is you've got a
VESA mounting support kit which right
here today we're going to be mounting
this unit on the back of a monitor so
with this unit you can say goodbye to
those all-in-one PCs that have all those
proprietary parts put this on the back
of a monitor and if something goes wrong
or you wish to upgrade a particular
component then you can do that with ease
with this unit and now the best thing
about this unit is it's currently coming
in at 157 US dollars on Newegg right now
in terms of Aussie pricing I'll update
the description below I don't think it's
quite hit the Australian retail channels
yet before this price you get the case
the motherboard as well as the power
adapter the two SATA cables USB two
front extension as well as a decom
support and you also get the dual band
MDOT two Wi-Fi kit included as well and
also a vase amount but I'm not sure if
the vase amount comes included with the
157 dollar price tag I think you guys
spend like an extra eight bucks to get
it but of course it's an optional extra
I'm pretty sure not everyone's gonna be
mounting their desk minis to the back of
some budget monitor like I'm gonna do
here today and now the unit self comes
in just under 900 grams but if you want
to add in a cpu m2 and a cooler and some
RAM it'll come at just under 1.2
kilograms dimensions is 154 mil by a
hundred and fifty five millimeters by
eighty millimeters in depth so it's a
very small unit smaller than my hand and
very lightweight but though outside
let's quickly feed the bird
outside on my back porch they're making
some noise then we'll get on to building
this thing testing it out in some easy
to play games like apex legends at 720p
and then also see if we can run 4k
Netflix since it does have DisplayPort
1.2 HDMI 1.4 VGA and 2 USB ports one
gigabit per second Nick none of the
front you get USB type-c
and an extra USB 3.1
and so there it is old mounted and ready
to go we picked this monitor up of
course off a used deal in the used part
son of the month I'll put the link up
here if you haven't seen it ready 50
Aussie dollars and it's about like
30-something USD so absolutely dirt
cheap to pick one of these monitors up
and since this box is pretty small and
pretty cheap you can get yourself like
an all-in-one solution like this for
next to nothing but that aside let's
install everything and boot this thing
up
so now we're finished up over 10 minutes
of stress testing everything is
installed on this PC and the temperature
tests are looking really good hasn't
even hit 80 degrees and that's
considering the Fant is just on silent
mode still I just let you guys quickly
try and listen to it yeah like that's
how quiet it is it's still whisper quiet
and the funny thing about the i-5 9400
is six cores but they're going at 3.9
gigahertz and they're only using up 46
watts
so this CPUs even more refined than the
8400 at least from what I'm seeing here
on the desk Mini now I also got the FLIR
one temperature IR sensor out and that's
showing that the vrm is getting to about
86 degrees and everything else is well
controlled I mean with 45 watts being
dumped in the case it's not that big of
a deal you probably hold your hand up to
45 watts and not get burnt weight you
probably would get burn on 45 watts
don't don't take my word for that so now
in the blast for this h3 10 STX
motherboard and it's got the option to
up the ddr4 memory speeds to 2600 CC's
megahertz there is however no CPU
control at least with the i5 9400 and
another thing about the i5 9400 is I
couldn't install the latest VGA drivers
so I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to
play apex legends but we'll find out
anyway in terms of the USB speeds I
tested them out they work perfectly fine
with a fast transfer of my kingston
external drive and also the internet
speeds are very smooth on the NIC and
both the wireless and work in terms of
the asrock boss that sells got good
details got good features just like
you'd expect out of a typical asrock
boss got the hardware monitor ability to
update your boss via an internet
connection and in this case we're able
to tune our memory speeds so we're gonna
try and set them to 2666
and lastly the biggest differences
between the desk Mini 300 series versus
the 100 series is the ability to go up
to that 2600 66 megahertz up from two
thousand four hundred megahertz but also
the MDOT two now supports solder as well
as nvme PCIe and the original 100 series
it only support a PCIe modules and they
are a little bit more expensive or
tend to be more expensive than the
saddle modules I'm using a 500 you buy
that I bought brand-new and I got that
for around 70 US dollars so it's
ridiculously cheap and then of course
you have the eighth and ninth gen CPUs
but in this case this 9400 is just
sipping power so we're gonna see how
well it does in dota 2 hopefully it
plays apex legends the no I'm doing real
so we like this just feels we're not in
slaughter party
so that's my first time using a trackpad
while trying to play games and I'm just
gonna say it's gonna be my last time as
well this dota 2 itself the performance
was actually better since the last time
I've used onboard HD graphics I tried it
I think like a couple of years ago and
now on dota 2 we can play 1080p lowest
settings but at a hundred percent screen
resolution getting around eighty average
FPS and the point one percent one
percent lows are actually decent to
coming around 50 and then the lowest I
saw was thirty so very smooth experience
for dota 2 and the good thing about the
i-5 9400 is that all the cores are
running a 3.9 gigahertz I believe that's
up from the i-5 8400 3.8 to
and beyond that 20fps II feel
so unfortunately apex legends did
terrible the lowest possible settings at
720p everything just dropped we're
getting around 30 average FPS so you'd
have to be desperate to play this game
on these HD graphics to play Apex
legends of course it is playable it's
just you know it's a terrible experience
but the 17.1% lawyers were still decent
in comparison to the 30fps number where
we saw him drop down to like 17 and 12
so there's that and on top of that we
also tested Cinebench 942 points pretty
impressive considering we were using so
dim memory I managed to clock that up to
2600 66 which was pretty good and then
the power consumption as well from the
water meter while we're doing a fire
strike and bind test was about 50 watts
and then the idle power consumption on
the desktop in high performance mode was
about 25 watts - and then the last thing
was the fire strike test where the
physics score went over 12,000 points so
that's a pretty good score considering
we're using 45 watts with the CPU and
then the GPU score was really bad coming
just over 1,100 points especially in a
nutshell with the CPU performance it's
really good GPU performance is
lackluster
but we're gonna see if that GPU
performance right now is able to run 4k
Netflix smoothly reveal new one wise
Thomas
and I let his really costly
so 4k Netflix I actually didn't get a
proper test I think it wasn't in 4k cuz
Australian internet it is that bad but
the 4k YouTube demo was very smooth its
4k 30 Hertz because it's not hdmi 2.0 so
it takes you my 1.4 but I mean human I
can't see more than 30 Hertz anyway so
doesn't matter but ultimately Tom's
Hardware had it right with the wording
just by it but they unfortunately had it
on the wrong product this here at 157
dollars is a really good buy if you're
looking for a small form-factor case I
mean I was just so impressed with it
because of the low power consumption I
mean the onboard HD graphics is
obviously the Achilles heel in this
product but everything else is amazing
the size the fact that you can mount it
onto the back of a budget monitor and so
you can really make a budget office PC
or a budget desktop PC or a budget
anything really budget Netflix streaming
PC or in this case you could even set up
super nodes for whatever or a little
service so possibilities are endless
with this thing I love what they've done
in terms of making it even more budget
oriented in the fact that they've added
MDOT to sada and not just n dot two PCIe
nvme
the memory speeds also helped out a
little bit as we saw at those gaming
benchmarks some of the best numbers i've
seen out of the onboard HD graphics but
don't expect to play things like apex
legends you can definitely get away with
playing dota 2 bit of csgo and League of
Legends should be fine at 1080p and of
course small form-factor lightweight
makes this thing really good the
wireless connectivity included is really
strong too so I was getting full bars
throughout this whole studio and
sometimes on my other devices for
instance on my Intel nook I only get
three bars from right at the end of the
studio they're so included Wi-Fi is
pretty strong everything checks out on
this unit I'm very impressed with it hey
guys if you enjoyed this video to be
sure to hit that like button also let us
know in the comment section below what
you think of the desk mini me personally
I'd love to see an AMD solution
especially with what we saw here with
apex legends I think if we had like a
2,200 G in this thing for cause with
that better beefed up onboard graph
I think we could see some better numbers
playable on apex legends I'd love to see
that I'm gonna request Ezreal do one of
those because this form factor is
amazing also on that note as ralph did
send this out as a review sample and
they are a channel sponsor but if you've
seen my earlier content you know that
doesn't affect my opinion whatsoever and
with that said I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
