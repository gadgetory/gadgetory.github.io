brought to you by MSI and Corsair
bringing you the best in PC peripherals
and components click the link in the
description below to find out more about
current specials being offered by both
MSI and Corsair over the Computex period
welcome to the deep cool booth this is
Computex 2017 and this is the yes man
talking about the new cases and products
on display here in 2017 so we have here
the baron case liquid all-in-one this is
a essentially all-metal construction on
a case so you can get it in black or
white and it essentially is a smaller
case like micro ATX size yet it can
still fit in a HDX size motherboard and
with that you can choose to put the
power supply up the front of the case
instead of down the bottom and it also
comes included with an all-in-one 120
mil rad liquid cooler that is RG bed has
RGB lighting has RGB controls on the
case itself and with that is a option I
believe to have the cooler the actual
pump you can see the water being spun
through the front of the case so it's a
really cool looking case it's looking to
come in at 130 USD and be released in
July so now moving over to deep cools
coolers being offered in 2017 they have
a brand new design here with the gamax
GT this is coming in at 50 USD and it
has as you can see here RGB lighting
both on the fan and at the top of the
case now this can be controlled either
via the hardware or if you have things
like MSI's mystic lighting then you can
hook that up and then you can control
this via software instead of the
hardware so really cool cooler coming in
at 50 USD and it will be a m4 compatible
so you guys looking for a cooler with
the x3 70 motherboards you'll be able to
get one of these and put that on and
then also refreshing their captain XR
jeebies will now put in RGB lighting on
their captain x series and it can be
controlled either via hardware or
software and they've included an RGB
strip here just to show what the effect
will be like this will be coming in at
100 USD reach
for the 120 X or 130 USD for the 240 X
and these will be dropping I believe in
June 2017 so very soon to stay tuned for
that so now moving on to the next case
they have on display here's the old case
RGB everything's RGB these days and this
is no exception they've included an RGB
LED strip with this case and it's all
metal construction for 80 USD it's
actually a really nice case you've got
the enclosed power supply there at the
rear of the case you've got a lot of
room for cable management and they've
even included the option to add things
like this in without the extra
controller because there is already the
controller built into the case so that
is a Earle case and we're also looking
at a tempered glass side panel with it
too so now what we've got on display
here is the new arc 90 and this is one
secksy case I really like the look of it
it's got tempered glass on the front
side and top of this case you've also
got the reservoir kind of like the
genome had the reservoir at the front
but I think this is a much better
implementation it looks very clean very
sleek also has RGB lighting control
which you can change via the top of the
case so I can actually change the
pattern the color on the fly and there's
so much room to work inside you've got
EA TX support in this thing you've got
the enclosed power supply shroud there
and it's RGB lit inside - so cosmetics
on this thing is crazy and it also looks
really good there's no availability on
price yet but it does look like it will
be hitting the market in October so stay
tuned for this one as it is one big and
awesome case and then the last case on
display at the deep cool booth is the
quad still this will easily be their
flagship case and it's got four separate
compartments with each compartment being
dedicated to different components in one
probably had a motherboard section which
works up to e-atx which is really large
it's the largest model that you can get
then another component will house
graphics cards GPUs full-sized link I
mean the other component you can put in
your SSDs and hard drives and then
lastly is your power supply in the
fourth compartment this is all made of
still and tempered glass - and with that
it will be massively huge and very heavy
to carry and then the last product on
display from G cool and one of their
coolest products coming out is the MF
120 smart fans now you can control these
via smartphone not only the RGB lighting
itself but the actual speeds of the fans
they go from 500 rpm all the way up to
2200 rpm and seriously at these speeds
this thing is like near chopping your
fingers off it's very good airflow very
quiet and it's actually a jewel blade
fan design so really cool when you get
these things working they actually look
awesome kind of reminded me like
open-air subwoofers back in the day when
people were putting subwoofers in their
car cars looks really awesome I'm
digging this product not only in the
looks but also in the performance and
that wraps up our coverage of the deep
cool booth at 2017 I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and if you did make
sure to hit that like button if you have
any questions about the booth then be
