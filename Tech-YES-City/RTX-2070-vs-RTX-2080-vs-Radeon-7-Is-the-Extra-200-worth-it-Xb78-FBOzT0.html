finishing up with the r-tx
20 atti versus the gtx 980ti I even
threw in the RT X 2060 there and that
was from requests from you guys we've
also got requests for the 2070 versus
the 2080 and if you're in the market for
a new graphics card which of these
should you choose and I've also decided
to throw in the Radeon 7 to see how it
stacks up a few months after release
what I'm trying to say is let's just
roll the benchmarks
so the benchmarks are finished and what
a battle we had between these three
cards and also the twenty atti now we'll
kind of not talk about the twenty-eight
Ichi is that's comin well above these
price tags of these three cards and then
the 1080 TI is sort of only available on
the used market now if you can get a
1080 TI for a good price I always
recommend getting that especially if you
guys follow the channel and you know
what I do behind the scenes as well as
on the monthly deal hunts but what we
got here is three cards that are in
focus for me with these games that we
tested here in either 1440p or 4k ultra
settings and I got to say firstly that
the 2080 especially with the four one
nine drivers it's really come a long way
especially since when I first reviewed
it where we're sort of trading blows
with the 1080 Ti and I had three
gigabytes less VRAM and at that stage DL
SS and r-tx features we're in their
infant stages and weren't working
properly but fast forward to this date
and this card is definitely performing a
lot better to the point where we're kind
of split in the middle where if you want
the better performance over the twenty
seventy then you should definitely think
about the twenty eighty but at the same
time it's still $200 more and doesn't
really carry any extra features over the
twenty seventy except just simply more
performance in games you still got the
same a gigabytes of vram you still got
similar r-tx performance dl SS support
you are getting a beefier card that will
pull ahead in games so whether that
extra $200 is worth it for that extra
performance I'm not too sure I guess it
depends on what kind of build you're
gonna do but speaking of the 2070 as
I've said in the past even when it first
launched it was like my favorite card in
the stack because of its features and
also because of its position with its a
gigabytes of vram which is really good
for 1440p which is my favorite
resolution for PC gaming but now onto
this big silver card right here the
Radeon seven and that's also had some
driver updates of its own which has
enabled me to finally lock in some
stable overclock and the performance was
showing in games however the power
consumption was getting quite high when
we did start to overclock this thing but
ultimately it's got that 16 gigabytes of
HP m2 which although AMD has included it
with the Radeon 7/2 to lift the
performance
/ Vega where Vega was kind of starved in
terms of its memory speeds and when you
overclock the HBM memory you got some
big performance gains so with Radeon
seven that essentially alleviated any
bottlenecks that the memory speeds may
impose by simply stacking the memory
with HBM - and as you may or may not
know with HBM memory the more you stack
it the higher the bandwidth and memory
throughput you get burnin all comes down
to guys which should you choose between
the r-tx 2017-2018 just depends on your
budget
as for the Radeon seven me personally
I've saw some massive gains with the
four one nine driver to the point where
it feels like Nvidia is just lifted the
safety brakes off this thing and it's
performing well between a twenty atti
now and a twenty seventy as when I first
reviewed the 2070 I'm pretty sure the
2080 wasn't coming that far ahead
but now it is a sizable boost and with
that sizeable boost it is coming out
well ahead of the Radeon seven and doing
so whilst using less power and this card
here is also on seven nanometer so I
guess a lot of you guys out there just
like me are very curious to see what AMD
is gonna do with Navi in the meantime
this thing here does look nice but it is
performing a little bit behind do twenty
eighty and the 2070 is coming in at five
hundred bucks but ever guys I hope you
enjoyed this comparison today with the
head to head to head and if you did then
be sure to hit that like button let us
know in the comment section below though
which of these three cards would you
pick and why love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon and
also if you enjoy the content enough may
wish to consider hitting that sub button
bill notification and also if you want
to get that inside scoop before it even
gets to YouTube instagrams down there
tech yes City and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
