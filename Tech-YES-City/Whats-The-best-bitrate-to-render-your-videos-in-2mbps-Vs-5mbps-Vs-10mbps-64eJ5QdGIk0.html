between bit rates today I'm just gonna
show you the difference between two
megabits per second verse five verse 10
so let's have a look at two first this
is two megabits per second as you can
see the quality starts to get pretty
like blurry I guess so to the point
where you can't see minor details as you
go down obviously it just gets worse so
what you guys have a look down to so
YouTube does reduce ten to eight as well
so they've the max bitrate for YouTube
is eight megabits per second so that's 2
megabits let's have a look our next
competitor second competitor is 5
megabits per second so let's have a look
now so 5 as you can see 5 is a lot
better than 2 the details are getting
you know you can start to see details
and it's very watchable so you can read
all the text you know things are very
clear so I think 5 is a great compromise
between size and quality so they're guys
that's 5 megabits per second so
obviously when you're reading 2 videos
it gives you the choice of choosing
between different bit rates and so let's
have a look at our last competitor 10
megabits per second but YouTube does
reduce this to 8 guys so as you can see
it's it's the file size starts to get
pretty big but the details are very
crisp and you can see everything so this
is rendered using the h.264 engine
basically mp4 so level 5.1 so I mean
doesn't really make a difference for
point to an OPS good yeah and I stand no
difference and this does reduce the 30
frames per second guys so it's important
to remember that
those things do get reduced to say
frames so you guys it's up to you uh-huh
so yeah two megabits per second and
lower is generally for streaming you
know it's because it's live and the data
is so small fives a good balance guys
the size and quality and is very
watchable in my opinion and 10 is
obviously the best but the file sizes do
quite get quite large so you guys have
you any questions just leave them in the
comments below and of course don't
forget to subscribe peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
