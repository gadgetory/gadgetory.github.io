city this is Bahrain easy coming back to
you guys today with a review of the
Logitech c920 and in Japan ecology cool
but it's basically the successor to the
logitech c910 and the biggest difference
being obviously that it has the inbuilt
h.264 video encoder now this is a pretty
huge difference as its going to do the
encoding for you while you're recording
which is going to save you a lot of time
it can save you a lot of data and if
you're using capturing software like I
am it could save you a lot of potential
problems so very good I'm keen to
actually test it I haven't tested it I
just unboxed it so the box is actually
pretty small and compact you don't get a
CD you don't get any software with it
you just get a manual and a warranty
card and it has a two-year warranty now
it's yeah I like it that way personally
because any you know if there's no
software that's going to save costs is
going to bring costs down and yes I got
this for $65 so it's a very cheap unit
now I am upgrading from a Logitech I'll
show you this here the Logitech C 270 as
you can see this thing dominates it it's
a beast it Trump's all over it but this
was only thirteen dollars and this was
sixty-five dollars so it's almost five
times the price and yet basically you
should expect a lot better of a webcam
for five times the price so the problem
I had with this was that it was
overheating in my Camtasia Studio 8 and
that was causing video audio scent
problems and it was a real pain in the
ass cause I have to redo videos after
you know it just be absolute waste of
time sometimes I was making videos so
it's a really it's a real hassle and
hopefully this doesn't overheat because
this was overheating and it especially
does micro stuttering and that causes a
lot of problems now this only has a 1.5
meter cable to the Logitech C 270 and
this has a 2 meter cable I believe so
that's you get that extra 50 centimeters
which is going to come in handy and it
also comes with a tripod mount so I can
mount this to a tripod and get some
awesome recordings on a tripod which is
very handy so you gets a versatile
camera definitely well-suited for being
the king of the room it also has a
stereo microphone which I'll be testing
later
and it has full 1080p HD at 30 frames
per second it also apparently supports
720p at 60 frames per second and the
build quality of this thing already
feels good like it feels like a solid
web camera it also has a noise filter on
it too which is a great feature and
that's about it it just feels solid well
built it also has carl zeus lens so i
actually don't know how to pronounce
that probably maybe someone can let me
know but i've always said it carl cease
car loose kal zeus tessa so it's got
these lens sony's sony's always use them
on a lot of their camera lens so
apparently it's good lens but anyway
let's give it a quality test and you
guys can let me know what you think so I
just actually got this in between my
budget builds so my next my next few
budget bills are going to be a lot more
crystal clear so but to be honest the
logitech fluid crystal before we go into
the review this has the logitech fluid
crystal this has it to it basically
makes the videos the webcam capture a
lot more smoother so I have watched
Logitech webcam capture versus Microsoft
and I actually have a Microsoft webcam
of similar price to this C to 70 and the
C 270 just looks a lot more better like
looks a lot better than the Microsoft
offering so I'm keen to test this out
and see how it performs
anyway let's test it out now guys okay
this is a test on the Logitech c920 at
Full HD so 1080p and I think it is using
the h.264 encoder at the moment as you
can see the lens are just ridiculously
wide okay my C to 70 it only focused
like in a square here this thing is just
you can see in the door man that's crazy
you guys are seeing too much here but
this is obviously you can hear my birds
in the background I had to turn this mix
down to like 10 literally 10 percent
because the Nick on this so this is the
actual Nick at the moment as well and
it's ridiculous let me change to my
other microphone now sorry before we
move on I will test the audio from
Camtasia Studio 8 as campus
it has a much better audio recording
device will they use the PCM Kodak thing
so I'm recording at forty four point one
kilohertz at the moment and as you can
tell it's going to sound a lot better
than the Logitech software I always have
frickin audio problems with Logitech
webcam software so before I do the
condenser test which I'm going to do in
Camtasia Studio 8 I wanted you to hear
the audio from Camtasia Studio 8 and I
know it sounds a lot better because I
tested this like a few times in the past
so anyway let's get on to the condenser
microphone whew okay guys we are
recording now off the USB condenser
microphone and I think there is a
difference between the c920 stereo
microphone and this USB condenser
microphone I love this condenser
microphone so much now one thing I will
say is that logitech webcam software
their quick capture software it sucks
it's got this crappy audio codec in it
they should fix the codec and put in a
better PCM audio codec to record audio
because every time I record audio in
that program the video quality is
amazing but the audio just sucks it has
like this I don't know it just sounds
like it's not recording properly I don't
know what's going on there but yeah I'm
using Camtasia Studio 8 to record the
webcam at the moment and obviously the
quality is not going to be as good
because I can't record in 1080p raw and
I can't use the h.264 encoding in
Camtasia Studio 8 for some reason I
don't know what's going on there so yeah
I got to look into that and sort of fix
it all I might have to buy some faster
hard drives I don't know so anyway guys
in closing I will say that I do like
this webcam a lot for sixty-five dollars
it is an amazing webcam you obviously
over my to see 270 there is no
comparison the lens are wider on this
webcam so I was recording at the same
distances and I had to actually zoom in
like like the entry now to get the same
effect after zoom in like three notches
as opposed to see 270 where that was
just the normal setting zoomed all the
way out so the lens are a lot wider the
lens are a lot better the they have blue
lights on it to the c2 the c920 also has
these two little subtle blue lights that
let you know on the webcam is in use
which is really good I love that feature
it makes me know like well my webcam is
recording now cool and my webcams on I
can turn it off so it's really cool it's
also got the extended us
be cable which I ilove it's coming in
handy I'm not having any problems with
moving this around the whole room I can
also take advantage of using it on a
tripod without having any problems
so overall guys I recommend this webcam
if you can get it for like sixty-five
dollars which is what I got a fall
amazing bargain it just it's the video
quality is amazing I'm still going to
learn how to do a few things with it but
after I do that I'm sure I'll be the
master of the Logitech pro webcam so now
you're probably thinking why should I
get the Logitech over the Microsoft
LifeCam or the creative and the reason I
got it over those two is because I love
the fluid motion okay the logitech have
like this fluid motion and it actually I
can notice it if you look at other
webcams the live cam studio on the
creative they're not as fluid as the
Logitech and even my C 270 had nice
fluid video and so that's why I went
with the logitech again so yeah I mean
I'm and for a 12 dollar webcam I mean of
course it's going to overheat it's a
cheap web camera I can't expect it to
perform like a this webcam because this
webcam alleviated my problem when my own
webcam would overheat and up called
micro study video sync issues and it was
horrible I hated it having to redo a
video and all that but to fix that sorry
guys in closing I will say if you have
any comments please leave a come in the
comment section below and if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and I thought the video quality was
amazing but I got to tweak it and get it
to work in Camtasia Studio as well so
yeah and if you're a yes man or your yes
woman then subscribe to tech er city
where you can feel the power of yes as I
do every day I feel the power of yes it
flows through me and we guys peace out
for now brain easy bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
