coming back to you guys today
unfortunately with another unboxing and
quick review of the 990 FX a GD 65
motherboard from this is the name
three-plus motherboard from MSI now you
guys probably wanting didn't you have
the Zeus motherboard and it's funny yeah
I had these those motherboard and it was
dead on arrival so it's just here I'm
making a video about of Zeus quality and
I get a motherboard that was dead on
arrival anyway I got the motherboard I
connected everything to it RACI to the
cpu tried a different power supply
everything I could think of and it was
just it just wouldn't boot up like it
boot up and then this it would just be a
black screen so I took it back to him
and it was at that stage that they
admitted they're like oh someone else
returned this motherboard and I was like
what the hell why the hell didn't you
tell me that so the basically they sold
an open box product is a brand-new
product and all's man always live it
anyway so there's lots of cursing going
on but anyway they ended up giving me
this for a little bit cheaper than
retail because they were sorry and yeah
it's up and running I'm recording on it
now so anyway the problems fixed
everything's ready to go
I'm at four point four gigs on this baby
it's all running smoothly the Intel
benchmarks are all compiled everything's
done now the AMD benchmarks are
commencing so expect the results in the
next few days and also yeah let's get on
with the quick unboxing and review of
this baby I'll show you guys what's in
the box and also I'll talk about the
motherboard as well a little bit so
let's move on thing is it feels a little
bit heavier in the box so that's a good
thing that's probably because it comes
with one of these an X term apiece II I
sort of a PC a slot at the back it
doesn't actually take up a PCI slot but
it just takes up a rear slot in your
case and you can use it as a USB to so I
like that feature that's pretty cool you
get the backplate here which feels
pretty you know just a standard
backlight the Zeus one did feel a little
bit that I'm good not to I don't really
care too much about a backplate this one
here this is interesting it comes with
these pins a lot of them this is a
really good feature I like these pins as
I said in the azusa motherboard unboxing
I like these pins as they can take a lot
of hassle out of installing the little
pins sometimes so that's a good thing it
comes with the manual as you guys
we don't really care about the manual
too much and we've got some side of
three cables here and you get the driver
discs as well so this is the MSI G and
you get a HDD backup guide and it looks
like an installation guide there quick
installation guide warranty card as well
and two more beside of three cables so
you get four SATA 3 cables with this
motherboard now let's get on to the
juicy part here this is the actual
motherboard itself now this motherboard
I think it's got similar features to the
Zeus motherboard in that it is basically
a 990 FX chip set with the 950
Southbridge I believe so will unbox this
little puppy here get the Box closed and
put it on top of the box so we get this
done here
and basically this is a MSI's version so
this is their sort of value for money
overclocking board on the 990 FX line so
it and honestly it looks really nice I
actually really like the look of the
motherboard itself it doesn't I think
the PCB doesn't doesn't feel as solid as
the ozu's counterpart but it definitely
you know for me if it does the job if if
it basically runs the FX 83 at 4.4 gigs
then I'm home and hosed because that's
all I wanted to do it's got heat sinks
here these actually these heat sinks
even though they look pretty plain they
actually feel really solid I like these
heat sinks there actually look they look
a little bit small but they look a
little bit plain but I actually really
like the look of them and they feel
really good it looks like we've got a
we're definitely I think it's like an 8
+ 2 Peter
so yeah 8 plus 2 phase power design on
this motherboard to your 8 phases for
the CPU two phases for the RAM and I
think that's twice as much as their 970
g43 which isn't really an overclocking
board but this one is an overclocking
board to a certain degree I don't think
it's gonna get the extreme overclocks
but it will be a good overclocking now
let's look at the features of this board
we've got four round slots here two dual
channel memory slots there so you can
have up to 32 gigabytes of memory in
this motherboard we have here three
starter 6 ports which is really good
they don't put on any as media or
anything like that they just straight up
normal sadhas normal 6 normal side of 3
ports that's all I need
I like Alamos I've cut out the crap I
like that the mother bought itself
though you'll notice there is a brown
tinge to this motherboard it does have a
brown tinge to it that is instead of it
being a pure black in this in this light
I can definitely see what people are
talking about it does look more Brown
than black so that is something about
this motherboard now honestly we do have
looks like we've got one two three four
five Shashi fan connectors on the
motherboard itself so you can have up to
five fans running and monitoring off
this motherboard as well looking here
we've got one two three four four PCI
one speed Express slots and we've got
two PCI 16 speed slots here which can
and you've also got a PCI standard PCI
slots and non Express down the bottom
that's pretty cool as well for those
people who want to use their old PCI
gear and also we've got USB USB 2
connectivity ports got a HD HD audio out
here we don't have a USB three I believe
so there's no USB 3 front panel support
on this motherboard however that's fine
we do but looks of it we do have a PCI
Express on the motherboard so that's a
power connection on the motherboard
there that's actually pretty cool for a
mid-range board I like that MSI have
included that there so you can I guess
you can give feed some extra power to
the motherboard more - more so - the
graphics card I believe so that's really
cool they're on board audio I think
we've got the real tech eight nine - on
board and we've also got the real tech
eight one one one e for the to the N I
see
we'll get onto that a bit later but
let's look at here this is the features
here this has got the two PCI one speeds
above the PCI Express 16 speed so this
is PCI 2 however some people don't like
it here personally I love having the PCI
1 speeds above the graphics card because
I sorted for me the graphics card is
blowing air from the bottom so if you've
got stuff under it it's gonna get in the
way also when you want to SLR your cards
and they're usually dual slot coolers
nowadays you generally can't fit
anything in between so for me I usually
put my PCI Express ni C in between my
heat sink fan and my graphics card and
it actually works out pretty well I like
it there but you can't really see it as
well they you
like a green PCB and they're ugly so for
me personally I like these two I like
the fact that's got to this you can put
an N IC and a sound card in there if you
want to so that's a pretty good feature
now let's look at the actual components
on the board this board itself it
actually I mean I'm sorry this time
around have done actually pretty good
job and I mean I'd liked the G 45 we got
that in the background there but it's
yeah I like the G 45 but also like my
MSI's motherboards lately I like to dip
I like what they've been doing with the
motherboards themselves will move around
to the front here and we can see here
that we've got the audio out here I
think it's 5.1 so it supports 5.1
surround sound we've also got a coax
audio out as well and we've also got a
clear CMOS button at the back - it's a
really good feature there we've got one
two three four five six seven eight USB
two slots on the rear and we've got two
USB three on the rear as well I've got
the one and I see there which is the
realtek I believe and you also got a ps2
slot as well as well as a coax audio out
so that's just that's usually standard
on a mid-range board nothing really
shines out there except the clear CMOS
button I love that as I will be
overclocking this board so that is a
benefit of this motherboard over there
zeus motherboard so kudos to msi for
concluding that let's turn around now to
the rear of the motherboard and just
show you guys what you get so now the
right mirror the motherboard is pretty
much just and it just your brown so that
you can really see that brown PCB look
there the actual motherboard itself does
feel not as good as these I mean I'm
will it meant it doesn't feel as good as
these loose but it's got everything I
need and it looks really plain and
simple and it's at a good price
performance ratio I think it's
considering the Zeus one that I got was
on sale and this one's just actually
retail at 135 dollars so I'm gonna get
this going and pretty much I am going to
be testing this against the Intel
finally hopefully this motherboard works
and it starts up the ozu's I just yeah
it really just I started up didn't work
I just like look I do not have time for
this literally so I tried a few
different things tried unplugging
everything just that but just the
graphics card CPU and tried a different
power supply didn't work try resetting
the CPU resetting the RAM did not work
so I just
now this one I'm going to change the
motherboard and give the MS I want to go
sorry I've got to MSI motherboards
around here I guess it's better if I do
a comparison with to MSI motherboards as
well for consistency purposes anyways I
hope you enjoyed this review suddenly I
guess this unboxing inspect detail and
more not really a review but more of a
boxing and spoke detail of the msi 990
FX AGD 65 and if you did like it please
give it a thumbs up if you have any
questions about this motherboard please
leave a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can and if you haven't ready
subscribe tickity I'll be getting these
reviews done and I'll be getting these
tests done really shortly
maybe eyes peas off a number any late</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
