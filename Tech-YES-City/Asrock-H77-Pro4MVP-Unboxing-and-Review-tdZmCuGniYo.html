look and review and unboxing of the
asrock h77 pro 4 / MVP motherboard let's
so this is the Box mean it's just it
looks nice
if I remember right it looks it looks
like an old school of zeus box that I
used to get so this specs on this is
it's a socket 1 1 5 5 so I bought it for
my eye 5 3 5 70 k that will be coming
soon and it's got a lot of features that
I liked pacifically why I bought this
board was the fact that it just had all
the features that I was looking for at
the right price so if we open the box
you can see it's got the CD which has
your drivers on it it's got your manual
a quick installation guide so it's all
there it's got some X 5 X who cares
about that virtue MVP don't really care
about all this fancy motherboard stuff
that they had on these little features I
don't know there's another little manual
because I'm living in Japan they give
you a little Japanese manual as well so
and they give you 2 SATA 3 data cables
which is gonna be perfect for me because
that's all I'm gonna need
I'm gonna be using this and just a
standard normal hard drive for backup so
yeah and then you cut your plate for
your case so after that so it's really
no frills and just unboxing it I'm
looking inside you can see that that's
how it comes it comes really well
packaged like you know even if this got
shaken around in post I doubt it would I
doubt it would break it all because it's
really well packaged like probably some
of the best packaging I've seen
for a motherboard and just open that up
so yeah if you open it you can see
there's there's just rap foam wrap all
around them all around the back as well
so it's not going to get damaged well
it's gonna be it's gonna take a lot to
damage it in post anyway so there it is
guys I'm not she just gonna have a look
at it now so you've got a Southbridge
heatsink there you've got your PCI 16 x
16 3.0 and that is obviously the latest
it's got the THX which is why this is
one reason why pacifically went for this
motherboard has real good sound card on
it and I love sound so it's got the
Northbridge heatsink here and it's got
four bus for plus two phase so now the
actual other Hardware on it it's got
down here it's got your solder side of
three and I started to sorry I believe
those three are sided to and that one is
a SATA 3 and then it's got two side of
three ports here they're gonna be my
main ports that I'm gonna use now an
important thing to remember about this
motherboard pacifically is that it's
meant for it's only meant for one video
card from what I read so it's only meant
to hold one video card and doesn't
bother me because that's all I want
because she the fact that I'm not really
keen on doing slide because of the power
and the money the extra money that's
gonna cost now I got this board for
about $90 so that's why I got it it's
really cheap board for the new i-5 and
it's got everything so it's got the look
here it's got six USB on the back and
obviously you can connect another thing
you can connect another one two three
four USB at the front
pretty sure maybe more anyway it's got
four round slots which can hold up to 32
gigabytes around and it's got
this is an interesting feature too so if
you've gotten if you're upgrading from
an LGA 775 board you can basically if
you've got a fancy cooler and you don't
have the mounts for the LGA one one four
five five you can use this motherboard
with those the white ones of the LGA 1 1
5 5 s but the black ones the little
holes next to it for the LGA 775 so
that's an interesting thing too so
you're gonna save money if you're gonna
bring your cooler over from LGA one
seven five which is pretty damn good in
my opinion it's good just a good little
extra value added feature so yeah and
yeah so basically it's got your onboard
video thing so I guess because it's
meant for the i-5 and the i7 that the
ivy bridge it's gonna have that support
the onboard graphics it's got the s/pdif
FL so I like that because I play with um
surround sound it's got a nice only got
one LAN port but that's not a biggie
because I think that's all I need
um it's it's got like I think that's
like it's got a HDMI out port as well
it's got one ps2 port it's got the other
two standard video modes and this looks
like I don't know what that is I think
it's just the USB slots but yeah it's
got USB slots there but there may be USB
three slots
yeah and that's um that's about it from
this board so it is a good board like it
the reason I got this board lastly is
because it's cheap it's got your little
heat sinks on it so I'll be able to do a
little overclock and it's got yeah it's
got your PC i3 is it USB three side of
three and it's got enough RAM slots for
future in the future ok guys if you've
got any questions about his motherboard
just leave your comments below and of
course subscribe to keep the Brian easy
go on so yeah overall looks really good
guys
looks kind of like they've taken a page
out of azusa's black all black on the
thing and it looks really nice yeah
alright guys peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
