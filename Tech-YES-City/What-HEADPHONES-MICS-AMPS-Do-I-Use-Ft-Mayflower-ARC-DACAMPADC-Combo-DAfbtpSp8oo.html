gear do I use so today I'm gonna detail
what headphones what speakers and also
what other gear I use and also for
today's video Mayflower electronics sent
over their arc which is a DAC amp and a
DC solution all packed into one little
box if you guys remember the Oh to
decamp solution this thing promises to
do exactly the same but also add in a
very cleaned mic port and i'll let you
guys take a quick listen to that
directly into the unit itself and of
course with that we'll get onto Peter
pepper versus Chucky
chuckles now Chucky was chucking
chocolate cakes with cherry mixed in and
Peter Piper was piping on his peppers
and packed into a pipe which he was
smoking at the same time he was eating
the cake that was thrown at him so
that's a big feat for Peter on paper
does boast some impressive figures even
beating that of the O to decamp solution
and after using it I will say that the
sound was extremely accurate the base is
full and doing a frequency response
curve you can see the numbers the
response curve is just perfectly flat
it's really good if you guys are looking
for a neutral sound there's also a DSP
button on the front which will boost the
bass which is good for open air bass
anemic headphones and also when we're
going into the crosstalk levels they're
really good on this unit so all the
numbers check out however something like
this and you're probably wondering well
I've got onboard audio and onboard audio
has come a long way especially in the
last few years though it's still not as
good as something like this and two
areas that I can identify where you
would want something like this over on
board audio even high-end onboard audio
would be that bass frequency roll-off
which does happen when you use cheaper
amplifiers this unit has a perfectly
flat frequency response really good if
you want to power your headphones
especially sub-base you'll feel it
coming through it does make the
experience a lot better on my Fidelio l
once this thing was pumping the bass
very detailed very full absolutely love
was coming out of this thing there the
second thing that you want to be careful
of especially if you're using onboard
audio is a frequency or an impedance
mismatch from the headphones to the
amplifier onboard Yasu
itself and what this means is if you're
using frequencies safe for instance in
the seven kilohertz range this is a very
common culprit you can get spikes that
go 10 decibels over what the frequency
response curves will actually read and
what this means over time is that your
ears can get severely damaged as 10
decibels is over 3 times the power at
that frequency as to what your ears
should be hearing and it's also for this
very reason that I do highly recommend
people use speakers the majority of the
time only use headphones if you have to
or if you just want to enjoy that
particular pair of headphones with that
DAC amp combo though getting back onto
topic with the Mayflower Arc this will
be replacing my ship Modi'in o 2 amp
solution it's one unit very compact
comes with a 5 volt DC charger which
will work all around the world you also
get a USB cable included they'll fir had
to critique one thing it would be those
cables I'd like to see it may be powered
off one cable if that's possible there
besides that it's a very sleek unit you
can carry it from build to build and get
cheaper motherboards as a result so you
don't have to worry about what onboard
audio solution they're putting on
motherboards you can just carry this
thing from build to build and have
exceptionally good audio now some last
things about this unit itself it does
come with an optical in so you can use
it with consoles ps4 Xbox one this thing
will do that clean audio both on output
and on input with your microphone RCA
outs to carry our audio mic out port to
carry out that mic out if you're into
streaming high and low gain outputs for
different powering needs and on the
front of the unit it's got the volume
knob which also doubles down as a power
button when you click it to the left
it'll power off click it to the right
you can then adjust your volume and
it'll turn the unit on there's also the
DSP button which stands for digital
signal processing and in this case we'll
change or add color to the sound in this
case it just adds a bass boost so it's
great for open-air bass anaemic
headphones for instance like the HD 595
s that I have here so now with all that
aside it is expensive it is two hundred
and fifty dollars though if you are into
using headphones and you do use
headphones a lot then something like
this is an easy recommendation
especially if you intend to use
headphones for a long time I can highly
recommend this thing clean audio out
clean audio in and of course it packs it
all into one unit very convenient and
the
is that it's boasting are very
impressive as well though what about the
other audio gear that I use well I
currently have four different headphones
here at the moment and a couple three of
those with a V mode of boom Pro to make
them essentially a headset
these are the v-moda crossfade LPS these
are great for editing videos they give
off a very neutral sound it's actually
quite boring for listening to music and
playing games I actually don't like it
for that I like it for studio work
editing videos great phenomenal
headphones actually very revealing as
well for a mid-fight can and then for an
end user experience this is a very
controversial headphone these are the
Fidelio L ones and I have noticed that
some people just hate these but some
people like myself absolutely love these
headphones the physical comfort is
amazing and also the sound comfort or
the balance of sound is so good on these
things the bass is a little bit
overpowering very detailed and then the
mids are there and then the treble fades
off a tad so this just makes for a very
good end listening experience that I can
just wear these things for hours and
hours and just enjoy the sound that's
coming out of them they are a semi-open
headphone too so they do have good 3d
imaging to the one that note I wouldn't
dare use them for video editing as they
are colored and if I did use them for
video editing you could see some really
imbalance sound coming out of my videos
for instance music would just be
overpowering all the voices would just
suddenly spike and kill your ears and I
don't want to do that to you guys so I
use my crossfade lp's but the last of
the headphones that i use are the
corsair void RGB pro's these are a
wireless solution so very convenient
when I need to use Wireless they have a
tinny mic onboard which isn't the best
but they do come in at a pretty good
price point and of course they do offer
a very decent sound especially for
competitive gamers looking for good
positioning I found these things were
very good when I was using them in csgo
and then on that note the last pair of
headphones that I have is the HD 595 s
from Sennheiser these are exceptional at
3d imaging which will allow you to
position people in games just like the
Corsair void pros do but these will do
them a little bit better in my opinion
especially coupled with a good DAC and
solution I absolutely love the sound
coming out of his head
for gaming competitively though they are
a bit bass anemic which is a result of
them being an open-air headphone so now
that we've got through that people are
probably wondering why don't you have
high-end headphones like for instance HD
eight hundreds from Sennheiser or Bayer
dynamic T ones well Asham they've passed
I've ordered both these headphones in
and tried them and return them after two
weeks in one week respectively I quite
simply thought that they were just too
revealing both sets of headphones were
incredible but they were too revealing
to the point where you could hear people
breathing
you could hear lips moving in songs it
just wasn't for me at the end of the day
I do appreciate a good mid fake hand
that's personally for me and when it
comes to audio it's a very subjective
thing and at the end of the day you guys
should let your ears through the
listening and choosing now what about
the speakers that I use where I'm
currently using the Sound Blaster X
katana which is a very good unit though
it is quite expensive you can get this
for around about $300 plus though on
that note it does offer very good 2.1
sound it does have very good base has
RGB lighting which probably raises the
price of the unit itself but it also has
a 32 bit DAC onboard I've tested this
thing in the past reviewed it and it
does put out some pretty good numbers
and now it's time to flip the output
switch and turn it into input and for
recording what microphones do I use well
currently I'm using the H and M sound
micro laughs I picked two of these up on
B&amp;amp;H photos for 70 US dollars now these
usually come in at around a hundred and
fifty dollars so they're a very
expensive lavalier microphone but the
benefit of something like this is that
they just have such a good sound without
me even changing the base or the treble
or the mids they just give a very good
sound straight out of the microphone
itself something that's easy on your is
something that's really good for me to
edit as well so something like this is a
really solid microphone and it comes
from an independent brand rather than
Audio Technica Sony and Sennheiser and
stuff like that so very good price
performance for what it is I actually
got a second one for when I'm going to
do interviews in the future but what
about other condenser microphone and if
you guys have been on twitch TV and
watched streamers you'll probably see
that all these guys are using these big
microphones and they sound very good
they're very rich though they are a
double-edged sword in that they are
very sensitive to on that note so if
people don't have them positioned right
they will be popping a lot where that's
where your pee goes boom right into the
microphone they also pick up pretty much
the whole environment that they're in so
they are a very sensitive microphone
though if you are into condensers and I
use one when I did the tech lounge and
that will be coming back that live
stream tech show that I did have to stop
due to my internet connection that when
that comes back I will be using my V 67
G which has the green and gold colors
because I'm Australian green and golds
like our national colors and it's also
very good price performance microphone
this thing sounds very rich got good
base and if you couple it with a cheap
preamp like an adder role I'm using that
you a 25 X which has a compressor on
board you will get a very rich sound for
under $100 so with all this gear guys I
will put links in the description below
