guys the r5 1600 X which is AMD six core
12 beats and it comes in at 249 USD and
today I'm going to do a special
comparison against what I believe is the
direct competitor the i-5 7600 K from
Intel and I'm going to be comparing
these in games and also productivity to
tell you which one says better in which
scenario welcome back to tech yes it is
time for that head-to-head comparison
between the 1600 X which I managed to
get to 4 gigahertz on a be 350
motherboard with a water cooler and also
32 hundred megahertz effective on the
memory and the i5 7600 K which I got to
5 gigahertz with 3 gigahertz XMP profile
so we'll quickly take a look at the test
bench specs and then we'll move on into
the benchmarks
so the benchmarks pretty much summed up
what I thought would happen before I
started testing this the 7600 K is
edging it out in frame numbers in gains
and now I did test this with a 1080 TI
overclocked founders Edition card so it
is pretty much overkill for this
scenario and as you step it down with
the graphics cards you will get much
closer performance between these two
CPUs however keep in mind on the
productivity side of things which is
very CPU dependent this is when the
Rison r5 will kick ahead and will get in
gear and beat the 7600 K hands down I
absolutely love the performance of the
r5 1600 X and it's performing so well in
those productivity benchmarks when we
contrast that to the 7600 K it is only 4
cores and four threads so in
productivity does fall behind a bit when
comparing it directly to the 1600 X also
one more thing to keep in mind is that
as time goes on I believe programs will
start to utilize more cause and more
threads so on that note the Rison r5
does have a lot more max potential than
the 7600 K which I believe for this day
and age four cores and four threads is
reaching its maximum especially if you
are high-end enthusiast I would much
recommend the four core eight threaded
7700 K over the 7600 K if you would a
couple with a high-end graphics card now
if you're on the mid-range graphics card
spectrum the r5 1600 X makes a lot of
sense and also on that note though I
think it's little brother the 1600 which
comes in 30 USD cheaper and hasn't
included cooler is the part to look out
for and get which I believe will
overclock to similar levels like we've
seen on the r7 lineup there with the
eight core 1700 coming in much cheaper
than the 1800 X and overclocking - very
similar levels of performance stuff
saving you valuable money anyway guys if
you enjoyed this video and be sure to
give it a big thumbs up and let me know
in the comments section below which CPU
would you choose and why I'd love to
hear your thoughts and opinions as
always also I would have loved to have
given you guys more benchmarks but
unfortunately I only got my 1600 XS
like literally only a couple of days ago
so I had very limited time to overclock
which I love killing and also
double-check the numbers and make sure
they were very accurate and valid for
you guys I'm sure Steve from hardware
and box will have a plethora of
benchmarks ready for you guys I'll put
his channel in the link in the
description below to be sure to check
that out and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
