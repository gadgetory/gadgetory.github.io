the yes where you guys ask the questions
and I answer them a little bit more in
depth than a comment or a reply
otherwise could handle but first things
first we're gonna talk about the heat
gun method where in a recent video I got
a lot of I guess not hate but a lot of
criticism about the heat gun and the
fact that it doesn't work and I know all
the arguments surrounding it and the
thing is though I'm one of those guys
who just does trial and error and over
the course of cooking up many of these
cards I've now had these second card
that's come back to life and the
previous car that I had come back to
life was a seventy eight seventy and
that's still going to this date years
later so this method it can very rarely
bring a card back to life now a lot of
the times as we saw in even the recent
video if you haven't seen that we'll put
the link up here we had two cards that
came back to life but then pretty much
cocked it pretty quickly and that they
wouldn't work after I gave them even
just a couple of minutes of stress
testing that's probably the most likely
scenario but it still doesn't take away
from the fact that I've got nothing to
lose
when I cook these cards up because I
can't micro solder for Jack and if the
cards worth enough money that I'm gonna
keep it aside and take it over to Taiwan
or try and get it fixed at a service
center so basically when we're dealing
with these cards for instance the GTX
650 I wouldn't pay money for like 25 USD
cuz that's what it costs to fix at the
service centre I wouldn't pay that to
fix this car because it's just simply
not worth it and also on top of that the
amount of time and effort it would take
to fix this thing even if I knew how to
micro solder I just feel wouldn't be
worth it hopefully that clears the air
surrounding the heat gun method and just
really it's basically as I said before
when you've got nothing to lose you've
got nothing to lose
the next question we got up here is from
Vegemite dangerous he says my dude I
recently got a new case and a bunch of
RGB fans however my board is an older
gigabyte H 81m I cannot figure out how
to wire up all these RGB fans as the
mobo doesn't have any RGB headers
they're really only on motherboards that
are new motherboards in the last couple
of years aged 81 M definitely won't have
these headers on board where you can
control and fry the motherboards
software in the case of asrock you can
control them within the BIOS however the
manufacturer of those RGB fans should
include a connector an adapter with some
sort of controller and you want to hook
all those RGB components up to that
controller and control those RGB fans
without having to install any software
at all
next up here we've got Vikings are
better he says it's still not hustling
please look up the term well actually
did look it up on dictionary.com and
some of the terms do definitely apply to
what I do the most relative one being
sell aggressively basically the tech yes
hustle ain't goin anywhere
next up here I'm gonna say Markos
finally getting some love this year
people are saying Marko was the man if
he can't do it no one can and also we
got Judge Dredd says hope his last name
is polo awesome name Marco Polo was
definitely happy with all the love that
you guys showed him in some of the
recent videos next up here we've got a
heap of comments pertaining to Zen 2 and
these were months ago but now that we
know the announcements and what's coming
we can definitely talk about this also
na'vi a little bit more in depth now JD
gaming says it's gonna be 4.4 to 4.7
gigahertz max turbo with 7 to 10 percent
higher IPC so we solved the IPC they
said it was 15% and in terms of the
clock speeds that's still up in the air
me personally unfocused on the old core
maximum clock speeds and I think they're
gonna be anywhere from 4 to 4 point 4
gigahertz it remains to be seen how well
these things clock on all course but in
terms of JD gaming's comment he got the
4.7 gigahertz max turbo bingo with the
39 50x so nice speculation there next up
here sir Brucie asks after rising 3000
launch then you will see
the is risin 5 1600 still a good buy in
2020 I called it watch and see
they'll be found for great prices too
actually as soon as risin comes out to
the market Zen - I'm gonna be doing some
deal hunts because I think a lot of
people would want to upgrade not just to
the new Zen 2 CPUs but also 2 X 570 as
well so stay tuned for some deal hunts
it's not going to be 2020 it's gonna be
2019 next up mr. sushi gaming says n2
and Navi come out soon I've been waiting
to build my PC ever since Pascal came
out and finally when I was ready this is
announced why basically Zen 2 is a big
upgrade for enthusiasts I spoke with
wendyl about this when we both agree
it's a great time for PC gamers on
especially on the CPU side where you've
got the chicken the talk happening at
the exact same time with this new CPU
launch so it's gonna be great and a good
time to build a new PC as well as also
getting used deals since hopefully these
CPUs will bring the price down of the
used market but in terms of Navi and
what we can expect out of AMD I think
it's a little bit too unrealistic to see
them come out and beat Nvidia I mean
Nvidia is a GPU focused company all
their Rd goes into improving their
graphics cards and so they are quite a
bit ahead of AMD especially before the
Navi announcement but coming out of
na'vi we do have to remember that this
is a company that has less R&amp;amp;D money
than nvidia but still has to do
system-on-chip CPU and GPU so expecting
them to pull a Hail Mary on the GPU side
of things is a little bit too much
considering they're already pulled a
Hail Mary on the CPU side of things but
when it comes to giving you guys buying
advice on these new products you can
expect nothing but objectivity
if na'vi is not going to perform as well
as in videos cards and I'm just gonna
call it how it is or vice versa if na'vi
ends up having some great features that
are worthwhile and worth the cost then
I'm definitely gonna say that as well so
stay tuned for all those reviews coming
up but we can already expect Zen to to
be hitting really hard especially since
the horizon 520 600 for example is
already an amazing value for money CPU
option next off Quang Glu 96 says thread
rippin 1920 X is like three hundred
dollars now twelve course 24 threads for
$300 and they
that and I'm actually more of a buff of
the 2000 series for instance I'd rather
have a 2700 x over in 1920 X exquisite
clocks better has the latency drop and
of course the motherboard side of things
it's gonna be a lot cheaper to get an X
470 motherboard than it is to get an X
399 board the next up Wayne Watson says
for editing a 1080 TI for the CUDA cores
or an RT X 2060 I think the big one
you're missing here Wayne is actually
the 1080 TI by a longshot and that's
because of the vram the 11 gigabytes of
vram I've found makes a big difference
for video editors
I've tried an Archie X 2060 and I've
actually tried a 1080 GI and also for
gaming - the 1080 TR is a better play
but it does cost more even on the used
market versus in new 2060
next up here we got ratchet who says LAN
suggestions pertaining to the previous
episode we talked about maybe hosting a
techie a city land and the game
suggested with half-life 2 CNC l4d to CS
1.6 and BD 2 since 1.6 is really cool
with the land feature I also like
StarCraft brood war but I don't know if
they took that out or if you can get the
original sort of vanilla brood war where
it did have that land connectivity but
basically playing over land guys gives
you the lowest pings possible it is
really a awesome experience that I'd
like to see that feature actually come
back into some of these titles that are
being released to this date but on the
flipside me August the 2nd says don't do
a land party go to LTX
and land party there + meet the other
content providers who are planning on
going to it actually on that note I did
meet Luke over at Computex got a photo
with him put that up on Instagram also
had lunch with him he was talking to me
about floatplane and I didn't get an
invitation to LTX but of course if I got
an invitation I definitely go there and
meet up with a lot of you guys who I'm
sure would be there too and if there was
a LAN party than jad do that as well but
I never got that invite next up weird
shiitake mushroom production says love
your videos in OG battlefield 2 is the
best game tool and it's basically the
biggest game that we land at school
actually that's actually true Biff - it
was a really good game for land as well
forgot that one next up bird flew Japan
says any chance you could double the
size of the comments on the videos with
a 5-inch cell phone you need to push
your eyes to the limits PS
nothing wrong with the game of CNC Red
Alert on land and bird flu your wish is
my command
we shall double the comment size so you
guys on smartphones can read them easier
next up FBI a lolicon division says if
they can beat he's refering to AMD Intel
in single core performance they'll have
a lot of new customers that would be
really cool if AMD could come out on top
as not just the value leader but also
the performance leader that would really
make for some interesting times we're
talking 2005 all over again Peter Jensen
says I highly recommend you to invest in
a better headphone first before you
consider buying a DAC an amplifier I use
a HD 700 sennheiser trust me that
headphone does a lot more than a DAC an
amplifier as brian says audio is about
the entire chain and what the weakest
link is in that chain frankly your
headphones are probably the weak link
right now and Peter's right guys always
invest in the headphones first and some
of my favorite picks especially in terms
of mid-range cans are actually the
Fidelio l1 and l2 s I really like these
headphones for instance I was on a
flight 14 hours coming back from the US
I had my l2 s on the whole time and my
ears did not get sore at all they're
actually really comfortable for sleeping
to wear it blocked out a lot of the
outside noises so definitely invest in a
good pair of cans especially since the
motherboard onboard audio nowadays has
gotten really good to the point where a
power a lot of these mid-range cans
absolutely fine and of course if you
want to step it up to something like HD
700 there for fire we're still on that
note you can get something really good
for around $200 that won't break the
bank in terms of price relative to your
headphones next up here at Tony Hanna's
says I too would like to see that Mars
story and actually when we looked at the
azuz video that we did a call me Tex I
hinted at the end I put in an Easter Egg
we're talking about the Mars cards and
how I acquired a 780ti Mars which is
just ridiculously rare and I want to
make a documentary and you guys the
response was overwhelming you guys
really want to see that happen but keep
in mind I'm not promising anything
anytime soon I've still got to get some
pieces to fix up the actual core content
and then of course I got to make a
documentary which I've never made before
and so this one's going to be a pretty
long
journey because I want to get it right
it's just a fascinating story the more
information I find out about this the
more it goes down different rabbit holes
and the fact that the Mars cards
themselves are just an awesome
collection is something worth a
documentary it's really is interesting I
can't wait to get more pieces to the
puzzle and also do more research and
just bring you guys something that'll
hopefully be like an hour long and just
be absolutely epic but it is going to
take a lot of time I do warn that in
advance kind of think of it maybe like
Darth Jar Jar well actually maybe not
that long but hey at least I end up
delivering in the end and here we've got
elder part a regular on the channel it
says great video the yes man answering
the important questions still waiting on
the BIOS overclocked tutorial and I
think he's referring to actually
overclocking a boss itself which
wouldn't be recommended since you would
be reducing the life of those BIOS chips
and if you see on LGA 775 maybe under
clocking a boss might be a good thing
next up Joel Quinn Fermi says yeah I'm
on a video of one of my favorite
youtubers you can be on it again techy
us loving knows no bounds and that about
wraps up this episode of addresses yes

I'll make that happen in the next
episode for you guys also sorry if I
missed out a couple of questions the
last few months have just been
absolutely hectic here on the channel
it's been so busy especially recently
coming off Computex and also doing the
AMD event in the USA those things were
like coupled together and that was just
absolute chaos in terms of my sleep
schedule jetlag being super busy packing
in a massive schedule but you guys along
the way have been supporting us left
right and center I just want to give you
