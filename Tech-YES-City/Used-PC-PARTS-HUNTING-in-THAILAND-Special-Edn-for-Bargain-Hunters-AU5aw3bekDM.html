I'm here for the Galax overclocking
event but I got here a few days earlier
and of course I'm gonna go use parts
hunting now is here a year ago and when
I was here I got a lot of comments about
checking out some new places one of them
being palladium Plaza and another one
called fortune town also got recommended
to go outside of the city but I'm really
not too keen to venture outside the city
as I'm only here for a few days I want
to relax and not get into any trouble
also got a lot of comments about
ladyboys and Bangkok and guys if you're
into that kind of thing then go for it
as for me personally I'm good I don't
need either of the two with that said
let's get this show on the road
so we've just made it into a palladium
Plaza and you guys was saying that this
place was better than pantip Plaza but
I've already been here for like two
minutes and I've already got hounded by
three different people for massages so
maybe is that is that way better but I
don't know apparently on the fourth and
fifth floor of this place is all whitey
so I'm actually on the fourth floor now
so we're gonna go use PC parts hunting
up here and see what deers we can get
but apparently there's also the sixth
floor but that's out of like out of
service at the moment but anyway if we
stop over these places and we get deals
then I'll record for you guys so now
I've found a store right at the back of
the fourth floor and this is called
techno Beyond and I've met Ed he's a
really nice guy he showed me around I
asked what PC parts he has on display in
which motherboards he has working I told
him I'm looking for used motherboards
mainly and he showed me he had a hate 55
gigabyte board and also a H 81 M so
that's first and fourth gen motherboards
I need both of them at the moment and so
we struck a deal for about 1500 baht
which would be around 70 or maybe $60
for the both of those boards so that's
pretty good going I'm happy with that
deal because as always when I go deal
hunting I like to get at least one deal
out of the whole equation just to make
me feel satisfied as that after the
day's ended so now just in a place
called VN and computers and they've got
something that new but they're of course
old 1156 motherboards and they want to
ground I think about 6070 us but they
only have two DIMM slots and the V RMS
I'm guessing is very weak so you really
couldn't expect overclock from these
motherboards but they do have some
really cool cases behind me Mini ITX
cases as well that I've never seen
before they're very lightweight of
course they're not as expensive as $100
cases I think they're asking around $50
but it's a really good experience here
so far they've pointed me to a shop
called ntek so we're gonna go over there
and see if we can find some used actual
used PC parts because apparently that's
the place to go but ironically enough
they're opening at 2:00 p.m. I mean I've
never heard of a shop opening it like
afternoon at 2:00 p.m.
anyway maybe I'm just not with the times
nowadays so now we're out the front of
ntek and now this place has been
recommended to me by practically
everyone on this floor and when I came
and checked out the place they
definitely have the goods
now they had a lot of h61 h87 also older
motherboards as well so they've even got
like an x79 board of course they are
pretty tough on the prices i can't
bargain them down at all so they're
asking about a thousand baht for a
motherboard I think that's worth it for
the H 87 gigabyte board which has got
the 8 pin CPU connect up from memory
I believe this board especially it's
because it's the revision one it can run
a fork or eight threaded CPU absolutely
fine without throttling so I'll probably
look around and definitely go to panted
Plaza and come back and go collect these
deals just because of course I want to
get the best deal regardless I know at
the price that they're asking it's
actually a pretty decent deal like it's
solid it's just of course I want to look
around and if the suitcase is already
full with even better deals then we
don't have to come back so I am
definitely going to look at getting two
of these motherboards the h-60 one which
I could definitely use to replace that
HP board with the GT 1030 or something
and also that h87 like I said before
really solid board so but they just
won't bargain at all that they won't
come down at prices here they're just
really set on their one thousand bar
which is I think it's about forty or
Stran dollars or thirty USD or something
like that so it is a pretty good deal
it's just of course you want to get the
best deals possible way that's still
before when we picked up those two
motherboards so I am hustling hard but I
think I've met my match at this store
right here so now I've gone around the
whole fifth floor and I've asked around
the stores who's got used motherboards
and a lot of the places don't have used
motherboards I actually saw in two of
the stores they had the pricing on even
just old H 81 series motherboards but
they had them brand new for around 1,600
Bart
so that deal for even a thousand Bart's
pretty good if it's confirmed working
for those motherboards but the store
behind me now elite systems they've
actually been really helpful in sort of
telling me where to go and where to get
the
deels they do reckon a few stores at
pantip Plaza will have some used parts
and they actually just like everyone
here is connected as well that's one
thing I've got to tell you guys about
they they all know each other on the
same floor and so they'll you just be
friendly to them and they'll like tell
you the inside deals they'll talk to
their friends about who's got the best
prices on used price-performance parts
so it's a really good atmosphere and
from here behind me I actually managed
to score a BTC Biostar 250 series
multiple with 12 PCIe slots onboard for
around about $150 so they they wanted
about 3700 but I got them down to three
thousand four hundred and fifty so
that's a really good deal actually
purchased that because that'll be able
to replace my two systems with one and
still have a lot more Headroom if I want
to add graphics cards onto the actual
mining bricks so really impressed with
that board so yeah 150 Australian
dollars it should be like 120 USD for
that board which is a really good deal
now another sad thing about especially
even palladium I haven't been to pantip
yet so I can't check it out but I was
talking to a few people they moved over
from pantip Plaza to palladium because
the rents a lot cheaper here but on the
fourth floor a couple of the guys were
telling me that a lot of the stores are
closing down because the business is so
bad at the moment and also with that
internet sales are taking over so it's
really sad to see that I mean I I don't
like hearing about economic tough times
because people lose jobs and stuff like
that even happening on YouTube with the
ad pocalypse thing so it's a really
weird time it feels like maybe the whole
things going into recession even
especially in Thailand so it's sad to
hear about that because the people here
are extremely nice it's so really it's
awesome just to get out here and go
parts hunting so a little bit sad to
hear that news but of course we're gonna
go over to pantip Plaza from here on in
and see if we can score some deals over
there and see what some of those prices
of those news motherboards alike because
a lot of the places here have those main
boards and that's the main component
that I need for these rigs
so we just rocked into pantip Plaza and
now we're gonna skip the first floor
because the last time we came here the
first floor just had nothing but new
parts and it's really cool if you want
to see some real cool custom builds wall
mounted pieces and stuff like that
they've got that on the first floor also
if you're coming to Bangkok or Thailand
to buy use PC parts then you're gonna
get some pretty good deals if you can
hunt around here but the new parts of
course they're a little bit more
expensive than Australia and a bit more
expensive than the US so it's good if
you're from like a remote island or
something and the prices are really
expensive but if you're coming from
Australia the US or the UK then you're
not really going to get good deals on
new paths with that said let's check out
the second floor and see what we can
find
so we just got done checking out the
second floor and they did have one store
called M&amp;amp;M technology and now these guys
did have some good parts like they have
the board's I was looking for but
they're asking way too much like they'll
asking about 30% more about 1,400 baht
for the same motherboard as the other
place so the other place definitely
looking better at the moment so we're
looking like we will go back but of
course let's check out the third and
fourth floor of this place before we do
head back and on that note as well I
didn't go to the back of this floor like
the second floor here right at the end
and people just didn't want to talk to
me like they looked at me and they'll
like I was like hey can I check out
these motherboards in LA just like
literally like looked at me and then
just looked away I was like ok if you
don't want to sell your stuff it's so
good maybe well maybe they just knew I
was like gonna hustle them and like the
anti hustle in there like not wait we
don't have the time mang
and we finished up now on the third
floor and this was pretty interesting
because we went over at the back and
there was one store that first of all
had like a use part section and they
opened up the doors and then they had
the packages and they wanted like two
thousand eight hundred baht for all
their package deals with i3s and the
motherboards that I wanted but it's a
little too expensive I mean they're
charging almost two thousand baht or
like $80 for an i3 it's really not worth
it but then we looked around the corner
and the name of this place that we
looked around the corner at was really
unique to say the least it was called
poo Computer Services so I hope that's
not a indicator of their actual services
that they provide but we managed to get
a H 81 K as zeus board here for 800 baht
so we saved 200 baht from the other
place at palladium so that's winning
baby so let's get on to the 4th floor
and check out what deals they got up
there and I think that's about it I mean
there might be a fifth floor as well but
let's go check it out
and we just finished up on the fourth
floor and that was a massive success we
picked up a H 81 as Rob mini-itx board
for a thousand baht so that'd be about
40 Australian dollars or 30 USD so the
reason we got the Mini ITX board is that
it gives us a bit of flexibility and now
in the past I've done micro ATX boards
but a used Mini ITX build is looking
like it's on the cards now they did have
another h80 one board for nine hundred
baht and I did bargain them down from
1300 to 1400 AD one board but I'd rather
pay an extra hundred baht for the h87
gigabyte boards so that'll give us a
stronger vrm as I said before more
options but with that said let's go hunt
around on the last and final floor this
is the fifth floor we'll go see if we
can pick up any more deals before we
head back to that place and grab some
other boards from there
so we just finished up on the fifth
floor and this was a boss though we did
come close to getting some deals we
looked at a h87
em from a Zeus so this they wanted
around 1400 baht for this I did say a
thousand baht which would be like again
30 USD but they were pretty firm on that
price but it wasn't a complete bust
because they didn't have the same mini
ITX board that I just bought from
downstairs
brand-new in-the-box going for 1,300
bars so that's an extremely good deal if
you guys want to come here and you don't
even want to haggle that's an extremely
good deal going on the fifth floor here
there was also another store that we
went to and they had the asrock h61 and
motherboard and they wanted a thousand
bar just like the other place and I
tried getting him down to nine hundred
and eight hundred they just said no they
wouldn't take it at all so I'd rather go
back to the other place and buy from
them because they were extremely nice to
me so I guess manners matter if anything
but with that said we're gonna go
collect the loot from palladium and then
we're gonna go get on out of here
so we just finished up at NJ Tech and
this is like crazy drama now I thought
I'd just come back here and have a
smooth easy by here with the two
motherboards but what happened was I
paid from initially a bargain him down a
hundred baht so I did bargain him down
about four or five dollars and so he
accepted to mother woods for nineteen
hundred but as I was packing in the mop
or as they were packing him up for me I
asked them to put the hard covers on
because I'm gonna be putting these in
suitcases and you shouldn't have just
paper over the pins you'll risk bending
the pins so it's always changing him
over for hard covers I noticed that the
h61 motherboard have a lot of bent pins
and so with that I said I don't want
this anymore
and so he refund to be a thousand bucks
so we ended up getting the h87 em for
nine hundred baht which is like you know
thirty Australian dollars or thirty USD
or some of that so it's really cheap and
I just got them to test that it was
working because the other h61 mother was
actually they had three of them and they
all had bent pins on them so I was like
damn you know this guy's selling some
shady wares so I just looked and he did
confirm that the h87 board was working
so with that I got a refund of a
thousand baht and so now I'm gonna go
back to the other place that had the
h-60 one as rock board just check that
that's got no bent pins and I'll pick
that up for a thousand five because I
desperately need that I do need one h61
board because I've got an i5 2400 CPU
that I pulled out of another build and I
want to use that in a build and of
course with motherboards they're always
the main component in a build and a lot
of people don't sell them cheap so
especially good ones that are working so
if you can always pick up a mainboard
for good money then get it
I just got back to the hotel and I am so
buggered I'm spent guys I've just used
all my energy now today just wheeling
and dealing getting those good deals
hustling and we ended up with five use
motherboards three of those H 81
motherboards one of those at age 55 and
also at age 61 also bought that BTC 250
Pro motherboard that was an extremely
good deal considering it's got 12 PCIe
slots and they all work for
cryptocurrency mining and on that note
of cryptocurrency mining a lot of people
at both palladium and panted Plaza they
were in de cryptocurrency really hard
they're all using nice hash I was like
asking on what's going on here and
they're just all mining they're all into
it in Thailand so apparently it's all
between BTC ETH and Z cash here that's
what they're all mining in Thailand so
it was pretty cool to talk to him about
crypto currencies and see what they were
doing one of the guys was making racks
for them and selling those and they'll
selling all the 10 70s so the rumor here
is is that they all use the 10 70s for
cryptocurrency mining apparently they're
just the best in terms of efficiency so
that's why your 10 70s got sold out
pretty much straight away well the other
Graham Scouts did get sold out but they
were a bit slower than the 10 70s to
sell out also another thing is well I
picked up this debug LED readout got
that for around $8 that's really cool
plug it into a PCI slot and you've now
got a debug LED they can read out
problems if you've got that and three
LED lights as well on top of that I
picked those three of them up for about
$10 I think and they're going to be
really cool for b-roll and just doing
some little things so it's just really
cheap some cool accessories that I
picked up too so this has just been a
massive used parts haul and this time
around it's been so much better than the
last time I came here there's just so
many deals now with used PCs and the
parts that they've got available there
was so many multiples they're gonna
picked up a lot more motherboards than I
did I just picked up the cream of the
crop and got the absolute best deal they
could there was still pretty good deals
as I said before the Mini ITX boards are
brand new in the box so if you guys come
here you can definitely get some good
deals on use motherboards it also is
really fun as well the food here is
great if you're coming over make sure
you change your money over at super cash
they got the best
I'm finding on the street or places
around them usually match the price as
well but they got really low spreads
they beat the banks by like 2% as well
so 2% saved if you just go to super cash
and change your money over there but
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's
epic used parts hunt in Bangkok they
also did have the LGA 775 boards and
ddr2 but as I've said on like live
streams in the past I'm kind of phasing
out of ddr2 and LGA 775 especially since
the Aliexpress first gen i5s and IR
Zeon's they're extremely cheap and also
the motherboards like we picked up today
are getting really cheap as well anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below what was your favorite
deal of today I'm so buggered but I'll
probably go eat dinner have a drink
somewhere and relax and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye
so I'll think about it so 2,800 bar for
this one okay all right I'll think about
it
hey this one you the H a do you want how
much I'm like I'm looking around here
and I'm probably the only happy looking
dude in this place at the moment because
I'm getting the deals</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
