pretty good I think we're good to go
sorry about last time guys my microphone
was muted because of xsplit and the
settings I've got a xsplit up here now
I'm positive it's working this time I'm
gonna double-check my settings as well
tools settings make sure my microphone
is working because last time it wasn't
yet so my microphone should be on now
you guys should be hearing audio
terribly sorry I'm only on a single
monitor as well thank you for the person
who sent me a message to my phone I
don't even have internet on my phone
it's just yeah it's a long story but
let's get into the deals international
deals I know to put time codes in the
description after the live streams
finished I'm gonna put time codes in the
top pin to comment as well if you're on
a smart phone and also we're gonna get
straight on into it so first up we're
gonna have Aliexpress international
deals so believe it or not Aliexpress do
have some decent deals then we're gonna
go into the US then we're gonna go into
Australia then we're gonna go into the
UK so let's get the first deal up $30 a
blue keyboard shipped to your door now
also with some of these Aliexpress deals
if you're living in Fiji or somewhere
remote check your import custom laws
because you may be a threshold or if so
you've got a really low level like you
can't import something over $20.00 then
you may just wish to ask the seller to
market down if they can't then you may
wish to not buy it at all
but also with that $30 great keyboard
blue switches I've got one of these in
my house phenomenal value for money one
of the best faith money keyboards you
can get Bar None and also next up Razer
DeathAdder $30 that's with the box if
you don't mind not having the box you
can save seven dollars and fifty cents
this is a phenomenal mouse for palm grip
users if you're playing csgo whatever
you want to do this mouse is really good
me personally though I'm a claw grip guy
I've got this rock at little lower heel
so yeah I'm a claw grip kind of
fingertip grip oh if you're a palm grip
grip oh this one is definitely one to
pick up a twenty three box also all the
links will be in the description below
so you can check out all the links on
the deals they good to go next up here
we have two gigabytes of ddr2 memory two
gigabytes
so $8 six dollars and 80 cents now you
grab four sticks LGA 771 the board cheap
X 54 60 or in a 50 for 50 and you get
yourself a little cheap gaming PC now a
lot of these motherboards are coming up
in old PCs that people are throwing out
a lot of the times might only have 2
gigabytes of RAM you get a gigabytes of
this stuff for 28 bucks shipped to your
door and you get yourself a gaming PC
you'll be out a couple with a 1050 which
we'll show you later have a great deal
$7 gaming mice now I heard about cheap
gaming mice from Aliexpress this one has
all the bells and whistles that you
would need and then some now this is a
funny thing because it's got all frills
it's got all gimmicks there's go 5000
dpi to so for seven bucks I think you
can't go wrong I think even if you're
going wrong you'd be going right if that
makes any sense so anyway have it gaming
mice as they would have it this gaming
mice is a clone of I think it's the
little of Zowie mice I think it's a copy
of that and for 13 bucks it's a pretty
cheap copy too you can get and get some
good money off that 50% off and now btg
5 CPU cooler $28 I've tried one of these
before
they're extremely good value for money
you get two fans included two towers in
the wine cooler I've cooled down the
next 5474 point 3 gigahertz on this
cooler I've done a 3770k 4.8 gigahertz
on this cooler now with that that's such
good value for money off this cooler
like I'm trying to think of what the
temperatures were 25 degrees ambient
temperatures too so if you were living
in Iceland or something you can probably
get higher overclocks than me as well so
that's a deal now since I've tried that
company vtg they've also got an
all-in-one liquid cool here for 57 bucks
shipped to your door so I'm gonna give
this a try actually might give this one
a go for 57 dollars shipped anywhere in
the world if you're in Europe or
somewhere like that this is a really
good deal
so no those guys constantly telling me
on Twitter hey man
living in Europe I'm getting terrible
internet speeds actually no not terrible
prices
what's Bangkok doing to me that's that's
something I'm gonna ask myself okay
next deal we got up here going into the
u.s. deals $400 for an ultra wide 34
inch monitor IPS 95 Hertz this thing is
extremely good value for money
you can't man there's some crazy noise
going on in my room too anyway all you
need to know is this is an absolute deal
for what you're getting it's a really
I've got an ultra wide at my place but I
paid like $1,000 for it this one's
similar it doesn't have the QD LEDs but
it's 400 bucks and it's got a 95 hood
refresh rate so that one's I see that
one selling out pretty quickly but
really good buy for money now next up
cooler master 212 15 bucks and that's
really all that needs to be said so
that's just it's a bargain guys if
you're cooling down a say for instance
x34 60 which is a 4 quart 8 threaded CPU
if you're calling that down if you've
got a even just a cheap fork or 8 thread
that you picked up somewhere this thing
will do a good job of cooling that now I
wouldn't couple this cooler with any six
core 12 threaded CPU maybe a risin 5
1600 if you go on for like a cookie
cutter 3.8 gigahertz overclock but
honestly the verizon stock cooler
included will do a pretty good job as it
is so this one's really good if you want
to get a better than Intel really crappy
stock heatsink fan and for 15 bucks does
an extremely good job so I can recommend
this thing at $15 day and day out
I'd actually buy I might even buy a few
of them after this streams finished
stock up the coolers because I'm always
needing coolers like these and a lot of
the budget builds that I do that's
really good value now 400 watt power
supply I was gonna say before thank you
as well thank you very much for letting
me know ma'am you quit me my mic was
muted because before that we're talking
about 400 watt power supplies these
power supplies will power practically
any build out there on non overclocked
builds like if you're gonna get a fork
or eight threaded cpu gtx 1060 a 400
watt power supply
is going to be enough I know a lot of
people out there like constantly
recommending oh you need at least 650
watt power supply I mean that might be
true for a 1080 TI and like a 8 core 16
thread risin 7 1700 and you're
overclocking both but 400 watt power
supply is gonna do a lot of system
builders justice 8 i5 8400 GTX 1060 or
even a gtx 1070 i think will go well on
this power spline it will run you also
got a two-year warranty and you're good
to go so a lot of system builds even
rising v 1600 overclock that with the
gtx 1060 some of this is gonna be great
for 20 bucks you cannot go wrong if
you're on wrong street then you would
have made a left turn right into right
Avenue so next up okay this one is in
stock very soon three days 100 bucks
supernova g2 now what I was saying here
10 year warranty so that in itself see
you paying a hundred bucks for a power
spline you're getting a 10 year warranty
gold rated 850 watts at your disposal
this thing will be able to do SLI with a
lot of system builds but if you're into
just one extremely powerful CPU you want
to go get a thread Ripper rise and
thread Ripper 16 core you want to get a
70 900 X and you want to get 1080i and
have just a massive system then
something like this is gonna be great
not only that you can just keep using
this power supply in future builds so
you can change it over from your current
beautiful system to the next beautiful
system and the next beautiful system
after that for a hundred bucks you
cannot go wrong so next up this is
probably one of the best deals here GTX
ten fifty eighty eight dollars and
really for a lot of guys who are
building om systems like HP systems or
Dell 4 cores with 8 gigabytes of RAM you
know like the old 8 i5 2400 builds which
go for really cheap like 120 bucks get
one of those systems Chuck one of these
graphics cards in you get yourself
extremely good value for money so that's
a really good deal 1050 that thing will
sell out very soon
88 bucks go get yourself a gtx 1050 main
okay next up GT X 1080 mini 500 bucks
now the word mini is kind of like a
little bit I don't know it's it's not
really a mini graphics card it's sort of
like a gtx 660 PCB size with a cooler
that's got two fans on it this thing
will do an absolutely fine job if you
want to overclock it of course it might
start tanking a little bit but out of
the box this thing will be great for 500
bucks it's the cheapest gtx 1080i could
find in the u.s. at the moment knowing
that yay 1080 performance you don't even
have to worry about getting a 1070 TI so
there it is next deal 1050 TI 130 bucks
not as good as the other two in my
opinion but still a decent deal $130 if
you need something small you want to get
your for you bytes of gddr5 memory
instead of 2 gigabytes you're like
worried about future proofing you're
worried about some unoptimized game
causing your headaches and you want to
put up your settings on ultra and you
want to tank your frame rates but you
want to utilize all that vram this one
might be for you guys ok seriously when
it comes to veer am I just something
quick if you sort of maxing out your
vram lower the settings a little bit I
mean I think 2 gigabytes is still fine
for a lot of 1080p titles but I think
coming into it 3 gigabytes will sort of
be the sweet spot coming into the next
year and then of course 4 gigabytes will
give you a little bit of future proofing
but in a couple of years you probably
going to be ready to upgrade your
graphics card anyway so next up here
Sennheiser game one gaming headset look
at that 85 bucks off so you're getting
33% off 165 bucks
hey sennheiser make some really good
headphones I believe these are based off
the HD 5 9/8 and they've got a really
good microphone attached to them so
you're getting aid this is one of the
few proper gaming headsets done right
and on 165 bucks bang pick yourself up
deal next up here we've got Corsair
Hydra series h100 IV - 85 bucks so if
you're getting a risin 5 1600 Verizon 7
1700 we're gonna talk about those CPUs a
bit later but you're getting yourself at
80 600k 8700 k this cooler is going to
be the one for you does extremely well
leaves the testing I've done something
like this does a phenomenal job of
cooling CPUs and it does a lot better
than the air coolers too so of course
they really have done a good job on this
cooler light they say they've used a
different plate and that's true because
I've tested this against some other
all-in-ones and it has beat them in the
past so next up SS d5 120 gigabyte 525
gigabytes and makes 300 now there's
gonna be some cheaper 480 gigabyte SSDs
out there for sure you're going to be
able to probably get one maybe 120 bucks
hundred 10 bucks the for a little bit
extra money you're gonna get something
that's consistent the crucial MX 300 is
one of the sort of cheapest consistent
SSDs that I can recommend I've thrown
this thing through some extreme torture
tests and it just keeps on going it does
extremely well so 430 bucks you're gonna
be getting an SSD that's not gonna clunk
out on you so the other SSDs that I've
tested in the past they're just they go
really well but after 10 gigabytes or so
whatever certain right level they just
tank this one doesn't so that's why I
can recommend this one anyway
next up here Sony 43 inch 4k Ultra TV
and if you want something so it's got
HDR as well if you want something like
this I'm gonna get 150 bucks off 20% off
and I love Sony TV's practically every
TV I've had in the last 10 years has
been a Sony that might stop though
because there's there is a deal I'll
pull up for the Aussies so that might
change but this one's really good for
600 bucks and then we got next up here
audio technica ath 8700 x headphones
these are really good if you're into
positioning so if you're playing csgo
even pop G which is pub G is actually
really dependent on sound if you if you
got crap sound it's actually funny
because I met up with some of the
viewers last night we had just a bit of
dinner and drinks and that one of the
guys said he had never got a chicken
dinner in pub Jay and then we talked
about audience
and he was just using his monitors sound
and I was like damn man you got to get
some good headphones everyone at the
tables like whoa you to get some good
headphones dude and yeah like that's it
Pub G games where you need positioning
FPS games headphones are so important so
this one here are a th 8700 X is
extremely good one of the best
headphones you can get for 3d
positioning 103 bucks
you're saving quite a bit I think even
in Japan that's where they make them I
think they're around about 150 bucks
their cheapest online price so that's a
that's a pretty good deal next up here
Zeus 144 Hertz monitor 24 inches hundred
and seventy dollars so you can get into
PC gaming with 144 Hertz grab yourself a
GTX 144 Hertz it's 1080p 1070 1070 B
route right gtx 1070 you will need a
good cpu or at least an overclocked cpu
Rison v 1600 overclocked 8480 600 k
these are all these CPUs that will do
144 Hertz no problems on pretty much
every game of course I'm gonna do some
other tests with some of the you CPU to
see how they go but that's a really good
deal now we're moving over to the Aussie
deals because you don't have long if
you're an Aussie you don't have long I
think there's 10% coupon code runs out
in literally three hours three and a
half hours this coupon code will be
finished so it's called a Pantone pnto
any now on checkout get the coupon code
drop it in save 10% so I've pulled up
this one here you know 3d ID chill x4
ultra drop in the coupon code you need
this thing for nine hundred Australian
dollars shipped to your door waiting
actually nine hundred and twenty dollars
because he charges $8 postage so you'll
get that ship your door I've tried the
no.3 di chill coolers in the past they
do a really good job
they're quiet they do a good job of
cooling so I can recommend them this one
is probably the biggest and baddest of
you know 3ds lineup for their graphics
cards next up another for summer
you know three days of going on really
good prices 10% off use Pantone get this
cooler sorry they're not cool GPU with
the cool 4 665 Australian dollars so
that's a deal another deal
another day another deal next up Verizon
five 1600 if you're in Australia and
you're looking to get a really good deal
on getting into PC gaming this CPU $259
take 10% off you're gonna get around 230
or strand so that's a really good deal
you can't miss out on that and for
motherboards there's only one guy
selling this for this price so you grab
the coupon code X 370 motherboard 140
Australian shipped to your door with the
risin 5 1600 that is extremely good not
to mention this is a pretty solid
motherboard so if you want a bit of
future proofing as well you want to get
onto the next rise in CPU architectures
m2 then this motherboard will definitely
handle it with the BIOS update because
AMD have promised that these
motherboards will remain relevant till
2020 so back look at that there's also
if this one gets sold straight away also
put update the description with some
other links as well so I think there's
someone else selling them for around 170
bucks but grab the coupon code chuck it
in you'll get yourself an extremely
cheap x3 70 motherboard now next up here
8600 k these are hard to get still I
mean I was told that they would come in
to stock a lot of more abundantly in
December and January
but for $418 take 10% off $380 8600 k in
my opinion it's the cpu to get for
gamers for next i'd say for the next two
years i mean as long as the ps4 as long
as the Xbox one are using six cause
that's gonna be all your console ports
are gonna be using six threads I mean
sorry they're using eight pause but six
thread some dedicated to gaming the
other two causes dedicated to something
else but as long as that's happening
your six core six threaded CPU is going
to be extremely relevant also with that
we have the six core 12 thread but that
does use more power and it does cost
more
so with that you can save a bit on the
cooler and use a 120 all-in-one on an 80
600 K get good results and use an
entry-level Z 370 as opposed to the 8700
K I'd recommend stepping it up on both
the motherboard and I'd go with the 240
all-in-one if you want to get good over
clocks so anyway next up for this same
CPU we got the asrock z 370 stream for
really good onboard audio they put solid
vrm on all their motherboards especially
like lately asrock have been on their
game 198 bucks plus you gotta pay $10
shipping but you get 10% off on top of
nine percent off so that's a really good
deal I'd be buying that if I was
building a sort of high-end gaming rig
with a 1080 TI I'd be getting this 8600
K and the I did have a cooler up here
no the cooler disappeared maybe the vtg
240 or the $25 air cooler and you'd be
home and hosed next up here Corsair le
200 240 GB SSD 119 Australian take 10%
off that would be a hundred and eight
shipped to your door now I've tried the
Corsair for celli's they're pretty good
they're great value for money and that's
really all that needs to be said about
them they're just a solid drive
especially for the coin anyway next up
panasonic 55-inch OLED 4k uhd smart TV
of actually after this after I finished
its livestream I'm gonna be calling up
my brother because he wants to get an
OLED TV he wants to actually buy a 4k TV
at the moment and be like look get on
this because you can save a couple
hundred bucks so this is apparently one
of the best TVs out there at the moment
so the Panasonic 55-inch OLED fantastic
so you get it for around 225 two hundred
and two hundred and two thousand two
hundred and fifty dollars or something
like that it'll be close to that and
Plus you got $30 shipping fair enough
fair enough
now that's the Aussie deals I think
that's the Aussie deals done ozzie deals
now we're moving over to the UK taken we
dumped it on a flight midstream
we're going out of the UK GTX 1060 170
pounds 170 quid mate great graphics card
if
you just want to get into PC gaming play
at 1080p play a bit of pop G play
whatever game you want to play because
this thing will do it great 1080p gaming
graphics card now also with that 4k TVs
but I'm gonna skip the UK because we
have here three hundred and fifty quid
for a forty three inch ultra HD our LG
TV so 4k HDR what more do you want
it's around 50 quid mate now I think
yeah UK guy you yeah everyone in the UK
uses mate too because down Australia we
all like mate yeah mate in the UK
they're like yeah mate twenty-nine quid
mate Logitech G 430 headset look at that
one that one ends pretty soon so the
sale ends in 13 hours but a pretty
decent headset I mean it's not of course
not the best headset you're gonna get
because 29 pounds but for the money it's
going to be a great headset and there's
no denying that now I realized special
deals CPUs and motherboards in the US
I'm actually gonna put another time code
in so completely skip these out but here
we go
last deals we got up here Rison seven
seventeen hundred two hundred and forty
dollars you really if you're getting
into anything
PC eight calls and 16 threads is always
a great thing to have this thing you can
overclock it as well two hundred and
forty USD absolutely love what this
thing's bringing to the table yeah not
enough said like Verizon v 1604 190
bucks or this for a 240 I'd spend that
extra 50 bucks get the extra 2 cores and
4 threads you're gonna be loving this
thing you'll be able to go afk for a
couple of years and still come back and
play games that's how good this thing is
next up if you want a cheap model board
with this Rison 770 hundred 70 bucks for
the be 350 plus from a Zeus great
motherboard you be out o'clock I'm
guessing around 3.8 gigahertz on the
Rison 7 1700 out of the box with this
motherboard that's value for money right
there next up Rison 7 1800 X if you want
to get the best Bend
Rison 7 chips the 1800 X I think the
majority like all at least half of them
around 4 gigahertz so this chip is the
sort of like the special one they're the
same essentially as the right and 1700
but 320 bucks you're laughing now if you
want a good motherboard for that this is
the motherboard i use in my Rison system
x3 70 tachi right now I just uploaded a
video changing over to you know coffee
lake but this is gonna be my AMD
benchmark trigger did I say that in the
video but I don't know if I did but this
machine here is becoming my AMD
benchmark system and I'm using the x3 70
Taichi because in my opinion it's the
best risin board out there feature
packed onboard audio is great vrm is
exceptional biles is great 185 bucks so
if you like looking to get high and
rising this would be it these two parts
here
next up here we've got the X 370 F
gaming though Zeus they're bringing in a
really solid deal here and you even get
I think you get a post purchase rebate
it's 15 bucks as well so this is just a
solid board for the money in general the
strict series especially the f-series is
kind of like your solid sort of like
well-balanced for the money for
overclocking I don't think it includes
Wireless though I think the e includes
Wireless the F doesn't so that's about
it guys so yeah any questions any if you
also have deals of your own as well drop
them in the comment section below
because I'm gonna move over to chat now
we'll have a bit of a chat I'll move
over any questions guys before we so if
you've got any questions then let me
know guys because we'll just finish it
off and we'll just answer some questions
because I'm moving into the questions
now this is my live dashboard the stream
health is good and any Ram deals are I
think Newegg had some Ram deals I just
I completely forgot like about Newegg
like when I was in the u.s. I tried to
use Newegg but I just I found it so
difficult so how many people out there
buy from Newegg versus Amazon if you're
in the u.s. because yeah so anyway so
yeah also what am i doing in Bangkok
guys
I am doing I'm going to the galaxy OSI
event that's tomorrow morning so that
starts off tomorrow morning at pantip
Plaza and Bangkok if you guys are in
Thailand and you're in the city then
definitely come to this event say hello
because afterwards I'm planning to go
out have some drinks and dinner and so
yeah if you're in if you're in Thailand
come come out and hang out with us so
also as well going to the gas of galaxy
event so really good and then really
that's about all I was here for so yeah
I know guys the naming I know now I'm
not doing any of that
um not banging anything unusual don't
worry so and now guys a questions coming
in okay okay I'm losing I'm losing all
the questions here okay any deals on oh
yeah also with some of the graphs cards
in the US it's hard like I couldn't find
any 1060 deals if they do come up make
sure you get on them quickly like if you
see a few prices that you know a better
than what you could get it for say a
week ago jump on that because chances
are that deals gonna get done so there's
also a I'll put ad some deals as I go
along don't worry I'll take the
description if there's any real hot
deals you guys see I'll update the
description throw them in I'll try and
look for some memory because I think
Newegg had some good prices on ddr4
memory especially compared to other
retailers so yeah anyway the chat is
going a little bit crazy guys I hope you
enjoyed the livestream and yeah blue
taught and I noticed you man I noticed
all you guys don't worry love years old
if you that's not good
Anthony that's not good at all man okay
slow mode sort of does keep it civil
though bogan deals when is the next
Gumtree video that will be next month I
usually do that at the start of the
month and yeah so the use parts deals
don't let's start of the month usually
and then I do the use PC as well because
it's a monthly thing I love doing it
that's one thing that I'm committed to
on the channel as for the livestream
gotta wait for better internet the
internet I've got here at the hotel in
Bangkok is
four megabits up now in Australia I've
got one megabit up this is on some
random Hotel internet this is why I
decided to do a livestream because the

also met a streamer as well he's in
Thailand he's doing like he gets like
7000 concurrent viewers man this guy

meeting a lot of people out here loving
it and also I don't leave ok yeah
because I want it like yeah nightclub

everyone was telling me this nightclub
was one of the bests so yeah gonna go
check it out
yeah also with the 1366 builds I'm going
to be doing a lot more of them a lot
more p55 1366 builds coming when I go
back to Australia as well the great
showdown is happening as well the three
you know two new CPUs versus that x6
core X 56 50 and that's gonna happen
don't worry I'm getting on my game when
I get back to Australia man no more hold
me back so actually I did something hold
me back at the moment as soon as I
docked into Thailand I got a thing
called a bangkok belly so that was know
as real that knocked me out for a day
so anyway guys we don't live chat why
not just go in the comments if you guys
have questions I'll just we'll stay
around and chat because yeah we did all
the live stress all the deals they're
really good deals and yeah all the deals
are them there in the description
awesome and all update if you guys know
any really good deals as well I'll
update the description so so know look
on ebay.com great bargains mate okay
I'll check it out thanks Daniel I will
check that out and we'll update if
there's some really good deals on ebuy
we'll drop them in the description so
and these are these are these are the
costs headphones as well is really good
for traveling even though they look even
though they look terrible
they're really good set of headphones if
you're if you're getting into PC gaming
getting a pair of these is actually
really good because you can use them
when you go out to the gym or whatever
and you want to exercise so okay let's
talk okay what is the best purchase you
have ever had oh man
hmm I'd have to think like I'd say that
I like the League of Legends $10 PC that
was incredible what was it five dollars
i paid six forgot that was probably one
of the best deals that i ever got
because it was so cheap and I turned
around and flipped it for what I forgot
how much I sixty or seventy dollars so
that's like a 600 percent profit so that
was really good
the recent 1050 TI deal I got was
extremely good for 110 Australian that
was really good also the some of the
chips that I got like yeah there's
there's just good deals all the time
guys extremely good deals you just got a
hunt for them and the chats starting to
get bad now okay and yeah I do play
games at the moment I'm playing destiny
2 and dota 2 they're kind of like my two
favorites at the moment P damn thanks
man what's up not much dude just what's
up at the moment I'm just drinking a bit
of water
galux have a deal
going on at this hotel I think at 7:15
p.m. so I've got a look at my time like
it's 8:45 Australian time at the moment
in Queensland and here it's 5:45 so in
an hour and a half I'll have to go to
dinner and I still gotta have a shower
and get ready and stuff like that so
okay so also one thing also one big
thing a lot of people are asking me
lately so maybe there's some kind of new
virus going around but a lot of people
and I've actually on the Gold Coast in
the last two weeks I've fixed up two
people's computers who have had this
random problem where their disks are
getting stressed like a hundred percent
literally all the time yes so I haven't
seen it on my computer yet but if you
guys have resource monitor open if
you're having stuttering check your
resource monitor and make sure your disk
isn't getting stressed at 100% because
that will cause stuttering because
background processes will start lagging
and then they'll start crapping
themselves and this will come through in
games so yeah that's something I've been
seeing a lot lately so could yeah I
don't know what it could be
so having I didn't really look that far
just like look let's just reinstall
windows clean this thing up and yeah it
cleaned up so it was something wrong
with their software so exactly because
why not that's it that's exactly right
alright so yeah if you guys that's just
this is hanging out I mean I can hang
out for another 20 20 minutes at least
another 20 minutes half an hour so what
is my main job at the moment this guys
this is it this is my main job as
YouTube I turned it into a job the ad
pocalypse was pretty hard that's getting
better now though for some reason I
haven't had a video demonetized in like
the last five videos so fingers crossed
that's gonna go well so I haven't had a
video demonetized for a while now so
things are starting to pick up a bit
yeah I mean it at around 250 K subs the
the money isn't like
add bucks you know what I mean I'm not
living it up sort of still you know
being a bit of a tight-ass but hey it's
I can survive off it and things are
getting better
so the content I think the content is
getting a lot better because like I've
gotten over a lot of crap that happened
in the past so the contents getting a
lot better because of that I think
because you know my Energy's coming back
getting back on the right path going to
the gym three times a week just staying
healthy healthy mind healthy body
brothers may even make it if you guys
want to see like a different video I
might even do like my hermit workout
routine like just like full-on you know
like I sit in front of a chair editing
videos and all kinds of crap all day
every day and like I still go to the gym
three times a week you know stay healthy
so did you check your Twitter deal
request links I'll add them so I'll
update the description after this video
is done and I'll drop them in the
description as well so yeah if you guys
have any really good deals I'll drop
them in the description as well users
submitted deals as well so also risin 5
1600 680 thoughts 680 ok you need to
update the graphics card sli 680 as well
I wouldn't go for that 2 gigabyte vram
buffer that's gonna hurt have I tasted
thermal paste yes I actually have tasted
thermal paste before it tastes like crap
when is when is the next studio update
that's coming as soon as I get back I'm
doing that one so the next studio update
we've got to paint the walls so me and
dad man we're gonna be painting walls
making a mess of things dropping carpet
in and then I gotta sort out the desks
for the studio downstairs once that's
done is gonna be awesome so Amazon
Australia am i excited very excited cuz
we finally get the Amazon down under
like Amazon so good if you guys haven't
tried amazon yet it's just like you can
get if crap goes wrong you can get a
refund so easy to buy things you usually
get really good deals as well so I mean
I've had nothing but good experiences
with amazon's customer service too so
that's just me so should i crossfire my
79 70s yeah
I'm not a big fan of SLI or crossfire to
be honest well thanks man greenies for
the greetings so I'm not a big fan of
crossfire at all I've always liked a
single GPU kind of guy it's mainly
because like if new games come out they
don't support they don't support the sli
and they crossfire a lot of things
sometimes you can just get games that
don't support it at all and even then I
think like pop G doesn't that run worse
on SLI that's what I heard so a lot of
the times if you go for a single
greatest card that's just why it's just
makes life easier so not to mention you
can just get limited especially in your
overclocks as well
you're then doubling up on the silicon
lottery so if one of the graphics card
sucks then the other ones gonna be at a
detriment because of the other crappy
graphics card so at least with one grabs
card you've got your max overclocks
you're good to go and if you got your
golden sample match imagine getting a
golden sample and then being held back
by a crap gravis card just because you
want an SLI that's that's a reality that
could happen it could happen in any time
mang so fellow Ozzy here why is RAM so
expensive at the moment Samsung Apple
bought out Samsung's like whole lineup
of ddr4 that's one of the biggest
reasons Oh Steve's in the single GPU
show hey Steve we've got to do our live
patrons stream brother come on man I've
been hounding Steve because I've got
good innocent here in Bangkok I got good
internet here so I can do the patron
live stream I'd really dread doing live
streaming on one megabit per second it's
like it's even less it's like 90
kilobits per second kilobytes per second
like that's how bad my internet is I
can't even do proper bit rates on audio
I've got a micro the audio as well so
that at least 4 megabits per second is
good so our friend is upgrading his
girlfriend's PC would you say a 1050 Ti
or a 1060 1060 3 gigabytes yeah Oh
actually no the price difference that's
actually quite big man price difference
is quite big so oh that's a tough one
yeah it depends on what games you want
to play what's
comfortable with honestly if you're
comfortable with medium and high
settings at 1080p a lot of the times go
with the 1050 TI so it's gonna be saving
your money so but if you want to step
things up the difference is there I
think it's about off the top of my head
1060 is about 50% faster than a 1050 TR
even the 3 gigabyte model may be a bit
more 60 60 % any good deal I don't know
man I okay I don't know Chris why do I
get 80 FPS on dota 2 with a 980 TI and
i-5 3450 it be the i5 3450 that would be
the reason why you're having your frame
rates limited you'd have to check that
out make sure you tune your i5 as best
as you can get yourself 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 8 gigabytes at least a ddr4 memory
and dual channel make sure that stuff's
overclocked and tuned if you can and
then of course make sure your cash ratio
yeah on IV forgot Ivy Bridge doesn't
have the option for the Encore does it
off the top of my head so maybe yeah but
this would be the reason why not the
980ti
unless something was running like crap
so okay well it could be software as
well so but honestly I 5x5 should be
good for dota 2 over a hundred frames
per second do you reckon you'd have a
coffee like CPU without YouTube no I
wouldn't
oh like you mean like without so if I
didn't do any videos at all would I buy
a coffee like CPU 8400 definitely man
this is the Mini ITX rig I'm using at
the moment I'm live-streaming on this
thing I'm editing 4k videos 8400 for
nominal and Mini ITX pcs because you can
use that included stock cooler and I've
done I've under clocked it like I mean
under vaulted it so it's using like 52
watts or something on full load so in
the in wind show pond it's really good
8600 k I would go with that too as well
so if I was building a gaming PC for
myself I'd build in 86 hundred K and
probably a 1080 rather than a 1080 T I
actually don't need a 1080 TI for what
like for my 1440p
ultra wide monitor because I use high
settings if you guys didn't know I don't
use ultra settings I use high settings
and so with that I find if you jack the
settings up to ultra sometimes you get
like just like micro micro stutter we're
talking like B's dick amount of my
crostata that if you drop the settings
down too high and you sort of lower the
AAA and stuff you still get a beautiful
picture but it's just smooth so much
like it's just smooth a lot of the times
so with that I wouldn't need the extra
power of the 1080 T ISO files building a
new computer I'd probably get eighty six
hundred k GT X 1080 that would be me at
the moment
any good mechanical keyboard deals yes
aliexpress $29 a blue it's they trust me
I mean the name you've probably never
heard of it all before you probably
never heard of the name but trust me
that keyboard is amazing I've had a few
people on the Gold Coast as well tell me
that they've bought that keyboard as
well and they're like dude it's legit
it's really good so I think it's like
one of the first links on the Aliexpress
deals did you get your ATC 700 K working
did I get oh okay yeah so I got the 8700
k rig I did get it working and it does
seem to have fixed the CAPTCHA problems
keep in mind only was using it for like
a day and a half before I had to head
out and leave so yeah I won't be able to
find out until like at least another
month if it's definitely fix the problem
but it's looking like it will fix the
CAPTCHA car problem
the 8680 700 K though on the motherboard
at the moment the raid was really giving
me headaches so I gotta wait for a BIOS
update to fix that
hey blue that's detection what are you
guys doing okay what do you think of
mini STX form-factor are good I using
the M wind Chopin or Chopin I just
caught the Chopin sorry I just love the
name it sounds sounds legit in Wind
Chopin this case is really cool I fit it
in my backpack and it's so lightweight I
got the AAT 400 in here if you go any
small on this you might have some
cooling problems as well you've got to
think about cooling
problems and a lot of mini STX builds
have an AC adapter and I hate AC
adapters like you've got to carry around
this other block the in wind choppin
like I probably sound like an in
windchill at the moment but this case is
so good it's so small it's got the
little power supply built in at the
bottom and it's just perfect for
traveling like I can't recommend this
thing enough a lot of people have been
like you know I'll show you guys - I
might even just make the webcam a little
bit bigger okay so we go I'll pull
myself over here might yeah so pull
myself over here this is the setup I'm
doing at the hotel so a lot of people
like dude how do you bring just a mini
ITX rig so I put this little folder in
front to block out noise so it doesn't
go to the microphone a little bit ghetto
I know but hey man this is just this is
how things are and then we've got the
mouse on the desk audio interface and
there's a little in wind chop in there
like so small there's a look at that
room service and then yeah that's it
that's my setup and I just work so much
better then I ever could on a laptop so
it's just incredibly good I'd prefer it
over mini SD x over a laptop as well
because the mini SD X form factors a lot
of time they have the AC adapters and
I'm just not a big fan of it can you do
Ram overclocking store for Rison yeah
I've actually got to get some extremely
good memory first everyone's telling me
the Triad and Z's the best Samsung B die
I've actually got to get a pair of that
and I want to do like a rise in memory
video and if everything goes really well
with that I'll do a rise in memory
overclocking tutorial as well because I
if I do that I do want to test a lot of
different rising CPUs as well with the
memory controllers so I want to make
sure that that's not as big as a factor
as I suspect it could be maybe
microphone V 67 G it's an amazing mic
the closer you get the warmer it gets oh
yeah and okay so you're upgrading your
PC yeah with a 37 50 K 37
hmm 37 36 70k 3770k okay
hey yeah okay okay so okay Brian there's
a blue Yeti going on sale on Amazon I'll
update the description with that blue
Yeti is a pretty good microphone as well
especially with the simplicity of it
plug it into USB and okay
I'm keeping I'm go I'm going guys I'm
gonna keep going I'll just cut off the
end of the live stream just because yeah
it's really not related to tech at all
but yeah I haven't hung out with you
guys for a while like the tech lounge is
definitely coming back we're gonna bring
that back it's just I want to get the
internet right the settings right
because I've been watching this live
stream and the health bar has stained
state green the whole time I haven't
seen this for a long time not since I
was in Japan and had Japanese internet
so that's refreshing to see that so
anyway let's uh yeah it's up hit up some
more comments 1080 ti4 250 Australian
dollars what dude like if you see a 1080
ti4 250 AUD you just go out and buy it
you do not even second-guess you do not
even hustle the guy down you're just
like here's my 250 take it out of my
hands and give me the give me that
graphics card right near me okay it's
got to be right but the joke is still
love huh okay I just man he look he went
too personal man that guy that guy
crossed the line man he knows what he
did and he knows he crossed the line and
I'm I don't know like it was an adult
when he did the crap he did so I'm never
gonna forgive that guy he just I was
gone that was the toughest time of my
life man and that guy basically kicked
me when I was down and I just you never
kick a man when he's down man Jesus
anyway how soon till you get the knees
stood up and running that will be about
ooh I'm gonna try and get it done in the
next month before I get better internet
and then so can you make a giveaway PC
for me that would be so unfair to all
the other viewers out there who support
the channel watch the content so I
wouldn't do that
give it away give everyone an equal
chance so okay there isn't we are
running a giveaway tech deals has got to
announce the winners and then we're
gonna do another giveaway definitely
doing I'm giving away one of these so
yeah I'll be giving away one of these in
win chopped on 8400 probably won't have
probably won't have as much memory hurry
we'll have 16 gigabytes of memory but 32
U is just so expensive at the moment
memories like wow I might have met maybe
I'll include 32 gigabytes who knows but
old it's gonna be the ultimate mobile
editing rig you can even play DotA dota
2 with decent frame rates at 1080p on
low settings I've been playing out a few
games and it's really good so you need
to motherboard overclocked your 35 70 K
any recommendations arm 35 70 K is so
easy to overclock any Z Z 68 z68 z77 any
of those motherboards they should handle
the 35 70 K absolutely no problems
they don't use up a whole lot of heat so
yeah studio yes you do up beds coming
guys already already said that like 20
times now so it's gonna be awesome to
don't worry once we get that new studio
out it's gonna be insane we're gonna
have like just content out the you know
we're and it's gonna be really cool so I
just can't wait to get that because it's
just gonna be streamlined at the moment
I'm in like a shoebox and just it's so
hard to like what you know new space
because I'm always doing builds testing
out used builds and stuff like that so I
need a lot of room and that studio is
gonna be a lot of room so it's gonna be
good
are you getting ambient yes so first of
January getting NBN being an Aussie can
you can one of you Australian tech go
interview the singularity's computer
crew I've heard of yeah I've heard of
singularities computers I've heard of
him before he does he does some custom
he does a lot of custom builds yeah I am
so busy like I don't know where he is if
he's interested in collaborating I'll
send an open invitation please contact
me singularity computers and we can do
something I'm will be doing here's a
little hint
rocketjump ninja and I will be
collaborating very soon that's gonna be
awesome he's gonna be recommending me a
mouse and I'm gonna be building and
tuning a PC for him so that's gonna be
stay tuned for that so there's two
videos coming with rocketjump dinger
if singularity's computers wants to do
something send me a message man I'm
always open just I'm so busy I can't I
don't have time to like go chase up
other things at the moment so yeah but
definitely always keen building a mini
ITX PC have an r9 nano okay okay
what Sudi recommend 550 what yeah if I
were to do what should be fine that
should be about right I not sure about
the nano nano is based on the it doesn't
use as much power doesn't use anywhere
near as much power but yeah 500 Watts
should be fine okay so just wondering
why you went for 87 in your personal rig
and not thread river wouldn't it be but
okay a you frosty I'm gonna tell you
guys live and tell you guys live a
little thing that I haven't spoken about
because the live viewers you guys
obviously are keen on tech if you're
sitting here watching this live you're
pretty enthusiastic about tech one thing
I've got to talk about and one thing
that no one has really spoken about is
latency latency and yes the risin 7 1700
4 gigahertz will have a better final
render time then an 8700 K or at least
it should be close or it's less it's
better price performance will have a
better final render time than 8,600 K
but every single action you do I found
this is the first thing I found only
after a day and a half I did render a
video out of my 8700 K and I noticed it
was more snappy for instance when I
click and drag a file for some reason it
feels snappy Oh on the 8700 K rig I hit
I do something I multitask I change
window I do something different it feels
fast around the 8700 k now if you've got
even fifty to a hundred actions per
minute that time that you're saving
those little micro seconds wouldn't that
add up to something over the whole time
of
editing a five six hour video it's
something I got to talk about it's
something that obviously I have to
provide empirical evidence with before I
do come out and make a video about it so
I will be getting out my I think it's a
thousand FPS camera and I will be
investigating that that's something I
want to do it might be all in my head
but in the past when I've done a lot of
research with stuff like this it hasn't
been in the past so I mean I like I
haven't been wrong when I've had a gut
inkling on some of these things in the
past so when we think about productivity
do we think about just final render
times just numbers or do we look at some
other things as well and that's
something I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna
go off on this crazy ass tangent and I'm
gonna be looking at that and yeah I mean
I'm just gonna present the results
because I guess that's what my channel
in the first place was built up around
was just trial and error testing things
out and just reporting the results and
sort of ya know yeah yeah mining we got
that yes coming very soon mining it'll
be coming in the next month hopefully
I've just got to get everything together
I want to know which sort of direction
I'm going with I've spoken to a few
people in the field so I think my
initial video that I made a few months
ago that's looking to be right you know
cryptocurrency isn't going anywhere and
that's it's it's a trend now that's
staying it's sticking around so hmm okay
so am i excited about Amazon Australia
very excited so do you think a forty
seven seventy is bottlenecking my six
gigabytes so okay any deals so far we
got all the deals and descriptions okay
that must be likely due until having
better IPC and that's why there's lower
latency it's not all about IPC though
there's so many different things to a
CPU as well I know Rison gained a lot of
its instructions per cycle advantage
from branch prediction so if that's
something to talk about rising gained a
lot of its IPC gains from branch
prediction so
over the initial FX series and now I've
had so many people tell me about FX CPUs
versus like 35 70 K or 46 70 K how much
snappier the 46 70 K is that's not in a
lot of people's heads that's like you
know I've heard that constantly as well
so I don't really know I'm not really
gonna report on anything not really
gonna speculate too much until I do the
empirical evidence could be on my head
so but yes man if you want to plan to
post this up on YouTube
yeah I'll post the Q&amp;amp;A I don't know like
I don't Q&amp;amp;A that much so and this is
like yeah people people aren't really I
guess they come in for a deals video and
then I'm totally guys are spamming about
you know type Bangkok and stuff like
yeah so sure if they want to see that
how good is a bronze rated power supply
blow up here 18 compared to gold and
others it's just a rating with power
efficiency so if you're burning 500
watts from the wall and 80% will give
your system 400 watts gold rated if it's
doing 90 percent or whatever it'll you
know 450 watts so it's just a rating it
doesn't it's it is correlated to how
good the components are and a power
supply definitely usually if it's a
titanium or a gold rated power supplies
usually got a lot of good components in
there so it is usually correlated with
the quality of the components inside
that's one thing I've found over the
past and what's my current net speed in
Australia it's terrible it's like 10
megabits down one megabit up so this one
here the moments like four down four up
but the Ford up is so important for
streaming so okay I'm looking to upgrade
is there a good price okay my HDD is you
slow yeah I if I were to view about SSD
yeah I've got one in the description
there's a crucial MX 300 it's really
nice please do more bogan videos yeah
bogan videos are coming the next one is
gonna be we're changing it up I'm just
going to me keep it a surprise
the next used parts aren't is going to
be a surprise you guys are gonna love it
too I've got I've been working on the
accent I've been working on it been
practicing in my spare time
hopefully it's gonna be good so oh okay
victorious where are you dude I'm so
jealous of those speeds my friend he
lives are my friend who I gave my job to
in Japan he's got a thousand down a
thousand up so those speeds were
incredible and so I got asked you 6,600
give me a nice CPU cooler that would be
this the vtg the air cooler this one
here that'll be perfect for your q 6600
I'd go with that just make sure your
mother will it's capable of handling it
too that's a that's a power-hungry CPU
man the Q 6600 was very power hungry
is it worth upgrading to an i7 5820k nah
5820k at 4.5 gigahertz is very good like
I wouldn't even if I had a 5820k still I
wouldn't upgrade to an 8700 K even it's
just it's it's that good of a CPU still
it's a really good CPU you're not like a
huge like unless you need like again
unless your FPS whore and you need the
best FPS possible then you'll be pretty
good any good SSDs eels I'll update the
description there is a heap of good
deals I just had to sort of cut it down
into one and best deals sort of thing
but yeah there's good deals eBay at the
moment for another couple of hours in
Australia have 10% off everything so Joe
check out a 120 gigabyte if you're in
Australia Amazon just go check it out
I'll add it all up at the description
but you know there's some pretty good
deals so is a mechanical keyboard worth
it yes definitely so it'll be really
good oh sorry I didn't I just saw this
comment then is a risin 7 1700 a
bottleneck with a 1080 also a 1700
versus 80 600 K for gaming I've write in
7 1700 like it won't be a bottleneck
it's gonna run the is gonna run the
ghost card absolutely fine you if your
graphics cards not at 100% and you've
got the ride in 1717 hundred on it maybe
one or two threads at 100% then in that
particular game it could be a bottleneck
of course if you got the ride in 7 1700
I'd recommend overclocking it
get a good cooler for it try and get it
to three point nine to four gigahertz I
got my rising seven to seventeen hundred
to foggy goods that was a really good
chip I've keep in mind they rather than
seven seven hundred is reported to be a
lower bin to 1800 X like they actually
do bin it so yeah three point nine Gigot
should be doable
and you should be able to have a good
time on that so yeah I mean if I if I
had that if I had a run seven seven
hundred and ten eighty I'd be home and
host any collaboration ideas with
hardware and box yes mister unboxed and
I we have two mister unboxed and I we
have two um we I'm planning to bring him
into the tech lounge so that is the plan
so probably be a three-way or something
like that but yeah that's that's the
idea we're gonna bring mr. unbox because
we do talk a lot he is a he is a really
good friend as well not just a colleague
so that's Steve from hardware and boxed
so have you been playing
no man feeder I haven't been playing on
my PS Vita yet it's so sad because I
really wanted to use it and I haven't
used it yet it's so I feel so bad
because I bought that wanting to like
use it on planes and stuff and watch
like movies on it but I just never got
around to it no man so time straps
sometimes so with a lot of people's
upgrading to Verizon with a FX 8350 be
good used by and then see like that's
right there I'm gonna be honest I would
rather AP 55 motherboard and an X
3450 or X 30 470 then an 80 350 that's
just me and you can get them so cheap
already so if you can get an X if you
can get an FX 8350 motherboard and the
CPU for a really good price maybe like
honestly I would pay about 70 bucks max
for that as sad as it sounds that's what
I would pay because I know I can get it
P 55 or H 55 motherboard and a Zealand
for about that money and so that's about
the max I'd pay for it it really wasn't
a CPU that was designed that
well for gaming dudewitz for
floating-point units as opposed to yen
so that was the FX 8350 1080 TI for 12 i
don't know how much that currency would
be in dollars I don't know if it's a
good price because I don't know how much
$1 is to an Indian rupee is it Indian
rupee seventeen dollars EVGA bronze yeah
that's good so there you go that's it
get those deals I seven nine seventy or
jewels e on Plex are Plex Media Server
okay would you
I thought Plex ran on I mean I just go
for power efficiency so I'd go with the
i7 970 I mean 256 20s would when they
juice a bit of power over an i7 970 I
mean I just mix plex media server
shouldn't be that intense at all you
could probably run that on a dual core
yeah unless you wanted to encode a lot
live transcoding true you've got to
think of this stuff okay anyway is it
the 1080i worth the current generations
and basically cheaper version of 1080
normal version silver een 1070 TI in
1080 oh yeah they're virtually two on
the same 1080 is a little bit better
both overclocked and the 1080i is worth
it if you need it so if you can get a
1080 TI and you need that power which
even like I said before in the live
stream I don't need a 1080 TI I'm
perfectly happy with a 1080 if you need
the 1080 TI it's worth it if you don't
need it then don't get it so that's
pretty much what it is that's pretty
much all it is so many questions got oh
okay okay um okay collab with green hand
gaming yes I've asked green hand gaming
for a collab we will be doing it very
soon I'm not very soon sorry I've got a
message him against because he was keen
to come up to the Gold Coast and we're
gonna do something crazy I don't know
when he would be keen to do it obviously
he's very busy with his studies and
whatnot so
but I have spoken to green ham I have
met him in the past he's a really nice
guy
so yeah I'm always open to doing collabs
with other tech tubers down under
especially people especially my fellow
Aussies really cool because everyone I
met so far in this train tax scene has
been really nice so why am I getting
30fps Pub G low-profile gear but I
wouldn't know man and that's a lot of
people ask me about like how to fix up
their stuttering and stuff it's very
hard when I'm halfway across the world
if I'm there and I can check everything
for you real time just start honestly
start with resource monitor download
afterburner
get the Live profile happening where you
can monitor CPUs CPU speed and go from
there so so yeah Tech lounge it would be
awesome with ok oh how many questions
more UK ok just imported fine I'm sure
you have a heck of a lot more than two
coins I have yeah my alias did import
fine I got that up and running
absolutely fine I made sure so I've got
2 drives with my alias wallet and so
yeah I've got over 300 Zen coins at the
moment Zen cash so there's a little hint
I'm not doing Z cash for you guys out
there watching I'm doing Zen cash so ok
is it a good deal 50 I don't know if the
top of my head that'd be $600 yeah it's
pretty good $600 out of a 12000 maybe
$600 yeah it's a really good ear for
1080i so when we were the build-off
build-off who do you want to build off
with Steve from Harbor box yeah we're
all good off we're gonna do it off
what's the best GPU for an x4 860 K oh
man I in the past I haven't really
recommended that CPU because it's it's
pretty weak the best GPU for it would be
like 1050 like that's what I'd go with
within a 60 K it's it's quite a weak CPU
like a lot of used Zeon's will kick the
pants out of that CPU like just thrash
it
so that's that's real why that's legit
it's uh m50x 420 bucks i would go with
the 8700 x's that i recommended before
they're extremely good for csgo
they're really good I've tried them in
the past my friend had a pair they're
legit series even the 500 X's for $67
are extremely good too
of course their vengeance memory I mean
at the moment a hundred sixty five bucks
is not bad I mean memory prices are just
ridiculous I think on you eight there
are some better deals but of course
their memory works really well I don't
have I did have some problems I believe
with a gigabyte motherboard x3 night on
but besides that I had no compatibility
problems and they overclocked to the XMP
profiles absolutely fine
to point wants bigger deals blow up
their description have a jacket do you
think current generation of consoles
I don't play consoles guys so I think
they're good if you like consoles
they're good I'm just not I'm not into
consoles at all PC gaming is where it's
at it's always been where it's at for me
since starcraft brood war i just i
started using a mouse and keyboard
absolutely loved it i that i can't go
back to a controller and like you know
console based gaming pc gaming has been
way too good to me so a lot of people
make the switch a lot of people in my
generation like maybe in your late 20s
early 30s a lot of people like me did
the same thing i've spoken to a lot of
people and it's like yeah used to play
console changed over to pc absolutely
love it so Australia Amazon it's it's
coming very soon that's the rumors I
don't know when they'll drop all the
products on there but yeah it's coming
very soon I think they're gonna get it
ready for Christmas so probably in the
next week did you collaborate on dota 2
on the new patch I calibrate yeah yeah
I'm good on dota 2 dota 2 new patch is
pretty cool
they changed did they change vengeful
spirit to spawning illusions now that's
crazy what do you think of Amazon AWS
being too late yeah it's good I mean I'd
rather have Amazon launch with full
stock and good prices then have them do
a dodgy launch
all right thanks I'll see you man yeah
I'm gonna close this stream down tubes
we gotta get ready to go out so
last-minute questions guys
ask them please answer what can I have a
laptop with a 5200 you 830 m my budget
700 bucks in my region cost 1404 okay he
just sent me a message man send me an
email I got to send me more specs what
country you're in what deals you got
I'll try and reply as soon as I can
probably not tonight though just yeah
get the good deals get a GTX 1060 around
700 bucks and maybe Verizon v 1600
stupid to upgrade to 1070 I uh what it
depends on the GPU have at the moment
but if you're using it for 4k yeah 4k
monitor yeah that that's CPU will be
absolutely fine on a 4k monitor with a
1070 to 1080 TI yeah 4k is fine with a
35 70 K at 4.4 gigahertz you should be
okay a gigabytes around 16 gigabytes
what's your take personally i if I could
get 16 gigabytes I would get 16
gigabytes just gives you a bit of
flexibility obviously you don't have to
worry about the future so keV you know
Tech showdown keep yourself protected
yeah um I mean I always keep it clean
don't worry so my mum any deals on fire
cuda drives no you couldn't find any
there might be one for 75 bucks I
thought I saw one so what you got here
is like the real hot deals so hot deals
that you won't usually find that often
so I remind you I've found some much
better deals over the past week or so so
anyway I mean yeah the past weeks been
actually really good like just if you
see a good deal just jump on it so
that's it these are just some deals that
I've whipped up together so okay so I'm
gonna start closing this stream down
guys I love chatting with you all that I
got to get going so it's been awesome so
is it worth upgrading to a Rison 5 yes
definitely yes rather than 5 1200 s a
lot better than an a8
okay can you run different RAM modules
as long as their same voltage and speed
yeah you can't same you can you can sort
it off run for two foggy about modules
together for a gigabytes and run a
module Cannell they'll just run at the
j-2x standard then from there you will
overclock and that's up to you sometimes
you can actually lock in one XMP profile
copy it down to another and it will work
depending on the memory stick anyway
guys I will catch you in another tech
video very soon and also stay tuned for
the Galaxy OC event you know they they
flew me out here and they provided a
hotel and stuff and ID with that I was
able to get that used tile and parts
hunt deal done for you guys so big
thanks to Galax for sending this out
