out AMD's new CPUs and today we have
here the 2950 X which is very impressive
not only in its total performance but
also in terms of its price tag coming in
at 899 US dollars it is one phenomenal
CPU with 16 cos 32 threads and I was
able to overclock it to 4.2 gigahertz
and the temperatures were very well
controlled a few days ago however I did
take a look at the 2990 WX and although
that had 32 cores and 64 threads and it
came in at a good price for the hardware
you were getting it was actually a very
nice CPU in that if that application
could take advantage of those cause then
you saw the performance but when it came
to gaming it was a real slouch it was
quite poor in fact that you had to turn
it into a 2700 X through the rise of
master software to get any real decent
performance out of it in terms of games
but today with the 29 50 X we have a
real hard-hitting CPU that in my opinion
can do it all
so straight away with the 2950 ex we're
gonna paint two pictures and that is the
productivity side of things or the
workflow and saving time and the
efficiency of this processor and also
streaming which I'm sure is a big
segment of people in the market who want
to get a CPU that can not only game but
also has the extra Headroom to process
frames even while it's encoding from the
CPU so let's straight away pull up some
benchmarks that are important to me
first of all DaVinci Resolve which is a
new program that's free and it does edit
videos in 4k this is where the 2950 X
really did well and in fact it beat the
2990 WX which was quite surprising Intel
did pretty well it does consistent
across the productivity numbers both the
18 core in the tank or but the 2950 X
was a shining example of really solid
price performance in this benchmark not
to mention you still had Headroom
because all the calls and threads
weren't being fully utilized but next up
here in the benchmark list we're gonna
pull up handbrake which is used to
transcode video transcoding a 13 minute
video from 4k to 1080p 30fps so love the
29 50x scored a sizable victory here was
pretty good also when it was overclocked
to 4.2 gigahertz it did even better
the 7900 x10 core was pretty good value
here as well the 7900 X however is
getting close to 100% utilization in
this particular benchmark so you do have
more headroom on that 29 50x when it
comes to handbrake moving across now to
the next benchmark which was W prime 2.1
this is a program that calculates
integers and it does it in 32 and a 102
4 million and the 102 4 million really
ramps up and then it utilizes all those
calls at 100% the 32m scores really look
a little bit bizarre because they're
constantly changing due to how quickly
all these CPUs can process this
benchmark but when it comes to the 102 4
numbers you saw here in a perfect world
how these CPUs can perform with 32 cores
64 threads winning here and then of
course at the end of the spectrum was
the 7900 X with its 10 cores and 20
threads losing this benchmark however a
hundred percent you
utilization of cause is something that a
lot of programs still can't do to this
date unless they get optimizations
Premiere Pro one of the most used
programs here at Tec your city because I
edit videos a lot in 4k shows that the
Intel optimizations that have been going
through the Adobe software have been
able to make the 79 80 X e come out with
a big victory in the 7900 X being a
hundred percent utilized is still
falling a little bit behind the 29 50 X
so the 29 50 X is doing really well in
its price performance in this benchmark
and you still got those head rooms with
the extra cores and threads versus the
7900 X counterpart and so these two CPUs
being similarly priced it does show that
the 2950 X is coming out with better
value in my opinion but we move over to
Adobe dimension which does take
advantage of more utilization on the AMD
side scoring near-perfect hundred
percent on the 29 50 X as opposed to the
twenty nine ninety WX which was
fluctuating just a little bit 2950 X
really comes out and showcases its value
and performance in this particular
benchmark but if you really want to see
the full potential of these CPU cores
from both AMD and Intel then Cinebench
is usually that synthetic that will show
you that in this case the 2990 WX does
do very well but the 2950 X at its 4.2
gigahertz overclock shows that with half
the cores and half the threads it can
still get up and boogie with a very
impressive score coming close to that of
the 79 80 X II which was very impressive
and beating out that of the 7900 X v-ray
was a similar story again with similar
types of utilization going at a hundred
percent and it show that the 2990 WX
again was coming out on top and the 7900
X was coming in last place but last up
here on the synthetics which is very
important to look at is the 3d mark
firestrike scores which does paint the
picture for gaming but also in terms of
the future potential in relation to
gaming in my opinion you see the 29 50 X
is scoring very impressive in the CPU
scores getting near 30k just like the 79
80 X 870 900 X does fall behind a little
bit and the 2990 WX really shows that
it's having trouble in
games and also this synthetic in
particular when we turn it to game mode
however you can see that twenty nine
ninety WH does do a lot better but again
we are turning the CPU essentially now
into 2700 X and at $1,800 that's a very
expensive 2700 X if you just want to
play games but now moving into another
figure here is power consumption because
I get asked a lot about temperatures and
cooling of these CPUs and because we're
comparing many different CPUs we've got
to take a look at the power consumption
figures because that's what you really
have to look at if you want to get a
cooler for your particular CPU check out
how much power consumption this CPU uses
and in this case the 2950 X is
performing very well here I believe it's
the most efficient out of all these four
CPUs in this particular benchmark where
I'm using i-264
to load up the CPUs to 100% but on the
other hand I feel like when you
overclock it you do lose some of that
efficiency on all of these SKUs at all
different speeds the 2990 WX with 32
cores 64 threads will need a solid
cooling solution but the 2950 X you'll
definitely be able to get away pretty
much all the time with the decent 240
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler and
in these benchmarks were using the
Animax TR for liquid cooler which has
its special bracket 4 X 3 99 though now
it's finally that time to move on to the
gaming benchmarks and here I decided
instead of doing straight gaming
benchmarks I decided to do streaming
benchmarks and I use the program called
xsplit 6 megabits per second 1080p 60fps
output which I believe a lot of
streamers will strive to get these
settings we use the fast encoding
setting as well because anything higher
generally will have pretty big 1% and
0.1% low dips and I guess if you're
streaming you do want to be good in
clutch situations because I guess that's
what people want to watch they want to
watch people who are really good at the
game so you do want a smooth experience
if you want to use this just as CPU to
do everything that's play the games and
encode the frames at the same time also
it's important to note for all these
tests I was using 32 hundred megahertz
CL 14
means on ddr4 memory I use it across all
different platforms the same amount of
memory the same timings on the same
memory itself let's move on with the
first benchmark however csgo we saw here
that the 7900 X was coming out in front
especially at 4.5 gigahertz even it's
all core boost out of the box is very
impressive and you're gonna see the
default settings still getting very high
as well on the 7900 X that's because a
lot of games aren't utilizing anywhere
near 10 cores 20 threads still to this
date so there's a lot more Headroom
across all of these CPUs but it is
important to know that 2950 X especially
in csgo is performing very well it's
performing so good - the fact that I
like what this CPUs about the point 1%
lows 1% lows they're very solid and now
moving on a de dota 2 the trend
continues with the 2950 X being a very
solid option having a lot of headroom so
if you want to do other things while
you're streaming at the same time
definitely a good option to look at
definitely the best value for money out
of these four CPUs with a 70 900 X if
you're just into streaming and gaming at
the same time is pulling the victory out
in dota 2 as well Monster Hunter a very
new title but all these CPUs handled
this game absolutely fine the AMD 2950 X
was doing very well in this particular
benchmark
7900 X again coming out with those 10
cores at 4.5 gigahertz which was a very
easily to obtain overclock and that's
one thing I'll talk about with my
overclocks in today's benchmarks all
these overclocked even though there are
different clock speeds they were all
very easy to obtain and they weren't
overloading the coolers nor were they
overloading the motherboards anyway next
up is a very important benchmark
fortnight and your pro think an hour
fortnight I don't like this game I'm
sick of seeing it but we got some really
good insight here as to what's going on
with single turbo speeds versus
overclocked speeds and the 2990 WX it
tanked in this benchmark just like it's
tanking in all the other games when
you've got the normal mode on you have
to really drop it down to a 2,700 X to
get good performance out of it and that
I believe is due to its quad channel
memory in the memory configuration of
the CPU to the bank's itself and that's
a weird thing we'll have to take a look
at that sometime later in the future but
what we
here now 29 50x performing very well but
even in this game the utilization on the
CPU is very low and what we can see with
the turbo speeds here is that they were
lower than they otherwise would be in
Cinebench and this is one reason why I
don't focus a whole lot on single core
boost performance or even in that case
recommending over clocks that are tiered
to single core performance because games
like fortnight's show
what's going on with single two are
called boost performance and I could
make a separate video to this later on
the future but what we see here is that
the cores are jumping up and down on the
ones that aren't being utilized fully so
we can see that two of the cause I think
it was call seven and nine were being
utilized near 100% and they weren't
going anywhere near those boost
frequencies on the single core to core
speeds that's because the other threads
were being utilized ever so slightly
which really confused the boost settings
in this particular game and this a
actually carried across to quite a few
games which is why the 4.2 gigahertz
overclock even though super user
utilization was overall low it was
winning in a lot of the games moving
over to pub G the frame rate cap has
finally been lifted and this enabled us
to get some really cool results 7900 X
again coming out on top with that 4.5
gigahertz overclock and similar to
fortnight the CPU utilization isn't the
best in this title even with all the
updates but it is great to see that
frame cap finally lifted moving over to
Tom Clancy's the last game we've got up
on display here for streaming Rainbow
six siege this did very well across
three CPUs the 2990 WX again tanking in
this particular benchmark so the 2950 X
coming out of this is looking like it's
the most relevant choice on the X 399
platform it's definitely going to be my
pick for someone who wants to do it all
have a lot of headroom
and get very good value for money the
2990 WX in that review I'll put the link
up here if you haven't seen it yet it's
mainly for those people who use one
application day in day out and they can
utilize all those 32 cores
64 threads and those applications are
very specific I'm yet to encounter that
in my workflow and have a need for the
2990 WS but the 2950 x
is definitely a champion that can do it
all and it can do it all in terms of
doing productivity better than the 7900
ex but still falling just a little bit
behind in gaming and I guess those
trade-offs are falling a little bit
behind in gaming but also having had
more Headroom for the future is
definitely one that I feels better value
so you've got better productivity better
creativity now slightly behind in gaming
but also more Headroom to do other
things whilst you're gaming so there's
that choice ultimately however that
you're left faced with what are you
looking for in a cpu there are different
options out there and they all are
relevant with different strokes for
different folks I feel like the 2950 X
however is probably the most relevant
CPU out of this bunch of CPUs here
because when it comes to just gaming
none of these CPUs are the best value
for money you're looking in either an
8700 K with a 1080i or you're looking at
the 2700 X which are a lot less
expensive and they do clock higher and
furthermore you've then got the benefits
of saving more money on your power
supplies because you won't have to push
as much power through these lower core
count CPUs cheaper motherboards x4 70
and z3 70 and also a cheaper cooler to
keep them cool so I will stress this
again if you're just into gaming 2700 X
and 8700 K are a lot better of a pick
they will give you more performance in
games and they will save you a lot of
money in other areas too but if you are
into streaming and heavy creativity and
productivity but you want something that
can still game then the 7900 X and the
2950 X are still very good choices and
of course if you want all those cores
and all those threads then those really
expensive options are for you so really
when it comes down to it there's a lot
more CPUs nowadays in 2018 that are
really getting specialized for different
markets I think we're seeing a general
segmentation of the market like we've
never seen before but we're also seeing
competition and value for money like
we've never seen before as well and the
2950 X is an awesome choice coming in at
$900 for someone who wants one of the
best in slot CPUs from AMD it's going to
have those improvements over the 1950 X
and it's got better latency it's a
refined process and you'll be able to
overclock it higher and it will be
power efficient than the previous
generation is that worth the extra cost
because I believe the 1950 X it's going
from around $750 at the moment that it
will be released later this month in
August but in my opinion I think it's
worth the premium to get that premium
upgrade on the 29 50 X over the 1950 X
especially me because I'm a manual
overclocker I would set this thing to
4.2 gigahertz and just have happy days
