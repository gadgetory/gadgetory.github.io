the Radeon 7 this is AMD's transition
from their previous flagship Vega 64
going from 14 nanometer down to seven
nanometer with this new flagship right
here and today we're gonna be comparing
it against the RT X 2070 RT X 2080 I'll
even throw in some extra graphics cards
like the Vegas 64 and the 1080 Ti and
with that said I'll also try to be
overclocking this thing and then I'll
overclock the RT X 2070 and I'm gonna
make a point of comparing this against
not only the RT of 2080 but also the RT
X 2070 because there's some of you to
come out of this review where it's going
to be probably one of the weirdest
recommendations because I'm going to be
testing at 21 by 9 as suggested by you
guys in the previous unboxing video and
I'm also gonna be testing out Resident
Evil 2 Crysis 3 which also got a lot of
uploads Forza 4 and also shadow of the
Tomb Raider and with that said let's get
straight into it with those benchmarks
for you guys
welcome back to tech s city let's get on
with those numbers straight away
Resident Evil 2 will pull up this
benchmark this was the best-case
scenario for the Radeon 7 in today's
benchmark numbers beating out that of
the 2080 and also the 2070 overclocked
now it is important to notice with these
overclocked figures I did put quotation
marks around them because the numbers
when I overclocked were virtually the
same as not overclocking and that's
because I just simply couldn't extract
basically any more performance out of
the Radeon seven it's like it had a mind
of its own where it would have found its
sweet spot straight out of the box now
this is an odd thing I did manage to
increase the power limit 5% but if I try
to overclock the memory even just a
slight bit but also even the clock
speeds say for instance 30 megahertz in
the Radeon Whatman software I just
couldn't get anything out of it even
pushing the fan speeds to a hundred
percent which we'll talk about that
later with thermals and noise we just
really couldn't get anything out of this
card in terms of overclocks but
irregardless of that Resident Evil 2 was
a good showing that I guess shows the
potential of the Radeon seven card
moving over now to hitman two this was
on the other end of the spectrum and
here we can see that the 2070 was even
beating out the Radeon seven when it
wasn't even overclocked so the 2080 is
well ahead but the 2070 not even
overclocked shouldn't be beating out the
Radeon seven so perhaps AMD still have
to optimize their card for this
particular title but now pulling up
battlefield 5 for you guys this game
does perform better in DX 11 then it
does in DX 12 so we're gonna keep that
dx11 option ticked on here 21 by 9 ultra
wide 1440p numbers with the max settings
at Ultra here on the presets show that
the Radeon 7 was kind of again falling
behind the 2070 when the 27 he was
overclocked and now it is important for
me when I do these overclocked numbers I
like to include them because in the case
of the 2070 it's easy to get that extra
performance out of it and there's a lot
of cards that are coming in even cheaper
than the founders editions especially in
Australia then you can overclock and the
noise levels won't Eve
be that loud in particular this Galax
card that I have here right on the desk
the 2080 is pulling ahead in this title
comfortably but the Vega 64 card is a
long shot behind the Radeon seven so it
is good to see that AMD is now sort of
keeping up with the bunch of new cards
from Nvidia
but now moving on to Forza horizon for
1440p ultra wide numbers max settings on
the dial we use the in-house benchmark
here and this was where the Archie x28
he was pulling ahead slightly same with
the 1080 TI but the 2070 overclocked was
sort of catching up to the Radeon seven
so perhaps in this title does need a
little bit more optimisation but the
Radeon 7n was pulling far ahead of its
predecessor of the Vegas 64 so that is
good to see that this new card from AMD
again just like the previous titles is
still packing some punches now next up
here is Rainbow six siege an online
competitive multiplayer title ultra
settings 1440p ultra wide again we've
got the 2070 actually pulling ahead when
it's not even overclocked and then when
it's overclocked it gets even a bigger
gain with that the 2080 and then the
2080 ti coming even more ahead than the
2070 so this wasn't a good result for
the Radeon 7 but now moving on to that
much requested title from you guys
Crysis 3 2070 is falling behind the
Radeon 7 and the 28 he's pulling ahead
just by a bit but the overclocked 2070
is starting to pull just a little bit
ahead of Radeon 7 in this benchmark as
well next up here we have Far Cry 5 and
the Radeon 7 was coming second best here
only being surpassed by the 2080 Ti so
was being the 2080 1080i NRT X 2070 even
when that was overclocked and then the
last title we had up here was shadow of
the Tomb Raider DX 12 high settings
1440p ultra wide Radeon 7 was beating
out a 1080 Ti and also the 2070
overclock did not overclocked 20/80 just
pulling ever so slightly ahead of our
new brethren from the 7 nanometer
dimension right here and then pulling up
lastly some synthetics for you guys 3d
mark fire strike and then also time spy
extreme showed us some decent numbers
especially
coming well ahead of that of the Vegas
64 from the previous generation now on
that note of the previous generation
Vegas 64 in Vega 56 for that matter they
were capped by the HBM bandwidth and the
speeds more civically in this case
Radeon 7 when you overclock the memory I
feel it's not going to make much of a
difference even though when I try to
overclock the memory it just crashed
this time around they've doubled the
memory from a gigabytes of HP m2 to 16
gigabytes of HB m2 and the big thing is
here people probably like that's a lot
of memory it's probably too much yes I
do agree I think it's a lot of memory to
put on a $700 graphics card but at the
same time it does have a purpose and
that is to actually double the bandwidth
to on this graphics card versus the
predecessors the Vega 64 for example
because in this case with HBM 2 since it
does stack it opens it up to a 4096 bit
wide bus on the memory interface so that
enables that I think breathing room for
the HBM to perform better when we saw in
the previous generation with Vegas 64
and Bagan 56 especially when you started
overclocking that HBM memory you saw
some big performance gains as opposed to
the actual clock speeds of the GPU
itself so even though the GPU is about
200 megahertz higher it's performing a
lot better because I feel that they've
stacked that a gigabytes up to 16
gigabytes and they're reaping the
performance benefits this time around
and also on top of that the reason why
they're able to double up the memory is
because they've shrunk down the die size
from 495 millimeters squared down to 331
millimeters skirt thanks to the 7
nanometer process that they're using
this time around which also increases
the transistor count ever so slightly
from 12.5 billion to 13.2 billion on
Radeon 700 ver the one ironic thing vs.
Vegas 64 is that they've reduced the
stream processors from 4096 down of 3840
so now all the previous benefits with
just discussed are pretty much to solely
thank to the TSM c7 nanometer node that
they are using going from 40 nanometer
to seven nanometer is a huge drop and
with that we're going to see power
efficiency on the increase as well
however the Vegas 64 card does still
consume about the same amount of power
as the Radeon seven it's just that the
Radeon seven performs a lot better so it
is good to see that this new design here
on Radeon seven isn't doing too bad as
opposed to Vegas 64 for instance which
came well under a 1080 Ti in terms of
performance but in turn used a bit more
power than the 1080 Ti so it was kind of
surprised to see that the Radeon seventh
not doing too bad but one important
thing to note is that Nvidia hasn't
dropped their process down yet so that
is still a sleeve that they have up
their hands as opposed to AMD using it
now with Radeon seven that's enough of
me babbling let's talk about this
graphics card itself it weighs in at one
point three kilos comes in at around
twenty seven centimeters long is a dual
slot card also features a backplate and
a Radeon logo that lights up as well as
the red little cube on the side that
lights up with it it requires two eight
pin power connectors and then on the
rear you get three DisplayPort 1.4 s and
a hatch DMI to out the triple 80ml fans
also make this card so much better than
the previous reference vegas 64 and vega
56 models allowing it to get only 30
decibels on idle with 23% fan speeds
measured roughly in the global Whatman
and then testing it out in UniGene
heaven with full stress soros get 58%
fan speeds with 46 decibels of noise
reaching a temperature of 70 degrees
Celsius now the room temperature on
ambience was 26 degrees Celsius stepping
it up to 60% fan speeds manual saw 47
decibels 69 degrees then 80% saw 64
degrees Celsius 56 decibels and then max
speeds was pretty much unbearable 100%
fan speeds 59 decibels 61 degrees
Celsius so the sweet spot for this card
is around 60% I'm guessing that's pretty
much old fans implemented on graphics
cards start to hit a inefficiency curve
in terms of noise in actual performance
after 60% we're seeing this again on
this graphics card not just with the
auto profile but also with the manual 60
percent fan speeds so the last test I
wanted to do for you guys was when I was
at sea yes I noticed
AMD made a point of testing productivity
numbers and saying that they
I got some big gains and then for
instance Adobe Premiere Pro they got a
25 percent gain in final render times
and then I saw how they did that and it
was with 8k footage and I did raise this
concern to AMD I thought to myself well
someone's spending $30,000 plus on 8k
camera gear is not going to be using a
gaming graphics card to edit and render
out footage and so for me personally I
do 4k workflow and the recent video I
did was a 20 minute render with the
Darth Jar Jar build and I applied some
lewd metric color effects ten band EQ
and the final render times really didn't
see a difference even a 10 70 I was
still punching up there with the Vegas
64 and the Radeon 7 and you wanna get
the most out of dobie Premiere Pro for
example at the moment then you
definitely want to think about using
quick sync anyway guys all this boils
down to the recommendation and
conclusion with Radeon 7 what do I think
of this card I think honestly for
starters it's a much better
implementation of a reference card than
Vegas 64 and Vega 56 ever was I really
was unimpressed with those two cards
when they launched this here is decent
it's not mind-blowing performance but
it's a solid implementation of a
graphics card from AMD I will start with
the build quality for starters they've
got a cooler that is implemented well
it's implemented properly
it's got good display options at the
rear it's also got a very nice aesthetic
as opposed to the previous reference
cards that they release with the Vegas
64 and 56 but in terms of stacking up
against the competition here's where
things get a little bit tricky and this
is where my recommendation is gonna sway
in two different ways depending on your
budget and of course you've got free
sync to support but Nvidia have recently
updated their drivers to now have their
gravis card support free sync monitors
so that's kind of not really a benefit
anymore with AMD graphics cards solely
and specifically but in terms of the 16
gigabytes of HBM - there is a purpose
for it on this gravis card it's not just
to get the 16 gigabytes of wow we've got
so much V RAM on board
it's actually implemented on this card
to get performance increases but in
terms of the r-tx 2017 I leave this on
the desk here because it's probably
going to be this or this depending on
what you want to go with and you'll
notice that there's no RT X 2080 here on
the desk and that's because when I first
reviewed the RT X 2080 I wasn't really
impressed with that card at all I
thought it was a step down from a 1080i
because you went from 11 gigabytes of
vram down to a gigabytes of vram but
then you got these speeches r-tx
features that really didn't apply to
many games and even when they did apply
they were giving you performance hits or
degradation in image quality and so in
yet to still see the full benefits of RT
X features from RT X gravis cards but in
terms of raw performance and value for
money
I think this here is a good buy compared
to the RT X 2080 I just don't think it's
a good buy compared to the RT X 2070
especially when I know you can overclock
this and get good performance figures
out of it this card here the Radeon 7 is
still up in the air
in terms of overclocking and drivers
support because this graphics card here
I'm going to come back in a month's time
and take another look at it in terms of
overclocking and also driver updates and
see if we can extract more performance
because I know over time this numbers on
the 2070 are slowly creeping up towards
that of 1080 TI levels and it is slowly
nudging ahead in some titles especially
when you overclock it so what we've got
here is a weird recommendation where I'd
rather be buying an RX 570 at the bottom
then I'd go to an RT X 2060 then I go to
an RT X 2070 then I go to a Radeon 7 and
then if I had a lot of money and I
didn't care I just wanted the best
performance then you've got the 2080 Ti
so $700 I actually think it's ok and
it's a viable option and that's because
I think the RT x 2080 could have used
more vram and if they did put 11
gigabytes on the 2080 and gave it maybe
even a little bit more performance my
recommendation here today would probably
be different so AMD were pretty smart I
think to go after the 2080 in a direct
comparison to it and sort of fill that
ice cap with the Radeon seven but in
terms of the 27e this is coming at a 500
bucks and when you overclock it
especially it does come very close and
sometimes beats it out in some titles as
opposed to Radeon seven and yes this has
got eight gigabytes but at 1440p I'm
sure a lot of people would be buying
this graphics card for 1440p because I
actually don't know many people that
play games at 4k despite 4k benchmarks
being very numerous
I think 1440p high refresh rates and
1080p Ultra even 1080p anyway guys this
review has gone on and on I really want
to know what you guys think in the
comments about Radeon 7 and also our TX
2070 and 2080 sort of this group of
gravis cards is very interesting because
I in the past I haven't come into this
dilemma and so do you think my
recommendation is right do you think
it's wrong I do want to revisit this
gravis card and also the eggie worth of
erm on the 2017-2018
versus the 6 thinking about such HBM to
let us know some tests that you guys
would like to see with that in the
comment section below and I'll do a
follow-up video with vram in an
investigation because on resident evil 2
when I upped the texture quality and
sort of made it go past this vram limit
it didn't change performance whatsoever
but I will be investigating that so let
us know in the comment section below
what tests you want to see also let us
know what you think about Radeon 7 and
my recommendation here today love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and also if you enjoyed this
video then be sure to hit that like
button and if you want to see the
content the moment it drops be sure to
hit the sub button turn the little bell
on and if you want to get that inside
scoop before it even gets to YouTube
instagrams there for your tech yes City
and I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon
he's out for now bye
Vega 64 flagship graphics card now of
course I should I say gravis card now
