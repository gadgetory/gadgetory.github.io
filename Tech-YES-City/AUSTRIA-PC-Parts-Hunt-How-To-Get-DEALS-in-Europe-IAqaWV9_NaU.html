landed in absolutely fine I've recovered
and after that deals hunt as well that
bust in Italy which things went okay but
now this time around we have a
home-field advantage and that is Ron he
has a car he also speaks Austrian and
fluent English he's also got a channel
called Tec therapy so he's really good
at building custom pcs and today we're
going to go deals hunting through a
couple of sites so if you're in Austria
there are two main ways to get PC parts
and that is through will Harbin which is
kind of like gum tree and Craigslist's
if you're overseas but also there's that
website and that app that we used before
spark which was good and Italy it's sort
of like a smartphone quick snap and get
those deals so we're gonna be browsing
both of those but the good news is as
well we've already picked up a couple of
deals so let's get you used PC parts
hunting capes on and go for the hunt
welcome by detects any before we start
this deals hunt there is already some
deals that I've lined up on the app
Spock one of those being 32 gigabytes of
ddr3 Vengeance memory got this 495 euro
shipped and we've also lined up 16
gigabytes of ddr3 vengeance this is some
really decent stuff in terms of X and P
profiles this is 55 euro we can go pick
this up later today and then there's
also a PC a whole PC with a 1050 Ti I
570 400 gigabytes of ddr4 memory one
terabyte hard drive of Zeus motherboard
everything got this for 250 euros
shipped so some of these deals the
shipping might come in after I leave but
that's not a problem because Ron said he
can make me a little stash pack and then
send that over to Australia so it's not
a big problem I guess the whole meaning
of today is to show that yes with the
home-field advantage
we're gonna get those deals
so here we are now and we're going on to
will haben and we pulled up a heap of
different graphics cards scrolling
through here that's anything from gtx
660 s the gtx 770 s26 ats to 970 defect
which we drop in a real low offer
perhaps of reball could definitely do
the trick that it's also a 1050 here
going really cheap
we might even come under that with money
like an offer of 60 and that price would
be well worth it
780ti as well hopefully we can go lower
than these offers main ones here that
I'm looking forward to calling up though
is the 980 s and they both go on for
pretty decent prices as they are but
especially this one here with the custom
Arctic cooling solution if we get this
down to 160 it would make it really
worthwhile then there's some 10 70s
which were mined on there going for I
believe 310 euro if we came in maybe 250
and they took that that'd be a decent
price yet again today we've got I 739
30k as well 75 euro even at the asking
price that's a decent deal we're gonna
come in maybe with like 55 euro so we
can score that but then there's this one
here an honorable mention because this
is actually quite a rare board nowadays
x79 micro ATX rampage or gene this is a
really good board whilst 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 if you're in Austria you put an
offer of 250 you just may get this
recently I wouldn't go for it as I
bought 2 X 79 boards recently they were
the big brother of this and I got them
for really good deals but we'll talk
about that in a separate video and then
last up here we've got a PC and it's 135
asking price we're gonna come in really
low here 75 because I don't think
anyone's putting offers on this and it's
got what I want 1 terabyte hard drive I
three decent motherboard and some RAM to
boot so 70 Europe it would be a decent
deal
so basically now we've hit the road and
we've got a few deals lined up of course
some of the deals we have to meet the
people after 7:00 p.m. now in Austria
the Sun especially in summer sets really
late things like 8:30 9:00 so feels like
it's like 3:00 in the afternoon yet it's
already almost 6 p.m. but first deal we
got lined up here is the i7 3930k we
ended up scoring this the 60 euro we're
going to go pick that up right now it's
about 20 minutes down the road so we
just on the highway now and what a deal
I think that's like a hundred Australian
dollars US dollars even less but what
we're gonna do is we keep picking up
these deals and then once we get all the
deals I'll tally up the prices for you
guys to see how we went
right so we got the first deal here
we're just driving out of what's this
town called shuffling shuffling okay so
we're just getting out of shuffling
we've picked up the 3930k got this for
60 euro it's time to go get ourselves a
gtx 980 now
so just got done picking up this here
the GTX 980 we've got this for a hundred
and seventy euro I think that's around
two hundred and seventy Ozzie dollars
this is the Strix Edition as well so
pretty much one of the best and the best
when it comes to the GTX 960 my pict up
a GTX 980 gigabyte for 250 but for me
personally I'd rather pay an extra $20
for a Strix Edition card with that said
let's go pick up the next deal
so now we just got the last deal for
today from I'm Devon this is a GTX 1060
I actually found this on Spock I was
going for 150 euro put in an offer of
130 he came back at 140 and we just sort
of said look we're on the road we can
come and pick this thing up now and he
agreed for 130 so that is pretty much
because it's getting late now it's like
almost 9 o'clock even though there's
still sort of sunlight out which it's
crazy we're going to actually postpone
the next deal which is a GTX 680 which
we're gonna pick up for 45 euro we're
gonna postpone that till tomorrow
because that's on the other side like
it's over a 40-minute drive away and Ron
has to go there in the morning anyway so
we're gonna pick that deal up in the
morning and that pretty much is where
we're gonna come back from tonight we're
gonna head back home and then take a
quick look at what we've got
so now we're back at Ron's place and
this is the GTX 980 and that is one deal
in the bag the Strix we've got the KF a2
which is what galaxy's called I believe
in the EU and that is a GTX 10 63
gigabyte and then we've got these 3930k
so that concludes today's pickups we've
also got some of those deals being
posted I don't know if they'll make it
in time whilst I'm still in Austria's
actually have to leave tomorrow night
but tomorrow morning we're definitely
going to be getting on that grind again
hustling them deals seeing what we can
pick up and seeing what will finally go
into the suitcase before I head on over
to Japan but how do we say that an
Austrian I don't want to hear it in the
comments down here you should been
nicked incoming Thailand so now we just
got this deal right here this is the GTX
680 picked this up for 45 euro and the
good thing is it comes with a water
block as well and they stock cooler so
really neat deal considering a GTX 680
in Australia usually goes for around a
hundred Australian dollars and you still
don't get a water block with that as
well so really nice pickup let's get
back on the road and see what else we
can get
and to quickly recap the deals that
we've actually confirmed now we've got
32 gigabytes of ddr3 memory Corsair
Vengeance scored that we've got a GTX
980 GTX 1060 a whole PC with a GTX 1050
Ti and an i5 7400 a 3930k and also a GTX
680 these are all the deals we pick
these up for 740 euro in total which is
about 866 US dollars on the current
change rate or if you're in Australia
1165 so Austria has definitely been good
to me and this was only over a couple of
days so I did this yesterday and today
so one and a half days the two days
before this I was recovering resting up
and doing a bit of sightseeing has
actually got a cold when I was over in
Italy but here we are guys deer hunting
you can do it in Europe but one thing of
course is you've got to speak the local
lingo the local language one thing I
will say about Austria however is that I
find on average a lot more people here
speak English than they did in Italy
people looked at me strange when I just
try to speak some English in Italy but
in Austria they actually spoke back to
me especially a lot of the younger
generation so that was interesting of
course if you're going to Europe and the
official language of the country is not
English then I sort of wouldn't Bank on
hoping that people spoke English but I
think in Austria you could get by if you
didn't speak English I think it's
definitely possible but anyway right now
we're going to change the water block
over to the staff cooler so I can fit
that in the suitcase lighten up the
burden a little bit and then we are
going to head off to Vienna
so before I go I'm actually gonna give
the waterblock to Ron since he does a
lot of hard line custom water loops and
also on that note this does have a lot
of like someone's been putting this
maybe on carpet or cat fur mighta got
honors or something and so there is a
little bit of gunk on this and you don't
want that touching the PCB because it
can cause problems so an easy solution
for this is to just simply flip the pads
over to the clean side so that'll be
touching the PCB and you won't have to
worry about changing pads in this case
because I could use these pads here but
they're thinner than these and that can
cause problems as well
so we just picked up the i5 8400 got
that for 120 euro now something Crazy's
happened I've got about two hours and 20
minutes before I get get to the airport
but another deals come out 50 euro for a
GTX 1050 so we're gonna quickly hustle
that put that in the suitcase as well
and then we jump on a plane
so now here we are I'm right before the
gate I've got 15 minutes to a boarding
time the 10:50 that was a bus the guy he
sold it to someone else but the ddr3 16
gigabytes they go back to your head and
come back so anyway he's gonna get that
tomorrow Austria has been absolutely
amazing and Ron right here he is the
Austrian gun when it comes to getting
those deals absolutely phenomenal and
just always on the hunt always on the
grind Austria proved that you can get
deals where it's you you just got to be
on your hustle be on your grind and here
I am now I'm gonna be heading to Japan
doing the exact same thing because I do
speak the lingo I know where to go and a
big thanks to run as well for hosting us
absolutely awesome love you guys in the
community love what Ron's doing if you
have any questions or comments be sure
to drop a comment the comment section
below and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon cheers for now
bye oh wait it's peace out for now oh
wait take one piece out for now bye
so Ron's also taught me how to say some
of the company names in Austrian as Zeus
is our Zeus EVGA is a folder and then
MSI is MSG and then gigabytes gigabyte
and then I think as rock is a sure doc
so here we are finally in Austria and
we've finally yeah this freaked me out
the Z key is located over here and the Y
key is changed over here I think this is
unique to Austria Germany and
Switzerland</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
