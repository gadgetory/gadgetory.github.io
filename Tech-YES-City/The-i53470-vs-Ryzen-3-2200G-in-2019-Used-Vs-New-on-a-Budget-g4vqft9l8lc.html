2600 installed in a previous video that
we did but now I've installed a risin
320 200 G now this is a fork or 4
threaded option that comes in at $80
currently on the market great option for
getting into PC gaming on a budget but
also on top of that it's got a graphics
portion built on board so if you're in
an extreme budget and you can't afford a
GPU upgrade you can use this reliably at
720p low settings and still get decent
FPS and all that for $80 makes it a good
proposition but what if you want to get
a solid gaming graphics card like the rx
570 or the GTX 1650 and you want to get
more performance than the Rison 320 200
G's APU option then is that CPU those
four cores brand-new at $80 still worth
it or is getting something like this
right here beside me a used om system
with an i-5 3470 a gigabytes of ram
motherboard cooler and a Windows 10
license better spent than getting the
rise into 2,200 G well today we're going
to be testing out this I 530 470 which
is pretty much seven years old I believe
and then putting that against AMD's
budget fork or option with the rx 570
and the gtx 1650 to see how much better
the new counterpart fares against the
used counterpart if you're in the market
for a z3 90 motherboard and vocabulary
isn't a word in your budget then the
phantom gaming 7 has you covered from
asrock with a superior updated aesthetic
in 2019 with a pre-installed IO shield
and RGB support with addressable in both
12-volt options and a 2.5 Gigabit Nick
onboard amazing onboard audio and the
ability to overclock and 9900 K to
kingdom come
this is the board that's going to please
value lovers that aren't on a budget
links in description below
before we get on with the benchmarks and
ultimately the verdict however I want to
talk about what I believe there's some
misconceptions in the use market at the
moment some people on the discord like
to rag on use price performance but I
think it's probably because they've got
some new gear and they're so proud of
their new parts and they just don't see
the market appeal of use price per se
and me being an enthusiast of
use price-performance for years now I
know how good value for money this stuff
really is especially if you're getting
some of those local deals and some of
the arguments that come through a like
okay the new stuff has all support for
the latest features USB 3.2 and more
PCIe lanes PCI 3.0 ddr4 memory and
honestly a lot of that stuff when you
really break it down is more geared
toward things like 4k video editing for
example or batch processing mass amounts
of raw photographs or making music or
doing a number of other things that
don't involve gaming I'd argue if you're
a gamer and you're on a budget use price
performance is always the way to go
because the only productivity that I
know personally in gaming is getting the
most FPS and if you're on a strict
budget then you're definitely going to
get more FPS for your dollar on use
price performance than you ever will in
the new market the second argument I see
raised is used products are generally
going to be more faulty er than new
products and that depends I'd argue if
you go pick up the parts and you witness
them working in action I'd say there's a
good chance that they're gonna still
work especially when you investigate
things like the caps and make sure
they're not bulging which is a big red
flag in the used market but if the caps
are nice and they're looking good still
and that's a general indication that
that product still has a good amount of
life left in it and also on that note in
the last two weeks here in the studio
I've had to faulty brand new hard drives
a faulty brand new ddr4 memory stick and
also a faulty brand-new power supply now
of course I do get the warranty which is
the advantage of new parts but on that
note is still a hassle for me to
organize warranty go get the product
returned replaced and even then I've got
some downtime between now and when I get
that product that replaced one back here
in the studio so new parts do carry
their risks just like use parts the next
argument in line is the security flaws
and the risks they pose for certain
people now as an individual who plays
video games and someone who recommends a
lot of hardware to people who play video
games on a budget I'm gonna step out and
say that I believe you have literally
nothing to worry about in this sense and
that's because these security flaws
there's not one
reported case of someone being affected
by these security exploits second thing
is as well is that the next round of
exploits apparently Intel's own in-house
team found them themselves and on that
note what better incentive to sell new
CPUs than to say that the previous
generations of CPUs that aren't getting
any dedicated patches for them have
security flaws so basically go buy a new
CPUs because our old ones could leave
your business and all that personal
information at risk seems a little bit
too convenient but the last point in
relation to this subject is that if
someone is that talented like I mean
they're on another level with the
hacking skills I do not believe they're
going to target someone like you or I
who only has a few dollars in the bank
they're going to be going for some much
and believe it when I say this much
bigger juicier targets out there in
terms of what monetary items and assets
they have and then the second last of
the arguments to pull up here and I
believe is just like the instruction
sets probably a very valid one is the
upgrade ability and after we roll the
benchmarks we'll talk a little bit more
about this in depth the last argument is
some of the instruction sets on the
older CPUs they just simply aren't there
and so the newer CPUs support these new
instruction sets like avx2 for example
and those same instructions can then
make their way into games and if they're
not there then you can't either play the
game or you'll get a bad experience in
terms of FPS it'll be stuttery or you
just won't get the FPS that you
otherwise would on a new CPU now we saw
this in apex legends with really old
CPUs pre FX CPUs just simply didn't work
and that's pretty much where I've
stopped a featuring LGA 775 I've also
haven't really used those old really old
phenom for example on the channel here
and the reason being is it's not just
because they're really old it's because
they support ddr2 and a lot of the times
they come into problems with the
motherboards just having not been taken
care of after all that time and then
they don't simply work properly but for
me personally things like second third
and fourth gen Intel's especially some
of the OEMs are really good value for
money just promise me one thing
this arrow don't go buying an HP and
then saying use price-performance is bad
you can generally extract a lot of value
out of Dell's Lenovo's and aces and with
that you're getting the whole CPU
motherboard RAM and a genuine Windows
license and a lot of the time getting a
used hard drive that still works
absolutely fine for less than the price
of a brand-new CPU it was all that aside
let's get on with these benchmarks and
then talk about the numbers
so after going through all those numbers
for you guys apex legends the first game
we pulled up new title in 2019 but this
title honestly didn't see any
differences on either the gtx 1650 or
the RX 570 across both Rison 320 200 G
rising 5 2600 the e5 2620 v2 and also
the i-5 34 70 now both the Intel CPUs
are on Ivy Bridge and of course both the
rising CPUs are on rise and second
generation but may be able to dota 2
which is an older title this was running
on DirectX 9 which is what it defaults
to now and I have noticed in recent
months that they had some problems on
dx11 and boot issues so I think they've
defaulted to dx9 with this title and
it's interesting to see these numbers
because the four cores pretty much
battled it out in this title the lower
clock to Xeon didn't do as well and then
of course the risin 5 2600 came ahead
when we overclocked the memory speeds
now the memory speeds did play a big
factor in this game because it is pretty
much single threaded dependent and with
that the high ram speeds will make a
difference to since I only clocked it
manually to 3.8 gigahertz with the 32
hundred megahertz memory and on the four
core believe it's only around 200
megahertz extra boost so the ram speeds
were making a bit of a difference in
this game but on that note the FPS on
all four of these CPUs with these budget
graphics cards is perfectly playable if
you're on a budget you got a 60 FPS
monitor you're gonna get a smooth
experience across all four these CPUs
now move over to hitman 2 dx12 this
pretty much saw no difference across the
board
it was nothing to write home about the
gtx 1650 losing to the RX 570 in this
particular title at 1080p medium
settings and really smooth experience
across all four CPUs but now turning
things back to csgo
here we had the Rison 3 falling behind
the rosen 5 and then the ivy bridge a
full core was beating out the 6 core and
it was pulling some decent FPS so both
the rising 3 and the risin 5 CPUs were
pulling ahead of the Ivy Bridge CPUs in
this benchmark but one thing if I do
remember correctly is it's not so much
to do with these scene
threaded speeds in this title as I
believe it has to do more so at the
memory speeds is something I'm going to
be following up on since we don't have
the option on both of these Ivy Bridge
CPUs to manually change the RAM speeds
so I couldn't test if that was a factor
in this particular game but I have known
from experience with the X 5650 for
example which is an older architecture
but has triple-channel support and I was
able to overclock memory that this CPU
in particular has fared better than
these two Ivy Bridge Zeon's and that's
Westmere which is two generations behind
the CPUs from Intel in this video but
moving over to the next title resident
evil 2 and we had here nothing to write
home about
very smooth experience on all four CPUs
across both graphics cards nothing out
of the ordinary here except the Intel
CPUs were repeatedly doing just a little
bit better than the rise in CPUs even
when the memory was overclocked on the
rising counterparts only a couple of
percentage points which in the grand
scheme of things is absolutely nothing
and speaking of the grand scheme here's
where dota 2 and csgo showed quite a big
difference for the higher clock two CPUs
the six core Xeon did fall behind by
quite a bit in these two titles though
the other three titles we tested were
absolutely fine all the FPS figures were
very close to one another however on the
note of dota 2 and csgo is playing with
over 80 FPS in the case of dota 2 and
playing with over 120 FPS and csgo a bad
thing I don't think so I think if you're
on a budget
these FPS figures are going to be
absolutely fine for a good gaming
experience in fact if you went out and
bought all four of these CPUs and
coupled it with either of these two
graphics cards you're gonna have a
really good gaming experience of course
the Rison 5 2600 is going to do a lot
better when you start coupling it with
cards like the RT x 2070 and better or
the Vega 56 and better on the AMD side
so it just depends on your budget but in
terms of getting something like an RX
570 used for $80 and then coupling with
an $18 CPU like the xeon or an i-5 3470
that you've pulled out
they used OEM it's going to give you
great performance there's not a whole
lot of reason in my opinion to go out
and spend all that extra money on the
new parts when you're not really going
to be getting any extra FPS at all
when it comes to these two graphics
cards but on that note the new parts
will have a much better upgrade path if
you get a be 450 motherboard you can
upgrade the CPU in the future sell your
old CPU but here's where I do have a bit
of experience and I've got friends here
on the Gold Coast who flipped PCs all
the time the amount of trade-ins we get
versus people that come in and want to
upgrade their system or people that we
know about it stores retail stores that
come in getting parts wanting to upgrade
the systems is far less to the people
who just want to trade in their old
system get a completely new system and
not have to think twice about that old
system but with that said that's why I
do believe in doing these budget builds
on the channel because you make that PC
once and then in a fuse time just get
rid of it and get the next latest and
greatest thing out because in my opinion
by the time you're ready to upgrade your
system in two or three years time
there's going to be a lot of other
components that are just are the better
or much cheaper for instance look at the
storage it's come down a lot to the
point where it's almost better to just
go out and buy a whole SSD rather than
an SSD in a hard drive and new graphics
architectures like Navi and also Intel's
Arctic sound are on the uptick and
they're going to bring some value for
money in the new scene which then of
course trickles down to the use scene
and makes the use price performance even
better so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button let us know in the
comment section below what you think of
use price performance but I know one
thing for sure and that is if you're an
avid techie a citizen then you already
know that use price performance is just
unreal hope you enjoyed this one and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
