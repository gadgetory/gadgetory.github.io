products some of which just had a bad
price but today's guide is gonna look at
some of those products that are just bad
period in that I wouldn't recommend them
to anyone whatsoever
for example the GT 1030 ddr4 version
this is easily by far the worst product
on the list because it came out silently
in that it just started hitting the
retail shelves and no one knew that they
were getting a switch-up
the worst thing about this product is it
pretty much has the same price tag as
the gddr5 variant but it performs a lot
less in fact the performance is so bad
on the ddr4 version that the Rison apu
the 2200 g will get far more FPS on
similar games in similar scenarios and
the GCL 5 version wasn't a bad card it
could still get up and play for tonight
dota 2 and all those competitive
multiplayer titles and I guess this was
the appeal of it initially so I'm not
entirely sure why Nvidia chose to do
this if I had to hazard a guess I'd say
it's that the GT 1030 was perhaps
selling too well especially compared to
previous generation low-end cards and so
when a $70 graphics card is perhaps
selling too well and then there's other
higher priced options that would make
more profit maybe this was an option for
them to push people towards the
direction of buying for instance the GTX
1050 Ti or a GTX 1060 and hence the ddr4
version is just not recommended to
anyone in any situation but let's check
out what else made today's list and what
products you should avoid
welcome back to Tiger City and straight
up next on the list was a monitor they
reviewed from biotech it was definitely
looking good on the surface in that the
value for money was there you had a
hundred and forty four Hertz curve
display 27 inch VA panel that gave good
viewing angles and the colors were
pretty good except the fact that this
monitor was targeted towards gamers and
when I tested out the response times
there in fact some of the worst I've
seen on a VA panel especially in 2018
this was to the stage where three
different images were coming out on the
same frame in other words it would just
be one big blurry experience to top
things off with this monitor it easily
had the worst build quality of any
monitor I've ever had the experience of
using in my life sivaiah tech please if
you're watching this I'd like to see you
improve on your monitors in 2019 coming
up next on this list is ebay fake
graphics cards that's right folks I've
had messages from people and even
locally here people telling me I bought
this gravis card and it's
underperforming it doesn't even run some
of the games and I had some of these
fake gravis cards here on hand and I
experienced the same thing they would
just complete garbage even at the price
points that they're selling out which is
easily well under what others are asking
for a legitimate product of the same
caliber these things were just total
garbage avoid at all costs and in fact
if you got hit with one of these and
then you started loading up games and
the FPS was really low you should
definitely try and get your money back
come here next series the RT x series
more specifically the RT x 2080 because
when this was first released it had
pretty much the same price point as a
1080 TI but the problem was was that it
performed in some of the titles actually
most the titles a little bit worse and
the top all that off it had three
gigabytes less vram not to mention the
efficiency benefits weren't really there
and then when you looked at the RT x
features that were promised to come with
these cards they really didn't work at
all on the release date and even
fast-forward to this date windows has
rolled back the 1809 update so a lot of
people can't even use these features
even though in video is trying to
improve them and they're trying to roll
out things like
DLS s the r-tx 2070 on the flip side I
did however sort of like what that card
was doing certainly it wasn't great for
two years in the making and the 2080 T I
did offer more performance over the 1080
TI but it did so at using a lot more
power so the RT X 2007 general was a
little bit of a letdown in 2018 next up
here in the list we have two different
graphics cards that if you did buy them
they're not going to leave you high and
dry they'll still play games quite well
it's just compared to their normal
counterparts they aren't a good buy and
I wouldn't recommend them to anyone
first up is the rx 580 2048 SP these
were sold in the Chinese domestic market
and there are really just an rx 570 and
rebadged is an RX 580 I'm not entirely
sure what AMD was doing with this naming
scheme comes in similar to the GT 1030
in terms of the naming but at least in
this case the card will perform quite
well I mean an RX 570 certainly does get
up and boogie at 1080p and then to
follow up with this we had the GTX 1060
5 gigabyte I actually had one of these
on hand and it performed in some cases
worse than the GTX 1063 gigabyte because
it had reduced memory bandwidth this
really affected the performance of the
card itself and ironically both these
cards come in a similar price points for
instances of gtx 1066 gigabyte and an RX
580 2304 stream processors and then
coming up last on the list here is
budget chipset motherboards from both
Intel which is the h3 10 and then from
AMD which is the a320 if you can get
these on sale and you know that's all
you need then they can be ok but at
their retail prices you generally just
want to spend a little bit extra and get
for instance a be 350 which will give
you the ability to overclock your cpu
and in the case of the a320 you can
overclock and on a lot of those budget
rising processes you can extract so much
value by just simply going into the bass
and upping the CPU multiplier on the
intel side however the H 3/10 or reduced
features compared to the B 360 and this
enabled it just really to come out as
poor value especially compared to
previous years
their budget chipset lineup anyway guys
there's pretty much the worst products
of 2018 for enthusiast tech that I
wouldn't recommend to pretty much anyone
if you enjoyed this video then be sure
to hit that like button also a one
product that sort of came in okay I
guess for cryptocurrency miners but it's
practically worthless for gamers is the
P 106 graphics card as well I did a
video on this where it just ended up
being useless in a gaming situation if
you want to check out more I'll put the
link up here but other than that let me
know in the description below if you've
tried out some new products this year
and they've been terrible as a love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in the next
Tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
