in for $70 I thought wow what a bargain
and upon putting into my computer
although it worked the temperatures were
a little bit high so I upon taking off
the cooler I noticed how rough the
heatsink the base plate was so I decided
to do a little guide on lapping and
changing thermal paste and note the
differences for you guys and let you
know what the best options are
so recently I decided to build a
workstation PC for work I mean who would
have ever thought around a workstation
PC for work but anyway I decided to put
in a 650 Ti boost in there which I got
for $70 now this price honestly it's
pretty damn good value for money
considering it boosts I mean it boasts
about the same performance as a 750 Ti
though using a little bit more power
though when I put it in I noticed that
the temperatures were a little bit high
so I immediately pulled it out started
cleaning it down and I found that the
heatsink paste they put on this was junk
also upon putting my fingernail and
running it across the heatsink I noticed
that it was really rough had a lot of
grooves in it so I decided not only to
change the heatsink paste and document
the actual temperature change with just
the heatsink paste alone I decided to
lap the cooler as well and document the
temperature change with that as well
so let's get on to some results now
so in conclusion what can I say about
the whole thing that just happened here
well the thermal piece made the biggest
difference as we saw with the Arctic
silver 5 this stuff got us a 5 degree
drop over the stock heatsink pace when
we tested that the Animax did pretty
well as well that got a 4-3-3 degree
drop though the cool board to his liquid
pro I thought was slightly behind the
Animax paste and it was a little bit
behind the Arctic silver 5 and this
surprised me because I read on the
internet this stuff was really good like
this was the best if you're putting it
on a GPU die don't know where I read
that but this stuff didn't do the best I
mean it did better than the stock
thermal heatsink pace but it didn't do
the best and especially since it costs
the most here out of these contenders I
thought it would have done the best and
also considering that collaboratory as
liquid pro is really good on dies so
surprised to see that this didn't do so
well last but not least
or should I say last but least the
silicon grease this stuff did terrible
on a GPU die so don't use this stuff on
dies I think that's something to come
out of this video I even though I've
been a bit of a fan of this stuff just
using our normal heat sinks but it did
terrible for what it's worth on a die
and last lastly the lapping itself you
guys probably saw the results didn't do
too well like I was surprised I thought
we would have got a bigger drop out of
lapping a cooler like this especially
one which I thought was sort of a worst
case scenario where the grooves were
really rough and you could see with my
fingernail are etched it on there and
then after I smoothed it down it was
really smooth where I sanded it back so
I was kind of surprised to see that the
temperature temperature drop was
probably only half or a 1 degree at best
over just the stock rough heat sink so I
guess that's a compliment to the
heatsink pace and how good they're
getting and sort of how much of a slack
they can take so that's time to come out
of this video yeah heatsink piece they
make a big difference so make sure you
pick your heatsink pace carefully I know
a lot of guys are big fans of like on
mx4 I'm a big fan of artic silver 5 and
I'm going to keep being a big fan after
the
video this stuff's pretty damn good it's
consistent anyway
keep in mind with lapping I'm sure it
would make a bigger difference though if
we had a bigger heatsink on a bigger die
for instance saying like my old GTX 780
lightning which had like a
one-and-a-half kilogram cooler on it and
the die would have been a lot bigger
than a 650 TI boost and I think would
make more of a difference in those kind
of circumstances so anyway for what it's
worth though the average person on an
average GPU would probably not need to
go out and lap their CPU cooler so I
think lapping is one of those things
that that's for more high performance
like real the guy trying to get the last
grain out of his arm out of his wheat or
something like that so anyway that's a
bad analogy so anyway guys I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon if
you have any questions yet drop a
comment below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can if you liked the video
please give it a thumbs up and I will
catch you in another tech video very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
