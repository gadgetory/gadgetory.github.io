what is up tech fans recently I've had
the x99 platform come through so that's
probably a 58 20k we've got an MSA ex
99s mother board and some crucial ddr4
memory I believe these three are kind of
like the best combo you can get at the
moment in terms of value for money if
you'd call it that for getting on the x
99 platform so you guys can expect a
review of this MSI motherboard you can
expect a review of this 5820 k and you
can expect a review of the crucial ddr4
memory as well now also on to other
things as well you're probably wondering
well there's an animax t40 sitting right
here so i've already reviewed this and
this however i did manage to get the
animax 240 on the 58 20k and it was
running absolutely fine so you do not
need to get some yo bro $300 water
cooler to keep the 5820 under control a
forty-dollar kulit will do that
absolutely fine also while I was
benchmarking the 58 20k on windows 7
something unexpected happened like
literally I was testing hyper-threading
vs. know hyper threading and what
windows 7 decided to do was to turn my
processor into Lake I guess an eye for
50 for 10k where essentially it became a
three core six threaded not so monstrous
beast so I don't know what happened
there and yes I did try like changing
the cause and advanced boot option I
tried everything I could and ultimately
I gave up and reinstall the OS so I
could continue benchmarking I've also
tested windows 7 vs windows 8 so you
guys can expect a video on that very
shortly as well so I've also tested
thermal paste arctic silver 5 there is a
reason why they call this stuff trust
the arctic silver 5 sold be comparing
this a year on so I've got this over a
year ago I purchased some pk3 over a
year ago I'm going to be comparing this
to the PK 3 and also to some koolaburra
Tories liquid metal pads so stay tuned
for that that's going to be an
interesting video as well that critical
as you guys can expect some cuda cores
versus no cuda cores videos especially
with the 58 20 k vs the 4670k and last
but not least i have been messing around
with settings in Windows 7 and Windows 8
and I've discovered some very
interesting settings especially for
nvidia graphics card users so stay tuned
for that so if you can not wait for all
these juicy video
please give a thumbs up and if you have
any comments or questions about this
build in particular or anything I've
mentioned in this video please leave a
comment in the comments section below
and what are you waiting for hit the sub
button subscribe to check your city if
you haven't already and I look forward
to seeing you guys in another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
