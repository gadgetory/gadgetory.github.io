address the yes where I go through
comments and read and answer questions
that would take usually too long to
reply to a simple text messages or
there's things I've got to add to the
conversation here we are at episode soon
anyway the first question we got up here
is from mcg tech came from last week's
episode he says address the yes question
I was wondering if you have any
recommendations for smaller computer
focused channels specifically on how to
get discovered and set yourself apart
from the crowd
thanks in advance if you're in it to
sort of set yourself apart from the
crowd then you may be shifting from your
focus and that your focus should be
based on your passion make what you
enjoy if you don't enjoy making YouTube
videos then just don't make them I got
into YouTube just helping people out not
really enjoyed it and I wanted to show
people new things and that's what I'm
doing with those used builds really set
apart a whole new community in ways
whoever I've got this whole used parts
hustle market now it's a lot of fun you
can join the discord where everyone's
always chatting about new sort of ways
to make a best price performance PC got
some cool content coming up with with
one of the viewers as well Harrow so
that'll be awesome stay tuned for that
but in terms of YouTube itself if you
want to get views apparently the
algorithm favors people who bring in
viewers from outside of YouTube so if
you'll bring in new viewers to the
platform YouTube will then favor your
videos and start ranking them higher
that's just what I've heard because it
actually is as well a team of people at
YouTube that select specific videos and
promote them as well so there is
favoritism going on I just don't know
really much about it I just keep doing
what I enjoy and don't try to think
about it but at the end of the day
YouTube is a business just like any
other business they're in it to make
money next up we got Batsy 22 we asked
daddy what happened to the five pcs for
underprivileged kids nothing's happened
to him they're sitting under my desk and
this is I guess in what ways represents
a problem that exists in 2018 and that
is this so much red tape I've gone to
different schools I finally got what's
called a blue card in Australia where I
can now go to a school and actually give
these pcs away to people before that I
wasn't even allowed to give them away
so now I've got the blue card I can do
that and next week I'm making be making
an update video on what's going on with
the progress of that it's just funny
because when I was a kid and we went to
school there'd be like outside people
say people from the farm or some
person would come into the school and
they'd just give away products and stuff
and you'd be like okay cool you could
just use them nowadays is just so much
red tape but I guess that exists because
there's needs to be laws to protect
people against the uprising of so many
idiots in society nowadays so what can
you do about it
next iPhone EB he says your YouTube
video thing 100k whatever frames
slightly off-centre wd-40 is good shares
I've used contact cleaner and brutally
damaged components because of it brake
cleaner is just nasty try some silicon
spray used to work good back in the day
making the engine bay of the GTR 32
looked good
first of all GDR 32 the engine bay does
look really good I do agree in terms of
using other products I think my tech yes
cleanses down pat I've never busted a
product using brake cleaner or wd-40
never in fact I've brought parts back to
life using these products so I stand by
them I love them they do help sell the
final product really well too so I have
first off I'll start off with brake
cleaner of course cleanse all the real
dirty stuff out of there then after that
use the wd-40 to give it that new look
shine the tech yes process it works for
me and I keep doing it if it doesn't
work for you that's cool next up we got
Ozzy bogan Tech how you doing man I
really enjoyed it when you chopped up
that AMD box I think it was the rise in
unboxing but he says just a heads up
this one did not show up in my
notifications very good video glad I
didn't miss it again right this is a
YouTube thing I've addressed them on
Twitter I've told them what's going on
with my channel I recently got a new
partner manager the old partner manager
he did ignore quite a few of my emails
so hopefully the new partner manager can
help me out and things can sort of get
back to even normal but thanks for
letting us know man next up we've got
Ibiza
Anton do you have to overclock Xeon CPUs
to get the best performance out of them
and the answer is first generation
definitely you can get some massive
performance gains in some cases you can
get up to like 40 percent extra
performance by overclocking highly
recommended but then we go into the
second gen series from Sandy Bridge
onwards you start to get
lockdown CPUs so you can really only
overclock the 1650 and 1680 v2 for the
third generation and then after that
Intel just started completely locking
out everything so if its first gen yes
do overclock it if you can
after second gen it doesn't matter a
whole lot unless you're getting the 1650
or 1680 v2 and also I've got
overclocking tutorials for x58
and check it out up here and there's an
X 34:40 and they're really good too for
the money and let's read the next
comment which is from sever I didn't get
a notification and it didn't appear in
my sub box for whatever reason I noticed
a new upload from the recommended tab
after watching LTT god bless LTT then
yeah
if YouTube can't save us maybe he can
next up Jesse he says Brian most of your
builds are Intel based could you do an
older AMD built-in overclock et cetera
maybe FX series thanks for the question
Jesse and a with the FX series I have
done a video quite recently with the FX
8350 and in general I don't do a lot of
them especially compared to the old
Zeon's and the old Intel i5 the nice
evans because they're a lot cheaper and
they perform a lot better especially in
games not to mention they don't put out
as much heat so not only is the builds
going to be better but also for me
personally on the slide the resale value
is going to be better FX 8350 s at the
moment they are a little bit overpriced
in a couple of days ago I did the top
CPUs and actually talked about that
directly and they're just for what
they're the motherboards you will
generally want to get a more expensive
motherboard like a 990 FX because
that'll help overclock the 8 core for
instance the FX 8320 a lot better than a
cheaper motherboard would in that build
that I did I had a 970 board and that
was throttling because the vrm couldn't
handle the 8 core and this was only at
4.4 gigahertz which is a mild overclock
for an FX 8350 and I had to put a fan on
that thing just to get it working
normally and so that's the need to have
a good borden if you're spending that
much money on a 990 FX board and Wisel
get an X 58 motherboard or go a
different route next up child of light
says a couple of wd-40 sprays to me
nether regions and me Bulls have
sprouted back out that's great to hear
man I'm glad wd-40
your dysfunctions it generally fixes
everything
next up DG born he says raid isn't a
backup and that's your opinion my
opinion is that it does backup things
for me I have it on my computer for
instance a video file I'll then copy it
to the raid 5 and that's a backup I mean
I don't know what else I call that just
a copy store next up Ozzie 10 man says
goog on works really well cleaning up PC
parts I don't know if you have that in a
you do you cleans anything a little less
harsh on equipment and hands I believe
we do have this at Bunnings I just
haven't tried it looks pretty expensive
I might give it a go
just for you next up a less key Dabra
Volsky he says but haven't you told that
Koon app is really great no and as he's
taught TV I guess they came in for the
save they said we can both be great
that's the point of fair honest
competition I do agree with that I will
say that I am replaced the QNAP with the
azuz tour the nasty a s 4040 it's a
amazingness especially for the money and
I represent value for money I try to at
least a lot of the times that's why I
switch my rig to X 79 and this Nass
represents really good value for money
so the Q DAP it's really good don't get
me wrong but it is a lot more expensive
than the zoo store variant it's for more
like even from my situation I don't need
it it's just too much so if you're like
a small business and you need really
fast speeds then the Q net might be for
you but if you're a small like office or
just a studio or something like that and
you need just a reliable little unit but
need faster than one gigabit per second
then the zoo store is definitely worth a
look next up we got to find oh three one
six three six we'd like to see a video
about your network setup in the yes to
do wireless hardware slash switching
hardware slash router etc I would say
yes but there's just too many promises
at the moment once I fulfill those once
all the promises that I've said I
promise the viewers are done then I'll
open up a video and they'll be like guys
apply for new promises and videos want
to see not sure when that will happen
and again not making any promises
next up now we got mocked re Abdul Majid
I hope I got that right but yes what
kind of glasses do you put are they for
PC use only so now I've got reading
glasses and this came about because the
sponsor contacted me and then at the
time they just said we want to
collaborate with you and I said I don't
know if I need glasses or not so they
recommended I go to the eye doctor the
optometrist that's what I'm looking for
they recommended I go to the optometrist
I did and the optometrist here locally
recommended I get 0.5 0.5 prescription
and when they showed me at the shop I
was like wow this is really good helps
my eyes a lot so I told the sponsor them
to send us out that prescription and
they did and their glasses were really
good and I've got now reading glasses
that I generally like to use at night
time especially when my eyes are getting
tired I'll I don't need glasses I don't
have to have them but they definitely
help with my eyes and help relax them
especially at nighttime next I got Jamie
Williams and he commented last week but
he said he forgot to tell us that he's
using a not Schuette 14 and it's a 4790k
it's deleted and he's used mx4 pastes
and he's still getting roughly 70
degrees at 4.8 gigahertz and he's down
clocked at a 4.6 and now he's getting
pretty much the same cinnamon score so I
guess that 4.8 wasn't that stable maybe
it's probably on the verge of not being
stable but mx4 for what it's worth i
wouldn't use that on going for a
relatively high overclock like 4.8
gigahertz on the 4790k I've done a
thermal paste video in the past you can
check it out up here a gelid extreme is
actually a lot better than it makes for
for these kind of situations so maybe
give that a shot and let us know how
your overclock then goes next up we've
got Daniel C he says you actually know
how to play dota not like RG in HD mid
feeding without einem okay I haven't
seen this yet I'm gonna go watch it and
I'll have a laugh but in terms of dota 2
I loved playing a bit of storm spirit I
used to play tusks competitively but
they nerfed him so hard that I just
really stopped enjoying playing
competitively now I just played turbo
mode for what it's worth and that's a
lot of fun next up we've got you on 1999
he says okay thanks to this vid price is
going to go back up
here in Singapore you're welcome and Jay
says does anyone know if these mining
cars tend to have had their BIOS has
changed is that a concern that's if
you're purchasing one off a minor they
might mod the BIOS and that optimizes
them for mining that it might be at the
detriment of giving you less FPS if you
guys don't know and so it can of course
be a detriment of performance but
generally for minor sells that card it's
going to I'm sure that flash it back to
the original BIOS which was intended for
gaming if they haven't you can just ask
them or of course it's not gonna affect
performance that much you only gonna bro
we get a little drop in that case if
you're getting the card for a really
good deal and you don't know how to
flash the boss then you're still gonna
be better off in my opinion
next up newts 88 he says why was there
no GTX 970 on the list he's referring to
the recent GPU video I did put a link up
here for you guys and it's on the list
it's still good it's even better than
the r7 260x in 750ti
yes it is better than both those gravis
cards I'd say it's even better than both
of them combined their total scores but
it's the GTX 970 is I guess it's one of
the most sought out cards that use price
performance hunters go for and so
without so much competition form that I
generally don't bother looking for him
to be honest a lot of people always
looking for a GTX 970 and so with that
the prices generally go up and so I just
in the past I haven't picked up a whole
lot of GTX 970 s to be honest and so
with that I've just my experiences just
really don't make me recommend them to
the average person which was where that
GPU guy was intended for to go out and
buy one next up we got the final
revelation he says I was thinking about
ordering a 70 TTI from aliexpress for my
cousin can anyone recommend a tested
vendor I know many of these cards are
fake with edited BIOS the zotac ones on
Aliexpress will be diligent the cells
have legit feedback Aliexpress is well
they do guarantee the sale so if you
have a problem you can just put in a
complaint you'll get a refund if it's a
faulty item or a dodgy item
even better dare I say than eBay's
protection next up savage he says gtx970
is worth looking into let's say I could
pick one up for 150 Ozzy would that be a
good deal for a GTX 970 or should I
spend that 150 on something else for 150
for a 970 AUD thats Aussie dollars
that's a good deal go get it
next up we got masterful is he says how
good's that blower vac thing I got the
same one it's so powerful and he's
referring to the data back I got this
earlier in the year and it is such a
good tool it is like one of the best
tools I've got in terms of working with
PCs you just turn it on and it just
blows out a heap of air an TST as well
for the people with OCD and it's also
now being coupled with the wd-40 at the
same time ago this new metal where I
just sprayed at the same time seriously
if you're working with pcs even remotely
every week get yourself one of these
you're not gonna regret it
next up cod wolf Pete he says this guy
looks like Tom Cruise I said last week
it was Lord Baelish now this week is Tom
Cruise you guys have to make up your
mind and a - Chuck Robb or t he says his
ebay reliable yeah he Bay's pretty
reliable the actual ebay place itself
some of the people on the marketplace
may not be however just like any avenue
where you can buy and sell there's
always gonna be shady sellers a good
thing about eBay is you got PayPal
PayPal will protect your purchase and
first name last name he says is that
corsair carbide 540 air behind can you
make video of it I have similar case
maybe I can learn from you
fi40 it's my main rig the x79 rig is in
that case and the fi40 I have to say
it's the best case of all time at least
for me I love this thing you just
install your hardware you've got air
flow from the get-go looks amazing so
easy to work with
if Corsair do release an update to this
case they've got a very hard task ahead
of them I mean of course they could just
add RGB but would that really be an
upgrade and his Dan Phillips he asked
aren't warranties non-transferable in
australia they actually are transferable
you just got to have the original
receipt to prove that that item was
purchased at that particular date I'm
not sure about other countries but
generally it's
they are and Gila chaos he says a spread
method master race genius
next up heartsick disciple says I never
pre-ordered why buy something without
knowing how it performs every ring is
generally for people who just can't wait
to get a product they want to make sure
that they get that product on day one
they may be a rabid fanboy for that
particular brand of product and this
whole pre-order controversy has
definitely come about for discussion
after the announcement of the r-tx 2007
and that was really bad I mean that was
just such a shill article if one could
call it that the wording in there like
how much of your life do you want to
miss out not having ray-tracing or
something it was ridiculous as an
independent review site you should not
be using that terminology
it was so oh man I mean I read it I was
just like no this is not good for anyone
but in terms of reordering me personally
I do disagree with other people it's
your money you can do what you like with
it should you preorder it's up to you me
personally would I pre-order in RTX 2007
I'm putting myself in someone else's
shoes if I was someone that played video
games day-in day-out and I made good
money and I wanted the latest and
greatest day one then I probably would
pre-order one so it's different strokes
for different folks if you want to
understand why people would preorder
it's because it may be their passion and
that's what they love doing next up we
got nasty Nate he says not gonna lie you
got a sexy librarian thing going on okay
so we have the librarian we've got Tom
Cruise and we got Lord Baelish seriously
guys please make up your minds next I've
got a frame collazo jr. says I recommend
asking the - what settings they use
instead of leading them to the answer
you're looking for basically they
provide the settings instead of a
yes-or-no mentality if you're if you
talk to someone and you ask them is
was this graphics card mind on and they
say yes and then you say was it
overclocked or did you under voltage
that's not a yes or no question that's
sort of just like they got to tell you
so I don't know maybe I yeah I do agree
though yes or no answer isn't the best
outcome there but you could generally
tell if someone knows what they're
talking about or doesn't know what
they're talking about when it comes to
giving you a response the ps4 dans la
jetée atum-ra 78 he says did I miss the
legendary sr to build it's been a while
since we've been promised that build it
has been and it's coming I've linked up
with tag mods who does custom pcs we're
gonna be doing a very special project
with the SR 2 I owe it to you guys out
to the person who donated the
motherboard I ought to me I ought to the
world it's gonna be coming I'd be doing
3 videos when we get this built in
action it's lined up before pax because
I'm hoping to drive down there and on
the way stop off at Ethan's house and
we're gonna get this epic build done
it's coming don't worry next up chosen
Stan Lee he says loll its Aliexpress
never trust Aliexpress mul I've bought
so many items from Aliexpress and so
many other people have and we've never
had a problem long and last up we got
Chrome who says am I the only one that
likes the smell of wd-40 no I love the
smell of wd-40 and 31 other people also
like the smell of wd-40 next time we got
crackling ice and he says if the cod was
set at a hundred percent fan speeds it's
a no buy in caps
he states that a hundred percent fan
speeds wears them out faster and is not
needed sincerely a miner himself for me
personally I was mining as well and my
experience the hundred cent fan speeds
made the graphics cards the coolest
possible and those fans if you talking
about the actual fans themselves wearing
out they're generally rated for 50,000
hours to a hundred and fifty thousand
hours mean time before failure and
that's like at least five years plus and
so the ten series cards have only been
out for two years so I not sure where
you're going with this and that wraps up
