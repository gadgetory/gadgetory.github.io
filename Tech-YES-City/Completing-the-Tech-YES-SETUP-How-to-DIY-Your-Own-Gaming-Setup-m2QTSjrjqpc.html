special day because we're gonna be
making some progress on the development
of this studio and you see the two
monitors here hopefully we're gonna be
wall mounting these today because I've
got the right height I was using these
Corsair boxes on a pouch playing cooler
and that was mainly just because I
wanted to try before I buy a kind of
thing and I recommend doing the same if
you guys are using monitors make sure
they're the right height
otherwise you'll be getting headaches
like all the time if your monitors too
low and you're looking down all the time
so want to get the right height and I
think we have that is the perfect height
at the moment away from the desk
so it goes to show that usually monitor
stands are not high enough but let's get
back to it so this desk here behind me
is gonna get cleaned off because we've
actually got to treat the wood as well
this wood here is untreated so we're
gonna treat it with some polyurethane
and we're also gonna be mounting some
floating shelves up the top here just
sort of fill out these walls and also
behind me here is the streaming desk
which I'll talk a little bit about later
as well there's still a few little
decorations that have to go up here and
we're also still waiting on some
products to come through for that before
we can finish it off and also start
streaming for you guys well with all
that aside let's start building this
city up
so now here we've cleared out all these
desks here we've got the shelves ready
so this first shelf is gonna come about
90 mil a 900 mil sorry I get all my
things confused here but it's gonna come
900 mil off that's gonna be the one
that's going one point two meters
horizontally and then up in the corner
that we're gonna put a 900 and also
another 900 on this side that gives us
options as well to put two six hundreds
above later on to sort of make it a
little bit more sophisticated and then
on this side we're gonna mount two and
we're still gonna figure out how we're
gonna do this we're gonna do this wall
first then we have to figure out how to
do this one because of this windows seal
here does make it difficult to mount
these floating shelves basically with
their pre-installed brackets not running
the spin of the window
so we just got the first floating shelf
installed is actually pretty easy and it
is looking pressed Dino
so there is the shelving there instead
of going over the window we decided what
if we just stack the shelving like that
and it actually turned out really good
so there's the floating shelves now and
that is stage one done so we're getting
at the monitor arms now mounted over
here the wall mount monitor arms and
then we're gonna try and install the
sound tiles because we kind of want to
get all this done in one go because
we're gonna be actually putting some
sealant on this wood too to protect that
so yeah
all right so we finally have the
monitors mounted to the wall and that
was a big pain in the ass because we had
to get the top flush and so basically
these monitors aren't height adjustable
these monitor stands so we had to drill
holes in the vase amount at the second
one to get it flush at the top otherwise
yeah it would just wasn't flashing or
sending me OCD the speaker on the bottom
there we've got that mounted so now
we're just got to deal with a cable
management but we're gonna use the sound
tiles now to raise them just above this
the sockets here and that'll be able to
cover like the cables go into the
computer so you won't actually see any
cables and of course it will give the
benefit of giving a sound deadening as
well in the studio and we've also
decided to add a 60 mil shelf up the top
there so I gave that a nickname as well
so yeah now it's time finally to sand
back this table and then give it a
protective coating
so we just finished cleaning up the
desks and there's all the alcohol wipes
man I didn't realize there was that much
dirt that came off I mean keep in mind
we did send it back but we use the
alcohol wipes and they just dry so
quickly so it's pretty much ready now
for the coat of polyurethane so wipe-on
poly we're ready to go
there it is that's the final stage of
clearing off this wood and making it
look awesome but also giving it a
protective layer so it doesn't get
stained have to give this at least 12
hours they do recommend 24-bit
Australia's a pretty dry country so we
should get away after I wake up from
sleeping it should be almost done so now
we've got everything going on here and
the shelves are all up and all so I'm
just gonna go hit up the gym I know it's
like 10:30 at night but still gonna keep
that health up got to keep on that grind
so I don't know should I take the camera
to the gym maybe there might be no one
there so let's do a workout
so we just got back from the gym and
it's close to midnight now and I'm
really tired but health is something
that I don't really talk about here on
the channel and actually a lot of tech
tubers don't really talk about health
but it's something that's so important
to stay on top of your game you know I
go to the gym like two three times a
week and I've been doing that for over a
year now and I feel great and I'm not
gonna stop doing that because you sleep
more efficiently you just got more
energy just gives you that energy to win
but if you guys want I can go through
the full yes-men regiment the diet the
exercises the time I spend on computers
and how I spend most my day doing this
YouTube gig and still remaining on top
of that game brothers so if you guys
want to see that let me know in the
comment section and I'll make it happen
but I'm gonna crash out now and we'll
get back into the studio in the morning
so it's now the morning after and I'm
ready to start doing some cable
management and I've also got to go out
and pick up a few things like a
three-meter DisplayPort cable for that
monitor over there a few other cables
maybe some extension leads as well and
yeah just start really cleaning up this
cable management and making the rig look
tidy maybe even put a hole in the desk
for the keyboard
so we just got back now and all the
goodies here we've got 25 centimeter cat
cables that's for the wall from the
switch to the wall and then we've got
some little pins here this is to stick
into the walls the decorations that are
going up there and we'll do that Britt
Lee Seun and Sam here with that and also
got a spirit level included so only two
dolls fifty so that was pretty good deal
double-sided tape for the sound tiles
we've already cardboard attached them to
the actual tiles themselves earmuffs for
when I'm doing the using the data back
because some reason it just hurts my
ears and I get a little bit of tinnitus
after it so dad man approved he always
loves using ear muffs so he actually
recommended I get them so and then we've
got here cable management as well HEPA
different stuff for cable management so
we've still got a lot of things to do
here but it's gonna come along nicely I
think
so here's the wall here it's all
complete and I mean who needs a level
when you can just eyeball it maybe I
should have used the level but it looks
pretty straight to me so we've got up
the top right-hand corner here the
motherboard now that motherboards iconic
because that was the first like
motherboard that began the whole used PC
parts hassle thing it was actually
broken but it came with a q9 550 Intel
quad core duo and so I was just I was
stoked when I got that CPU 20 dollars so
I was in the forty dollar PC parts flog
and then below that we've got the play
button there and then we've got two
graphs cards ones in video and the
others in AMD cards so I'll think about
painting it red and green but you know
opposite colors but I was like now
because it actually goes really well
with the wall so also cut myself as well
while I was installing that motherboard
it's the hole puncher slipped my finger
slipped and then hit those little pins
does hurt a bit but that's not gonna
stop us from getting all this done now
so there is the sound tiles all in and
they're covering up those monitor cables
as well both the power and the display
cables so we've got the server's there
as well I got the 25 centimeter cables
they're just looking really clean we're
gonna do a cable management in a second
and clean this up but we've still got a
few more sound tiles to do there's
another three sound tiles so we
literally have the perfect amount just
there I just got to go down to get some
double-sided tape but I do want to set
up my computer quickly and just sort of
piece things out in case I need to get
some other stuff as well while I'm out
so now we've completed the first stage
of the check yes setup and this now is
the benchmark setup I was going to start
looking at this and sort of prepping it
but this monitor here actually doesn't
have a VESA mount stand on the back I
believe it does come with like an
adaptable kit but it's a lot of trouble
so not to worry as Zeus sent over there
actually 35 V so unexpectedly I just had
both these ultra whites here and I
thought I would compare them one is 34
inches the other is 35 inches and so the
Zeus does have an extra 20 mil on the
bottom so it does have 20 mil more a
height and then on the horizontal it
does have eight hundred thirty members
805 so it is a little bit bigger that 35
inches definitely giving you just that
little bit more viewing area so when I
do the review on that I will be giving
it a little bit of a comparison versus
Samsung because that is a very popular
ultrawide monitor and we'll see how this
fits and I've still actually got to
review the review sonic as well so I
don't know what it is this month must be
the month of the monitor so now here's
the stream setup I'll take you guys
through a little bit of a tour there are
still some little final touches I have
to do for instance I do have to get a
micro HDMI adapter for my Panasonic g7
I'm also waiting in the mail on an AC
adapter for it too so once that comes
through I'll be able to actually stream
from that camera give you guys DSLR
quality in a live stream but here's a
look a little look at the setup what its
gonna be like so I'm gonna be sitting
from this angle point of view gonna have
a stream deck they're gonna have the
keyboard mouse here two monitors as well
be able to see the live chat and the
feed and the news and then also that
monitor there will be the subject
monitor too and then that'll be the
webcam the hidden webcam for the subject
so whoever I'm talking to can see me I'm
still waiting also on a mic
Kable XLR cable so that can connect it
down to the bottom here where all the
magic is happening I am a little bit
worried about this mini ITX PC I mean it
is powering everything off a 100 watt
power supply so many USB devices 6co
8432 gigabytes of RAM I hope it can hold
up but we'll give it a shot we'll test
it out and give it a chance because it
would be epic to just have that travel
PC actually pulling weight and doing
something else around the channel so
there it is guys that's the streaming
setup let me know what you think of it
so here we are now at the end of day 2
and I'm absolutely buggin I'm actually
ready to go to bed but behind me is the
tech yes set up phase 1 it's complete
that's my main editing rig got the 2
wall-mounted monitors they're cracking
in the background I'm absolutely in love
with this setup
I've just visioned it and it's gone the
way I planned it to go got all the cable
management done and that was pretty easy
to do because we hit a lot of those
cables behind the PC the err 740 X also
bought those dozers from the furniture
place they were pretty cheap that like
$19 a pop use 3 of them to cover up the
cables as behind the rig and under the
desk and then also use brought the
printer downstairs use that to cover up
some cables and the Logitech surround
sound 5.1 also wiring some wires under
the desk and using some clips to hammer
them in so to keep the cables clean and
out of sight so all-in-all the first
part is just come along so well you guys
are probably surprised because before it
was just so messy but that's how I
generally do things I'm just like look
we've got to get the content done and
then we'll get onto the pretty stuff
later and so now we've got the pretty
stuff we'll have to get back to the
content anyway guys hope you enjoyed the
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button also a big thank you to
each and every one of you guys for
watching the videos supporting the
channel and a big thanks to the patrons
as well you guys know where that money's
going it's going hold back into this
studio baby and we're making this place
look like a million bucks and we're
doing it on a budget as we always do
look at those budget bills they get done
on a budget as well and they beat a lot
of those computers that are like four or
five times the price anyway see you in
another tech video very soon let me know
in the comment section below
what was your favorite part of today's
video and I'll probably try to bring a
bit more of a back catch in the next one
peace out for now bye
and here these guys here's the rubbish
pile so far just stacking up in the
studio all-in-all the first part is just
come along so well okay also I forgot to
mention I went down the place today to
get more double-sided tape and they said
they closed at 7:00 p.m. and they
actually closed like 5:30 on a budget as
we always do baby around here we make
those budget so now I'm editing out the
video and I did watch the bit with video
the last video you guys are messaging me
as well and he did do what I hoped he
wouldn't do and that was build the
cheapest new PC possible and then
compare it against literally the most
expensive use PC I have not heard
someone paying that amount of money for
a PC of those specs in the used price
performance scene and the only reason
I'm making videos and responding to it
is because it's misrepresenting use
price performance and it's
misrepresenting it by a long shot so if
you guys want I can make another
response video but why not mean we can
have a bit of fun but I'll catch you in
the next one anyway peace out for now
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
