workstation it's right here guys that is
working perfectly however there were a
lot of little hurdles to overcome in
order to get this thing working a
hundred percent so today I'm going to
talk about all the paths I selected all
the problems that I had to overcome and
also show you guys from 1440p gameplay
footage with this rig and how well it
performed and also a little bit of the
productivity side of things too so let's
get on with it
welcome back guys and today I'm building
my new rising workstation and this is
all the parts here a lot of these parts
were sent in and other review samples or
build samples but I'm going to go
through all the parts and what goodness
they're going to do for this workstation
in the first year being the verizon r7
CPU this one here is just absolutely
amazing price performance with
productivity and since the productivity
on this is going to beat that of my 6800
K it's going to be a pretty good upgrade
now underneath that you have the GTX 10a
BTI
currently the best gaming graphics card
out there at the moment is just a beast
of a card performing really well on the
benchmarks and of course you get a lot
of CUDA cores as well which is always
great for Adobe Premiere Pro the next up
here we've got one of the best x3 70
motherboards out there the asrock tights
you actually haven't reviewed this yet
but I'm going to be reviewing it pretty
soon after of course I do this build and
run it through some more paces and then
we're moving on to storage and first up
here we've got the Corsair ex-cia and
neutron this is a 960 GB Drive and it is
going to be the main OS drive so there's
going to be a lot of storage on there
really cool and then for the scratch
drive I'm using the MP 500 really fast m
dot to mdme Drive going to be great when
I'm editing videos really fast file
transfers and then I got an interesting
configuration going on here for my
backup we've got two Seagate barracudas
7200 drives I'm going to give them
another chance since a lot of people are
telling me the Seagate are really good
nowadays so I'm going to be giving them
a go on my main workstation here we've
got two of these going to put them in
raid 0 for the for Tara but since
they're both three terabyte drives and
then we're going to put one terabyte in
raid 1 so that
essentially mirrors the drives and so if
one of these drives fails you still get
your really important files backed up on
the other drive and now moving on to
memory we've got 64gb a kid here for 16
gig sticks at twenty six hundred and
sixty-six megahertz
this is a vengeance led stuff and now I
need 64 gigabytes for editing in
Premiere Pro at 4k some other people
need less but I find myself always
needing 64 gigabytes nowadays with all
the footages I'm taking at 100 megabits
per second so this stuff is going to be
really good for that and now we're
moving on to the cosmedix with this
build and it just wouldn't quite be a
build without some dank RGB lighting
from corsair so i've got the fans the
strips and also got some black cables
since this will be a predominantly black
and white theme build now the good thing
about the RGB lighting is that you can
put it on a static color that's one
thing that I really like about it
so if you can take this from the next
build to the next build you can always
call a coordinate your stuff even though
it does have that rainbow effect which I
kind of think so that makes RGB a bit
more people think it's a bit too much
but I love the static color that you can
change it to anything you want at any
time that's the my favorite thing about
RGB and this build is going to
essentially be this turned into white
and then we've got the black cables for
a really cool black and white theme
build and then we're moving on to the
whole power plant essentially of this
build the HX 1000 either Singh has 83.3
amps available on that 12 volt line for
bit of a 10-year warranty which is huge
and the fans spin down when it's not
drawing that much power you can pass on
drawing damage pal also it's got
ultra-low noise and it's a platinum
rated power supply so this thing is
really efficient and it's fully modular
too so damn and this thing is got it all
now under the cool we've got the corsair
h 110 i which works with the a m4
platform out of the box it's also got
the corsair link software and it's got
two 140 millimeter fans so this thing is
going to do a pretty good job of cooling
and with that said let's move on now to
the last component in this build this is
the air 740 and now there's part of the
air series from corsair which is
essentially a case series that split
your components into two it's got two
different cabinets one which is
dedicated to your power supply cable
management
also your drives and then another
cabinet which is dedicated to your main
component and it's got a push-pull air
configuration so that's your CPU cooler
your motherboard and your graphics card
just get dedicated cooling and man I
absolutely love it this is not just the
740 it's also their air 540 and a 240
series and this is specifically why I
requested the air 740 from Corsair for
this build because I absolutely love
this series of cases but anyway guys
let's get on with a build now and just
get an epic workstation ready for you
guys
yeah
all right so we're on the last phase
here of the build and this is all the
cable managers and their feet a lot
longer than a usual bilks I had to pull
off the front panel which actually has
like nine screws and then you have to
plug the hard drive trade to get to that
so awesome build so far except the
cables are just a jungle here at the
moment and that's because we've got a
three extra controllers Lashley for I
think we've got like three things for
the LEDs or a fan controller here
because we've got a additional amount of
fans also a three sided drives and they
all require cable so you just see
there's an a mammoth amount of cables
and you've also got the two USB link
controllers therefore the HX 1,000 I so
Dan a lot of cables here but we're going
to do our best to make this a neat and
tidy
so let's get off and another thing too
there was a shame about the 24 pin here
it's actually with the HX 1000 it needs
another four cables or something or the
premium cable anyway it's got too many
cables so it can't plug in unfortunately
to the H 1000 I which is a shame so I
can't use that keba long enough to
contact Corsair to switch something up
there and try and get a black extension
in maybe and then see what I can do with
that
so now I booted up my computer before
you probably may have noticed that the
LED strips didn't turn on at all and
also the fans at the front didn't turn
on either and I'm actually glad I made
these two little mistakes because I got
to figure out how it all works from the
computer side of things and this is the
HD node Pro his essential e the unit
hooks into the USB 2 and you can control
it via the software and you control all
the LED strips and also the fans of the
front vine is - and essentially I've
plugged in a male to male connector at
the start this was only a 2 prong or a 2
pin unit and that's actually this unit
here controls the power - for your LED
strips you have to make sure you plug in
the 3 pin male-to-female I kind of wish
they have the male to male LED for more
wiring convenience but they didn't but
it still works it works really well now
and also the front part here I didn't
realize that I had actually plugged this
into 4 5 6 first when I needed to plug
this into 1 2 3 and with that when I
started reading up about this you can
plug this male-to-male prong you
actually get two of them you can plug
this into the spare port here on the
node Pro and plug that directly into
this unit here so you now no longer need
with manual unit which you can which
I've installed before so I actually just
pulled this out and now I can control
all my LEDs from the software itself in
Windows my front fans and also the LED
strips
thank you
so I'll just set up the PC and now I'm
locking in the overclocks to make sure
they're stable I'm using i-264 for this
which i think is actually a really good
stress tester for the rising CPUs I find
the temperatures are pretty accurate
even though I'll not know what the
temperatures it looks like the CPU may
be in the socket temperatures as opposed
to the package temperatures which may be
actually your core temperatures even
though a.m. DC these are running about
20 degrees overstated at the moment on
the 1800 s and the 1700 X I got to look
into this a little bit more I may
actually change this over to thermal
grizzly to instead of using the stock
Corsair paste on the heatsink and also
test that with a 77 hundred cases stay
tuned for that video in the coming weeks
and also here we can see a four point
zero to five overclock here completely
stable and the memory is looking really
stable to inside of those tests the
memory - and that's a one point three
nine volt on the CPU and one point three
bolt I believe on the memory and that's
64 gigabytes at 29 33 megahertz so now
this is looking stable I'm going to jump
into some games with my overclocked gtx
980ti on the Exelero
and see how that performs let's
benchmark I'm going to run through now
is GTA 5 and I've got here the graphics
settings which pretty much on very high
across the board here I have turned down
MSA a little bit because I am on 1440p
ultra wide and let's see how this thing
performs on a mission in GTA 5 they'll
be driving through heaps of traffic and
I'm actually going to have shadow play
on - you guys can have a look at the
performance and I mean even with shadow
play on it's still getting around 100
frames per second which is exactly where
I want it with this monitor so that's
really cool that it's think and perform
how I want it to perform and yeah look
at this I mean it's smooth this bottle
it's playing fine it's with a 1080 TI by
the way so the GPU is getting utilized
quite heavy as you can see it's near
100% and wow this is pretty cool like
it's good that Verizon can play even the
CPU intensive games pretty well not just
the graphically intensive game
here it is here guys I mean I've been
driving through a heap of different
crowded areas and stuff like that it's
been just going over 100 frames per
second the whole time I've been doing
this the 1080p I obviously is a great
graphics card this is killing it as well
but for those people who want to step up
to higher resolutions with a high end
card like the 1080 TI then don't be
scared because this thing can definitely
handle a 1080 TI at 1440p ultra wide
which i know is going to be a very
popular monitor so here I'm just playing
this mission and the frames aren't
really good so really enjoying it smooth
as butter and we'll just move over to
another couple of games here and show
you guys our performance so one of the
last titles are going to look at here is
Ghost Recon wildlands this is one of the
latest titles out there at the moment in
the Tom Clancy series it is very
graphically intensive so you know you
guys can um you guys can see it's just
it's handling the game pretty well I'm
playing pretty terrible here but let's
reverse this thing off the mountains
here we go and you know you're getting
near about around about like 100 or 90
frames per second so it is looking
pretty good I can't believe this truck
just survived a big drop like that I
thought it's going to blow up but yeah
like the title the AMD CPU is handling
this title absolutely find the GPU near
100% usage the whole time and the CPUs
just chilling so I think when we compare
this to the 7700 K even though I'm going
to make a direct video versus the 700 K
is of course going to edge it out in a
lot of the modern-day titles in FPS but
this CPU if you look at the productivity
scores it's got so much more max
potential in terms of the CPU than 7,700
K so it's kind of like when you're
comparing these two CPUs with each other
it's only one is sort of more relevant
for gaming now but the other is much
more well rounded and can do gaming
perfectly fine and then when you look at
obviously the 6800 K this thing beats
the 6800 K in productivity and it does
pretty much the same in game
so that's really good to see AMD coming
out with a just kick-ass price
performance CPU and now another thing
too is with that is the bulldozer if we
look at the bulldozer CPU and compare
that like I tried the bulldozer CPU and
I just I remember comparing that even
delayed the 46 70 K at the time it
really wasn't a CPU that I would want to
have as my main CPU like bulldozer was
just so far behind when it was released
and so the four core versus the eight
core I would have rather have had a fork
or even to this date if you gave me the
two seed mutants that I could only have
one of those CPUs I'd still pick a 46
night or 46 70 K over an 83 70 or in 83
20 so that's just my opinion there but
rise amend I'd rather pick rise in any
day of the week over a 7700 K for what
I'm doing it's just that good of the CPU
and this is its gaming is absolutely
fine on this thing too especially when
you get to the higher resolution so
let's move over now to a conclusion with
this whole build so there it is guys my
rising rig is finally complete it's been
running this benchmark in the background
for a good 30 plus minutes and I just
can't be more impressed with not only
the Rison r7 CPU it's a fantastic CPU
for productivity and gaming for someone
looking for an all-rounder unbelievable
price performance but also all the other
parts as well they're just kicking ass
you can probably just hear there's no
noise creeping in you actually might
hear the washing machine which is like
often yonder being louder than this
thing and even my benchmark rig which is
just transferring files on it over at
the moment and it's not doing anything
in idle is probably louder so there's a
quick noise test and this thing is just
performing like a complete workhorse I
can't recommend it enough to someone who
just wants to go out there and build a
really balanced system
I'll also be having another system
coming to the channel where it'll be a
really cookie cutter rise and build to
stay tuned for that someone who doesn't
have the budget to build something like
this but also wants to get really good
performance and on that note of
performance the 1440p gaming is just
really damn good I'm loving what this
brings to the table and then of course
there's the productivity when I'm using
this in a dough
premiere pro it is just performing
extremely well better than my 6800 K did
the keep in mind I did have better
drives so if you do want to do
productivity and you do want to get
better performance it's not just the CPU
will come down to also your drive
configuration so do keep that in mind
and of course the memory configuration
so I've got the 64 gigabytes of ddr4
memory running on all six of 29 33
megahertz with that one to command rate
timing so it's working really well at
the moment though as I spoke about
before with some of the little problems
I had like the LED controller and stuff
like that there were some other problems
that I did come into and this build the
elgato capture card for example would i
rana CLE enough not work on any of the
PCIe mini slots and those slots go
through the chipsets PCIe controller and
not the CPU however when I installed it
on one of the two PCI Express 16 speed
slots are correct or connect directly to
the CPU that was when the capture card
would start working so I then contacted
Elgato they're telling me that they are
working on fixing this problem so if you
do have a rising system and you want to
get your HD 60 Pro working then you will
have to use it on one of the two PCI 16
speed slots to connect directly to the
CPU so it's kind of unfortunate if you
do have two graphics cards that need
those slots then you have to probably
put one of those grabs cards in the
bottom slot that connects through the
PCIe chipset controller for the meantime
now I also did have a little problem
with the air 740 and although the
performance is just phenomenal in this
case the back component doesn't have
cooling directly for your hard drives
and since I am running two mechanical
drives at 7200 rpm in raid zero I do
want a cooling solution or active
cooling on those drives so going into my
use price performance bin I managed to
pick out some random fan and just
install it in there to give the drives
direct cooling and the performance is
really cool now also another little
thing that I did spend time on was the
Rae configuration setup and it's mainly
because I just wasn't used to setting up
Rae with an AMD controller I haven't
used it for a long time so there is a
little bit more hurdle to jump through
there you will have to download the
latest raid drivers from
website load them on a USB stick and
then also when you're installing Windows
you'll have to load up the driver four
times like that's once and then load it
up again because another one will pop up
you have to do this four times if you
want to install windows on a driver in
this configuration of raid even if it is
a single like hard drive that's not even
going into a reconfiguration per se and
on that note if you do want to put all
your drives in the raid configuration
you will have to create an array for
every single drive even if they're not
being raided in raid 1001 so just a
little FYI there hopefully save some of
you guys time and also some last-minute
things that I wanted to touch on with
this build I will be benchmarking it
comparing it to the 7700 K again since a
lot of you guys want me to retest these
benchmarks
now that the Rison rig has some BIOS
updates flowing through the updates are
coming through on Windows things are
looking really good and they are
performing really well so I believe the
updates have flown through right in time
for risin five which is what Wendell
predicted that the eight core uses will
be more like the bench dummies and
that's exactly what's happening and on
that note I should have some Rison r5
coverage coming to you guys very soon -
stay tuned for that
and on that note I can recommend the
risin r7c be users just all around be
CPUs for productivity gaming and whatnot
they're incredible price performers I
absolutely love what AMD's done with the
rise in lineup now that all the fixes
have come about and the true performance
is starting to be seen anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this video if it did to
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know what you think of the new
workstation what would have you done
differently if you would do something
differently would love to hear your
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon
peace out for now bye
for my hard drives and since I've got
two mechanical drives in 72,000 72,000
I'm that's pretty fast</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
