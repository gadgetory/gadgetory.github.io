moment if you own a new PC or you built
one with ddr4 memory and a new graphics
card then currently you're in a good
spot but what about those people who
want to get into PC gaming they don't
know what to do was ddr4 Ram prices are
through the roof graphics cards are
scanning sold out everywhere and in that
case what you have to do is pull up some
deals jump in your car and go hustle and
that's exactly what we're gonna be doing
this month in January PC part son of the
month so let's take a look at what we
can get welcome back to tech yes it is
brand coming to you guys today with that
time of the month and it's that good
time of the month not that bad time of
the month if you're in a relationship so
the last couple of months we have
accumulated enough graphics cards to
write out this current short supply and
apparently it's actually hitting the
used graphics card market at the moment
as well people are looking for cheap
seven 80s cheap six 80s even and they're
snapping him up I have been eyeing off
the deals throughout the month and
whenever a graphics card does come up a
gun tree on a good price people just
snap it up straight away so with that
aside we're gonna pull up a heap of
different deals this month and see if we
can get some of those awesome prices but
of course last month what we did was we
went to the US and then we went back to
Australia and put on a bit of a US
accent and you know it was pretty funny
because people will laugh and all around
the world at that accent but this month
we're doing things a little bit
different we're bringing the UK to
Australia and we're gonna get them deals
so now first deal we're pulling up here
is a whole computer with a 78 70 and
also an i5 750 so we've got a gigabytes
of RAM p55 motherboard so we're gonna
see if we can drop in an offer of 200
Australian dollars now guys want
Australian dollar is weaker than a US
dollar so keep that in mind I'll put up
the prices so if you're in the US and
you get a little bit confused you can
just convert these dollars in
Australia's to us and you'll get a
figure of what we're talking about but
I'm gonna offer 200 Australian dollars
for this computer see if they'll take it
and if they do then we're getting
ourselves a pretty good deal
you have read you have read all right so
we've got no answer there we'll try
again later because that is a pretty
good deal if we can get it for the sad
price but let's move on to the next deal
now someone has a 2007 when Wow was cool
power gaming PCs so I don't know man I
said I was pretty much done with ddr2
and whatnot but if I can pick this up
and say $30 then I've got myself a
possibly another csgo potato build if
that's what you guys would want to see
because people were a quest than I do
another CSCO potato and if I can pick
this up to super cheap then we've got
ourselves an awesome video let's try it
out hello Levi I saw you got an ad on
gumtree humate yeah I just for $45 for a
2007 where was quietly yeah oh sorry
you still got I've got literally $30 in
while literally wallet mate would that
be something you'd take you mate I could
do I could do that mate you don't want
Texas yo dress do you want Texas your
address and I'll come pick her up yeah
sounds good mate thanks mate right so we
scored ourselves the first deal here for
$30 doesn't come with a hard drive we'll
find something we'll see what we can do
I know I do have like a spare stick of
ddr2 memory so I'll probably be able to
make like 4 gigabytes of
to memory and do something quirky with
this PC to hopefully bring it up to
speed and make it a modern-day csgo
potato and now the next thing we got up
here is $400 negotiable on some computer
parts so there is some juicy deals to be
had here I mean twelve gigabytes of ddr3
it's pretty decent as an SSD and there's
also gtx 780 except that $400 is kind of
when you add up all the different parts
individually it's $330 so I was gonna
drop in an offer of like $200 for all
these parts and even then that kind of
be fair games so I'll see if they take
that for those three parts okay so next
up now we've got a person selling a
desktop components for sale so they've
got three different drives in this deal
a power supply a GTX 780 Ti and also
some other weird stuff like a blu-ray
player don't need that so we'll drop in
an offer of say $350 as the power supply
looks pretty decent and the drives look
pretty decent too so hopefully they'll
take 350 if we come in with that lovely
UK accent
okay that was super weird that didn't
even ring like I tried ringing the
number didn't even ring at all so we'll
just manually drop our offer down and
see if they accept so and now they're
saying the offers too low so we'll
actually just leave that be so now next
deal we got up here is a gaming PC that
apparently doesn't boot up that it does
have an i7 4790k GTX 970 and also
sixteen gigabytes of RAM good pals bleh
everything looks pretty decent on this
whole build and they say they don't know
what's wrong they suspect it's the
motherboard of the CPU and I would be
inclined to think that it's the
motherboard in this case because CPUs
rarely die especially if you haven't
been overclocking in looks like this PC
hasn't really been overclocked I mean if
they knew how to overclock they'd
probably know how to diagnose the
problem as well that's just my guess but
we're gonna throw in an offer of around
450 Aussie dollars on this because it's
currently asking 700 but of course it's
700 I think they are not selling it so
let's give them a call okay josh is not
answering his phone either and we're
doing this on a Sunday as well so hmm
lately that's been a trend that's
happening people just aren't picking up
their phones on the weekend so I might
have to change it to like a Monday night
or something these parts hunts if this
continues if this trend continues so now
lots of the deals we've got up here is a
24 inch 1080p monitor name probably
thinking why do I need this I actually
want it to in that previous vlog that I
did where I completed this whole studio
I was gonna use this 32 inch monitor on
the stream desk but it was too big so
now I need or I think I need another 24
inch monitor so I found picked this up
for 50 bucks that's a pretty good deal
on 1080p 24 inch monitor so we're gonna
give them a call and they're just around
the corner as well so that would be
really cool as well so let's try it this
six one four three nine six one
so we've been waiting for a couple of
hours now the lady from Brisbane got
back to us and said she would only take
220 so it's a little bit above my
wanting price because I'd have to drive
all the way up to Brisbane and that's a
lot of time and gas as well so I was
kind of firm on 200 though it looks like
we've only really landed the potato PC
at the moment cuz the guy with the three
different sets of parts he um he yeah
he's like he wants two hundred dollars
just for a seven eighty so yeah it's one
of those months I think where we just
got a bit of a fail going on but on
other good news eBay did have this 20%
off sale on Ozzy sellers and I managed
to pick up an ASA GTX 1050 TR laptop
with one single 16 gigabyte ram stick so
that'll allow me to put in 32 gigabytes
of RAM and I'll now have a travel laptop
so I'm constantly changing my travel PCs
around and this looks like everyone's
been telling me to just change to a
laptop rather than a mini ITX so I'm
gonna give the laptop a try if it's good
then I'll probably sell the travel PC
recoup a heap of the costs and see the
differences because this little laptop
the $1,300 is a really good deal its
Australian dollars and it comes with all
the bells and whistles I need as well
because it comes with USB type-c and I
can use that for a DisplayPort for the
stream setup as well so I've got some
options here and they're looking pretty
good but that aside let's go pick up
that potato and also from a couple of
months ago Mitch he sent me a message he
was a guy who had the x58 that needed
tuning and he gave me some memory for
that do you still have both ads
available
he needs a DisplayPort cable so I'm
gonna head around and he said he'd just
got some spare parts lying around so I'm
just gonna go for a bit of a drive on
the Gold Coast and hopefully yeah we can
pick up that potato by the time we go
see Mitch
so now just go back and it's pretty late
and I ended up picking up that piece see
the guy messaged me very late and I was
actually just hanging out with Mitch
we'll drinking some beer and watching
the tennis man that Federer finale was
just amazing tennis is really popular
here in Australia especially for
watching it I love watching it it's just
on fire and let's go take a look at this
PC see what we've got here
275 so I think they set a GTX 260 in the
auction not too sure so that's actually
a bonus this will go really well for a
csgo potato and we've got here two
sticks of memory now said three
gigabytes I think in the ad but upon
checking this out it's actually four
gigabytes so to two gigabyte sticks that
is pretty awesome - the only thing I'm
not really liking at the moment is the
power supply which it looks like it's
pretty bad I mean 16 amps on the 12 volt
line with the GTX 275 is not gonna give
me much room to breathe and in fact it
might not even work properly if I change
the power supply around and put a quad
core in this thing I think it could
really get up and boogie and be better
than the last csgo potato we made of
course that question is probably running
on your mind does this PC even boot well
let's do it like the old fashioned tech
s city days and see if it boots
and we booted up and there's a signal
coming out so that's really good news
I'll be able to work some magic with
this PC hopefully give it a proper
cleanse and introduce you guys to the
next csgo potato now it is pretty late
at night and I'm gonna run this PC parts
hunt over two days because the person
who I offered two hundred dollars to
initially they've come back tonight and
they've said sure I'll take the offer
and so two hundred Australian dollars
for that PC is actually a pretty good
deal if it does have the 7870 a good
power play case motherboard and all that
stuff in the ad it actually is a really
good deal considering the market at the
moment and now speaking of the market at
the moment it's actually a pretty rough
market at least on the Gold Coast here
what I've noticed especially in this
January compared to last year's January
is that there's a lot more hustlers out
there picking up deals and you can tell
because of the amount of PCs that are
for sale on gumtree itself there's all
these gaming PC's pretty much now
popping up with very similar specs to
what I'll sell on my gaming PC's on
gumtree as so a lot more hustlers I
think and with that of course it's a lot
harder to snap up deals but of course
I'm gonna keep hustling for those deals
and I'll be trying to look for a new
avenue to get those really good deals
but Aliexpress definitely looks like a
good road to take and I'll be doing a
lot more research on Aliexpress in the
next couple of months seeing what PC's
we can put together like complete
systems to get around not in the
cryptocurrency boom but also the used PC
parts hustler boom
it's now the next day and I just got
back from Brisbane also earlier in the
morning I did the overclockable used
CPUs top five for early 2018 so stay
tuned for that and this PC 200 astray
lien dollars it came with that I five
seven fifty but also the motherboard is
really good it's a P 55 UD four it's got
an antique power supply deep cool
tesseract case also the eight gigabytes
of ddr3 memory is going to make this
thing a legit gaming PC now the only
thing that's wrong with it really is the
hard drive it comes with a 120 gig like
laptop drive so the guy must have taken
the old hard drive out and put that one
in just as he was selling it wanted to
keep his nice hard drive but it doesn't
really matter because that drive will be
the perfect drive for that new potato
that we're gonna be building and we'll
have to put in another drive with this
but they also threw in a 7870 because it
wasn't there initially and then I asked
about I said like yo you said 7870 in
the ad so it had also a GT 710 or
something so I've got two graphics cards
with this deal really nice deal honestly
but of course it looks like a jungle
sandwich
it looks filthy gonna have to clean it
up but of course let's check if the does
boot and of course that 7870 also works
as well
so here's a computer here it is booting
absolutely fine booting into Windows and
there it looks like there's no problems
at all with any of the hardware so
that's two for two we did not get hosed
at all with these PC parts this month
and really makes a good hunt when you
get some good deals like I was thinking
coming into this that I was gonna get
absolutely no deals at all and I mean
quickly before we go on with
conversation I mean check out that
jungle sandwich I mean that is some
next-level
like jungle I haven't seen a jungle like
that in a while especially with the
limited cables and limited hardware so
there it is guys this month was yet
again another success we got two really
good deals on whole pcs the graphics
card market looks like it was drying up
a bit but thankfully in the last few
months I have been stockpiling those
really good deals that I was getting on
GTX 780 s even 780ti s and that's the
thing that's why I really encourage you
guys if you see a deal
always hit it up even if you've got too
much like for instance when I was in
Japan I was smashing those x58
motherboards because I knew they were
really good value for money I was just
hitting them up I think I brought back I
think it was I got nine of them but my
friend in Japan he wanted three of them
so I ended up hooking him up three of
those and I brought back six with me as
well as getting those power supplies
which I've now all used to this date so
a lot of those parts I stockpile but I
also use them so when you come into a
good deal if you're looking to build a
PC and you see even another really good
deal and snap it up because if you're
one of those guys who bought a few gtx
780 s and you could probably turn around
and flip them for a bit of profit and
that can go towards getting yourself
better parts in your current PC so what
we've got here - awesome pcs let me know
in the comment section below what you'd
like to see especially done with this PC
here I haven't decided what I'm gonna do
with this PC but the other PC is going
to be the next csgo potato so January
ended up to be a really good month but
also some other really good news is I've
finally got my mbn confirmed so in 9
days I'll have really good internet
being hooked up in the studio that'll
just allow me to upload more videos get
back to streaming as well so the tech
lounge will be returning as well and
