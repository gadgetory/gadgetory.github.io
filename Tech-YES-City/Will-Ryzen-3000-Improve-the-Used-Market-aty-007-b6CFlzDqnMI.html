yes where you guys ask in the comments
some detailed questions that need
thorough answers like this first
question for example can i overclock my
BIOS chip the answer to that is you can
do anything if you set your mind to it
but it's been a while so let's overclock
this episode of address that yes
welcome back guys in the first series we
question we have here is if the rumors
are true about the rise into series and
it's spectacular price to performance
ratio how do you think that will affect
the use market even their lowest and
$100 CPU should be four cores at a
decent overclockable speed from the
looks of it and that does be down a lot
of use price performance especially due
to the cheap aim for motherboards
I think prices will drop across the
board especially when they start so
that's in relation to the 3000 writing
3,000 ships that are coming out later
this year
I honestly think of course anything new
that comes out that brings better price
performance than the previous
generations is going to bring down use
price performance accordingly of course
when it comes to just me in general and
hunting deals that's really not going to
change a lot because I'm always looking
for that cream of the crop stuff but
when it comes to sort of maybe like
bringing down the prices of fourth gen
Intel's and also bringing the price down
of second gen Rison of course it's going
to do that to what extent though I'm not
too sure because one thing we have seen
with trends and you've always got to
look at the trend in the use market in
the new market one thing we have been
seeing with the new market is those $100
CPUs now because I remember a couple of
years ago we had things like the Pentium
G I think it was G 445 60 or something
like that and it was 2 cores 4 threads
and that was like 50 or $60 and that
really shook up the market at the time
and that was a new processor came with a
cooler and there was just phenomenal
value for money now you're seeing like a
minimum threshold on the market of $100
and for a 4 core and so that's kind of a
trend that's coming in are they going to
release the 3000 series chips and are
they gonna charge a little bit more in
relation to the second gen chips that
does remain to be seen I mean I'm
curious because you know you look at the
8100 as well on the Intel side of things
and that's sort of upped to like $118
now for that entry-level CPU so I am
curious but of course new price
performance will always bring the price
down of use price performance next up is
spectra asks I hope that we will see x58
content because I just bought one
by x58 ud7 and bought because i love the
old-school overclocking and you inspired
me a lot through your videos I'm sure
that there is going to be a fix for the
performance loss in Windows 10 I got
that x58 board for a hundred US dollars
with an ex 5650 I 7 9 20 and 10
gigabytes of RAM that's a pretty good
deal like really good pick up there I in
terms of x58 content we did a heap of
x58 content recently I did Darth Jar Jar
as well looked at the performance of the
duel x58 Zeon's did x79 as well I'll
look at them probably a little bit later
in the year with maybe some builds in
the meantime like we'll definitely keep
touching on the old x58 next 79 because
there is some questions later on this
episode that do relate to x58 2 but in
terms of the content that's not going
anywhere
in relation to one of my favorite
architectures well actually x58 is
pretty much my favorite architecture of
all time because of what it can do and
sort of what it had in relation to those
eons that came out there was sort of
kept real low-key but offer phenomenal
price performance
next up hashtag address that yes hey
Brian do you think it would be worth it
to upgrade from a core i7 5820k at 4.4
gigahertz to one of the new rising chips
assuming the rumors are true for mostly
gaming and some editing and rendering
occasionally I have a 1080 Ti
Waterfalls GPU and do notice in a few
games that I play that my CPU is the
bottleneck keep up the great videos I
would say in relation to the 5820k I'd
say are you playing at 1080p because
that's realistically the only resolution
that that CPU should be bottlenecking
the 1080 T I mean tenancy has a beast of
a GPU still to this day and a 5820k at
4.4 gigahertz will still play games
really well I'd say it would play games
just as well as a risin 5 2600 at like 4
Giga it's off the top of my head so
you're not really gonna get any benefits
for gaming upgrading to Rison the 2nd
gen but the 3rd gen if the of course if
the rumors are true if that thing can go
to 5 gigahertz then upgrading will be
worthwhile but it does remain to be seen
because I like I said in my original
video I got the feeling that these will
kind of go from 4.4
4.6 gigahertz that's my thinking of
where these chips will overclock to
remains to be seen everyone's got their
guesses in the works and if that's the
case you're not gonna get a whole lot of
benefit out of it I don't really know
and I don't think anyone out there has
access to these Rison 3000 chips except
the engineers and the people stress
testing them themselves and they are
very and trust me when I say this they
are very tight-lipped about what they're
leaking I know AMD over the last year
have been really trying to crack down on
rumors and leaks they absolutely hate it
so what we're seeing from AMD is really
all you're gonna see of course right up
until launch I mean like a week before
launch once and they get out in the
retail channels that's when you see
those real leaks because people just
take them and test them so I am waiting
for those details but a few months
beforehand it's still no one knows next
up here Matt Stone says according to the
youtuber dankmemes you can overclock the
W 3680
and W 3690 on OAM mother boards using
Intel's
extreme tuning utility and that's he
means like Dells HP to lenovo's and
other manufacturers like that that did
make X 58 mainly like workstation
systems I granted he was only able to
achieve 4.1 gigahertz but that is still
a noteworthy bump I wish you would be
trying this soon I actually only read
this comment like even though was 2
months ago I only read it now I'll
definitely look into that if I come
across one of these motherboards because
I have come across one of them in the
past I just don't know if it's supported
the six core Zeon's but basically the w
3680 is the single QP ice core Zeon's
that can work on some of those x58
boards that don't support the q pi/2
Zeon's that's the X 56 50s and whatnot
and they do on the same token have an
unlocked multiplier that's the 36 1836
90 so they're able to just go sky-high
so in the cases of these OEM boards
they're probably locked at the base
clock anyway well we've been taking a
look at that I do look forward to that
next up here we've got Kela he says when
you get an X 79 system for 15 bucks from
an e-waste center and you end up man
look Kela
I've filled man that would have been
like the biggest peak and
the biggest comedown after that I really
feel sorry for you dude and then next up
tricks gaming he says if you were using
Photoshop don't bother with mspaint and
use ctrl shift alt s which is the save
for web function that you can
specifically edit the quality and size
of your PNG jpg gif without the output
of the image thanks for the tip he's
talking about when I sometimes the
images are way too big so I run them
through mspaint first which reduces the
size drastically then I can use into
things like thumbnails where YouTube has
a 2 megabyte limit on the size of your
thumbnails so it's a little handy trick
I'll definitely use that next up Brian
Jia Mendoza says a levira will help with
the scar tissue try to get some fresh
aloe and used as a cream I've been
massaging it a lot I've been using a bit
of a vitamin E and jojoba oil on that
and it's just it's common good it's a
slow progress because it was a deep scar
it's actually really crazy because the
back of my nail here has a indent mark
so that's how deep the cut went in my
thumb and it's actually funny because
there was another comment in a recent
video that the poor guy I mean Lucas
Colker he said Lowell Brian I did not
learn from your mistakes and cut my
finger on the thin PCIe bracket thing I
it's painful man I feel sorry for you
Lucas hope you get well soon next up
we've got here mr. 1 1 SC 1 1 1 he's
actually I do remember this guy's name
from like 2014 2015 he's been commenting
for a long time and he says it seems
that this channel are one of those who
don't believe in two craps from adored
TVs leaks about cheap Rison 3000 CPUs in
relation to the Rison 3000 CPUs and
adored TVs leaks adored TVs entitled to
have whatever opinion he's allowed AB is
entitled to me whatever content he's
allowed to have and I like Jim he's a
really nice guy and I think some of
these videos are phenomenal they're
fantastic they're well researched that
well put together and he delivers them
really well it's just on the leaks with
Verizon I had a different opinion and
that's because I get into the mindset of
those people on the board who are
sitting down and they're thinking about
making money because AMD Intel Nvidia
they're all publicly the
companies the end of the day they got
shareholders and major institutional
investors that they've got to take care
of and say they're thinking profits and
so when I look at what they're gonna
offer the public and the prices that I
saw in those videos I disagreed with it
I think they're gonna charge more if
those rumors are true about the specs or
I think they're gonna be a little bit
less on the specs at the same price
that's just my thinking it all remains
to be seen I just look at it logically
from how much they want to make in terms
of money and dough yeah but there's in
terms of Germany's content it's good I
like I really liked his analysis of the
16 CCT I so yeah next up JFK o says
questions of the s men when are you
going to convince Galax to sell GPUs in
Europe they actually do already under a
different brand name it's called KF a -
that is actually officially Galax it's
just they couldn't call their company
Galax in Europe
so I'm guessing someone already took the
rights to that name in another example
of this is in Japan with logitech they
actually have to call their company
logic cool because in Japan someone
already took the name Logitech before
them so it's a weird thing so it is
already in Europe and it's called KF a -
next up Joseph canister says please
notify me when you get hands-on like a
bunch of 2070 GPUs I'm here in TX or
Texas and when doom external comes out
yeah sure I got the risin 1600 and rx
484 gigabyte but I'm not sure that's
gonna take this game okay I I mean our
TX 20 70s they actually have been in the
u.s. coming up secondhand a little bit
in Australia I only seen one up for sale
secondhand it was pretty close to retail
so I didn't really bother but yeah I
don't have any secondhand r-tx 20 70s
that I'm getting in bulk I mean there at
the moment like rs5 70s rx4 70s the GTX
10 series guards they're miners are
still getting rid of those things and
you can get them involved for pretty
good prices I'd maybe suggest taking a
look for a 1080 TI that thing's still a
beast why a little trade blows with the
2070 next up mu our Dib says don't buy
dak and amps by audio interfaces if you
want true clean audio like focus writes
armies etc most Dax and hi-fi trash is
not outputting music cleanly
it depends on what DAC and amp you're
buying essentially a DAC an amp is not
getting the input side of things so
technically it should be better value
for money Falls you want to do is listen
to high-quality audio
there's many Dacron amps that I really
like there's the O to decamp solution
that's pretty much flat and neutral it's
very high powered too so they're not
trash it's just different strokes for
different folks
next up Tek with Sean says I love that
you address some of the troll comments
that's what makes you rock you've always
got it you got to feed them a little bit
sometimes man none otherwise they're not
gonna comment anymore and that's not fun
next up nate'll babel says did you dye
your hair
I have dyed my hair and I do continue to
dye my hair because I am I don't want to
fall into that tech Chuba frosted look
next up vs Kai says regarding the scar
tissue a bench grinding wheel should
take care of it wing face good video
thanks yeah man I'll just get some steel
wool and turpentine on that thing clean
it right up next up Joel Queen says love
the new set it'd be great if you did a
land party I bet it would make from a
great vid yeah I'd love to set up like a
land potty locally it's just there's so
much going on here at the moment it's
ridiculous people just want to keep
sending stuff in whether it's using you
and they want me to take a look at it
and I'm like man I can't refuse that so
it's been busy the moment one day when
I'm not so busy I will want to set up a
lovely awesome land party you guys will
have to let us know - what are the games
in 2019 that are new but you can still
play the land functionality on like a
lot of these games nowadays just locked
to the Internet and that was one thing I
missed back in the day when you played
over land it was like the the pings was
zero basically like instantaneous so
it's such a good experience and then the
last question here is from frag a lot he
says I love to add em to nvme on my azuz
p9 x79 motherboard not pro not deluxe I
just need one of those x2 PCIe cards
with an MDOT to connect on it right yeah
you can get the PCIe adapters that will
go then through your PCI Express whether
it be 16 Lane or whatever it is
and of course you may need a modded BIOS
so in the case of the brand page I have
here someone made a modded BIOS for it
and it worked
perfectly there is another guide that I
haven't tried yet where a guys in
Windows and he sets all these things up
and then is able to get the enemies
working on V another method but other
than that I haven't tried that yet so I
can't validate if it works or not any
guys that's it for this episode of
addressed the yes if you guys have any
questions that are boggling your mind
then be sure to drop a comment in the
comment section below also if you've got
a joke I always love hearing a good joke
good troll I'll go with that too and
that's about it
I'll catch you guys in another one very
soon if you enjoy the content as always
sure to hit that sub button bail
notification a city where it's always
popping with those behind the scenes
shots and stories I'll see you next time
peace out for now BAE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
