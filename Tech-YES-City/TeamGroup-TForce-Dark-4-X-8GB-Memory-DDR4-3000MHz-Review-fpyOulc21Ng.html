Panther memory and that was pretty solid
though being in Japan I have had some
experience with a brand called teen
before when they asked me to take a look
at their 3,000 megahertz 16 18 18 36
times t force dark memory modules I said
sure I mean who in their right mind
could pass up free batarangs
welcome back to tech city this is brian
coming to you guys today with a review
of team groups 32 gigabyte 4 by 8
gigabyte ddr4 memory kit which features
only one XMP profile and just like the a
piece of stuff it was one thing that I'd
like to see companies do it would be to
put two or more profiles as this stuff
on my 5820k couldn't even reach the XMP
profiles though when I coupled it with
my 6800 K CPU it was a very good
experience getting a solid 32 hundred
megahertz stable after overclocking when
I found the maximum stable bandwidth
overclock though as viewers pointed out
with the Panther memory review it's not
always about the maximum speeds and I
completely agree having not overclocked
memory for quite a while I thought it
was time I would polish up my skills and
put this memory to the test and after
dropping the timings and the speeds I
found that the team dark memory hit a
sweet spot at 26 hundred megahertz with
timings of 1314 1431 with a command rate
of 1 which of ddr4 memory can hit this
then it generally means that they have
used more than the minimum standard of
layers of PCB when creating their
modules that is it is better than your
run-of-the-mill stuff this particular
blend of stick also features a gram
black blended heatsink there kind of
looks like somebody's favorite weapon
clearly Bruce Wayne's memory of choice
though on a serious note this stuff ran
really well at the rated X and P speeds
and also the overclocked ran really well
too and I even decided to stress that's
the memory for over an hour to ensure
the temps weren't creeping up and in the
28 degree environment the modules were
getting barely warm as for overclocking
like a boot at three point three and
even four point four gigahertz so the
two modules started dropping out and on
my lower overclock with tighter timings
at 12 13 30 and 28 it started dropping
out and only one memory module remained
and this was most likely due to the CPU
memory controller not being able to
handle the additional clock speeds at
the higher clocks though the lower
clocks it was most likely to the memory
itself also this memory although
produced by team actually features DDR
banks from micron but with all that
aside the 10 group memory is solid the
build quality is good and there really
isn't a lot else to this stuff overall a
solid choice and ultimately what this
means is that there is now another
manufacturer that is bringing
competition to the market and in
in helping bring down prices and offer
better value to us tech enthusiasts now
what about pricing and availability well
I could actually only find this stuff
currently for sale on Newegg where it's
16 gigabytes for $75 that's to buy a
gigabyte sticks though that was for the
red and black stuff the gray stuff that
I have here surprisingly is an extra $25
so I don't exactly know what's going on
there but for $75 for 16 gigabytes of
this stuff
it is pretty damn good value for money
so definitely keep your eye out for it
and if the price is right - be sure to
snatch some up for your x99 multitasking
King ding-a-ling Randall before the jam
bling Kronk on the katana hustled with
the muscle productivity and gaming PC or
your sky leg build or your upcoming Zen
/ something like build and also don't
forget to manually set your system agent
voltage in even if you are just
overclocking on the XMP profiles and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon and also don't forget
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below what's your
most aggressive overclock you have ever
done in your life I'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments and opinions as
always now catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
