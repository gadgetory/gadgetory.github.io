architecture called x58 and it was
released into the wild and it was quite
well received it was i79 20s which were
for core a threaded CPUs and they
overclocked pretty well and everyone
loved him and that was like the way to
go back then but in 2018 is x58
and what was released in 2010 which was
a 6 quart 12 threaded Xeon still the way
to go especially if you're a gamer well
today we're gonna be testing this CPU
the X 56 60 which you can still get on
Aliexpress 420 US dollars or a little
bit under that that's free shipping as
well and we're gonna putting that on an
x58 motherboard overclocking this CPU to
4.5 gigahertz with an air cooler in a
sub ideal ambient temperatures this is
27 degrees ambient and we have been
testing this with the new king of gaming
the RT x 2080 Ti and then we're gonna be
comparing that of course against the
granddaddy of gaming which is the 9900 K
clocked to 5 gigahertz so ladies and
gentlemen grab your Xeon capes hopefully
they used and strap them on because
today is gonna get a little bit
interesting but before things do get
interesting are you ever down the gym or
you go out on a date with someone and
you're thinking damn I wish I had more
money for food if you're that person and
you're hungry then you can save money on
a Windows 10 Pro key and then go out
with that extra money you've saved and
go buy some more food with today's video
sponsor s CD Keys bringing you a 12
percent discount with the coupon code
TYC SK so simply go to the website go
get yourself a legit
Windows 10 single end-user license key
bang it in and you're gonna have happy
days ahead so if you want to save
yourself some money then the link is in
the description below so here we have it
the 8 year-old CPU that is the X 56 60
now there are other variants of this CPU
namely the X 56 50 and also the X 56 75
which is my personal favorite
they basically differ in the max
multipliers and you can get other cpus
like the w 36 80 which have unlocked
multipliers but the multiple that we're
using is a Maximus a rampage from Zeus
now when it comes to X 58 it is
important to choose a good motherboard
to overclock these CPUs on some x58
motherboard won't even support Zeon's
from the get-go take for example the ud7
which I have here in the studio this
thing is complete garbage when it comes
to overclocking it only managed to
support one skew of memory that we had
here and all the other memory just
didn't work on this board very weird
problem but then we pulled out the
Maximus rampage and it was happy days we
managed to get the big clock to 214
megahertz and at these settings we could
then lock in 4.5 gigahertz without
having to rely on Intel's turbo settings
and this led to gaming performance which
was pretty damn good considering we're
coupling it with a graphics card that
cost over 1200 dollars that's over 60
times more expensive than the CPU we
have here not to mention the 9900 K
costs in excess of 500 US dollars so
that's an expensive CPU on its own but
let's blow up some benchmarks for you
guys at 1080p Ultra settings first off
we're gonna show the worst case scenario
and this is far cry 5 which is still
single threaded IPC dependent and what
we saw here with these Xeon x50 660 was
we got 97 average FPS vs. a hundred and
fifty eight on the 99 hundred K so there
was a big gap and was one to the likes
of around 50% and then we scale it up to
1440p ultra which is a spot arguably
you'd want to be with if you're buying a
card like an RT X xx atti and here we
saw the gap lesson where we got 96
average FPS and then we compare that to
the hundred and thirty two on the 99
hundred K so we can see at 1080p we were
CPU bound in both cases at least
according to the 1440p numbers and
funnily enough it showed that the xeon
especially at 1440p ultra can still play
games with a hundred Hertz monitors
which is a fantastic experience
especially if you're going with my
personal favorite which is an ultra wide
35 inch 100 Hertz and you play at high
settings moving on now to dota 2 in the
past I've tested this at 1080p low
settings because I guess that's where a
lot of competitive gamers would be
playing this game at but when we step it
up to 1080p maximum settings here we
actually do expose quite a big gap
between these two CPUs we saw the lights
of 100
fifty-three average FPS versus 218 on
the 9900 kay so that was a difference of
around 33% going to 1440p ultra so
pretty much the exact same thing
happening 148 average FPS versus 215 so
the scaling of the resolution didn't
really affect performance because the
graphics card still has a lot of room to
breathe
it wasn't being stressed anywhere near
100% in both scenarios however the one
percent lows did scale with the CPUs
they were really smooth on both the 9900
K and also the X 5660 and then moving
over to csgo 1080p ultra settings are no
practically no competitive gamers play
this game at these settings but we
decided to change things up and we saw
355 average FPS with a 1% low of 105 vs.
472 with 123 1% low and then we compare
the 1440p numbers and the gap lessons to
279 versus 360 FPS so there was a gap in
these first three games definitely it
was there and the RT x 28 ETI being a
lot more powerful than the 1080 TI does
help expose this gap ever so more I'm
moving over to GTA 5 1080p maximum
settings we saw 108 FPS versus 151 1 %
lows were very good on both sides with a
90 100 K actually being a little bit odd
in that it does sort of break the engine
in this game when it gets too high an
FPS bigger but moving over to 1440p
ultra settings
here's where things start to look more
GPU bound and less CPU bound with 93 FPS
vs. 98 so there's virtually no
difference between the $20.00 CPU and
the $550 CPU at 1440p ultra and GTA 5
moving over now to overwatch which is
another competitive title with a 300 FPS
limit here at 1080p Ultra settings we
saw 222 average FPS versus 297 so the RT
X 2080 I wasn't being capped at all and
the 9900 K could definitely take it to
the brink of 300 FPS the 1% lowers were
very good on both sides of the fence you
can get a very playable experience on
both CPUs at 1080p but stepping things
up to 1440p Ultra did see a bit of
stress on the GPU this time around then
we saw 199 average FPS versus 263 so
there was quite a gap in this game by
about 25% at 1440p and a similar gap at
1080p but we did test this game in
pretty much a worst case scenario in a
battle with just mass Road hogs
everywhere stuff going on and then I was
bashed in and I was just going ham and
so the trend that we're starting to see
is that maybe with the 1080i there
wasn't too much of a difference but now
we're stepping it up to the r-tx 20 atti
so we are now starting to see a gap
finally be exposed on the Xeon versus
the latest and greatest but let's roll
through some more popular twitch games
at the moment black ops for Call of Duty
and here we have here 141 FPS versus 237
on the exact same spot in blackout mode
the 1% lawyers were very controlled on
both but did scale in terms of the
average FPS to the 1% lows so there was
quite a difference here and that was
actually over 50% so the 9900 K did very
well in black ops 4 which is quite a CPU
demanding title just as it is
graphically when you max the settings
out stepping things up to ultra at 1440p
saw the gap widened a lot where we saw
124 average FPS versus a hundred and
sixty so around 30% at 1440p Ultra and
moving over to the last title however
Rainbow six siege a very popular
multiplayer title also very popular on
twitch channel DP ultra settings saw we
got 97 FPS with a minimum of 47 then we
compare that to the 99 hundred K which
scored a hundred and three and sixty
five minimum stepping things up to 1440p
Ultra saw a 57 average with 36 minimum
versus 61 and 46 respectively so there
was virtually no difference when it came
to maxing Rainbow six siege out between
the $20 CPU and the five hundred and
fifty dollar CPU a lot aside we can now
move on to conclusion time and also
throw the Cinebench scores MP you guys
where we got over a thousand points on
the X 56 60 and around about 137
single-threaded which the
single-threaded performance isn't that
great but keep in mind this CPU itself
is over 8 years old and we compare that
to the 9900 K for example that is
getting over 2000 CB and also on the
single-threaded score over 200 points so
is there and I'm glad to see and tell in
the last couple of years have definitely
picked things up with the 8700 K and now
the 9900 K but what comes after this is
anyone's guess is the 9900 K is you guys
know if you haven't seen the reviews
already it's really pushing the limits
of the ring box I don't know the thing
it's gonna get a whole lot better than
this especially considering Intel's new
10 and enemy 2 architecture has been
facing delays and whether that will
clock to 5 gigahertz like the 9900 K
will is anyone's guess but when it all
comes down to it we do have 500
megahertz of clock speeds on the 9900 K
we do have better IPC and we do have two
cores and it is making a difference in
games with a graphics card that's
costing over 1200 US dollars so the x58
Xeon going into late 2018 and most
likely most of 2019 because we haven't
really seen a whole lot of development
in graphics cards will be still relevant
and I'm more interested now after these
tests in testing was something like an
RT X 2070 or an RT X 2060 when that's
released and seeing how well it performs
because for $20 the value is phenomenal
you're not gonna get this kind of value
out of CPU anywhere else in the world
and then of course coupled that with the
cheaper ddr3 memory in this case we used
off sticks we used a red stick and to
just random 4 gigabyte sticks and then
managed to get them over 1700 megahertz
and that was absolutely fine it gave a
very smooth and playable experience not
just to my eyes but also when we look at
the 1% low numbers as well and then of
course the motherboards this is the
biggest problem facing x58 and it always
has you have to get a good motherboard
and then you have to get them at a good
price but if you guys have seen my
previous deal hunts in the past you know
that I come across x58 motherboards here
and there this one that we actually had
on the test bench was given to me as
part of the GTX 690 deal that I picked
up so that was crazy to see that because
he just said I've got no use for this I
can't get it working and alls it really
needed was a heatsink on the North
Bridge otherwise it would have shut off
because that silicon on the North Bridge
does need cooling just like a CPU would
need cooling too and needless to say
it's a phenomenal motherboard and it
does do the job very well anyway the
last thing to talk about is the power
consumption itself we had the fire
9900 K in NightA 64 juicing about 280
watts from the wall and then we had the
X 5660 juicing around 300 watts from the
wall and the CPUs themselves I can't get
a reading of the CPU on the X 5660
directly but I'm willing to bet is
actually using less power than the 9900
K but because the motherboard has more
components on it we're using three
sticks of ddr3 memory that's where your
extra power consumption would actually
be coming from because we have a cooler
master cooler here and that handled the
overclocks absolutely fine temperatures
were around 80 degrees and there are
coming in lower than that of the 9900 K
which gets up at five gigahertz close
towards a hundred degrees with a custom
water cooling loop so there you have it
the motherboard the z3 knight is gonna
be more expensive the water cooling
needed to get five gigabits on the 900 K
is going to be more expensive and then
the CPU itself is going to be a lot more
expensive but I guess that's the price
you pay when you want the latest and
greatest and coupled with an already
overpriced RT X 20 ATI when you look at
price performance this is one that's
shaping up to be a conclusion of when
you want premium you're gonna have to
pay for it anyway guys with all that
aside I hope you enjoyed today's
comparison with the x58 Xeon versus the
latest and greatest z3 90 and it's 9900
K if you did them sure to hit that like
button but I'm thinking to myself maybe
a more relevant comparison would be
testing the value kings of the new price
performance say the risin five twenty
six hundred and even overclocking that
on a stock cooler and then testing
something from the nine series from
Intel which is their value King which
I'm actually yet to identify which one
it would be I'd say maybe the i5 8400 is
still the most relevant choice from
Intel side but with outside let me know
your thoughts and opinions in the
comments section below
love reading them as always and let us
know as well are you still rocking in
x58 Xeon because I feel like they're
still so relevant even still in late
2018 and especially when we start
comparing these two CPUs with more
affordable graphics cards for instance
look forward to giving you guys these
Xeon comparisons because I know you love
them but also on that note don't forget
