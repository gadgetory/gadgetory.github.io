editing / secondary rig to skylake and
instead of building a whole new PC I'm
just going to be upgrading it and doing
sort of like a vlog commentary for you
guys which shouldn't take too long
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech es cities Brian coming back to you
guys today with a video sort of
detailing the upgrade process so
essentially what we have here is the ex
5650 and an x58 motherboard now this is
a 6 quart 12 threaded CPU but it is a
few years old and I did get sent a
review sample of the z170a so I decided
with that that I was going to upgrade to
skylake and I've got the 4 core i5 6600
K which I'm going to have a lot of fun
overclocking because I love trying out
new things however this being said we're
just going to simply pull out this
motherboard pull out the CPU cooler
hopefully we can use this CPU cooler
with the z170a and we'll find out today
and then it should be a breeze because
all the cabling is already done the
power supplies installed all the drives
are installed so it's just a matter of
pulling out this graphics card and
putting in the new motherboard CPU and
all that so let's get on with it alright
so we've got the PC all ready to go this
is a fractal define r4 case now you will
want to backup your files just in case
anything goes wrong I always recommend
whenever you're doing work where you're
unplugging hard drives and stuff like
that always back up your crucial files
just in case something goes wrong in my
case I am reinstalling the OS as well so
I've already backed up my files now it's
pretty much just the case of upgrading a
PC as I'm plugging all the necessary
things and just putting them aside and
then getting out everything so I mean
I'll try and make this as quick as
possible
so
yay okay there is the motherboard all
out so that's the first part done so now
we're just going to take off this cooler
off this big motherboard now when I got
this cooler I got it secondhand for like
ten dollars so I'm pretty sure it was
missing a mounting bracket so I had to
kind of mount it in with just the
standard just the screw holes coming
through the front of the actual case so
see they're they're pretty long screw so
I figured I could do that and not have
any problems but hopefully I'm hoping
this fits on the z170a board and if it
doesn't then I'm going to have to buy a
new cooler that supports our little
friend here
now if you're reusing the RAM you'll
want to if you're reusing the RAM you
want to obviously take that out and put
it on your new motherboard but I don't
really I've got
ddr4 memory so it's irrelevant to me
that's the next part we're going to now
try and put this computer on our z170a
motherboard as our artic silver five
still nice and moist and to clean this
off you just grab yourself an alcohol
wipe you should always have alcohol
wipes like readily available wherever
you are they're so useful for just
anything you know like just cleaning
anything in general not just computer
parts so there's our X 5650 who yet
writes the first things first we've got
the MSI board here and we're going to
put our memory and CPU in usually I like
to put the CPU in first because there's
no sort of no blocks or anything like
that and it's usually the easiest thing
to get in so we've got a sixty six
hundred K and now we've kind of got to
look for that dot the arrow usually it
goes this way usually so if I'm wrong
then God help me know that that fits in
perfectly like that
and then we just pretty much with the
four cores the main streams it's usually
just one clip with your x99 you've
usually got two clips there so that's
the first part done very easy to do and
then we've got our RAM here which is a
good thing about I'm not the biggest fan
as I've said before I'm not the biggest
fan of the Matt look but the memory
we've got here is matte black as well so
it's going to match this motherboard
perfectly so we put that in like that
and now the good thing about this board
is I like it it's got dem two and four
there printed there and it's got first
so that's very easy to understand
because it's a dual channel supported
motherboard you
want to put generally you want to have
your memory running and jewel config and
that's what we got so we've got to 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory going in there
and now we just want to put on our
thermal pastes I mean you can do it any
way you want it but just for saving time
I'm going to use the pea method the p/e
okay so you're using some Animax I
actually ran out of the UM I ran out of
the what you call it the Arctic silver 5
I ran out of that stuff so you're going
to put a little blob there and you get
the rest of that off because I don't
like thermal paste spilling on my
motherboard it's not one of my things
you just tighten up that head now now
there's going to be difficult because as
I said before this cooler is not the
greatest like I pretty much have to
mount it from the top and with that I
have to kind of it's just hard because
you'll see I'm going to have to mount it
from the rear and I don't even know if
it'll fit I should have tested this
before I put the thermal paste on but
yeah alright so this is an LGA 775 CPU
cooler now does not fit this bracket
anyway does not fit with the LGA 1151 or
the MSI board so it does however as you
can see here fit diagonally now which
this will be fine for sitting up the
board horizontally so the cool is just
sitting on top of it however I probably
will be buying a new CPU cooler that
fits this probably is for the long term
this is really something I wouldn't
recommend but in that being said I'll be
able to do my review of this sooner than
I expected as I won't have to order a
cooler just yet so as ghetto as it is
this will work so now there's a closer
look as you can see there this and
another side are just completely not
attached as well so yeah the top looks
so much better than the bottom oh yeah
let's just put this bad boy back in the
case now it's just what it's all about
I and put the i/o shield in - can't
forget the IO shield
you
ah I'm the biggest noob I didn't plug in
the SATA cables
that's clearly labeled there so I'll be
able to make won't do this pretty easy
okay so we've got the whole computer
running and it's working and MSI just
asked me to flash the boss before I do
anything so I'm just going to do exactly
that so got version 1.4 and we're going
to install that on top of this so it
should be okay because it's got a
dedicated flash mode hopefully
everything works well I mean typically
nowadays when you flash a BIOS it
actually loads it into the flash ROM so
and then it flashes it so nothing can go
wrong generally unless your power just
shuts out which is the worst case in our
and then you will break your motherboard
but this motherboard has two biases it
has dual bias so there's no problems
it's all good in my hood
okay so the bias flash has finished so
now we can get on to business and that
is yeah just recording okay here we go
delete run back yes I want to run by
want to run glass yeah okay so we put it
up in the boss now everything is running
a okay we've got our BIOS which has been
flashed to version 1.1 for now
interestingly enough when I did load up
the BIOS before but my camera just
bricked out for some reason I don't know
why it does it very rarely but I'm gonna
have to probably reinstall the camera
gear but I had up there 1.1 6 volt on
the vehicle that was on version 1 so I'm
guessing the defaults are looking very
similar to Haswell and Ivy Bridge on
this default that's 1.1 1.1 there on the
vehicle I'll just go through with you
guys I'm just really plugging my mouse
back in so I can hot plug that and show
you exactly what I'm talking about
the vcore here one point one volt so
before that was one point one six on
version 1.1 now they've changed that so
obviously this is behaving pretty much
exactly like has well an Ivy Bridge was
so I wouldn't generally I mean with that
keeping that in mind I wouldn't be
taking this over 1.3 volt but regardless
we have this is the first time I've
booted it up and I should technically
install Windows before I overclock but I
don't know I've I mean the CPU like this
is the thing I installed this CPU cool
light only on the diagonal that's only
on the diagonal there so I don't have
the two screws in two of the sides of
the motherboard now this cooler is so
freakin cool at the moment and it's 34
degrees as well which is a very good
idle considering this room is what 23
degrees so that's not bad at all so
we're just going to try and give it a
little I mean just install windows on an
overclock I mean
stable overclock why not this is a vlog
and I'm sure this is why you guys love
watching the vlogs so easy I don't want
easy mode give me advanced so there we
go
this is back to the original so I
thought it was yet overclocking profiles
here but we'll go to settings and just
check and to make sure all our stuff is
good to go
until info block effect I've never seen
that before um so yeah there's all these
options here I'm going to have to go
through them in my own time that okay I
mean yeah it should automatically boot
from the SSD anyway nowadays with all
these overclock Explorer mode ok we're
going to get all core here and we're
going to bump it up just to 4.2 gigs
we'll try it on fixed mode of course the
ring ratio we'll try that at yeah I mean
3.9 we'll give that a shot as well I
mean that seems to be the go to the ring
ratio isn't so important as long as it's
a hundred megahertz below your or lower
if you make it the same speed as your
CPU ratio especially on high as well
then it did cause a little bit of
problems like it was a little bit worse
off than having it lower than your poor
clock there and just mumbling to myself
and your CPU base clock will leave that
off for now the DRAM auto frequency I
mean if we've got XMP profiles we'll
just lock them in for now no that's
pretty cool - they've got if you've got
Samsung memory and high Knox memory or
micron memory you can just lay that's
crucial I think micron is crucial you
can just lock those they've got profiles
automatically there which is actually
really good I like that that was a
feature on MSI's x99 board as well so
let's try I mean we're going to lock in
4.2 gig I mean we'll just try 1.2 2 volt
to begin with I mean probably even just
up it just to be safe and I want to see
if temps RAM you know if I'm installing
Windows I want to go overboard here
vitia I've never seen this voltage
compensation yeah I probably want to
disable that just for now because I mean
I don't want my voltage going way too
high and I don't know what that setting
is allows most of the advanced
overclocking tweaking to CPU okay we
would want our good old adaptive then
we'll just go straight for adaptive mode
our adaptive plus offset adaptive plus
offsets pretty good actually and we can
put that on plus and usually I give it
plus point five I don't know just for
some reason my overclocks
tend to work really good with adaptive
plus offset just for 24/7 super you
voltage conversation we're going to turn
those off for now I mean the SA voltage
that stuff we're not overclocking the
memory at the moment so we're just going
to leave that I also want to do as a CPU
and I mean this is the first run and
haven't even tried skylake yet so you
guys are seeing it as it unfolds I mean
let's give this a whirl anyway so me and
we've got two as well I've got to insert
my boot disk which is going to be a SD
card so plugged in through a USB so
we've got an SD card plugged in through
a USB component here this is going to
either suck or it's going to be good so
we're going to plug it into the front
panel let's see if this works
front panel USB port boot for me baby so
we're going to try this and see if it
boots from the get-go okay
so boot priority UFE a hard disk
the I'll just try and pull up I just
save this anyway save this as noob
overclock noob OC there we go save that
so that's a four point two and we're
just going to go try and boot this bad
boy up okay I don't like that I just
want to quit man yes save figuration and
exit yes save it for me okay so we're
going to try and boot now off the USB
we're going to see if our this bad boy
can walk the walk now so four point two
gig straight off the get-go and we are
going to try and get into our boot menu
I don't know forget I thought it was f
11 on this board when I saw it before
hopefully it brings up that yeah f11 to
run boot menu cool okay oh man okay UEFI
generic SD petition one that looks good
we'll just we'll just boot that see if
my SD card can boot windows so you might
not need a USB after all there's just a
spare memory card I had running around
and looks like it doesn't work okay
let's try this
hey please work yes okay that works cool
alright so now we are now booting
Windows and if it all makes it to the
screen then it should be good like if I
can get the loading the files and stuff
then we're in man I think we're already
done like okay
Australia baby there we go yeah okay
that sounds good to me install now
okay this should work I mean hopefully
it works okay I got to put my product
key in and you guys can't see this
so our skylight build looks like the 4.2
gigahertz overclock is working and
Windows is installing so that's pretty
cool yeah
now obviously another thing is I don't
know if you can see that I gotta get in
there there's that little bit you can
see there I don't know what that is I
got to check that out that numbers just
moving all the time I think that might
be your CPU load that would be the most
logical thing so that's really cool if
that is that's actually telling you
you're the load on your CPU in real time
like that
is a really good feature that is useful
for an onboard motherboard feature like
that's actually really cool anyway we'll
get back to the install so like this is
a fastest Windows install I've ever seen
so the single core performance on
skylake is actually pretty good as if my
camera can focus probably as focus
hunting there we go logs you guys say
you love the vlogs you just want to see
more of them you don't care you just
want to see more text so this is my
first time booting this bad boy up and
I'm gonna pretty much I don't know what
to do with this I'm going to sell this I
think it's the ex 5656 cores 12 threaded
CPU beast of a CPU this will go up to
four gigs no problems the CPU will put
out a lot of heat though I mean this CPU
compared to the four-course skylake man
did this big sis ninja core this thing
was getting pretty warm I mean now
touching this thing it's just it's cool
man like this for core this is putting
out no heat at all so yeah anyway that's
done please unplug the following to us
yes so I'll get oh did I show you guys
that
I'll get oh I get oh I just got up the
ISO there there's I get out windows boot
disk it's not even a USB boot it's like
an SD card in the US
a card reader and that's it that's all
uh that's all our install is so let's
get and Stroke the ISO down so there
that's working now and I don't know what
else have to do unplug that and
reinstall my computer and we're good to
go
I mean I've got to install drivers and
do all the boring stuff now which I'm
sure you guys don't want to see but
there's the upgrade process it's really
easy this is only taking me like an hour
and a bit to install all the hardware
mount a cooler that doesn't even
properly fit the motherboard and get
windows installed so yeah things are
going pretty good I'll do an
overclocking tutorial for you guys but
let's move over to a conclusion now yeah
so I thought I just was about finished
and everything was working perfectly but
that was not to be the case there is a
problem I'm having a little bit at the
moment knows what the killer and I see
on board this actual motherboard and
I'll show you what I mean you can see
here the device manager you know
nothing's happening but as soon as I
plug in the killer and I see you'll
notice that it just starts refreshing
like literally every late literally five
seconds so I just plugged it in then and
you notice the device manager just goes
crazy now just starts refreshing every
few seconds and that's pretty much
what's happening is in my internet
browser too if I go to a download for
instance and then I refresh that it'll
fail as well pretty much in sync with
the refreshes in the device manager so
it's as if something's cutting out and I
got to pretty much figure that out so
what I'm going to do is only put in an
external and I see I've got one lying
around and I'm going to see if that
fixes the problem and then the you know
that just means the onboard killers a
bit buggy and I've got to just spend
some time diagnosing why that is so C if
I unplug the internet like I did just
now
then it should stop doing those
refreshes so yes let's stop doing that
now so I don't know what's going on
there I've got to figure that out it's
pretty crazy but yeah it wouldn't be a
computer build if there wasn't a problem
and so we've installed the killer I mean
sorry we've disabled the killer and I
see now I've installed an old Broadcom
PCI Express ni C so this is really old I
mean the driver supports usually
embedded in Windows and it's recognized
that the Internet is working so I'm just
going to try this download again and see
if it fails yeah so it's failed again so
now I've got to get back to diagnosing
why this is happening so I don't think
it's the killer's fault I think
something else is wrong with this board
and I don't know what it is so I've got
to figure it out now so it's not the N I
see this is the problem with having
problems is that you've got to diagnose
what's happening so I mean I can pull up
device manager yeah man
why me that's I mean generally when I go
with these new builds I had problems the
last time as well where I had to update
the boss yeah you can see there the
device manager is flashing again and I'm
guessing that's to do with same thing
anyway I'm going to keep diagnosing and
reporting back all right guys so that's
it the problem was fixed by just
manually setting the time to the current
date and time the time was actually like
set back to 2009 and that must have been
causing the error with the internet
syncing to the Microsoft server or
something I don't know I don't know but
it's fixed anyway so everything's
working perfectly now I just have to
benchmark this motherboard and give it a
good stress test and overclock my CPU on
it because that's sort of part of the
motherboard review and that'll be coming
to you guys next and we've got the new
shirts
so I'll even though they're not ready
I'll get that link and all that
all stuff ready because you know the
truth hurts baby but if you guys liked
this vlog then please give it a thumbs
up if you have any questions about
today's video then drop a comment in the
comment section below and I will get
back to you as soon as I can and this PC
here yeah so I have to get a new cooler
on it one that actually fits properly so
if you want to manually install your LGA
775 coolers on these 1151 motherboards
just keep in mind that they're going to
be like a diagonal connection only which
is kind of ghetto as you can see is
facing flat down at the moment just to
make sure everything's okay but you know
the CPU is running really damn cool like
it's a world of a difference compared to
the X 5650 which uses up a lot of power
so I mean overclocking this for course
should be a complete breeze so even
though that TDP rating says 91 watts I
think it puts out less heat than as well
as above so I think that rating is just
there to make sure that people don't
skimp on coolers that's all anyway guys
that's it for me I will catch you in the
msi z170a gaming m5 motherboard which
i've already tested the audio out on my
speakers and the base and the sub-base
are good which is indicative of a good
day and combo so peace out for now and
I'll catch you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
