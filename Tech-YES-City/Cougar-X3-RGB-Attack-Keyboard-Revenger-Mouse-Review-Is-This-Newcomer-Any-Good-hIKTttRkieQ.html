mouse review this time from a relative
newcomer in the game called cougar and
they have their revenue Mouse and x3
attack RGB keyboard up for review so how
do they perform let's find out
welcome back to tech yes city and the x3
is an RGB keyboard from cougar that
comes in a currently a hundred and
twenty USD and there's also the
accompanying mouse that comes in at 30
USD
but looking at the x3 keyboard first it
is an RGB keyboard that comes with legit
Cherry MX red switches rather than
clones this alone I am sure is going to
make a lot of people happy we're always
looking for the real deal so to speak
but don't want to fork out over a
hundred and fifty dollars plus for a
keyboard that features RGB and Cherry MX
switches the actuation distance is your
standard halfway down which does start
to put it a tad behind some of the other
switches i've reviewed recently though
it will still be fantastic for gaming
and typing providing you aren't prone to
making typos like myself which then you
might want a blue switch or something
with feedback which they also have on
this lineup anyway the red switches
featured here amid a median level of
noise so to speak and on that note I
will let the keyboard do the speaking
for you
the weight of the x3 is a hefty 1.1
kilograms and it has black accents at
the top with the Cougar logo in the
center and milled alloy running under
the switches which does make the RGB
light reflect off the keyboard quite
nicely the brightness of the keys have
three different levels or can be
switched off and besides that there are
three royal profiles on the function
plus f1 f2 and f3 keys that within them
have three different settings which
allow up to nine different profiles that
can be changed on the fly though if you
wish to edit these profiles manually
then you will have to download the
software which allows for more
customization of the lighting though it
doesn't allow you to change back lining
individually it does allow macros and
key remapping and updating of the
firmware I found the software though to
be confusing and sluggish at times
especially compared to other software
that is already out there now you also
gain the ability to change the polling
rate from 125 Hertz to a thousand Hertz
and there is an N key rollover function
which when switched on worked quite well
there's also one extra level of
adjustable height and coming from the
rear is a 2 meter braided cable that
splits the two gold-plated ends with one
of the cables not doing anything at all
since there is no USB pass-through on
this device also there is no included
wrist rest or key cap puller so Kouga
have sacrificed on standard included
items to make the keyboard have those og
Cherry MX switches so now onto looking
at the revenging Mouse this speech is a
pmw 3360 picsArt sensor which runs all
the way up to 12,000 dpi and people
familiar with this sensor will know it's
one of the best out there having
adjustable lift off distance which
actually works and also allowing for
smooth tracking winning games and also
with the ability to allow just about
angle snapping for those who want to use
it professionally the mouse features
some nice clickety click action too with
Omron switches loaded all round and the
ability to change three levels of dpi on
the fly and also sniper DPI if you macro
it to the other two side buttons or the
flywheel button the center scroll will
itself does have a nice firm scroll to
it and the click can be used reliably
the mouse weighs in at roughly a hundred
grams without cable drag and the shape
is very similar to that of the Razer
DeathAdder which would make it a palm
grip as Mouse in my opinion the cable
itself comes out of the left of the
mouse rather than the center and is non
braided solution which is actually quite
popular with the gaming mouse scene now
onto comparing the input lag of this
Mouse to the G 302 we can see that it is
roughly 10 milliseconds behind though
again this is not exact science it is
still fairly accurate which is
acceptable though for a mouse at $60
recommended retail price I would like to
see those numbers come down a tad the
software also allows you to change the
DPI and the polling rates all the way
from 125 Hertz to a thousand Hertz and
there is the ability to create macros
change the RGB lights in two different
zones and remap the switches so now on
to verdict time the x3 keyboard and
Reverend your mouse are very solid
options from a hardware standpoint you
get RGB lighting and Cherry MX switches
it comes in at 129 recommended retail or
159 Australian dollars which is $29 over
their non RGB Edition whether a $29
premium is worth the RGB lining is up to
you
I even think the non RGB version is
going currently for just under $70 which
makes it a steal since it is loaded with
legit Cherry MX switches the x3 RGB
version however is pretty fair value at
$120 though I would honestly love to see
and include a wrist rest and key cap
puller and also think the software could
use some touching up the Revengers mouse
was also quite solid it boasted good
build quality and had some excellent
specs though it is entering an already
highly competitive market in a 60 USD it
is quite an ask especially against other
brands that have already been in the
market for so long
lastly Kouga also sent out with the
review samples a bungee and a mousepad
these were actually really nice to use
with the Excel full desk mousepad coming
in at 17 USD or 20 depending on the
color scheme and the bungee coming in at
17 dollars which makes both of these two
accessories easy recommendations
especially for the mouse
and you guys if you enjoyed this video
then be sure to hit that like button and
if you dislike them be sure to pop a
dislike down there and let me know guys
have you tried a cougar before I know
they can be quite comforting sometimes
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
