a tutorial on how to update your boss so
this is what you're going to need guys
you need a USB stick so get your USB
stick can be any size really doesn't
have to be four gigabytes like I'm using
plug that into your computer now I want
you to make sure it is a fat32 first so
go to computer right click on properties
and mine already is a fat32 so it's a
fat32 and if it's not you can format it
to be a fat32 so by right-clicking on
right-clicking on the device including
format so now after we've done that we
made sure it's fat32 we are going to go
to as rocks website and i'll put this
link if you've got an extreme for like
me i'll put this link in the description
below but make sure you get your mum
suit to your motherboard and we've got
the latest version here we want to do we
got instant flash dos and windows so we
want to do instant flash which flashes
from the boss it's the most stable guys
it's the most simple and it's not going
to like generally it shouldn't break
your computer if you for a few hints so
save as save as anywhere save it
anywhere you wanted and then once it's
finished downloading i want you to open
that file extract it to your USB disk
okay finished extract it okay so that's
finished now so we've got it is the
flash we've downloaded that we've got it
on a USB disk and we are ready to rock
and roll now so now before you do this
guys
if there is no problems with your
computer then I don't recommend updating
bars because there is always a chance
that you can brick your computer now
I've tested this already so what you
want to do is before you update your
boss you want to set all your settings
back to auto so load ufi hots Save
Changes and exit so you want to you know
cancel yoga clocks and all that because
there is still a mind you chance that
you can break your bottles so you don't
want any
run any risks so basically you want
overbold a little bit now we go to
advanced in a Nazarite motherboard
instant flash and that's come up with
our boss so we want to click on it and
it's basically it'll update your boss
now so processing crash list features so
as rocks as rocks flash utility is
extremely easy to use a little seed my
little babies getting excited about it
too it's like you're updating the boss
that's great
now just yeah you see let it go you're
right from the boss you want update the
instant flash you don't want to do the
Windows version or the DOS version as
this version is probably the most you
know solid so you will know okay babies
getting a little bit anxious I hope this
hurry up so I can go okay now video guys
this is um so once this is finished you
update your boss so if you've got any
questions guys leave them in the comment
section below and of course subscribe to
keep the bronies you going but yeah
that's the most easiest way to update
your boss it takes two minutes and you
want to make sure you got stopped clocks

stock clocks and you've got you grab
little bean man

to say yep that's a bias update and guys
yep so that's how you update your boss

cancel your overclocks
like you set everything back to normal
settings and it's running you know solid
before you update your boss and that's
it guys that's it's pretty easy to
update your boss I honestly yeah I don't
recommend updating your boss unless you
absolutely have to because you know
there's always a chance that you can
break your boss and if you do that then
