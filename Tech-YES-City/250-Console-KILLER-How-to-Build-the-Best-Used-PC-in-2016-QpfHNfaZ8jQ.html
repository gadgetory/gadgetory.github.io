price performance going for it or does
it today I'm going to show you guys how
I turned a $250 PC into a ps4 destroyer
welcome back to tech yestiny this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
250 dollar pc which i've recently
completed and i've tested it at 1080p
this thing will get you 60 frames per
second in a variety of games and it will
in my opinion beat a ps4 and an xbox one
not only in price performance but also
in everything else however before we get
onto the building the actual
benchmarking of games i wanted to do a
quick rundown of all the prices that i
paid for these parts so starting from
left to right we have here the
motherboard and a gigabytes of ddr3
memory which also came with a cpu for 82
dollars shipped however as I detailed in
my prologue video the CPU was actually
dead
so then had to spend an additional $40
to get in an ex 3450 which is actually a
better CPU than the i5 I originally had
it's also 8 threads and it's
overclockable and generally the xeon
cpus are considered a little bit better
than the standard consumer-grade line
especially in this generation of cpus to
the right of that we have an r7 270 from
XFX which I managed to pick up a $97 and
then just below that we have a 500
gigabyte Western Digital black
enterprise storage hard drive which I
got also for $11 shipped to the right of
that we have a Sith core there which I
managed to pick up a while ago for about
$10 and then above that we have an antic
650 watt power supply which I picked up
for $14 shipped off the internet and
then just behind that I have the final
component which is the case where I
picked that up for two dollars down the
junk store so that leaves a total price
of the build to around two hundred and
fifty-five dollars however let's get on
with building this thing and doing some
benchmarks now
my powers
my bus my power dollars but
oh yeah
but I was
my house
I've been looking forward to this my
powers have doubled since the last time
we met count good twice the pride double
the fall
I like my power showers
but my power dollars
house
what
how is it my powers
as fast
the fire
see the lights only
to get there and hope we will meet there
Oh
but my powers
my powers
kill him
I shouldn't Gilly so there we go guys
the benchmarking is finished and as you
can see this computer did a great job of
running pretty much any title at 1080p
at 60 frames per second whether it was
Ultra or high settings or medium
settings this thing gave out great frame
rates at 1080p and that's a true 1080p
mind you not a 720p 30fps like the
consoles are doing this is a true HD
picture so there you guys have it if
you're on a budget and you have some
time then you can definitely find some
really good bargains out there and build
yourself an absolute price performance
beast in my case this $250 PC is my
favorite PC that I've built so far in
terms of both news and new PCs I really
had a great time with it because the
final result is absolutely kick-ass now
if this was the only PC I could have I'd
be still very happy with it 1080p gaming
on this thing was an absolutely amazing
experience so if you guys want to look
for use parts just keep in mind that you
can incur problems however in the long
run I do believe it is highly worth it
if you know what you're looking for and
you know what you're doing hopefully
some of my used PC videos have given you
guys ideas on what parts are pretty hot
and will give you great price
performance and also what parts aren't
good and what parts will give you bad
bang for buck
that's about it if you have any
questions about the $250 console killer
then drop a comment in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can and if you haven't
already subscribed attack yes City for
Nora noir tech news and reviews and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon pigs out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
