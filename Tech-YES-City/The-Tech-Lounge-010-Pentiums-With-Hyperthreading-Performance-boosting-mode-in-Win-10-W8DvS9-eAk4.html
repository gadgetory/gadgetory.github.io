boo
welcome back to episode 10 of the tech
lounge i'm joined by a cab from tech
show down how you doing keV doing great
Brian how about you man you feeling a
bit better a bit better yeah I woke up
this morning like my the left eyes
finally get I'm in my right eye is
finally getting better than the left eye
like this morning is a little bit puffed
up I'm like oh no please just let it end
you know when I get back I want to get
back to making content so hopefully
that's not as bad as it sort of as I'm
worried that it might get too but
besides that yeah everything's been
going well it's been really hot for some
odd reason like extremely hot so how
about you / in / the ditch Chevy um yeah
it's it's actually been not too bad
really but New Zealand doesn't really
get particularly hot summer you know if
it's a hot day maybe goes to mid
thirties type thing but it's nothing
really excessive wear you know Ozzy
start getting all the way through the
40s i speeding up it sort of you know
unbearable um I just notice that the
chat seems to be disabled smell yet to I
will fix it LOL to those so them hey
just there wouldn't be so it just
wouldn't be a show without something
wrong with it yeah it's so good just
that I knew if people could complain
they would all right go at a guy's the
chat is enabled so with any tech pickups
for the last week as well did you get
anything good um no like oh I started
back doing videos so I did it the g one
gaming GTX 1060 unboxings get into it
now made a video just discussing my
thoughts on Vega and pointing people to
come join us in the tech lounge we've
talked about it more extensively so a
year but today will be good i'll go to
play tic after the show stun today and
i'll pick up the z 2 70 kb lake system
which is waiting for me and then i'll be
able to start my kb like testing with
retail ships 7700 day i'll see how many
I can get out I'll definitely get both
you know the high five and the i7 um but
maybe i'll get be able to get more than
one so we can see how much of it
discrepancy is there and overclocking
but we'll just have to see how that goes
but what about you man you picked up
anything you know this am picked up a
bit not another xeon i mean i've been
actually been a little bit what I was
sick as well I've been testing this this
is the qh 8g now it won't work on a-z
270 definitely no but I'm I actually
there's an ebay sale so I ordered some
old z1 70s that apparently this ship
works with so this is the chip that I've
been holding out but problem is it's at
the end of the day I'm probably not
going to be recommending it that like
because it's actually a hardship to work
with so this one you pick it up in
around about 100 us and yes a fork white
thread skylake essentially it's like a
6700 k so you can overclock it's an
engineering sample so you can overclock
it's a hundred bucks but the problem is
is actually getting it to work on a
proper modern ward so I ordered some
motherboards they're on sale off ebay so
I ordered them for twenty percent off so
the cheaper than the retail is here so
looking forward to getting that done
hopefully I can get it all working with
you know custom modded bios and armed
with the microcode injected and stuff
but I will say one thing the Russians
are really cool like those these Russian
overclocking forums and I couldn't find
anything about these chips like there
was just nothing on these chips on any
of the sort of English overclocking
sites so the good man i went to the
russian sites man there on that game
these guys man they got like full-on
look at all the microcode bin files
ready to go there like this is how you
do it this is these are the confirmed by
haces working on these particular
motherboards so they're really on their
game and arm yeah that was really good
to see their kind of their overclocking
community thriving so yes no it's really
bigger they're a lot more in tickets my
most views by country Russia is like
fifth for me on my analytics so the
really high viewership I get from here
more Russian viewers and Australians and
gyllenhaal so pretty big from there but
i also get more Germans than Germany's
like my fourth most watch by country so
yeah it's kind of crazy but a u.s. good
old USA that's my number one to be this
for you a USA's number you have cool
yeah us is king like that's you massive
it's about a third of my viewership
comes from the US boldieu doc I said in
another video it's like not just it's
not just the thirty percent factors like
like literally eighty percent of my
revenue comes from the US yeah you know
that's why you have to tell you cater
what did I just do then you have to do
you tailor your content aliens yes yeah
yeah like it just has to be so there are
no other two ways about it so yeah
that's the CPU as well we're going to
talk about the g 45-60 as well Intel's
latest dual core as well we get into
that topic as well but we'll jump into
the first topic here this is the windows
10 so they're bringing out another
update so you know like I I'm getting
sick of these like you know every time
you update essentially it resets the
settings that have changes services
around you know so I might have to even
make another optimization guide I'm not
too sure but this is it is the first
optimization gotta did for Windows 10
was pretty good yeah you know that's
still you know it's still relevant today
but from is they change little things
around it this time around they're
promising to introduce this game mode
and exactly what it does is still up in
the air but what do you think it'll do
Windows 10 game mode so basically I
assume this will be very similar to what
an anti-virus program would do a
security suite or something would do in
the in the sense that it's probably just
going to turn off things you don't need
while you're gaming stop things from
updating namely I don't know probably
windows update but windows updates been
pretty good I think for most people
anyways with not doing that so I think
it's just going to be something like
that but what they're saying is that you
may not see what a lot of people are
assuming is that you may not see any
difference unless you're playing games
through the windows store which is not
what most people do I don't know anyone
who plays games through the windows
store I think the vast majority steam or
when
the other ones like that let you play or
something else so yeah I don't know but
for right now it's a cool idea for just
windows tend to be a bit more
streamlines I think no one would
complain about that it's just the
complaint will be if it's only for
Windows the Windows Store or if it's for
all of the you know if you play games
through steam it'll still you'll still
be able to put it into game mode and
you'll reap the benefits from it well
that's all they're hoping for we're
hoping to put this game mode and enable
it when we're playing not just on the
Windows Store which is I think a lot of
people are hoping for that and that's
yeah that comes in then I mean that
would be great right we can have our
steam games okay let's go this dedicated
mode drops all the services in the
background I we're not going to get any
crappy stuttering while we're Gary
that's the biggest complaint i have with
the understand and so I think windows
8.1 is a little bit better like I've
noticed when I played games like dota 2
whatever you the latest 7.0 update don't
get me started on that but I'm you know
when I played a few games it feels like
there is this occasional stuttering that
shouldn't be there you know I'm not used
to it it's actually a windows 8.1 when I
had that Thun completely tuned to the
max I'm just one you know is this going
to be game mode is going to be properly
is it going to be done well or is it
going to be medium rare you know what I
mean even though medium yeah exactly so
where might just be rare right you know
to me no one really exist yeah rare I
know we're going to get one guy in the
comments like a mistake rare but we
essentially we want this to be a yeah a
medium rare steak you know what I mean
instead of just a realistic sir yeah
that's a that's what we want so hope
they can deliver I mean yeah it's still
up in the air exactly what's going to go
on with this update is it going to just
be for Windows Store which I've got an
inkling that it will be for some reason
I don't know what's how bad Microsoft's
been lately with a list
commercialization and stuff like that
and with a kb like as well being ah the
fact that you require do you know if
there's a way around that with the kb
lake requirement that you use Windows 10
I'm not too sure I mean apparently
doesn't I mean apparently just disables
some services on windows 8 and windows
seven like O'Hara Lee's
like a lock it's just if you want to
fully utilize your system yeah I don't
know if you guys can hear that so I'm a
parents arguing in the background I'll
just yet midstream can you guys keep the
noise down on live streaming Thanks ok
there we go cool anyway like I don't
know I tell them I'm live stream so yeah
they're gonna start arguing but they
that's all it's just Australia you know
here the neighbors arguing dead meat the
TV deliver ma'am haha but yeah so so it
wasn't a complete disabled you can still
run Windows 8.1 with kb lake it's just
going to disable some let the encoding
or well I mean imagine they have to
allow it still that that would be like
anti-competitive if they did that right
i mean oh right if you can't install
your Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 that you
paid good money for I think what they're
doing is they're they're just disabling
a few little things I'm not exactly sure
what's going on there but I noticed one
thing that I will tell you one thing I
did have a 0 70 and I installed a custom
bios on it just to test if this chip
would work and you know the funny thing
is this is scary to the bios it was
working completely fine everything was
perfectly fine and went and backed
itself up it's like no this bias is yeah
I'm gonna we're gonna flashback the back
up by us and I'm like who ordered this
you know everything's working perfectly
fine so there's definitely some funny
bug is going on there with you know like
a co detection and whatnot so yeah yeah
now yeah they're funny but I think it's
that's it to the comments just exploded
after that out haha I don't know look
guys I don't know what was a verdict
they're gay this is just like they just
decide like literally are right outside
where I'm streaming like just to start
having an argument I'm like oh SI
Australian way you're gonna make sure
everybody hears if they could just say
Luke Bryan streaming at the moment we
can go an argument out back you know
what I mean yeah
what we're going to talk about that a
risin the four core which I hadn't well
first off we're gonna go with cabbie lay
this is really damn I've got to admit
this is I've ordered one of these as
soon as I saw the price it's like 78
australian dollars right we got the g
45-60 coming up oh the Pentiums yes yeah
OMG 45 see I mean this is actually
pretty huge news I mean a lot of a lot
of enthusiasts okay they're rocking
their i-5 still or they're rocking their
overclocked I sevens what not there six
course they're not in it care but this
is actually really damn big news for
that budget segment I mean you can
technically if you've got a friend as
well you can go and get a really cheap
h110 and then flash the mouse and then
you'll still be able to support the
chief 45-60 it's essentially in the
states i think it's like a sixty-dollar
cpu you know something like 58 or
something but here it's $78 at least I
bought one from you might so hopefully
i'll be able to pick it up today or
tomorrow such big news this cpu to cause
for threads clocked it I believe it's
clocked at the 3.5 bigots yeah they said
a hundred megahertz bump up over sky
lake so I would know that sir I think
the IDI 371 hundreds like 3.9 decodes
but this one's three points oh ok hurts
caaa essentially it doesn't have an
instruction enabled versus the versus
the i3 except the difference is though
for gaming that instruction sets never
use I think it might be a VX I'm not too
sure hmm so it doesn't use a turtle
instruction set for gamers it doesn't
matter so they're not really cool
product to keep so $64 us sorry I don't
know why it's so cheap in Austin have
seventy eight bucks that's what I'm
picking mine up for so we can check out
the 7100 which is going to be sort of
like the go-to budget CB you yeah this
is just so good for consumers from the
perspective of like your once risings up
as well consumers you guys are going to
have so much choice when it comes to
cpus you're not going to know where to
look you're gonna have so many got all
the pentium line obviously the core line
up and then all rise and celina
it's going to be fantastic so yeah
pulled up the i7 7100 so that's going to
3.9 gigahertz so that's got a 400
megahertz clock boost which you know for
double the price it really isn't worth
that but will check the 6100 quickly and
yes that's 3.7 so you can see the value
here is insane like for this little
penny and now one has to wonder you know
same same level cache as well three
megabytes so one has to wonder is this a
pre-emptive move towards our oh
absolutely sin absolutely yeah you think
that your sources we are absolutely
without a doubt yeah so you know why
else would they you know do this if they
had no competition okay I mean they
would just run the core line up some
more I mean what would have they really
the Pentiums in the past for one they
haven't had hyper-threading since the
Pentium 4 and they've just been
relegated to obscurity basically in
terms of the gaming market on the G 3258
obviously changed that but yeah mmm
still you know that it's not being the
most popular with this looks like
they're actually taking a serious this
time and you know what's the reason for
that is you know not just a coincidence
at this time around suddenly they'll
will bring hyper-threading back on
Pentiums all of a sudden it's because of
raisin absolutely Intel's just trying to
over saturate the market um with so many
cpu choices and intel making up probably
about 75% of them depending on how many
rows and chips come out but what I'm
worried about this is the thing that
worries me with the G 45-60 is you know
it's it's sort of like it nvidia did
this today md already right AMD's got
there you have his card on the launch
the nvidia just pumps it out a few
months earlier cheaper price and that
you know that's what nobody's got
something big on the horizon now this is
what's happening something big is on the
horizon or pond and 10 yeah and you know
i think aunt Elsie's that okay bang ji
45-60 and the thing is a sixty four
dollars or in australia like seventy
eight dollars
that's gonna be freaking that's gonna be
real hard to beat yeah that's straight
off the get-go how the hell do you beat
that like you're not i mean even if even
if Zen is really good on the budget end
how do you beat $64 with a free i'm
pretty sure i have a freakin cooler
included how you know how do you beat
that that's insane value for money no
it's just it's crazy but I mean the
thing is you got to think how much
profit is Intel making of those higher
end chips oh yeah they can sell these
ones for so cheap yeah I mean there is
there is ways in that right I I'm all
for companies you know jack and the
prices up if we're getting a really big
improvements because I earned if you pay
for the R&amp;amp;J so yeah exactly so because
you know upgrades aren't cheap but the
problem is like cabbie lake really
listens but let's be honest yes it's not
an upgrade i mean the IPC is virtually
the same but this you know this here the
g 45-60 is looking like a gem and i was
surprised when i started reading up
about this i was like okay everything
looks good on paper and I'm hearing
early reports that everything is
performing really well on paper too so
you know it's it's damn here we go guys
the winners already been released and
it's kind of sad because I'm really
looking forward to amd's launch but this
is kind of really gonna blow the low-end
out of the water like I don't you know I
don't see it getting much better than
this that's the problem yeah I mean
we'll have to see at the time I'm with a
lot right Springs you should say that's
the problem too it's a she a really good
thing for consumers oh yeah yeah it's
good it's that's what it's saying before
I mean you're gonna have so much choice
there's going to be so much competition
at all areas so i would say that there's
going to be massive amounts of you know
they'll be dropping prices both sides
will to try you know capitalize on that
um and yeah it's going to be fantastic
for people i think you're the consumers
are going to be able to get a very
powerful cpu you know relative to the
price that we've ever seen yeah
your money is going to go so far yeah so
I'm looking for the fork or option as
well I mean it'd be interesting if Intel
did launch a three core six threaded CPU
that would be really interesting but one
can only hope that would be a really
cool sweet spot that arm there's also
you know what are they going to do with
amd's obviously got the fork or on the
you'll talk about this now so we've
changed topics to the four cores right
am DS rising for course will take on the
i3 and the i-5 and I think this is
really true a lot of people out there
going to want a fork or and if they can
hit the market around 150 bucks then
damn it's game on there so yeah yeah
this is this is really good to see I
think what people took a kind of the
wrong way in that the sand when I said
these dual cores with hyper-threading
and very good yeah in the sense that you
can play your games because the games
only look for the threads they don't
look for the foot the inner for the
cause yeah we know what I meant by that
is that you'll be able to play your
games but I'm not saying that you would
rather a dual core with hyper-threading
than a quad core with no hyper-threading
you're always going to want the physical
cause yeah um it's kind of difficult to
explain in it in a simple way but hyper
threading is with the with the virtual
cause it is not the same um you'll be
able to get away with it in terms of
your games you still be able to play the
defense are you always yeah it depends
on they always want the physical for
yeah of course you want the physical
cores are you want the floating-point
yeah it's over there having two floating
point units but I mean the thing is mmm
yeah you still got four threads there it
can still act like a fork or even though
it's not a fork or yeah yeah the bottom
line is there's not going to be as
powerful yeah specially for gaming of
all things yeah yeah I mean it's up in
the air what you'd want to get but I
mean when you get a jeweler you know did
the 45 60 is a big deal because it's
what 60 bucks I mean there you go so
yeah you get a forty-dollar motherboard
yeah hundred dollars you've got almost
your bare bones chuck in some ram you
got some bare bones they're ready to go
so yeah damn but I mean look rison
they've got their for call for threat
interestingly enough this is what I saw
on this article
here for calls for threads so they're
going to be doing what intel's doing
sort of they're going to be sort of
releasing skus with hyper-threading
without hyper-threading whatnot if
interesting to see their full cpu lineup
and what it entails but yeah this is
there apparently they're going to be
launching it around March that's looking
like the release date and I'd say that's
about right on the money I'd say March
is where you're going to be looking so
much third it's going to be available on
stores I'd say that's a pretty damn
accurate to when you can see rise and
being released and it's going to be a
huge launch everyone's gonna be like oh
my god how does this thing reform oh my
god oh my god oh my god but I will say
one thing I mean look we just looked at
that g40 files get back on you Ryan stop
talking about the g 45-60 i know but
it's going to be hard to beat that
that's all I'm going to say so if you
love me if you're looking to go out now
like you like look I cannot wait to
build a budget PC and you've got a
friend who can flash that by us on the
h1 10 for you I think actually msy down
the road here they were charging ten
bucks to flash the mouse for you so you
might have want to think about that if a
store can pre flash the boss for you I
think five bucks is pretty fair I mean
they just quickly got the cpu there bang
flash bang flash but um you know if
you're looking to get a new pc new
budget PC then you're not going to be
going wrong with the G 45-60 that's all
I want to say like no you simply want
it's not going to get much better so
yeah I think the Rosen will be
interesting and also once we actually
start testing some of these motherboards
are as well I think will be really cool
i mean some of these new x 370
motherboards for the enthusiasts look
absolutely superb so i think what i mean
most people if you're going with the
fork or you go with that be 350 instead
and i can't wait for that be 350 that's
gonna be like yeah that'll be really
cool as well so i think this will be
very very interesting for a lot of
people out there but hey I mean we can
only say now once once all these are out
then we'll be able to test them but I
think yeah Intel's definitely prepare
ring I mean it mean it I think it shows
that they're obviously worried about
Rosen because of you may be something
there furred that we don't know about or
something like that so that the fact
that they're releasing all of these
they're trying to over saturate the
market right before raisin comes out as
I mean I was you sir but there is
another thing too I mean how is it going
to really compete with the x99 platform
as we pointed out last week there's only
four slots of memory they're sort of
like you know some people want it's not
so mean there's also apparently only you
know 24 pcie lanes so versus 40 right on
x99 chips so yeah kind of a little bit
you know what's their answer sort of if
they do have an answer for x99 i don't
think they may be no dare i say they
don't have an answer for some of the x99
real high-end stuff which is where a lot
of profits would come from four until
I'm sure of that but it's okay yeah i
think they make probably more of the the
core range then of the extremes like the
broadway probe made more skylight than
they did a fraud well II or for stuff
like that because of the x 99 s I would
say the profit margins are much larger I
mean not many people run it out of all
the people I know yeah um you're
actually the only person I know other
than myself running broad Willie so
there we go it's not that now it but I
mean would you agree out of all the
people me maybe if you're no more
enthusiast than me but and all my
friends are just do gaming they will
just run i5s nice Evans did you ask him
if they lived good come on valid
question oh how are you going down this
nah I would we're just gonna move on to
the next time you so this is sad right
game show me this article we're talking
about we're talking about last week Oh
LED monitors comin to ya too busy and lo
and behold L goes and cancels therefore
klo LED monitor project they're shutting
it down there lighten up color issues
you know you can this monitor would cost
five thousand dollars if it hit the
market and basically it had color
shifting when you looked at it from
angles and i'm sure people who are
paying this money don't want this
product and so it's one wise wise choice
i mean
they're in the business they're not in
you know they're not running a charity
surface here so I completely agreed like
for them if they you know if they saw
the outlook is being really negative and
they cancelled it and that's okay I mean
usually if you look at it I think
there's that innovators curve right
whoever puts in the initial rd always
ends up losing it's always like the
early innovators that end up picking on
ya so maybe they'll just sell their
project to someone else saw else will be
like okay because you got to do this
this this is this and then we'll have a
pc gaming led model i think there's a
huge market for it honestly like I think
oh yeah I think there is a pretty big
market for people who had just fed up
with crappy white LEDs and if she could
paying good money for it like me I'm
hole now like I'm not buying any new
monitors until we get some OLEDs in the
back light yeah yeah not exactly right i
mean this side change what we talked
about last week which was a was it sharp
i believe with their huge investment
there 20 LED technology so with Foxconn
I think so yeah I think I think that'll
be good and so was that that will
obviously still you know help things and
a lot of other companies are researching
and developing it more so this is just
one sort of thing but but this is always
going to happen you always use with one
technology yeah there's always hiccups
and speed bumps and they got her you
know they run into problems or it's way
too expensive mean 4k monitors when they
first came out that no one could buy
them but then you look at our cheap they
are now so OLEDs will be the same the
launch hi very few people be able to
afford them and then after a few years
later through efficiencies and other
things the price will drop dramatically
well while syncing with this right with
this is got the oleds right I think what
might happen even this is a possible
scenario people will just start using
your LED TVs they'll be like who cares
about pc monitors when I can get such a
gorgeous experience out of HDR led back
with TV bang who cares if it's 50 inches
and just seeing this adoption where
people will start running these TVs and
then you know the gaming monitor market
be like what's going on while we sell in
pc monitors you just hey you know we
want the latest tech and the latest tech
is 0 LED get it on the freaking panels
yeah and you charge us reasonable price
yeah I think we'll see it on phones
first that'll be the first place because
apparently that's what the technologies
or four is the next iphone right now any
worse yeah i got this out in caps
questions of tech city ok will answer
that in the Q&amp;amp;A it's coming up don't
worry well answer that when Q&amp;amp;A don't
worry it's coming up guys it's not too
far off we don't have many topics this
week because we did the show like a few
days ago yeah yeah yeah we're like a
bigger Q&amp;amp;A section this time so you know
start thinking about the questions get
revved up guys for Q&amp;amp;A but we don't hear
the next article the zotac gtx 1080 mini
so zotac i've done it but it's it's not
as many as many of the people and that
like the mini ITX ducky yeah it's still
quite bulky from what we've seen in the
past i remember some of their very tiny
i mean even some of the tiny am 1060 who
can get a much smaller I don't think
this is a particularly good looking card
either but does look very Toit though oh
man it does look the week yeah I mean
for those people that does I mean yeah
that they're definitely going to be able
to get this in there mini-itx built and
you know getting a 1080 in there wow
that's going to be that is powerful
that's a winner that's the winner right
there yeah for a little mini ITX i don't
know how many people um do those mini
ITX builds these days I don't know if
it's increasing or decreasing personally
I'll probably talk to play tic today is
increasing sales guys I think think yell
Isis sales guys if they're selling more
than mini-itx stuff um yep but i'm not
particularly sure I knew back a few
years ago it didn't have a particularly
big following and they obviously were
people that were into it it is quite
cool I do understand why people do get
into it it is really cold the idea of
having a very small
compact pc you can pick up and trust me
if you're a person moves around a lot
that's really good you know chuck it in
a bag or so when i was coming when i was
doing all that traveling dude that mini
ITX pc it was amazing dude so you know
mini-itx species are incredible yeah
they're really good you can pack all
that desktop power into a small package
and you can cool it properly you can
drop a water cooler on there you can
keep the noise down still there's so
much you can do with a mini ITX pc that
you can't really do with a laptop you
know you're going to get those heating
issues or you can't overclock or
something and yeah yeah yeahs yata
probably as mini ITX gives you that
freedom and you built it yourself right
you just kind of feel like you know you
your prides not going to take a dent
right you walk around with the laughs
yeah people who know that you kind of
yeah you're paying a premium for a
laptop so I don't know yeah that's it
and I do understand it so this is going
to be I really cool for them those fans
are actually a hundred millimeter which
is actually a pretty decent size you see
how big their regards to the heat sink
underneath so that's that's plenty big
for a little you know compact cut so I
think actually cooling wise this thing
would probably be all right judges know
what it is and I think with zotac as
well they've really stepped up their
game I mean in 2012 right I don't think
anyone even knew zotac were but now
there are actually a really big name in
the game which is really cool to see I
like it I like seeing a manufacturer
just come in and say hey I'm getting in
this deal I want part of the road yeah I
want part of the raw steak and then
we're gonna cook it medium-rare that's
what that's what they're doing well in
such a cool so used to do very good
specials when I bought my 780ti back in
the day that was the zotac and just the
reference model and that was only
because I was looking at the time to buy
a gtx 780 and then zotac had this
special on for the 780 ti to be the same
price as a 780 so I thought we would
just buy that instead of the ego and off
we went yes sir that was quite good as
well so I have owned as otech card
before and that thing was fantastic
you're talking about steak I guess I
want a steak you need to go to a steak
house today yeah might have to organize
cording to the GPU boost speeds we've
got seventeen hundred and fifty-three
megahertz on the boost up from 733 so it
is it actually performs better than the
reference card out of the box slightly
with GPU boost three-point Oh it'll go
up a bit more of us if it starts running
in it temperature issues that will
obviously be brought down yeah error I
think that it would go just find the
effortless those people so solid mini
man that's a solid mini might be a well
hopefully expect it to be a lower price
than a reference or a founders edition
but you know sometimes they make things
more expensive you know this more yeah
okay so next we're going to talk about
vaguer again and apparently we have a
release date which is looking like May
so dirty for me this is what they
recognize third eve of me which looks
about right i mean looking at these
release dates they kind of start to make
sense i mean AMD at CES they didn't have
really a production line ready you could
see that right they had their sort of
product that's still in the works they
were using tyne XPS so looks like me
what do you think about me yeah i think
that makes sense computex that would be
a pretty good place for it to go ahead i
think yeah this is this was what we were
kind of expecting around at that time as
far as someone else earlier did i watch
the girl gamer video about doing the
mathematics for a yes I did what do they
think of it well I think he raised some
good points although it doesn't
technically work the way he described
basically what the video was is saying
that Vega 10 will have 4096 stream
processors that is the same as what the
fury X head with the fiji xt GPU in it
yeah here is basically he's making the
case in the video that if polaris had
4096 stream processors pretty much if I
put into Eric's yeah if you put to our
to our exes to that combines the GPUs
and it would be the same power as a 1080
so if there's any I
see gains at all with vega over polaris
you would expect it to be more powerful
than the 1080 that is true to a certain
degree but again when i did my rx 480
crossfire against a single 1080 it only
one in one of the benchmarks Iran I'm
all the rest of them had actually lost
in so i think when AMD showed off that
our expertise and cross way would be to
1080 they only showed it in one
benchmark occur in which one it was and
yeah in the real world i found that
actually the 1080 in a winning now there
was a while ago so maybe would driver
changes now it might usually be um you
know a bit better so yeah yes it'll be
interesting to see a noble thing is
meant like are you going to want to run
to graphics cards over one I mean me
personally I'd always pick the one
graphics card right oh you will yeah
yeah he said we got the driver issue
we're not going to go into that but I
mean look I'm hoping this will be one
big card one big card it hits hard and
it competes with the GTX 1080 now we've
talked about this last week where we had
the they're bringing in those
technologies that sort of you know
cancel out the pixels that you don't see
doesn't render them picked a sort of
geometry that you can't see on the final
image it'll sort of cancel that out
that's improving the efficiency of the
GPU then we've got the higher clock
speeds so hopefully this is touted to be
one really heavy hitting card that's
what I'm hoping yeah absolutely yeah
this will definitely be powerful I think
the I think it's pretty fair to say my
prediction right now which is the video
i put up just yesterday yet my
prediction was that it's gonna beat the
gtx 1080 by about ten fifteen percent
performance wise um and i think that
would be quite fair maybe a little bit
more than a pro pro be at launch maybe
if this driver changes and stuff like
that there'll be improvements there but
people saying that it's going to beat
the tide and XP which is what the 10 ATT
i will be will the net so not very then
okay then
anybody themselves are comparing it
against the tightening hmm yeah and
another thing that's very overlooked by
everyone is that amd's through some of
the features that says this is aimed at
the professional space as well the same
way the projo was to a certain degree
for VR developers so I think this is a
gaming GPU but it's also going to be
aims Pat's the more professional site as
well not just entirely there so which is
kind of what reisen is trying to do as
well but as we said earlier I mean like
is it really going to hold much over x
99 for those people who take
productivity stuff really seriously yeah
maybe for the people that aren't super
serious about and just want just do a
bit of photo editing and stuff on the
side maybe it'll be great for those
people but yeah it's it's it's there's a
lot up in the air right now but um it
was an interesting video to see but
there's definitely there's no question
that Vega 10 will be extremely powerful
4096 stream processors that's not like
being around each beam to you know this
is going to be seriously powerful well
that's the thing the opencl performance
is going to be huge on this thing like
wow because obviously a lot of people
wondering i'm looking at the dates as
well like they put a good point here
it's almost a year after the 1080 is
launched I mean there's a lot a lot of
time everything that's probably why
invidi has been still doing what they're
doing with the GeForce experience three
they're looking at making money in any
other way but the GPU itself so yeah
yeah I'm Kyle's I was hoping for a
January release like I was really I
heard rumors that it was gonna release
this month I was really hoping that
would have been the case I think you
know starting off the new year with a
graphics card that just competes with
the 1080 and then it's something new
it's got the reliv update but holding it
off until May that's you know it's it's
a long time like it's another four
months away still you know people want
their graphics cards and they want them
now especially with verizon launching
people are going to be looking to build
new computers they're going to be
looking to build your computers and if
that hits in March then I I guarantee
you people aren't going to hold out two
months to buy a graphics card so what's
going to happen then he named dr
inadvertently going to be sending people
towards gtx 10-7
and even 10 80s and if the 1080 TI hits
at March hell you could have them
selling 1080 TI's to that's from their
computer your competitor shouldn't be
doing that for a competitor's product
that's all I'm just saying so i'd love
to see vega and it has to come out as
soon as possible but i think that i
don't set me anytime soon exactly i
don't see it anytime soon unfortunately
for you guys in the audience i see it
coming and this release date does look
pretty accurate and even then it could
be delayed even more so it could be
delay could be june thirtieth you know
if it said the first half of 2017 so
yeah a little bit worried i mean there's
my busy of course we've raised all the
good points but there's the doubt right
there's there's a time oh yeah I'm got a
lot of doubts to do with a go so the
same way it was quite skeptical going
into the RX 484 good reason it was way
too overhyped and yeah I mean people
thought i was going to be 10 70s and
stuff like that and it just didn't come
close well the RX fer is 470 i like the
iris 470 it's 150 bucks and it performs
great value for money yo you for money
waste and how did you get a really good
still doing the builds but yeah should
be this week should have some really
good content coming finally better yeah
we're gonna hear the razor prototype it
got stolen / leaders they had these
triple screen laptops and they were
stolen and then one of them's popped up
on taobao which is a chinese auction
site kind of like ebay it's the chinese
ebay yeah as its rocked up for like what
20 1700 USD and like someone's almost so
much money well yeah i saw a picture of
linus uh taken off with 12 bethie I hope
have been a joke but i made like this is
pretty damn serious love soup people
actually racked this and then yet and
now they're selling it that's crazy hey
no dummy did are they watch though they
have a guy i mean i guarantee you the
guy on the floor he would have been
fired one of them someone someone would
have been fired for this and they
someone was super sneaky with it but I
think meant you have a gun you should
have a guy or always on the stock
you know the shopfront sort of late
looking over things hey I don't know I
do you reckon the guys who stole that
they had the distraction check yeah they
would have been doing that they might
have been professional people I medias
actually when it first happened I
thought this would have been like an
espionage type thing I thought that
maybe another company had someone take
it and then you know take it to their
factory or wherever and then they were
going to copy it or you know reverse
engineer it or something if they were
gonna go crazy like that but this might
just be as simple as someone just taking
it I mean all the conspiracy theories
about Linus taking it are quite happy
but a man loves would rely to you get jy
what the Linus why would Linus who's
just sad yeah yeah yeah but there's some
people actually seemed like it was
serious but I mean I don't think Linus
would bother mean Linus isn't hurting
for money so this you know why would he
why would he risk so much as all his
reputation of stuff just stealing a
triple screen prototype but only I want
to talk about the distraction chick
these guys would have had a game plan
set up they would have sent the
destroyer and the guy at the shop front
he's like yeah that's right I'll work
for reason yeah go check out this laptop
oh yeah where is the laptop and the
chick just bails but yeah these guys
would I did a plan hitman this would
have been friggin I gotta be as sad as
it set as sad as it sounds this would
have been epic to see go down like if
you're watching from the you know eating
the popcorn like it would have been
sweet to see how they did it but yeah
what I mean yeah they would have been
camera so they should sort of figured
out what what the reason was but know
this it's a bizarre thing but yeah so
whatever that if people are actually
that's so keen on a three-screen I mean
you can get you can get a modification
right now for laptops if you want
something like this I can't remember the
name of it as an accessory that I'm you
basically stick to the back of your
laptop screen and then you can just pull
two more screens out the side it
obviously won't be a curve that I think
but it's something you can't do so if
you already want something like this
you can get it i forgot the name of the
accessory okay this is something gonna
redo okay so get those q and A's ready
we've got arm we've got here the switch
will greatly talking about the switch
it's coming out very soon I think when's
the release data March third so much
though yes something soon yeah yeah and
yeah what's the things that you like
about the switch um well I sort of only
half-heartedly kept up with it but I
think it's quite cool in that size wise
um I think it takes what a lot of people
liked about the wii u and which there
weren't really that many things since it
didn't sell very much but the the fact
that you can sort of play it on the
screen when you dock it but also then
take it with you and play it sort of
like a a gameboy type thing as am is
also quite cool see i think it's going
to I mean the reception so far has been
lukewarm maybe it was outside self in
mixed add next yeah I mean that Brad
resolutions not really good but I don't
know that ad was out of it man like hey
let's get dressed to play the Nintendo
switch slay huh where's the gun is
underwear who's just going to like chill
on the couch you know we've got here the
biggest thing that I like from the
switch is that arm the biggest thing I
like about this is the legend of zelda
yeah the games are finally but that's
not finally then finally they've learned
something from yeah from their audience
to people they're selling the freaking
consoles to finally they've listened and
they're learning something and they're
saying hey people want a zelda title so
they're going to be launching breath of
the wild and that launches with the
nintendo switch which is looking pretty
good but it's set to run at 900p dot and
720p portable i mean damn that 900p like
a come up like 1080p at least we've got
to do 1080p at least you would thinking
this with the fact that their rivals was
Sony and Microsoft releasing 4k capable
consoles that sort of an Nintendo's not
even got into 1080p it but I mean nvidia
saying that
uh it's going to perform very well
because obviously there that's running a
nvidia shipping at this time so yeah oh
I don't know we'll have to see i mean
nandina has never been about the
graphics or any of that it's always has
been yourself the way you play and
therefore definitely was about the
graphics the fact that uses cartridges
again seems like a bizarre sort of i
step yeah give a problem good to me man
cartridges zelda this is reminiscent of
the 64 so but the problem is the
graphics aren't there this time you know
like 64 did have kind of cutting-edge
graphics on it i will admit one of the
time yeah it was alright yeah that 90
900p in 2017 like you know like dude
1080p monitors like a hundred bucks you
know like a lot of people to buy in
1080p monitors you'd want something that
at least runs natively on a freakin
1080p monitor so kind of got to pull off
some serious points therefore 900p but
yeah but at least they're getting
something right Zelda's launching with
the switch i want to clap my hands but
we'll go to Q&amp;amp;A so that's about if
unless there's anything you wanted to
really talk about with no the one thing
i was saying is the fact that nintendo
is trying to Nintendo's of late has been
struggling with the image that it's the
kids console and they're saying this one
is they're trying to aim at more adults
than kids the armed with some of the
games and that but i think obviously
that part of the market will still
they'll still have huge amounts of game
cells and regards to you know parents
buying it for the kids we don't know so
let's go so we got Q&amp;amp;A let's roll in
those questions rolling those questions
we're going to be answering for whatever
yeah so let's do it for so a question
for me either of you going to check out
the asrock desk mini irish gtx thing
looks amazing well okay use MXM GPUs and
has three and built to drive slots in a
Wi-Fi slot hmm i'll have to check it out
man i actually haven't looked into it
yet I mean I've got the desk mini I've
got the one
and that was really good i love that
that was a little cool little pc i have
to check out their new RX that's thanks
for the suggestion haven't seen it but i
will check it out definitely thanks
Larry so we got no price on the cpu of
the GPUs from AMD no official pricing
yet I don't think on Vega or rising CPUs
so yeah I think that's up in the air I
mean we're looking around for vegas six
hundred dollars for the GPU i think
that's a pretty decent estimate and then
for the cpus what do you think for the
cpu is kev or GP is 24 Vega and rising
um duh I'm not too sure at this stage
hmm does anyone's guess that's pretty
much anyone's guess so on yeah so Isis
breathing so someone was asking about
that question they had earlier which was
have you lived with a bad pc for a week
right o bad pc for a whit yes um yes
technically yes um was it it was as well
as well when it initially launched so i
got my 46 74th for 670 que ya got that
right i got it in and it was actually
wasn't it wasn't so much the hard way
wasn't working the bias was bad so they
were just releasing these infancy biases
and they had problems with the
compatibility with the memory so for
like a week I was just like scratching
my head you know constantly crashing I
was like what the hell is going on
updated the bios and then all my
problems went away but yeah pc problems
are frustrating man trust me they're
frustrating especially if it's your main
rig so that's kind of like why i like to
have my main editing right now and then
like you have you you know if you can
afford it get yourself a benchmarking
rig or whatever just hardware that's
proven and you know works and then you
can tweet you and then you can sort of
play around with your other hardware so
and you know in whatever way you want to
play with it so
yeah yeah so we got asked if we will
ever meet up in real life I think we
will yeah definitely may eventually yeah
it's only if we both at computex us yet
then definitely I definitely yeah can't
wait to meet up with kev too yeah we'll
probably do a tech lounge when that when
we're there if we end up being there
together you know considering it runs
for about what four days I think yep
we'll probably end up doing something
like that another question which I
thought was quite good for Brian just to
keep it keep it going yeah pentium g g
4650 best budget cpu ? a G 45-60 so best
trip for a budget build a 360 190 more
4g 45 60 s going to be okay yes so
that'll definitely be which c270 mobo
from asia is great for gaming for 150
bucks I mean n easy to 70 s going to be
great for gaming I think the gaming the
the name the title is way over done now
I mean not a motherboard essentially
gaming should really just be you get a
decent vrm solid Intel ni see on there
and also a decent onboard audio if
you're using the onboard audio I mean I
would personally just probably invest
into you know maybe a fee or something
for your DAC camp and that way you can
carry it on to all your future builds
and then get those entry-level z2 70s
with the Intel an X on them that'll be
doing you pretty well you'll be in the
mirror you know saving money we have an
awesome audio from any build that you
poured on to in the future you won't
have to rely on the upgraded audio damn
many keyboards loud oh sorry I just got
this is the new ducky that's why they're
there it is laughs you're in the monkey
oh listen time delay don't just lose
another thing it's over it's over
bearing isn't it so um so also what's
happening with security problem with six
gen intel cpus not too sure I have to
check that out and research it Kev's
just showing I i saw i checked that out
earlier yeah i need to read about it a
bit more i thought it was a bit um it is
something interesting but i would
rather wait for more information to come
out regarding it because it seems just a
bit crazy right now but yeah I it is
something yet that will be quite
interesting going forward if there is a
big problem with kb like in terms of
security yeah so will we be doing any
videos on rising hopefully i mean a
devil is i mean like like launch launch
date oh I'll launch day otherwise
post-launch maybe one week or something
so yeah do I work out yeah I did like I
lately up in six so I haven't been
working out much but I'm going going to
try and go to the gym today I shall will
go to the gym that I try and do a proper
full workout my only get like you know
sixty percent Donald whatever the yeah
yeah just been so sick man like barely
my dad like he got the results in like
like the worst strain of influenza going
around straya so Thank You Sydney for
giving me that crap Thank You Sydney I
gotta pick up the tone a little bit
though I just know probably dead so I
said sure it is a question someone said
i 777 hundred K and a Zeus as e270 prime
a good combo yeah that that would work
there yeah that letter that would be
just fine um if you're just looking for
something solid um I can't see why not I
don't particularly like the looks of the
primate but well you always were q and
A's are coming in so fast now sorry with
that recommendation of the Z 270 boards
as well I mean if the extreme for is
around about 150 bucks I'd recommend
that yeah oh yeah the killer SLI I mean
this is a heap of good boards out there
for the money yeah it should be able to
good good overclocking with the primate
penny mg 4650 I mean there is that
another iteration of the g40 45-60 I
mean you getting all these numbers in my
head so if it's a little bit if it's
clocked a little bit higher and it's
cheap sure go for it interesting what
laptop specs do you guys run with
currently laptops actually don't have a
laptop at the moment like my brother's
got one I've got this actually I bought
one in the junk session in Japan
got it right here dropping a nest in its
a AMD apu so i'll be doing a video on
that hopefully can run league of legends
and then i can make like a oh my god
$100 league of legends laptop oh my god
video would you guys want to see that so
i only some is a you go to the states
anytime soon me I've got no plans as of
reason I'd lied I love going to Vegas if
we go to States or love going to LA and
Vegas and then yeah that's a I've Nessus
been oh really damn me know someday I
definitely want to go it's just one of
those things to him guys we have to go
make a GoFundMe get kev to the United
States GoFundMe I mean that is I looked
at GoFundMe nowadays all's it is just
like people like health problems say man
my legs broke GoFundMe fix up my leg
something I mean okay what happened to
the actual projects though like I don't
see any projects on there anymore like
hey help me fund this you know Oh LED
light bulb development or something yeah
I don't want to do it anymore it's all
health things I mean that's I mean feel
sorry for people who need help but
mainly under the original goof on me
like yeah yeah it seems like it's got a
bit off track to be honest but yeah
there's another question this one is
actually really good any reason to
upgrade to an I 373 50k from an i5 2500
k co for the people that are still on
sandy bridge yeah um ah it depends how
good of an overclocker is your eye yeah
you're 2500 k um if it's not then
potentially they could be a good reason
to yeah the kb lake isn't a good ha
that's sort of too harsh the one good
thing that people like him at kb like is
the overclock ability yeah um so that's
would be one good reason but i mean if
you're getting like four point eight out
of your 2500 k which quite a few be
worried a yappy something within
well known that I wouldn't say there's
any point to be perfectly honest you
would still weighed out one more
generation we're still hope I'm rich
yeah we're still holding out for that
generation that gives us a noticeable
bump I think that's all yeah people are
holding out for so then yeah I can't
wait for the day that we get that so
we've got asked also pink or brown what
are you with give didn't are you are you
aware of what this is referring to now
I'm just Jonah are you detecting no cuz
there's that pink season that album that
came out to from arm from filthy
I've never heard a better album in my
life man oh my god a little things I
thought we would talk about it do you
think there will be any eatx Zen boards
I'm not too sure ah hopefully there will
be I'll of any sort of different sort of
motherboard that's you know in the
picture so hopefully there will be I'm
not to as for me happy knowledge of it
no how about you keV now I don't know
knowledge of that yep um I think yeah Oh
time will tell maybe David Williams
thanked me and said not a question be
just a shout out mega Phoenix thanks for
watching men appreciate it love it love
this is a this channels for you guys is
with QA shoot thanks man so Leo's got a
question he's currently running his
computer off CPUs integrated graphics
and he's looking to buy a new GPU should
i buy 1070 or wait for Vega I mean
that's four months so that's all made
four months the question is can you play
games is that for months this is the
biggest question you gotta ask yourself
is that few months worth the wait for me
I couldn't hold out for four months on
integrated graphics no I would I would
buy I'll go look on wherever you believe
there'll be a second you know place
where you can buy second-hand graphics
cards go on there and buy yourself just
a something to get you by for the
meantime um and just use that to get you
by may be fine find yourself a gtx 980
or something like that something maybe a
generation old and
um and just to get you by until Vega
comes out and then when beggars out then
you know but I wouldn't wait if I was on
integrated graphics oh boy I could I
would just go out and and yeah yes
Eileen get something cheap to get me by
I used to do that when i first started
my youtube channel because i was running
sort of low on money i couldn't afford
to be buying all these gross Scouts do
showdowns for before I have play tic
back in me I just went out and got
myself a really cheap reference our 9290
is my just personal card to run in my
rig when I had nothing else and it was
really cheap because the guy was using
it for Bitcoin mining so I had been
thrashed you know like months and I and
I just picked that one up for cheap ran
that it was perfectly fine nothing wrong
with it yeah um yeah ran perfectly and
that was just a good thing to get me by
in the meantime I didn't particularly
worried me if it blew up or anything I
had massive problems because I knew I
was only going to be running it till
I've gotten something else yeah I mean
and that was fine so yeah just do
something like that you'll be able to
find I mean things are known to 90s um
you could pick one up very cheaply now
so you could always just do that it's
still pretty good performing grabs guard
it gets about the same performances of
1060 so yes yeah actually NASA now sexy
I raised a pretty good question why are
we going crazy over these new jewel
cause when you can get secondhand for
calls you know with a threads for way
less and way better performance very
good comment I mean very valid yes and
yeah extremely valid I mean me
personally I'll always love the use
parts it offers way better price
performance even to the new you know 60
some dollar G 45-60 even a 30-dollar x
34 50s going to trumpet in performance
but the thing is obviously the used
market snot forever i mean i love the
used market and a lot of you guys love
these market but it's not for everyone
they right now not even for the majority
of people people just wanted that you
cpu new motherboard warranty it works ok
awesome we're good to go no problems I
mean us us enthusiasts with the use pcs
right wheel of tweaking we love getting
things to work we know how to diagnose
any mishaps any problems and so yeah
definitely they use my I love as much as
I love these market it's not
everyone's know it is a lot of people
forget that the vast from it will maybe
not the bus but there is a certain ly a
big amount of people who and we'll just
go into their local pc gaming store like
play take care and they'll just walk in
and just say hey I'm what I want to
build my first gaming pc I'm going to
follow the guide on youtube or something
recommend me the the what cpu GPU all
that and they will not even be aware
that there's any use market or anything
like that they'll just go in and buy
what it gets recommended to them so with
the hype is because it's going to give
this people so many options that those
people who yeah don't know much about or
only do a bit of research beforehand
will realize well I've got you know that
their skin the market would be extremely
saturated by comparison to last it's
going to be a great thing to so we got
us one hundred and eighty dollar so you
already answered that very I'm just
going through the questions now making
sure we didn't miss anyone so paladin's
yeah it's gone really well youtube says
I got him into the game thanks you too
that's his name YouTube thanks youtube I
didn't I gotcha playing paladin's man so
yeah I'd yeah 2500 k over the I 373 50k
so because I mean the motherboards
hopefully going to be a lot cheaper to
if you can get a Z 67 yeah Eugene he's
said some dirty and Japanese I'm not
gonna repeat that so yeah guys I will
start wrapping up the question so I'm
just drunk yeah I've gone through so um
it's about it really can you see
anything else sir no I mean the only
other one I saw really was people asking
if you're going back to Japan anytime
soon I'll me Japan know like not planned
anyway so you know knowing my ex you
might make up something and be like oh
you know Chi really I'm not gonna go
into it but yeah she really gave me a
real fright you know she knows how to do
it you know like look if there's anyone
who knows how to get a rise out of me
it's my ex
she's the master of it that's always the
case man there was no much but funny but
it's it's just like you know basically
when I said not you know I'm ironclad
I'm not gonna let her get to me she
knows how to do it she goes and does it
like she just figures out how could she
can get a rise out of me and she does so
she can she'll probably get a rise out
of me to the point why have to fly over
there and you know it'll be about my
little boy of course so yeah I don't I
don't get it man like where are these
women like Jonah before we close the
