on the Facebook marketplace well at
least shadow banned and that is once
that happens your listings then get D
ranked so hard that basically no people
can see them anymore so what did I do in
order for this to happen and also what
can you do if this happens to you let's
discuss
Facebook and also it's attached Facebook
marketplace I don't use the former a
whole lot but the latter I use quite a
bit especially when it comes to selling
gaming PCs now depending on where you
are in the world
Gumtree Craigslist or offer up or other
apps might be more popular but in
Australia Facebook marketplace is a big
way to sell gaming PC's so if you flat
out get banned or in my case shadow bend
it can affect of course sales
dramatically and in this case I have
spoken with a few friends who have been
shadow bend in the past and what you can
do about it but let's go on with my
first case of how I got shadow ban
personally so you guys cannot make the
same mistakes as I did basically I
wanted to have a bit of fun with a PC
listing and I use some different words
than in hindsight I realized I shouldn't
have used because that obviously
triggered something in the Facebook
algorithm that automatically thought
that I was selling something that I
actually wasn't so what did I actually
do in this listing well I had a rise in
526 hundred and a RT X 2060 PC for sale
and in this listing I decided to spice
things up or call it an MLG PC or major
league gaming now it took that major
league and I'm guessing it took the
league part and in the item itself I
actually put in the description it was a
big ticket item and I realized after I
got banned I'm like oh no the algorithm
put those two words together ticket and
also league and thought that I was
selling tickets to a sporting event so
it then went and shadow banned me and
it's been a week and a half later and I
haven't been unbent I've put in multiple
reports to Facebook to say hey I was
actually just selling a PC using some
fun terminology to sort of spice up my
listing and they haven't replied to me
at all there's no number I can contact
in Australia to try and resolve this
they've pretty much just said nope
you've done the wrong thing and here's
how we're going to reward you so how you
can identify if you've been shadow
banned is the first thing is you're used
to getting a certain number of messages
and enquiries but all the sudden you get
no views no increase not even from low
balls which
surprising so that's how you're gonna
know your ads are sort of being filtered
out and put right down the bottom after
listing the second thing is in my case
is I lost the renew ad feature just
completely went away and I couldn't get
that back that's how I knew something
was seriously wrong straight away now I
have had friends who have told me that
they have been shadowed banned in the
past but it's only been a temporary
thing for using things like too many
caps in a listing in the woods and so
they said that went away after three
days but in my case it's been more than
three days so I think something is
severely wrong now of course if you've
incurred this problem or you want to
know what to do if you incur this
problem then I unfortunately think the
only way to get around this is to either
get a facebook rep to respond and
realize that this mismatch in the
algorithm or make a whole new Facebook
account in itself and the problem with
making a new Facebook account is
apparently you have to be using Facebook
actively on that account for three
months before you can unlock the
marketplace feature because if you make
a new account Facebook marketplaces
automatically not available so that
really puts you in a tough spot
if you then have to get your Facebook
account which you've got all your photos
or your memories or your friends and
then go make a new account because of
this and unfortunately I think in my
case that's exactly what I'm going to
have to do if I want to keep selling PCs
on this marketplace so basically there
is my example with Facebook marketplace
I'll try and resolve this if you guys
have any tips and tricks of your own be
sure to drop them in the comments as
well but with Computex coming up very
soon I don't have time to resolve this I
actually don't even have time to make a
new Facebook I'm not even gonna bother
until two weeks later and then I'm gonna
to make a whole new account and start
trying to sell PCs on that account but
now we're moving on to the latter half
of this video and we're gonna talk about
what you can do to avoid getting shadow
banned like I did or getting flat
outright banned and the thing is you can
use words and terminologies that will
circumvent this algorithm because
basically it's just identifying simple
keywords and when one or two of them are
matched it will then just simply wipe
your ad off the listing and that will
affect your other listings so in this
case I'd advise you guys not to use too
many caps in your listing it's okay to
use them sparingly here
there another thing as well as I'd
advise not to use any business terms
like don't say we are a business or
anything like that because they do have
those options for business sellers who
have to pay for ads another thing is
don't list too much in a short time
period I heard from people who use this
a lot that you should ideally be listing
maximum one ad every three days your
mileage may vary with this but depending
on how busy Facebook marketplace is in
your country they might have different
rules no one exactly knows except the
person or group of people who have
programmed these algorithms another
thing to look out for with Facebook
marketplace listings is emojis if a
detects you've used too many of these it
will then again just pretty much nerf
your listing right to the bottom another
thing to be careful of too is using
links that link to external websites
this one can be a big no-no for detects
especially too many of these in an ad
than again you're going right down the
bottom and the last two things to talk
about which go hand-in-hand is
visibility and also feedback but I
believe the feedback itself if you have
it private or open it doesn't so much
affect your visibility as opposed to
having a lot of bad feedback if you
incur a lot of bad feedback within a
short period of time your ads I believe
will then get nerfed down to the bottom
but if you have a lot of good feedback
in a short period of time that will then
boost your ratings ad visibility itself
the more people that click on that ad
over other ads that will boost that one
to the top so the algorithm is similar
to YouTube videos with thumbnails in
that regard the more people are clicking
on that particular ad the more Facebook
marketplace is going to promote that out
because it thinks it's hotter than the
other ads but in terms of feedback
itself actually having your feedback
private or public I believe doesn't
affect the listing directly but of
course it is always a good thing to have
your feedback open because it may be a
determining factor if someone comes with
your ad and says hey this guy's got
private feedback what's going on or at
least if he's got a public feedback and
the ratings are high that may help that
individual sale anyways in terms of me
in my situation the moment I am
currently shadow bent on Facebook but
that's okay because I've still got good
old gam tree to rely on and fall back to
which doesn't seem like it has as strict
as listing procedures as Facebook
marketplace does and also on the
relation to gum tree at least in
I believe you can contact someone to get
direct responses and help if something
was to happen like it did on Facebook
marketplace but regardless I enjoy being
a guinea pig for you guys and talking
about this thing as well as getting your
feedback in the comments section and
adding to the description if there's any
other tips and tricks you've got in
relation to not getting shadow bend but
also keeping your ads to the top of the
marketplace and with that aside hope you
