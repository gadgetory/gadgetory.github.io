at Lex's lineup of new from USB flash
sticks and memory cards for their
professional line of series and the only
reason i'm doing this video is because
I've actually been using lexile memory
cards in my cameras for quite some years
now and they do represent good value for
money and thus I do believe in the brand
ladies gentlemen welcome back to tech
yes City this is brian coming to you
guys today with a quick video on
interestingly enough memory cards and
flash sticks now it is a little bit
different compared to my usual type of
content however I do believe in lake
sales products and when they reached out
and asked me to take a look at their
cool little devices I decided why not
and give you guys a quick look at what
they've got on offer here so for this
device they've got here usb3 flash dick
which comes out one side and has a type
c connected there and then if you use it
to the other side it has a type hey
there this is both USB 3 compatible so
the speeds on this i reported a right
speed of around about sixty five
megabytes per second so that's copying
to the drive and then copying from the
drive which is the read speeds we
managed to clock in at about 140 4
megabytes per second so pretty good
speeds on this device and you also got
about 64 gigabytes of storage there so
the next flash drive they have on offer
here is a similar thing except it's
white and on one end instead of the
type-c connector we get an apple iphone
connector there then if you move back
here you again get that USB three type
connector so this one however is a
little bit more plasticky and does feel
a little bit cheaper than the grey one
and ironically enough it did report
lower read and write speeds for the read
speeds we managed to clock in at around
eighty five megabits per second so
that's copying from the drive and then
copy to the drive which is the right
speeds we looked at we're looking at
around 25 or 26 megabytes per second so
it was pretty low there in the actual
transfer speeds and the actual write
speeds that would be similar but
wouldn't even need USB 3 on that so next
up here is the compact flash memory card
which I managed to take down the store
and do a heap of tests on high-end
cameras and this thing did not
disappoint at all it was a very
consistent memory card and also the
build quality feels pretty good so the
advertised speeds are three and a half
thousand speed and it's got 525
megabytes per second sequential read
speeds so it's a pretty quick card and
you will get a lot of life out of this
if going by my own experience with lexa
camera memory cards is anything to go by
lastly here is their professional XQD
memory card which is supports four
hundred and forty megabytes per second
so a little bit slower than the compact
flash and i did
make this down and it did test it as
well and it is very consistent just like
the other memory card so that's about it
for the overview today if you guys
enjoyed this video then please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions or
comments about Lex's professional lineup
of memory cards and please drop a
comment in the comment section below as
for these two USB sticks I definitely
like the grey version here it does have
a little bit better build quality than
the white version and it is a little bit
smaller and it has faster speeds though
for those people who use Apple products
then I'm sure you will be handy or you
will find something like this very handy
for that proprietary nonsense so you
don't have to have that proprietary
cable if you want to get files off your
iphone so I could see this being very
useful for apple iphone users anyway
guys that's it for me peace out for now
