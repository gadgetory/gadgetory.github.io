to 2017 you guys wanted to see the top
five
GPUs well here it is today welcome back
guys and ever since the release of the
RX 470 and the GTX 1060 graphics card
prices have or should have gone down by
a lot since these graphics cards really
brought a lot of price performance to
the market and they were new and they
came with warranty however with that
aside there is an updated list and how
much you guys should expect a piece of
these graphics cards and what they will
perform like on 1080p or other
resolutions now before I get onto this
list there are a lot of good graphics
cards out there and the thing that makes
a deal good is simply the price if you
guys could pick up the right graphics
card at the right price then it's going
to be a really good deal also there were
a lot of graphics cards that were close
to making it onto the list but didn't
quite get there since they'll very
popular in the use scene and with that
popularity comes an increased price
these graphics cards are the 5852 6850
and also the 7950 and gtx 780 though
that said let's get on with the list by
now coming in at number five is the GTX
770 a great card that comes in two
different variants of two gigabytes and
four gigabyte flavors I would go with
the foggy but if you can pick up one at
the right price now the maximum I would
pay for one of these cards would be
around 80 USD personally I recently
picked up one for about 75 USD with a
custom cooler on it and four gigabytes
of vram on there and it's a great card
for playing 1080p titles and around high
settings it's also very similar in
performance to the GTX 1050 TI o Kamiya
number four is the HD 7850 this is a
great card for 1080p medium settings
nowadays though we'll play some of those
older titles like csgo dota 2 and League
of Legends with really good frame rates
at 1080p also with this card it is
pretty low in power consumption so it
will do a great job of being match with
pretty inexpensive hardware coming at
number three is a very unexpected entry
this is the GTX 460 now these were very
poor
Fila back in the day and since they were
very popular and since they're not
popular now and they're probably one of
the most least searched cards they come
in very cheap expect to pay up to around
$20 for one of these cards but they will
play games really well even titles like
overwatch at 1080p high settings can be
played on this card but you can of
course lower the settings and get really
good frame rates if you are on a budget
coming in a number two and honestly this
was a toss-up between this number two
and number one this is the GTX 970 now
this was an extremely popular card when
it was released a few years ago and with
that it gives you extremely good
performance at 1080p can even play games
on high in 1440p expect to pay around up
to a hundred and 20 USD for one of these
cards since the GTX 1060 has been
released for around about $200 they
perform pretty similar in performance
the GTX 970 is definitely a good card if
you can pick it up on a budget what and
coming in at number one is the r9 290 or
the 290x expect to pay up to 120 USD for
these and they are really good cards
they perform extremely well and they
have four gigabytes of vram on board so
they will be able to just like the GTX
970 play games at 1080p Ultra or even
play games at 1440p high and they will
do a really good job of that though
there is one caveat to this card and
that is that it does run extremely hot
it is a really hot card and it is hard
to keep under control I even put an
arctic explorer on one of these things
and it was starting to overwhelm that
cooler albeit I did overclock it however
it is a great graphics card that
performs really well and you can expect
some really good performance out of this
thing so there are those guys there is
my top 5 used GPU picks for 2017 and I
was honestly waiting a little while to
do this guide because of the release of
the rx 5 series and it also looks like
in videos going with a refresh on their
cards as well so expect these prices to
remain pretty solid and also these
recommendations to remain pretty valid
for a good at least six months in my
opinion so with that said if you want to
find out how some of these graphics
can't perform there are a lot of
different YouTube videos out there where
people test these different cards on
different games
different settings all you have to do is
search for the gravis card if you find
it at a good price quickly search its
performance of the game you wish to play
and then you'll see how it performs and
whether it's a good deal for you
also keep in mind that are more risk to
buying used PCs parts as opposed to
buying new PC but I'll put a link up
here if you guys want to check out some
tips and tricks that I've got for buying
used PC pot and without that I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
