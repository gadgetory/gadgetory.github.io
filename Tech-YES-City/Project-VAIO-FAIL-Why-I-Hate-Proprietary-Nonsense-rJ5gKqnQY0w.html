sony vaio 1080p displays the 24 inch
model four hundred and forty dollars I
thought I'd struck gold but then I
pulled off the back plate and saw really
proprietary booth going on there and I
knew I was in for project fail today I'm
going to document what just happened in
this build
welcome back to tech estd this is brian
coming to you guys today with a video on
what happened in the last week with this
big project fail and now I found this
monitor this all-in-one it's actually in
the background running right now found
it at the junk-- store for a bargain
price was like damn 140 bucks I could
rip out a lot of the internals and put
in my own in Turtles and make one
awesome custom project however upon
getting at home pulling off the back
plate I just started to see one cable
after another that was all proprietary
and I was shocked I mean even the left
and the right speaker cable Jack's were
different from one another and the
biggest thing that got me all the two
biggest things that got to me was the
fact that they had the monitor cable
there which I could not use on a
standard form factor Broadwell
motherboard or the power supply as well
and I was just scratching my head going
this would be an absolute nightmare if I
was to do all this and the biggest thing
that stopped me from doing it in the end
was the fact that that power supply
didn't have those different connections
on there if it's one thing you don't go
get on it's the power supplies like
seriously don't go get on them unless
you know what you're doing and if you
guys know me you'll know that I'm all
for get on the moment I'm actually doing
a project where I'm cutting off parts of
the motherboard socket to fit in a
different LGA 771 chip however it wasn't
all bad news i did manage to get another
hard drive and some more memory and
patch this little bad boy up and put it
back on the market so it's just a big
lesson that I learned from this and if
you guys are doing custom projects as
well the biggest message to come out of
this is don't go with old-school OEMs
they all use proprietary stuff I know so
nivo is not just guilty of this I know
Dell do at HP do it a list of other
people do it and in the end it's just
one big headache if you are wishing to
do custom projects for yourself another
example of this is I just got the server
board in it was a dell jewel socket
server bored so i'm actually got a
little project coming up in the future
however again it uses a power supply
with 280 x 24 pin connectors they're so
big headache and that's coming for you
guys i'll be documenting a video on that
but one thing you will have to be
careful of if you wish to do project is
just to go with standard form factor
stuff i think in the future i will be
getting ages the lightweight 1080p
monitor of 24 inch and
then just manually sticking the parts on
the back and making a custom bracket for
the back of the monitor and have it that
way where I can have an all-in-one
lightweight carry solution because I did
want to put a Haswell motherboard and a
Broadway liars pro GPU in there and have
just one awesome mobile gaming solution
that was pretty light weight to carry
however it still would have done a very
good job and the whole reason for these
companies doing this is essentially so
that if something breaks down they can
charge you for their piece only like oh
we make the power supply that has these
connections so you have to buy the power
supply from us which has the markup on
it it costs you guys more money and it
caused me like someone like me a
frustration if I'm trying to do a
project like I'm doing so in the end I
guess the company wins out but not
really because they had to spend the
extra money to do the designs in the
first place and they also have the
limited accessibility in that they can't
use other OEMs for their designs and
whatnot although if it's one thing to
come out of this video today that is
that if you're doing custom projects
just deal with the standard form factory
stuff I think if I do this project in
the future I will just grab a
lightweight 24-inch slim 1080p monitor
and get a custom bracket for it put all
the hardware on the back and I'll be
good to go with a mobile gaming solution
hey guys if you have any questions or
comments be sure to drop a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can if you
haven't raised subscribe to tech yes
city and i'll see you in the next one
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
