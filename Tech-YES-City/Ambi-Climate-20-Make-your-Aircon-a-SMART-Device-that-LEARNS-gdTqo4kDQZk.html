Taiwan and it's hot and it's stinky and
maybe you're not sure if you want to
cool down or you just want to dry
yourself down with a beautiful gold mark
so you eventually find your way to a
massive place like this that is a
conditioned but is that climate to your
liking well if it isn't perhaps the ambi
climate 2.0 can help you out just over a
year ago at Computex 2017 there was a
Kickstarter campaign and it was from a
company called ambi labs with their ambi
climate air-conditioning smart control
fast forward a year however they've
since won the DNA award from last year's
show and they now have a revision 2.0 of
the ambi climate from last year we're
gonna go to the showroom floor and take
an interview with the CEO Julianne Lee
welcome back to take yes City and I'm
joined by Julian he's gonna tell us what
makes ambi climate different to stand it
air conditioning control as well as
other smart AI features out there
because a big thing with my climate is
the smart control so what makes this so
much different thanks Brian
so Emma client is the world's first AI
powered controller for air conditioners
the key difference for our system is
this with air conditioners today you can
only really set a temperature but then
many other factors affect your comfort
so things like humidity and sunlight
coming in the room changing weather
outside things like that so with our
system instead of setting just a
temperature the user can just tell us
how do they feel right now do they feel
hot cold or comfortable and then our
machine learning system will
automatically build a personal profile
of their comfort so something like this
so this what we found is that actually
for most of our users temperature is not
number one it generally is something
like humidity or weather so based on
this understanding we automatically
adjust the air conditioner and I users
find it's more comfortable and they save
energy as well so what I already tried
this out at the studio and I'm loving it
so far you've got that full integration
with your smart phone you can control it
anywhere you wish and it's so easy to
sync up as well it's a pretty easy
learning curve and after that you get
full control of your AC like I've never
seen before this is really taking it a
step
further to make your environment just
really comfortable and the best thing
about this is it automatically learns
your behavior as well and then it'll
apply that over time right yep so I
think you know the key factors that you
know it will learn how these factors
affect you and it's not just a static
profile actually we found that your
preference has changed as the seasons
change as well so constantly learn and
update and it'll just get better over
time so now also I've noticed at the
booth here you've got the Amazon Alexa
and also the Google home devices is that
because the ambi climate syncs up with
this or can you tell us a little bit
more about the extra features on this
unit so yeah we're currently building a
lot of new convenience features so for
example we recently developed this
feature which is a geolocation so you
know the air-conditioner can
automatically turn on as you come home
and turn off as you leave and yeah we
also have we finished the Amazon Alexa
integration and Google home is pretty
much done or should be out in the next
month or so so how does that typically
work the integration what goes into that
right so with a voice integration then
you don't have to fire up your app
anymore you can just voice come on and
say you know Alexa tell ambi climate I'm
feeling good warm or you know ok Google
I'm feeling cold something like that
what we're trying to do is to make
things more convenient for the user and
that's the whole philosophy of our
automatic AI control and by training the
AI we also eliminate sort of over
cooling and overheating problems so you
save energy as well as I noticed that
advertising with efficiency so how
exactly will that save you
I guess electricity over time so I think
one thing we found is a lot of people
tend to over call or overheat their home
so you know without meaning to so an
example of this is like you know in the
summer if you set your air conditioner
to a comfortable temperature to go to
sleep next morning everyone tends to
wake up to cold that's because your
metabolism is slow down overnight so by
having this you know fine tune a
constant adjustment and automatic
adjustment we eliminate these over
cooling and overheating situations and I
usually say that you can save as much as
20 to 30% of their electricity bill so
essentially in a really hot day the unit
will be on a little bit colder than
usual but as you're sleeping and your
body cools down the unit will then get a
little bit warmer essentially saving
your lectricity but also making you feel
more comfortable is that correct
yep that's precisely it so now the last
thing I've noticed with the Emmy climate
device as well
essentially after you program it with
your AC remote you no longer really need
that remote that's right a lot of my
users actually tell us that they've
stopped using their remotes and you know
they're pretty much the battery's run
down and that sort of thing
so essentially you can now have your AC
remote in your smartphone so it's great
if maybe your previous remote has died
but also you don't want to replace the
batteries all the time that's a really
handy feature but can you also tell us
about pricing and availability of the
ambi climate 2.0 sure so ambi climate 2
is currently available in many markets
around the world in the US for example
well on Amazon at 129 us Australia will
be coming pretty soon and we're gonna do
a retail launch soon and it'll be
retailing for 199 Australians so that
sounds really good essentially if you
change your smart phone or you change
your AC in the future you can still use
the ambi climate from the de NEX device
to the next device correct because
they'll also I noticed it said as you
travel as well
you can program the Ambu climate bring
it with you and change it to different
environments yeah you can't do that I
mean of course you know one of the
things about the learning system is they
it's good to learn your environment so
it is good if you leave it at home in
that sense but some of the travel
friendly features we have is that we
have rules to help you take care of your
home as you're out of the house so let's
say a temperature so you know if you
don't want it to get too hot let's say
for your plants but you don't want to
leave that a/c running all the time then
you know you can set a rule if it's for
example above 30 degrees in the home
then it will turn on just cool it down
just that little bit as required that's
really awesome thanks for your time
Julian it was great meeting you if you
guys have any questions or comments
about the ambi climate then be sure to
drop a comment in the comment section
below and thank you guys for watching if
you enjoyed this one - be sure to hit
that like button and also a quick
message from Julian peace out for now
bye and that about wraps up computation
2018 hope you guys have enjoyed all the
coverage so far and also with the ambi
climate 2.0 it's really good before I
even came here
I just set it up really quickly there's
over 1,200 models supported out of the
box and even my Australian air
conditioning which is unique it's a
Panasonic model it wasn't even supported
in the list but it was manually set up
and it was so quick to do that - so even
if your air conditioning remote is
something new it's something unique
it'll just program itself automatically
with a touch of a button
and lastly
the ambi climate 2.0 there's four
different modes manual mode if you don't
want to change anything but just want to
use the smartphone as a remote you can
do that as well get the digital readouts
there's the comfort mode which is the
smart AI mode and it will learn over
time how you prefer your climate and
then there's temperature mode for this
the manual temperature in the room set
that and the humidity and you're good to
go
then the last mode is a way mode which
you can set thresholds for either
temperature or when you leave your
particular house where the
air-conditioning is at it'll turn off
and this is essentially saving you
energy or if you go to a certain
temperature then it will turn on and
again saving you energy anyways hope you
enjoyed this one if you did that be sure
to give it a big thumbs up and I'll
catch you in another tech video some
enthusiasts text off very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
