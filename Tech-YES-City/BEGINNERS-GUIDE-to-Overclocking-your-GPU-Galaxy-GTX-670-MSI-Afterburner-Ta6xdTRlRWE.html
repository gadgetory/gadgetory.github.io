he just coming back to you guys today
with a long awaited graphics
overclocking tutorial okay and the
reason why I haven't done this guy's for
a long time is because of the fact that
I don't really need to with my new
Kepler GTX 670 okay so let me just first
say that these graphics cards are
amazing again the video have already
introduced their automatic boost clocks
which basically allowed oh they
automatically overclock the graphics
card for you when it needs it and it's
going to keep temperatures pretty low
it's going to think things really well
it's a really good system guys but
anyway guys I'm going to do this whole
overclock tutorial for you guys today
and I'm going to explain why I do what I
do and things to look out for okay and
let me first say guys overclocking and
graphics card is a lot more sensitive
and there's a lot more things to look
out for as opposed to overlooking a CPU
okay so with a GPU you've got a video
RAM on board you've got a GPU you've got
capacitors get all these things that are
getting cooled with one big block okay
and it's you know a lot more things can
go wrong on a graphics card as opposed
to a CPU which just got one CPU it's got
its thermal throttling sensor built in
so when it hits that throttle sensor
it's going to shut off safety BAM pretty
easy simple simple GPU it's only got two
senses of thing on board so if something
goes wrong on a little bit of the card
and blows up bang you've lost what three
or four hundred dollars whatever you
paid for your graphics card so hey guys
let's get into the tutorial two programs
I'm going to make this as simple as
possible and I'll try and make it as
quick as possible but it's a very hard
units a very long topic and I want you
guys to watch the whole video so MSI
Afterburner and msi combustor okay these
are the two programs you're going to
want I'm going to put them in the
download description below so you can
just click on download them and they
will work with any graphics card guys so
MSI yes MSI do make graphics cards guys
but this program will work with any make
at any brand of graphics card a galaxy
I'm on a galaxy GTX 670 okay guys this
program works fine with my graphics card
okay no problems at all
now the first thing you want to do is
you're going to get these two programs
you're going to want to download the
latest driver version for your graphics
card you will also want to run your
graphics card in for a good two
without changing any settings at all
okay so let me just and first off before
I start overclocking guys let me just
show you why I haven't had the need to
really overclock my GTX 670 okay so
that's all the settings are normal let's
just run a test here so we're going to
put the settings on HD 720 HD with any
analyzing off and basically this is
going to stress my GPU okay so let's put
it on the furry and Tessy test okay
Ferrari and testing test 720p this is
going to stress my GPU okay not my
memory clock it's going to stress my
core clock okay and let's run this test
and let me show you why I love the new
Kepler okay lets me just show you why
again bang look at this
11:23 okay this thing is overclocking my
graphics card the you know the normal
clock the factory overclock I mean the
factory clock on the factory overclock
is like 900 and 980 okay so this thing
is going a good 15 percent over or a
good 20 percent over the factory clock
okay and now I've got a link my galaxy
card admittedly it's got an aftermarket
cooling solution which is really good
it's really quiet you cannot even hear
it now and also it's got a really high
overclock it's really good overclock I'm
really happy with this okay but anyway
let's go let's get on with the guide
guys so let's move on so then first
thing you want to want to do guys you
want to want to test your graphics card
you don't want to see what the base
overclock is okay so now I know my base
overclock is about 11 23 okay so it
seems to be hopping between 11 10 and 11
23 and the reason for this is because
it's reaching the max TDP here okay
which is the thermal power design and
basically that's the 170 watts for my
graphics card every graphics cards
difference going to have a different TDP
power level mine is 170 watts okay so as
what this means is is reaching 170 watts
it's burning all the power and that's
why it's going from 11:23 back down to
11 10 now the first thing is you're
going to want to run that you're going
to want to find out what speed you're
going to want to find out if it's
hitting that TDP and then you're going
to want to find the temperatures now
with the graphics card guys you probably
don't want to go over 80 ok don't not go
over 82
is I just don't like going over it and
the reason being is because you have da
da da da dun er memory on board okay and
if we look at memory guys and in the
past what fails a CPU or RAM I've had
Ram Mackay fail on me two times now and
I haven't even overclocked it I've had
friends with faulty Ram
I've never had a faulty CPU so the same
principles apply to a graphics card guys
memory on a graphics card will fail
before a GPU fails account on the
graphics card okay so now this is
important and it's extremely important
to watch out with this memory clock
overclock as a put as opposed to the
core clock okay and now the first thing
we're going to do is going to say safe
power limit and insert your card name
here okay so let's go to Google let's
find out what other people are setting
this their power limits to and if you
have a 7950 for example you type in 7950
what are people doing okay and 20% okay
so people are doing 20% that seems to be
a safe power limit for an ATI seven nine
fifty let's have a look what people are
doing for a GTX 670 okay and I'm in one
hundred twenty two percent of a little
bit too high for me one hundred and
fourteen hundred fifteen percent seems
to be about what I like to do for my
card so let's put that in one hundred
and fifteen is the first thing we're
going to do in a raise this up to about
115 okay guys and we're going to apply
and now as with all my overclocking
tutorials guys I usually recommend safe
settings and of course they're not
nothing safe in the overclocking world
but generally I recommend lower kind of
over clocks as opposed to extreme
overclock and this is because you know
you guys if you're watching this you're
obviously beginners and I don't want you
destroying your hardware if you're a
beginner guys stay low with your
overclocked slow not learn the whole
thing learn the whole game before you
start going for extreme overclocked you
know there are so many people out there
who have blown up graphics cards blowing
up CPUs because they just got into and
they're like yeah man I'm going to drop
yeah let's just max settings bang blow
the friggin thing just you know to
kingdom come
and that's exactly what happens to
somebody when they lose 400 dollar
investments so if I guess 115 that's for
me first thing
going to do is going to apply that now
the second thing we're going to do okay
and this is what we're going to do fan
speed we're going to whack that up and
you can guys can do max I'm going to go
70 okay so you want your fans running
and now listen okay
just have a listen can you guys hear
that that's a noisy fan okay so this is
another reason why I have an overclocked
my Keppler because you know you're gonna
have noisy fans in the background guys
and this is a big reason for me I hate
playing games out the area like this is
jet engine in the background okay now
we're going to save that okay save that
to one okay so this is going to be an
overclock profile first thing you want
to do is raise the power limit and
you're going to raise the fans okay and
the reason why we're raising the fans
guys is because if we leave it on auto
the graphics card may spike and then the
fans kick in and at that time it can
cause damage okay so the auto setting
this can cause damages there's a little
bit of lag there okay so we're going to
want to leave that seven you want to
keep our graphics card cool and then
we're going to start our overclocks okay
now first things first guys I've already
tested my graphics card okay and I'm
going to tell you now it can go up to
about 140 and then it starts to artifact
okay and let's for all purposes intent
you may want to start off with 50 or a
hundred okay a hundred should be almost
every graphics card should be able to
attain a reasonable hundred Hertz
overclock on the core okay so let's
apply that and now as we got our
settings here before this is a nice GPU
intensive test this one we're running
right here and now let's watch this okay
so bang we're already getting that 115
percent TD TPD thermal power design so I
said TDP before done while so yes it's
already hitting the TPD so that means I
don't want to take my card any higher
I'm not comfortable running my $400
graphics card any higher okay and the
reason being is because yeah I'm just
not comfortable I don't want to if
something fails guys if you've had
hardware fail on you you'll know how
much of a pain in the ass it is to
replace hardware and that downtime and
all that stuff so yeah be very
with overclocking but here we go guys
GPU temperature is close it's climbing
slowly which is a good thing it's a
really good thing it means it's it's
obviously you know if it was up to 70
degrees already and it was climbing it'd
be pretty harsh
okay now we're up to 12 so here we are
we're up to a hundred megahertz about a
hundred megahertz over our clock that we
had before okay so even though we're at
11:23 before we were actually limited by
the TPD okay so the TV the TPD was
limiting our overclock before and I
believe it's still kind of limiting our
overclock now okay but anyway guys
that's what we're getting now again
12:24 and it's pretty good overclock
again now we can push it higher if we
want to okay but what I want to do
quickly now is since that was 120
megahertz over what we were getting
before I kind of want to go back now and
test how much we're going to run off
stock okay at 115 percent TBD I want to
see how much my graphics card is going
to go to okay now if we run this on
stock factory settings guys look at what
we're getting the graphics cards saying
this isn't a videos technology and this
is how good it is guys it's saying
alright we're going to give you a nice
1175 overclock without you touching a
thing except just saying without you
except raising the TBD and this is a
really good solid level for your
graphics card okay so if you guys don't
want to touch anything other than one
setting or two settings maybe just raise
the fan speed and raise the power limit
if you're on a GTX 670 660ti or if
you're on a GTX 680 just hit those two
settings and the video will do the rest
for you so that's if you're really basic
and you don't want to risk sort of
stuffing up your graphics card but as
you can see here it's a healthy
overclock and we're only really getting
another what 60 70 megahertz over what
we were getting before so now what we
want to do is we want to say okay well
we're at 62 we're going to say 80 and
this is going to be this core clock guys
is going to be related to the power
limit okay and I'm not and you're
probably wondering oh well you haven't
touched core voltage yet core voltage is
for people who want to go bang
or raise it higher than that and then
they're getting instability problems
core voltage may fix stability problems
okay and for beginners guys we're not
even going to touch this okay but if you
want to you can enable it with these two
settings in settings click on settings
check these two boxes you can then
enable this and it'll you can change the
core voltage but guys if you're
beginners and you're watching this
please do not even bother touching your
core voltage okay it is probably one of
the quickest ways to destroy a graphics
card and as it's a millivolts to it it's
sensitive okay so don't you know if you
guys are learning and you want to go
higher than yeah please please by all
means do your research and go higher but
for for you guys I'm going to teach you
a safe overclock one hundred and fifteen
percent let's raise that back up to
seventy now so we're going to raise this
to eighty now and we're going to find
out what our card is comfortable doing
so there we go guys we're now we're
still at the same level so even though
we had a hundred hundred in there before
we had a hundred megahertz in there
before we've gone up to eighty three and
we're still getting the same level so
the TD the TPD is what's limiting our
overclock okay and I don't you know I'm
not comfortable really pushing my card
any higher than that I did manage to
push it before to a hundred and sort of
5140 but Neil we'll try that let's just
give it a go so as you can see here up
to 1280 and that's our max okay so at
this TPD this is our max okay 1280 is
what we're maxing out on okay so you
know this test obviously this test test
memory as well so I'm sure if we did
another test we may be able to go higher
but you know for games is going to give
you a realistic level of what your cores
running at okay so basically my max is
1280 okay I'm happy with that
that's what I'm going to do I'm going to
stick with that obviously I can go
higher if I put up more power but guys I
don't want to risk destroying my
graphics card okay so there we go 1280
guys let's be happy with that so we just
leave that at 100 and now we've found
the core clock okay that's our core
clock overclock okay that's what we're
happy with going with okay so I'm happy
rolling with that day-in day-out
4:7 overclock I'm happy with that
setting now the next thing guys the next
one is we're going to go to the memory
overclock okay so this one guys this one
here and I want to say to you guys this
here is be very very very careful with
memory clock okay it is the main reason
in my opinion why graphics cards
break okay and why they just you know
why they brick is because memory clock
okay memory is put a lot more prone to
failure than a core okay a CPU or GPU
okay a memory clock is way more prone
and it's one of the reasons why a lot of
graphics cards stuff up especially in
the past because the RAM wasn't cooled
sufficiently and bang and graphics card
just fried or on a real hot day even
people with normal graphics cards davin
even overclocked they were getting fried
greatly not fry but the graphics card
were having problems and it's because of
memory the memory wasn't cool but
nowadays the memory tends to be cooled
pretty effectively and so yeah let's
straight away you know find out what
people are doing on the internet guys
for your particular card but for me a
lot of people were going for 500
megahertz overclocks on the ram now to
me that is just it's too much I don't
like going I don't like overclocking my
ram that much let's start off first with
say a 300 megahertz overclock okay
there's a 10% overclock on our memory on
board now since my card is not an MSI
card I don't have the feature for shader
clock but if you have an MSI GTX 670 you
will get another feature which is shader
clock memory and basically these two
settings you can tweak them but for
these purposes of beginners guys just
play with memory clock and be happy okay
so now that being said guys we're going
to do want to do a special test okay so
when we get the memory clock here we're
going to clock this back down to 0
because we're testing memory this time
and we're going to go to settings guys
and we're going to say let's whack this
up to 4 MSA and 1080p ok so this time
we're going to want to go higher reza's
we're going to put on the anti stropping
filter you know the the MSAA settings
and this time guys we're going to do a
rekt 3d 11 so DirectX 11 and leave it on
torus so these settings here guys this
will stress your a put that back on this
is going to stress it depends guys if
you don't play MSA for by all means put
it on to I tend to play my games on two
or four depending on the framerate so
I'm gonna for this test let's just do 10
and sorry before we run this test let's
just run it back down on zero okay so
let's leave this on zero and zero so now
this will be a Jeep hey get back to zero
this will be a GPU test this timer cases
coming up so this is going to be a
memory test so let's get that on DirectX
in GPU burnin direct3d 11 torus settings
1080p for msaa
let's go guys bang let's see what now
let's exactly see what's going on here
TPD
is not so it's not even reaching max
which means our memory is starting to
get a chugga K as memory is like oh my
god I'm getting hurt here this is
hurting me what are you doing to me
Brian yeah you know you're chugging me
man
so the memory is now my GPU memory guys
is now maxed okay and it's starting to
chug
so the GPU is actually fine even though
it says 99% I don't know why the graphic
the actual memory is starting to chug
okay
and now so we're finally we're getting
average of 23 frames here guys okay
and our GPU temperature is kind of
climbing that's not climbing that much
but the memory is getting stressed trust
me now let's close that down okay so
we're gonna exit that 23 okay note that
23 there we're going to drop this up so
we're gonna Dre's this up 300 okay we
okay I'm going to apply that let's go
we're gonna save that so I should have
saved it before as you did you do all
the little increments you should save it
and then you know after you sorry after
you get the stable you should save it
and then do your next one save it I did
it just a little bit wrong in but anyway
let's go guys let's practice this we got
300 megahertz this time and you're going
to notice you don't notice a difference
okay you're probably going to notice a
increase so we've increased the che
in case the memory clocks 10% guys so
we've increased our memory clocks 10%
and look at these guys were getting
pretty much a 10% increase in our frames
believe it or not so yeah this memory
clock is working effectively and I
recommend if you're playing at 1080p or
higher res is goes and you love your
msaa if you love turning that on then
yeah you may wish to overclock your
memory but be very very very careful
with your overclock on the memory guys
it is extremely fragile memory is what
is going to make pretty much generally
memories what's going to make your
graphics card just going to kill your
graphics card basically as you can see
is GPU temp only 52 degrees but I
guarantee you the memory is getting hot
as it's getting stressed and we can see
that with the average frames okay so
tread really lightly with memory test
guys personally for me I'm not going to
overclock any higher than 300 okay I
don't recommend you guys going any more
than a 10% overclock on the memory okay
of course you can go higher but over
time guys fan speeds are going to get
your fans going to get weaker on your
graphics cards you're you know you know
obviously memory if it gets hot on
especially in summer so be careful but
you know memory is going to be the one
that's prone to failure not your GPU as
much okay so anyway guys let's just say
look this is doing pretty well let's say
okay let's go up to 400 now some people
are getting 500 that's okay but guys in
the long run don't please
I don't recommend going to 500 or even
400 I'd stay at 300 but let's go to 400
and we'll see obviously it should
hopefully it should go up to 26 27 the
average frames so obviously we're in
clear increasing the memory clocks
and we're getting results okay we're
getting real results here so there we
have it guys that is your memory
overclocked now and so what we're going
to do here is we're going to now go back
to our settings and we're going to say
okay well we got a 300 megahertz
overclock on the memory it was pretty
stable it was nice and we got a hundred
megahertz on the core clock again
and now this time guys of course if so
back onto the memory clock if you're up
to 500 and you're artifacting then drop
it back down a little bit okay but for
beginners guys I don't recommend running
your graphics card below artifact okay I
just don't recommend it okay you
basically it's like your kids on the
racetrack I'll go back to the racetrack
example your kids on the racetrack he's
got a smile and if your cards
artifacting you're pushing your kid and
you're saying look your six-year-old
son's got a smile you're saying look
keep running man and he's got a smile
would you do that to your son no you'd
say stop me and have a break and so the
graphics card if it's artifacting it's
struggling guys are you going to keep
pushing your graphics card or keep it
just below that level where you're
pushing your graphics card are you going
to do that I'm not going to do that
because I know in time something's
probably going to go wrong and since I
like to have my hardware for two to
three years I don't recommend you doing
it so anyway guys if you want to though
go up to 500 megahertz and then work
from there if you're on a GTX 670 if
you're on another card going to Google
see what other people are doing getting
with their cards see what the safe
levels for your card is to start at and
then go with that okay but for me I'm
happy with a street I'm happy with ten
percent man that's fine
I want my card to run I want my card to
run day-in day-out especially since it's
holidays I play games a lot on my
holidays and I want to keep a safe
overclock so here we go let's apply this
this is the final test now how are we
going to do the final blend test okay
the final test guys is we're going to go
to here we're going to drop it down to
say two obviously you can do the furry
and terry test this is a it's generally
it's a good test okay it stresses
everything okay and now hopefully this
time guys we should get the best frame
rates that we've ever got
so hopefully sorry we got to MSN I
didn't really test it with MSA off but
you know this is our final overclock
guys and we're going to see we're going
to get a nice average frame rate here
I'm getting 41 and we're going to test
that now as opposed to having no
overclock at all and we're going to see
which is better okay so anyway here we
go we've got our memory gonna sit 3300
we got core at 12 67 nice overclock guys
nice safe overclock some people aren't
going to be able to obtain the overclock
that I can get some people are going to
go a lot higher just depends use the
luck of the draw with graphics cards
just as it is with CPUs some CPUs can go
higher
some can't and you know this is my
overclock guys and I'm happy with it
okay this is my nice gaming overclocked
I probably will tune it down even a
little bit less because I want to I
don't like the having the fans so loud
in the background yeah if you don't mind
fan noise guys ball means you know copy
my settings if you have a GTX 670 please
ask me any questions if you want guys
yeah that's about it so let's have a
look guys 41 there GPU temps are pretty
cool it's running nicely let's clock it
down and see what we will let's see our
overall increase in performance here
okay as opposed to a researchers reset
the whole thing so we're getting 41 on
that test let's just reset ok so sorry
will actually save our profile before we
do that ok there we go let's save that
save as 1 so that's our overclocked
we're going to save that sorry I already
did save it and then we're going to go
back to default which is 2 so we're back
to stock settings guys everything's
normal
let's run off same test variant a/c
tests and this time we're going to see
how much of a general increase we got
out of our card ok what kind of
performance gains we got out of just
raising that TPD 15% ok and that's why
I'm saying it's the most important thing
is raising the TPD because that's the
limit of how much power your cards
actually using and just like a car
engine the more you know the more fuel
that's going into the car the more power
it's going to produce and this is
exactly what's happening with the
graphics card the more power is going
into the graphics card the more power is
coming out to your screen so let's have
a look at 37 ok that's about what we're
doing at 37 as opposed to 41 you do the
math that's over at
10% that's what's almost pretty much
it's pretty much exactly a 10% overclock
so basically guys we got a nice 10%
overclock today and it was safe as it's
pretty safe okay it's not going to burn
your graphics card out admittedly the
fan noise is annoying for me so I'm
probably you know for all in all guys
I'm most likely just going to keep my
graphics card at the normal settings
maybe I'll just increase the TPD up to a
hundred and ten percent and you know
guys that's that and that's why I
haven't done this overclocking tutorial
for a long time is because I've been
really happy with my GTX 670 and the
video have done a phenomenal thing with
the Kepler series they've increased the
power efficiency they've increased the
frames or the power a massive amount and
it just runs so smoothly every every
game that I put through this thing no
problems at all guys so you know you
guys have obviously I'm not a Nvidia
fanboy I love AMD to whatever's better
value for money but I'm just saying this
is a really good cut and guys yeah watch
this okay you don't want to go over
eighty degrees okay on any graphics card
I don't recommend going over eighty
degrees it's sort of a level that things
can go wrong okay so what's your
graphics cards guys and be sure to watch
the temperatures okay so as you can see
it's sort of fighting 79 80 it's sort of
it's fighting itself and also the
graphics has onboard fan control auto
which once it gets to 80 degrees the
fans spin up faster and cool it down
better so guys I hope you enjoyed this
