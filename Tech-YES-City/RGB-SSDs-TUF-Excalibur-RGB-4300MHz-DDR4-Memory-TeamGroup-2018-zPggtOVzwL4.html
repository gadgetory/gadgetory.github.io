es city and I got some RGB stuff to show
you today if you're a big fan of swords
that's what this is right here this is
Tim group Excalibur ddr4 we're gonna get
some close-ups on that straight I've
straight what strip straight at a
crocodile River
Crocky might
mm 18s Computex coverage wouldn't be
possible without gigabyte or Corsair
bringing you the quality and also the
reliability that you need when building
a new PC welcome back to the Computex
2018 tour and this time around we've got
team group with their new RGB memory of
course RGB and they'll say their SSDs
here is their Excalibur T force
brand-new it's going to be hitting the
market it's just showing off here at
Computex but pricing and availability
will be updated now they are using
Samsung B dime memory so this is
expecting some high overclocks I believe
it is 3600 starting from with CL 16 time
is going all the way up to 40 300
megahertz with CL 18 timings so this has
got the speeds it's also got the bling
with 10 LEDs five each side included so
you can customize this with software as
well but let's take a look at some other
products they've got on display here
we've got here the tough gaming alliance
a collaboration with Zeus and also team
group and their T force branding this
has got that camo look going on with
gold and black to match the motherboards
now they also coming in with a little
bit of a competitive price here and
lower speeds
so from 2400 megahertz 165 USD for a 2
by 8 gigabyte kit and that will go up
all the way past three gigahertz
however past 3 gigahertz they do start
using Samsung be diet chips onboard the
memory before that however it's a choice
of hynek's or micron and of course it
all scales to what's in your wallet
however later in the year they are
releasing a custom PCB model which in my
opinion looks really good it really
matches that raw look of the PCB on the
motherboard itself and this will come in
a little bit cheaper but will also
feature the same speeds as the heatsink
stuff now to the right of me here we
have some interesting new products to
say the least
RGB now on a SSD and this is addressable
RGB 2 so you can match it with your
computers software and they've also got
it in the white and black aesthetic as
well now starts at $85 so the premium
over a 250 gigabyte SSD is not that much
it scales all the way up to a one
terabyte version which comes into $255
includes a three-year warranty
you also get micron 64 layer TLC NAND
flash and there's also a controller on
board from SMI there's also burst banks
as well so the speeds won't be slowing
down
some competitors are cutting out the
burst banks even on their entry-level
240 Cuba SSDs and that's causing slower
speeds a team group are not doing that
with their SSDs this time around and
that about wraps it up for the team
group booth here at Computex 2018 with
this new product some of them look very
sleek in my opinion looking forward to
putting some of these on the test bench
and putting them in a build especially a
big thanks to Kevin for also hosting us
here and also Kevin tells us that there
is a special difference between team
group and also competitors and I'd love
to hear what that is okay we also use
the original IC city from the
manufacturer like a same song hi next
Michael and we all use this IC to do
very very serious loading to make like
pending process in order to make V good
party module so the quality control is
really up there the failure rates are
low that's what people want to hear team
group delivering you some of the best
memory in 2018 thanks for your time
that's all for now bye
crikey mangle the heatsink stuff here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
