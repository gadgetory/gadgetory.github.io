back and we looked at how important
exercise was and why I feel you need it
in every day of your life if you haven't
seen this video already then I will put
a link to it up here where I do
recommend you watch part 1 because
Taiwan and now today part 2 are very
important because they'll lead into part
3 well we can come together and make the
ultimate guide on how you can be a
healthy
so before we get on with my diet and
what I eat every day it's important to
note that there are some correlations
that have been happening over the last
100 years at the very least and their
correlations that are heading towards us
not living a healthy life the first one
being sugar in the 1700s the average
daily intake was under 5 grams
fast-forward now post 2000 era we are in
taking on average over 270 grams of
sugar per day
that is over 45 times the increased
consumption of course in taking too much
sugar can lead to things like diabetes
and other health problems but it can
also and this is the biggest problem in
my opinion create an addiction however
some could argue it's a dependency but
it's been shown that every time you
intake in certain individuals it can
release dopamine and just like certain
drugs this then in time can be an
addictive habit that you develop a
resistance to hence the next time you
eat more sugar and sweets you take more
of a hit to get the same feeling that
you previously had so if you're guilty
of drinking soda drinking Cola and
drinking too much soft drink and eating
too much junk food then you need to stop
things like syrups as well they are
packed with sugar and not only that
they're packed with the next cardinal
sin and that is trans fats trans fats
are essentially hydrogenated oil that's
then hardened and in turn it's harder
for your body to digest this and it's
packed in a lot of foods it was
notorious for being packed in previous
fast-food outlets however they have
since change their tune and are now
putting in more healthier options which
is good to a point but of course eating
deep fried food is not always a good
option it will load your body with a lot
of other malnutrition food but ladies
and gentlemen before we move on with my
diet and my choices of food if you can
do me one favor well actually two favors
and that is cut back on the sugar and
also cut back on the trans fats so less
processed and junk food less drinking
soda less drinking sweet drinks and try
to drink water and a lot more cup of tea
every time you see me on the channel
here I'm drinking a cup of tea and I
don't put any additional sugar into that
I put a little bit
milk in there and I'm good to go
basically I want you guys to develop a
liking to having a bitter tongue rather
than a sweet tongue because that's gonna
mean you have energy for a longer amount
of time you're able to work longer
you're then able to exercise better and
more importantly your mind is then able
to function in a more regulated manner
so from here on in I wake up in the
morning and I'll usually have a light
breakfast this will usually consist of a
fruit smoothie I'll be whacking anything
from beetroot to carrots to kale to
apples to banana to various other
ingredients that are just in the fridge
and I'm at the supermarket there aren't
special those vegetables and fruits
whack them all together chuck them in a
smoothie get yourself a good blender and
you're gonna be definitely having one of
the best breakfasts available now
another thing at breakfast sometimes I
like to drink coffee especially if I've
got a big workload on so if I do drink
coffee I'll always only drink it in the
morning because for me personally after
lunchtime I find it does affect my sleep
sometimes they can get to the stage
where if I take it too late in the day
it'll have my heart just beating beating
beating when I'm trying to go to sleep
so for breakfast try to eat a light meal
in my opinion fruit or veg is the best
option of course if you're in a hurry
you may just want to grab something
quick either you have a few measly bars
sitting in the cupboard and also a
banana this is like my super lazy no
time to even put a blending breakfast
together and of course the other option
I've got is if I'm got a bit of time in
the morning I'll cook up some porridge
and have that with banana
so there are my three choices for
breakfast that I eat personally and now
here we're gonna move over to lunchtime
because this is an important one this is
I feel is the most important meal of
your day lunch because it gives you the
energy for the rest of the day if you
eat crap food at this time of the day I
feel like you start coming down and
around four or five o'clock you get very
tired lack of energy but if you need a
good meal and if you do eat fast food I
try to eat things like sushi burritos
and rarely will I have an indulge in
something like KFC if I do go to KFC I
usually get myself an ultimate box they
do taste very good but if I do eat that
KFC I don't get myself a soft drink as I
said in the intro I get myself something
like a water or an orange juice because
they're much healthier for you and we're
gonna stop here and talk a little bit
more about lunch because as we said
before most important part of your day
most important meal if you can always
try to cook yourself a good lunch you
can have last night's dinner if that was
healthy try to eat maybe a wholemeal
sandwich I personally love and the
majority of the time if I'm out
don't have time to make lunch I'll eat
salmon and avocado sushi
they've also down the road they've got
some really healthy options like tuna
california rolls these are all good but
if I have a bit of time it will make
myself a sandwich
with a bit of ham lettuce and hamish dip
on there sometimes even going as far to
cook myself up a chicken stir-fry or a
chicken schnitzel and salad st. meals
that I'd have for dinner
but they're packed with healthy
ingredients they're not gonna weigh me
down and they're not gonna be too heavy
however before we move on to dinner I
would not recommend eating something for
lunch like a pizza this will really
weigh you down leave you so thirsty for
water high salt intake all that stuff
that you don't need to get the rest of
the day productive and now finally
ladies and gentleman we are moving up
towards dinner but in between if you do
get a little bit hungry there's some
great snacks that I have throughout my
day I usually had it I said before in
the cupboard muesli bars bananas on hand
these are healthy snacks that everyone
should have in their cupboard or in
their fruit bowl apples as well
fantastic I usually have a lot of these
on hand at any given time I also drink a
lot of water and tea throughout the day
so don't be afraid if you're a little
bit hungry and you sort of want to delay
your lunch time till 12:00 or 1:00 p.m.
and don't be afraid to have little
snacks throughout the day but do keep
them healthy don't go off all the time
eating things like chocolate bars but if
you do eat chocolate bars try to keep
them dark chocolate and here we are now
at the final meal of the day
this is dinner time you're getting
hungry you've most likely gone to the
gym and now if you do go to the gym I
usually like to go at least the evening
or sometimes even really late at night
like 1:00 a.m. but if you do find
yourself hungry go to a workout first
eat some little snack before you go and
then when you get home you can make
yourself up a nice rich protein meal me
personally this is the time when I eat
my steaks ate my porks ate my chicken
it's usually got a bit of meat packed in
but it would packed in with vegetables
and salad usually vegetables find like
even things like potato chips are fine
here I like to eat a lot of things like
pumpkin carrot cauliflower beans these
are some really good science to couple
in with your main dish just to make a
nice meal it'll keep you full
and then you can go to bed sleep really
well because hopefully by this stage
you've followed part 1 of this tutorial
see you now exercising you're now eating
right and you're ready for the
conclusion of this video and also the
lead-up to part 3
before we get on with anything else I
know people gonna ask me about my
skincare sometimes I get told that I
look 25 even though I'm 32 years old so
let's take a look at what I use and what
I have been using for quite a few years
now this is my moisturizer I get this
off I her but calm it's called she
moisture and it's essentially baby
lotion but I find it works so well it
really moisturizes my skin leaves it
feeling really good especially in winter
when it's really dry and itchy also
here's the other finishing touch I don't
use this every night but I do use this
after I moisturize and this is jojoba
oil I like to put in some vitamin E oil
as well as vitamin C oil inside this mix
and then just drop it on my skin before
I go to bed it leaves the final product
looking really nice really polished so
sometimes you'll see me go to these
events you'll hear stories about the yes
you know having a bit of fun with the
ladies and that's because they see the
product and they say hey I can overclock
this thing I can get great performance
gains out of it so I want to share these
same secrets with you guys but also if
you're in the shower and you need
something to clean your face clean your
skin off this is what I use even though
I haven't got any pimples on my face
that's called acne dote a and it's
really good I find this cleanser really
cleans out all your pores so you can
then put on the moisturizer and then on
the judge a bowl but I don't use this
every day I only use this once every two
or three days so just depends you be the
judge on what feels best for you I like
to be the judge on what feels best for
me now for supplements a lot of people
how they take different supplements
because they may be deficient in a
certain thing me personally I only have
two supplements that I take and that is
cod liver oil and all social aided
magnesium because I believe about 75% of
human beings post-2000 era are deficient
in
magnesium and you want to get the good
stuff which is the sh elated stuff
because your body absorbs it much better
than the cheap stuff this will help with
your muscles and you'll stop getting
cramps at least this is what I
personally found I no longer get cramps
in my muscles and really weird pains and
especially when I sleep sometimes before
I took magnesium I wake up with a really
sore neck that no longer happens anymore
and here we are now at conclusion time
the most important thing to come out of
today's video is cut down on your sugar
if you haven't already and also cut down
on processed foods which generally
contain a lot of sugar and trans fats
these two are your biggest enemy in 2018
going on to 2019 at 2020 it doesn't
matter this is a trend that's been
happening you've got to see it you've
got to identify it and you've got all
emanated out of your diet and then that
will help you in turn have more energy
to exercise and then exercising will in
turn make you feel better so it's all
the process that's interconnected that's
why I'm making a three part series and
the first two are really important for
part 3 which is coming soon hope you
