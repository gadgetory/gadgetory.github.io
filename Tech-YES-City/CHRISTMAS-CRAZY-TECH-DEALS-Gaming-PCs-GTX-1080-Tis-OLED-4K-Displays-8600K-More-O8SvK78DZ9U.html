deals on tech products and today is
another one of those days where there
are some awesome deals especially if
you're in the u.s. and Australia I've
got a heap of good deals and of course
with that said I always take care of the
international audience and we've got
here a combo of the ex 34:40 which is
currently $18 for cos 8 threads couple
that with in a zeus h 55 pro-am
motherboard good vrm this comes in at 64
dollars so it's a little bit more
expensive than the cheapest age 55 board
you can get but with that it will let
you overclock a little bit higher and
then couple that with a VT g5 cooler
this thing is going out of control it's
selling like crazy it's $27 shipped to
your door now with that you may have to
pay import taxes where you live but if
you ask the seller to mark it down and
say 5 10 bucks or even 5 chuck-e-cheese
tokens apparently that's the currency
nowadays then I'm sure the seller will
oblige and help you out so with that
said let's get on with the rest of these
deals
welcome back to tackiest city in the
first of the deals we have up here is
people over in the states Amazon have
the corsair void pro gaming headset
going for 50 US dollars now I did take a
look at the wireless version and of
course that's wireless but that's a
hundred dollars this is the same thing
you won't have to charge any batteries
and actually the sound on this thing is
very good
the included mic is a little bit tinny
but for 50 dollars you just can't go
wrong and even if you're going wrong
you'd be right up there soaring with the
Eagles the next deal we got up here is
the Orion g10 from Logitech going for
eighty dollars this has Omron switches
they're currently the switches that I'm
using on my main daily driver keyboard
also if you're not into Omron switches
you can get the Cherry MX brown or Reds
they're going for sixty dollars really
good deal on a keyboard now if you need
a good fingertip mouse to go with that
keyboard then there's a gta3 currently
on sale for twenty dollars down from 40
there's also the white version as well
to go off the white theme built if you
so wish and then if you need a power
supply for your new builders currently a
620 white sea sonic power supply going
for fifty dollars is also apparently a
fifteen dollar rebate there so you could
theoretically get this for 35 dollars
which makes it an absolute steal at this
price and then lastly the OLED TVs from
LG are on sale worldwide I believe this
one's going for fifteen hundred dollars
for a 55 inch OLED TV this thing has got
HDR as well absolutely gorgeous panel
you can step it up to other models but
keep in mind that this display the
actual display going into this TV it
won't get any better than this at least
in 2017 and we're moving over to
Australia where the deals are actually
really good especially for the next
three days with a base 20% off sale so
you use the code power up on checkout
and you will save quite a bit of money
twenty percent and with that the gtx
1070 TI so not the 1070 the 1070 TI
which is really close to the 1080 is
going for 600 Australian dollars after
you use that coupon code so if you want
to get into cryptocurrency mining and
you want practically the most efficient
card out there I believe the 1070 TI is
the most efficient car picker to
currency mining then you get into it for
pretty good prices or of course if you
just want this gravis car for what it
was intended to do and that was PC
gaming then this will be an extremely
good value for money card so now next
deal I have up here is actually
good when you take the 20 percent off so
2,560 Australian dollars but you're
getting a fully pre-built system with a
GTX 10 ATT I also z3 70 motherboard 8700
K and vm e storage 650 watt gold pals
play in wind case also get a H 55
Corsair water cooler which all those not
the best for this build is still really
good Bay for money if you were to go out
and build this whole computer yourself
it would easily cost more than two and a
half thousand Australian dollars and
that's shipped to your door as well so
if you can't afford the two and a half
thousand dollars then there is two
thousand three hundred dollars on a GTX
1080 system so you're not getting the TI
you're just stepping it down to a 1080
and of course saving a bit of money
so both these computers are actually
really good deals if you take that 20
percent off and the next two deals we
have up here are graphics cards we go to
GTX 1060 going for two hundred and sixty
Australian posted to your door really
good performance for the money and if
you want to step it up to the high end
there's a 1080 TI gone for nine hundred
and fifty Randall's after you use the p5
cause you coupon so you can't use the
20% off on this one but you can use the
five percent off and still get a pretty
good deal moving over to monitors now 4k
ultra white or at least close to 4k I
think the actual vertical resolution
isn't quite 4k but it still is a crazy
monitor 38 inches and this is going for
sixteen hundred and eighty dollars after
use that coupon code and of course it's
going to be great for video editing and
of course gaming since it is free sync
and it is av a panel and it's got 75
Hertz available to of course if you want
to monitor that's a lot cheaper and more
practical there's a Samsung 32-inch
1080p display going for $268 shipped to
your door or if you want to step it up
or down in size but better panel quality
you can get four four hundred and sixty
eight dollars a curved QD LED display
with a 1440 PV a panel and of course
that supports free sync too though
speaking of the granddaddy's and as we
talked about before with an OLED display
there's also the same display on sale in
Australia going for nineteen hundred and
sixty eight dollars shipped to your door
this is one crazy deal especially if you
want to step it up to a very high-end TV
55 inch LG OLED display HDR as well
these are the panels that they're also
putting in the panel
and Sony displays too so don't let the
price fool you this TV is legit
and what about CPUs and motherboards
here we have the 80 600 k going for 356
dollars shipped to your door after you
use that coupon code very good cpu I'd
call it the best in slot for gamers at
the moment it is very good especially if
you can overclock it and you won't have
to deal it to get really good speeds so
if you want something a little bit more
in terms of maximum performance you can
get a risin 7 1700 for 384 dollars this
will be great when you're doing to do
productivity or any simulated thread
loads that can utilize the 16 threads
that this thing has then when it comes
to gaming of course the 8600 K will edge
this CPU out even with something like a
1080 Ti though moving on to the next
deals for motherboards to couple it with
this we have the z3 70 P this is a the P
stands for plain and not like simple or
anything like that it actually stands
for aeroplane because these deals are
just flying out at the moment you can
get this thing for 200 a strand dollars
shipped to your door or if you need an X
370 and this is for the AMD CPU you can
currently get the fatality for a hundred
and eighty dollars shipped to your door
X 370 motherboard great for overclocking
as rock boards are rock-solid in 2017
and going into 2018 Zeus and as rocker
kind of like my two picks for the best
motherboard manufacturers out there of
course if you can't afford either the 80
600 K or the Verizon 770 100 then there
is the horizon 5 1600 go for about 260
dollars you can couple that with a
inexpensive be 350 motherboard from MSI
going for a hundred and twenty dollars
so there the deals for the Aussies let's
move over to the UK now and see what
they got there with a GTX I think I
might save that one for next month's
part hunt but we've got a gtx 1070 going
for 368 quid pretty good price
considering how expensive graphics cards
are in the UK to begin with then if you
want some coolers cool master have some
really good deals on a 240 ml rad 46
quid shipped to your door and a hyper
212 which is gone for 20 pounds so
they're pretty good deals on coolers and
a gratis card if you need to monitor for
your gaming experience there is the same
Samsung 27-inch monitor that we talked
about before in the UK going for
238 pounds sorry guys that's about it
for the deals today if you've got deals
of your own be sure to drop them in the
comment section below and I'll add them
to the description though with the
Aussie deals you only have three days
left to use that coupon code so beyond
that quick as there are some really
legit deals out there and with that said
I'll catch you guys in about three hours
in a live stream where I'll be doing
some Christmas giveaways there's three
different giveaways running I'll also
probably give away some stuff live as
well for those who are watching the live
