the two hottest gaming headset
microphones you can get the v-moda and
also the antlion mod bank 4.0 we're
going to be putting these head-to-head
against one another and seeing which one
is the best or which one suits you for
your particular needs
welcome back to tech yes City this brand
coming to you guys today with a review
of the antlion mod make 4.0 now this is
a microphone that you don't need to do
anything to change on your existing
headphones so if you have a good pair of
audiophile headphones you can
essentially bang on this little clip
then put on your microphone plug that
into computer and you now essentially
have a gaming headset albeit with two
wires now there is an alternative to
that and that is the V mode of burn Pro
which I have been using for a long time
especially if you followed me on my tech
gaming weekly podcast where I use it
every week and everyone says that
microphone sounds exceptional though how
good does it sound against the mod mic
so I'm going to do a head-to-head
comparison right now for you guys and
you can be the judge on which you think
sounds better
she sells SSD shells by the Micro Center
store he sells aliens that where alien
where by the Dell store big bada boom
for the bass she sells SSD shells by the
Micro Center store he sells aliens that
where alien where by the Dell store big
butter boom for the bass so the last
test I'm going to do for you guys is run
the alien my mic off this included USB Y
splitter there so let's do that
she sells SSD shells by the Micro Center
store
he sells aliens that where alien where
by the Dell store big butter boom for
the base so there we have it the test do
all the speaking themselves for the mics
and I thought the Antley and one mic had
a little bit more bass or a flatter
response than the v-moda boom Pro which
had a little bit more treble which made
it seem a little bit more clear
especially when it came to voices though
for what it's worth I thought both these
mics sounded phenomenal especially for
both mics that come under $50
they both introduced no noise on their
own when I cleared out the noise over
the
bored audio also another thing about
these mics is that one comes in at
thirty dollars that's the v-moda boom
Pro it also it comes with a mute switch
on there and a volume switch on there
and it's honestly in my opinion the best
choice if you've got a 3.5 millimeter
Inlet already on your headphones though
the mud mic itself that comes in at 50
dollars retail USD and that comes with a
mute switch though you can get the
option there without the mute switch
which comes in at 43 dollars you'll also
notice that I did a test on this why
splitter as well this is the antlion
audio USB jack there which splits off
into a mic in and and audio out and I
thought the audio out sounded really
damn good on this thing the mic-n did
introduce a bit of noise suppression
there which was a little bit noticeable
in the test though it was still very
clear and it is a good option if you're
on an old motherboard for example with
really bad audio or if you want to plug
it into the ps4 or some device with USB
and you want to suddenly get audio into
that device so we'll keep this very
simple though in closing if you do have
a pair of headphones that you really
like and you want to keep them and you
want to turn it into a gaming headset
and it doesn't have a 3.5 millimeter
input jack there then I'd recommend
going with the mod mic 4.0 though if you
already have an awesome pair of
headphones with a 3.5 millimeter inlet
and you want to turn those headphones
into a gaming headset then I'd go with
the V motive boom Pro and also one thing
to point out is that the v-moda boot Pro
doesn't have a pop filter on it as well
actually had to put that on line to make
it sound as good as it was if I didn't
have it on there there'd be a lot more
pop and peas going through it so anyway
that's about it for me today guys if you
enjoyed this review and comparison to be
sure to hit that like button and if you
have any questions or comments about
either of these mics and be sure to drop
a comment in the comment section below
and I'll get back to you as soon as I
can
peace out for now bye dear clear of the
lavalier if you have no fear what do you
call a v-moda crossed with an ant Lin
mod mic you just call it an ant motor</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
