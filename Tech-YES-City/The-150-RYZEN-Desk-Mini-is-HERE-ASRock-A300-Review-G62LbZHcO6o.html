mini for the intel side of things I said
to myself in that review I would love to
see an AMD solution because it's kind of
like a MOBA right if you guys have
played MOBA games when they drop a new
hero and then everyone wants to play
that new hero that's what the desk mini
is is that new hero everyone just wants
to play him the Intel one unfortunately
is like that hero that you know it's
kind of been out for a long time people
like me don't really know what's new
about this thing but regardless we've
got the new hero here on the desk it
supports the Verizon 520 400 G and 2200
G as well supporting some of the normal
rising CPUs if you wish to use it as an
afk standalone machine regardless today
we're going to be taking a look at this
150 dollar unit you can currently get it
on Newegg they do ship worldwide because
in Australia I can't find it up the sale
anywhere I think as ROC haven't
distributed in these strange channels
but at this price you get something that
weighs in at nine hundred and forty
grams bare-bones if you add a CPU cooler
which we're gonna try today add this
stealth cooler on there because it's
gonna have much better cooling
performance then the included cooler I
think this is like the GE dual core
cooler which they do include in the box
but it's performance on a four core
eight threaded Rison 2400 G sort of a
little bit worried about that but it
does have two slots of so-dimm memory
support so you can't use usual desktop
memory on this you have to use the
laptop stuff because of the small form
factor which measures it in 154 mill by
155 mill by 80 mill depth so it is a
very small unit comes in smaller than my
hand at the back it's also got the
option to vase and mount it to a monitor
or vase amounted to a wall if you wish
to that accessory isn't included in this
unit you can buy it for 8 bucks which is
very cheap you can also get a USB
extension USB to extension which is
another eight dollars so there goes
build these little extensions that sort
of add to the cost but it'll give you
two extra USB 2's at the front the
speaking of the front yeah USB type-c
USB type 3.1 as well as your onboard
audio out and mic jacks in at the front
and your power button at the rear you
get DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 1.4 and a VGA
out - as well as a USB 3.1 type-a and a
real tech 1000 megabits per second
dick
so there's the install it's super quick
super easy it takes little to no time
put the CPU in put the RAM in and put
your Anthony Drive in and you're good to
go but in this case we did have a little
bit of trouble getting the Wraith
stealth in I did have to bend this up a
little bit and then it inserted and
hopefully this fan doesn't cause any
issues being so close to the mesh here
I'm hoping it's not since the edges of
the fan are a little bit taller than the
actual blade itself but other things to
speak about before we get into the BIOS
is there are two sided ports included as
well side of three you can raid these
over raid 0 and raid 1 we've also got
two nvme drives one at the front but
also one of the back and you will have
to pull the motherboard off the tray to
access this but on that let's jump into
the boss see how well we can tune this
thing and then try and run some games on
it so we're in the UEFI BIOS it looks
like any other azeroth BIOS except it is
missing two features which I actually do
use regularly and that's internet flash
and also the fantastic tuning software
but it's not to worry you can still
customize your fan speeds manually if
you wish to and you can also update your
boss just by a USB downloading from the
website but some really good things is
that you can manually control the clock
speeds and you can also overclock your
ddr4 memory which on the Rison AP use
does make a big difference but since we
are using so dim memory I think we just
might and try and go for like a 29 33
megahertz at CL 16 or something like
that just to get things boosted and
smooth but of course since we don't have
good so dim in there I think you can
still get really good so dim it's just I
don't have any good stuff on hand and
since it is sort of like a budget
orientated option I am gonna go for that
sweet spot overclock as for the CPU
speeds we're gonna leave that on auto
for now simply because we're using 120
watt brick which I don't want to
overclock too high and of course it's a
little motherboard super little but that
aside let's get into some games and see
how this thing performs
so the benchmarking is all finished and
what a very impressive little unit we
got 1080p apex legends on lower settings
but it still got 56 average FPS 48
minimum so very well controlled and the
problem is I had to use fraps this time
because apparently right as I started
benchmarking this thing from about 15
hours ago there was this bug where River
tuna just fails to open anymore so I
don't even know what's going on there so
use fraps minimums were okay apex
Legends was fine at 1080p but that's a
big difference compared to the Intel
variant which couldn't even play 30fps
at 720p so there's that night and day
difference between the AMD version the
APU and the Intel HD graphics so the 5
strikes scores will show this too with a
graphics score of 3000 and a physics
score there's going pretty much near
10000 so nothing's being hampered by
this motherboard except my own so dim
memory which unfortunately could only go
up to 2600 six megahertz even though
you're able to get it much higher with
the limits being pretty much
unrestrained with of 1.2 and 1.3 5 volt
choice in the BIOS so you will want to
get some better sodium memory if you are
enthusiastic about getting the most
performance out of the 2400 G or even
the 2200 G but in this case it still
gave us a smooth experience dota 2 was
getting over 60 FPS on 1080p 100% screen
resolution medium settings so that did
really well so I was very impressed with
this unit when it came to its gaming
performance moving on with some other
tests like 4k video playback of course
that was smooth we just tested with
YouTube this time because last time I
tested with Netflix in the Intel review
if you haven't seen that put that up
here already Netflix decided that it
wouldn't
stream on as the internet at 4k so this
thing will handle 4k video streaming
absolutely fine though do keep in mind
you are limited to a HDMI 1.4 out as
opposed to HTML 2.0 out so that you
won't get 60 FPS at 4k but I think the
AP you could handle that so if there's
any feedback for asrock I would like to
see them improve on the hdmi 2.0 upgrade
with this particular unit in the next
iteration but in terms of the vrm
temperatures and also the APU
temperatures themselves with this cooler
on it just managed to fit as we said
before but the temperatures were well
control we got the node temperatures up
to 93 degrees in a 26 degree ambient
environment and the CPU went up to 58
degrees from the 10 sensor itself T in
10 10 10 10 10 10 pin pin and the
thermal-imaging camera showed that the
ventilation with the mesh side in front
was allowing the unit to breathe itself
using up about 85 watts United 64 on the
stress test and then 25 watts idle
roughly and then we went to a heaven
benchmark was using around 70 watts so
pretty good temperatures considering the
wattage is going to 85 watts so I was
very impressed with this unit
instability and eventually heat and
going through some more rounds of tests
here USB 3 speed transfers on my
kingston SSD drive was showing over 300
megabytes so they're absolutely fine as
well as the internet speeds on the
realtek that was getting over 100
megabytes per second copy transfers and
then the last test were the onboard
audio now here's where things get a
little bit tricky the onboard audio out
is decent
I mean below 10 Hertz we only got an 8
decibel roll-off after that it was
actually a pretty smooth line but the
mic input itself was showing some
serious worries so basically don't use
the mic import for any serious audio
recording because the 30 decibels and
the plus 100 volume was just showing
like really inconsistencies and then
switching between it was jumping so I
mean it is a sort of cheaper solution
for the mic input and that's
understandable it's a desk mini and the
audio out is good too so there was no
problems really with the crossover as
well to crosstalk and you guys there it
is for the desk mini a 300 from asrock
the 2400 G
is just going hard in this thing the
memory speeds they're able to go higher
but unfortunately I've got the two same
ddr4 mismatched RAM sticks that I used
in the Intel variant which if you
haven't seen that yet I'll put the link
up here for it unfortunately the team
group memory they sent out one of the
sticks was faulty so I couldn't use that
for this review and you don't want to
use single-channel when you when you're
using an APU because you'll just have
lower speeds and real worse performance
you do want to use dual channel and you
do want to get those memory speeds as
high as possible so if you're really
enthusiastic about this you can raise
the voltage in the BIOS from 1.2 volts
1.35 volt on the memory side of things
and if you do get some really good
sodimm kits with XMP profiles or whatnot
then you should be able to get even
better performance than I showed in the
video here today but as it stands for
150 bucks this thing has checked every
box that I'd want it to it's a real
solid little unit besides that mic
import but again it's a hundred and
fifty dollars and I'm sure pretty much
anyone out there is not gonna really
worry about the mic import you got the
HDMI out too for the audio if you're
already a purist you can use I think
HDMI to optical out extractor as well if
you're that concerned about it but other
than that everything checks out I hope
you guys enjoyed the review for the
risin a300 desk mini if you did be sure
to hit that like button also let us know
in the comments section below what you
think of it are you in the market for
one or what would you do with one of
these as there is another youtube I
think ETA prime who has tested this with
emulation and it does check out really
well so it's good for using for
emulation if you wish to use it for that
and yet just checks out in general I'm
really impressed with this unit and yeah
there's also not much to say as well as
one thing there is the m dot 2 nvme you
have to use a PCIe m2 you can't use a
sada m2 otherwise it won't boot so do
keep that in mind the two PCIe nvme s
ones on the front ones on the back of
the unit they only support PCIe nvme so
one thing to look out for but other than
that this unit is rock-solid from asrock
or should I say as rock-solid and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon
and that's about it guys I'll catch you
