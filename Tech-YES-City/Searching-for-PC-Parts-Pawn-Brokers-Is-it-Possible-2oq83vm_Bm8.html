coming out of Vegas but before I leave
Vegas we're gonna go around and check
out some different kind of porn brokers
and local stores to see if they have any
deals on PC puss because since I've been
here I've only really checked Facebook
Marketplace I've also used some of my
friends phones to check offer up and I
haven't seen a whole lot going on now I
also do have to apologize I did say I
was gonna check out Texas but I got into
CES and I was just super sick got sick
during that event it was tough doing it
and then I came off that event late so
coupled with the fact that I then I got
challenged by Christopher Yi we then
recorded that video and my suitcase is
just super packed it's above the limit
for traveling on local domestic flight
so there's just a lot of crap I
apologize for that guys next time I come
to the states I'll be sure to do Texas
for you guys but today we're gonna go
check out a place called super porn see
if they've done any deals and if they
don't here we'll go roll around a few
other places check out if they've got
any deals so let's go hit this place up
and see what they've got
so we just got out of that super porn
place and it was an absolute blast they
did have a few like Lenovo all-in-one
PCs they had some other stuff I think I
saw a PC from banging something else for
like a thousand dollars I was like no
way that's just not happening cuz a
thousand us in my country Australia it's
a lot more expensive like that'll set
you back around $1,300 you dollars you
can pick up a really good rig for that
price so this place wasn't really
cracking I mean they did have some
decent prices on TVs so if you're in the
market to get I can use 32 inch TV or
something it look like they had a decent
deal there but we're gonna go jump in
the rental car now and see what else is
cracking around Vegas
so without this place called a Sean's
big buy and sell except the problem is
it doesn't even exist so I think Google
Maps might have to update their services
because maybe it turned into something
else like a finance center that buys
gold so unfortunately that's a bust
we're gonna keep touring around and see
if we can find some more prone brokers
that hopefully have those deals
so I've just rocked up to the next Super
porn and this one's apparently got a 4.2
star rating the last one we went to it
had just over 2 stars so we're gonna see
if my theory is correct if they're rated
higher than they might have a better
opportunity you can see all these
different super pawns around the area so
let's go and check out if this one's a
bust or if this 4.2 star rating is
something we can go by
so I just got out of Super porn and that
theory of the star rating was put
straight to rest that was an absolute
bust they had like a little novo think
center on the on the paper but it just
wasn't there and even then they're
asking 160 or something for it so I'm
not sure if you can barter at these
places but if I end up finding something
decent and some of the other ones then I
might throw down and off a bit it's not
looking good so far but let's say a tour
around see if we can find something
this
so just much as a DFO when I got some
Calvin Klein Jeans for seven bucks and
also a pair of Puma shoes for twenty
bucks like that's where the deals are
out is that the DFO in Las Vegas anyway
guys it's time to go hit California Los
Angeles because that's where we're gonna
get a flight back home in a few days but
I'm gonna definitely check out some pawn
shops and see what's cracking over in CA
so I just checked into this hotel and
there was this crazy storm going from
Vegas to Los Angeles and it's pretty
late now someone's gotta crash out and
in the morning before everything opens
I'm just gonna lay out a little plan to
all these different porn stores I can go
to see if we get some deals in LA so now
the next day and there's like some
flooding going on in California but
that's not gonna stop us from checking
out a few porn stores here so we've got
popular porn which looks like it's in
the vicinity and there's also another
one down here called
Trading Post pawnshop so we're gonna go
hit these up now and see if they're any
good then if they're a boss we'll go hit
up a few more but I think in Vegas
Christopher year you actually found a
Lenovo PC for under 200 bucks where you
got a monitor thrown in so like it can
be done and I'm hopefully hoping that we
can find something today
so I just finished up with that pawnshop
and it was actually really good I got
some insight I was talking to the guys I
was like hey do you know any areas
around here where people sell desktop
PCs and they were telling me apparently
all the pawnshop says is trend on
through where they don't want to take a
desktop computers anymore because
apparently people don't want to buy them
so they're all taking laptops and
all-in-ones pretty much and I was like
damn really I think I did not know about
this trend gaming PC's I think for me
you need a desktop you'd want to get a
desktop because those laptops you just
can't really change anything in them and
all-in-ones is the same kind of thing so
they directed me now to a place called
Valley pawnshop which is just around the
corner so we're gonna head here and
check out what they've got because
apparently they're a bit of a bigger
pawn shop but in terms of what they had
they just had yeah again laptops in an
all-in-one PC for half a grand and I was
just like Nath's is not there's no ver
the value here so now let's check out
Valley see what they've got
so I just got out of that last place and
they didn't have any tech it was the
same thing like laptops and all in ones
but I did find these the Fidelia el twos
and I'm a big fan of the El ones I asked
them how much they wanted for him
they said 100 bucks and I said look I'll
give you $90 so they took $90 cash and
so that was really good so these are
pretty much brand-new like I can't see
any signs of them being worn so they're
190 bucks brand-new on Amazon so that
was kind of like a deal but now gonna
head up north to near Sacramento go see
an old friend
so hopefully while we're up there we can
check out some pawn shops see if they've
got any kind of tech on display
to find your local Sleep Number store
so now the next day and editing out the
Christopher ye vs. tech yes three
hundred dollar budget bill challenge you
guys are not gonna want to miss this
it's gonna be a huge video 25 minutes
long look at how long that renders gonna
take it's already gonna be like pretty
bad an hour in total okay guys I'm gonna
go check around a couple more places in
the u port area today this is the last
stop before I head back to Australia and
we'll have a hopefully enough statistics
after this to tell you guys what the
verdict is
with these brokers in the u.s. so I went
to the local porn store which is really
close but they were just a jewelry store
so that was a complete bust and now
we've just wound up at a goodwill and I
went inside there and there was just not
even one piece of tech at all sometimes
I believe like in 2016 I did find an old
PC for like ten dollars but it smelled
really bad but I was back in 2016 so
maybe in goodwill stores you can find
some bargains just this one here I
didn't manage to find anything
whatsoever but there is one more hope
guys we've got a super porn nearby it's
got a 4.7 star review so apparently it's
really good
that's about ten miles away so we're
gonna head there now and see what
they've got
so I just finished up at the Huntington
super pawn and it was like all the other
places they had no desktop pcs they had
laptops but I found this this is a wrap
for the hurry
it's actually a really good joystick and
I got this for 40 bucks they want a 55 I
just said would you take 40 cash and
they said yes the buttons feel really
good so something like this does cost a
lot of money brand new so I was happy
with this pickup it's pretty funny so
far I mean I haven't picked up any PC
bargains but I've got all these other
cool things I mean one last go will
check out a goodwill guys as one close
by to this pawn shop and then we'll
report back
so I'm just here now at Newport Beach
and it's beautiful here I'm catching the
sunset this is my last day in America
and it's just been a great time I mean I
did get sick and I'm sorry to you guys
in Texas once again I was meant to go
there but just didn't get enough time
see yes and all that stuff but
essentially checked out another couple
of places and there's just an absolute
blast they didn't have anything around
there especially with enthusiast tech
and if it was funny I got some really
good deals on other things like that
wrap for at the end and also some jeans
and those Fidelio l/2 so if you want to
go hunting it brokers then you can
definitely get some good deals on other
things that are non enthusiast tech
related if maybe if you're into a laptop
or an all-in-one PC then you can get
other things as well but what I found
here is that your time spend if you're
an enthusiast tech is much better spent
just going on Facebook marketplace or
offer up where you can get what you're
looking for even if you're not looking
for something particular you can get
much more enthusiast tech products right
then and there
so I wasted a lot of time of these
places and I didn't even find anything
worthwhile that I'd even buy except for
a PC that was massively overpriced in
Vegas but oh guys that's gonna do it for
today if you enjoyed this video then you
