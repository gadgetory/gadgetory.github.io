all around the world today we have a
triple monitor surround setup that we're
doing in my opinion for a really good
price we picked up these three monitors
here on a deal just over a hundred US
dollars we got this gtx 1070 TI for just
over two hundred US dollars and now
we're mixing in a be 350 amp pro 4
motherboard which is Rison 2000 series
ready and we've also got a risin v 2600
as well as a Corsair h-60 water cooler
120 ml this will do an absolutely fine
job of cooling this six core 12 threaded
CPUs then from memory since memory is so
important we've got some 32 hundred
megahertz XMP vengeance Pro RGB memory
so not only we're gonna have the
performance but we're also gonna have
the bling then we got a one terabyte
hard drive for backup and also a 240 gig
MP 400 MB ma SSD drive from Corsair -
and then for the case we got the spec oh
five this is one of course says sort of
budget options but it still promises to
give out a good aesthetic so with all
that aside let's build this thing and
then play some World of Warcraft on it
and here we are with the triple surround
setup it is looking beautiful especially
on a budget and then we're copying over
World of Warcraft game files at the
moment we're also gonna test out destiny
2 and see how that performs there was a
little bit of a problem trying to boot
this PC up but it's another story for
another day I guess it's just one of
those really rare things that happens
that I guess no one's really gonna come
into I've also got the mark to set up
the dark core and the mousepad the mm
1000 and the HS 70 wireless headsets so
got all the peripherals ready to go the
swag is there but before we get these
games running I do want to get the most
performance out of it since we are using
the water cooler on the CPU and the
memory is 300 megahertz XMP profiles and
we're just in the boss now and
overclocking this CPU to 4.1 gigahertz
it's really easy all you have to do is
hit enter and then go to manual and then
type in 4100 and we'll give it about 1.3
9 volt that should be pretty good and
then also in this same tab you can
change the XMP profiles or at least turn
them on and we should have 30 200
megahertz memory ready to go so just in
three little tabs we can extract so much
more performance out of this PC and we
just finished the stress test on the
overclocked 4.1 gigahertz is absolutely
fine on this motherboard and the
temperatures are actually really good
with the h-60 so we're getting just a
little over 60 degrees which is again
perfectly fine for a risin 520 600 so we
managed to overclock the graphics card
and here we've got about 144 megahertz
on the core and about an extra 464
makeups on the memory so it's time to
jump into those games
so now here's the triple display and we
just finished playing World of Warcraft
on this thing and it was a really
incredible experience I was surprised
even in the massive battles which at the
start of this expansion you can get into
these huge battles with so many NPC's
everywhere the frame rates didn't really
drop that bad I mean they're still
hovering between 50 and 70 this is kind
of the worst case scenario in this game
we had the settings on max graphical
settings on this triple surround display
and a lot of times we're getting 120 FPS
and the graphics card still had room to
breathe so the 1070 Ti is definitely
suited for something like this and
especially if you can pick up one for
cheap it's a really good buy I was just
surprised at how much fun playing World
of Warcraft was on this triple monitor
setup
and now we just finished up playing
destiny - and this was a really good
experience just like World of Warcraft
except for one thing and that is when
you didn't have vsync turned on the game
exhibited a lot of artifacting and then
when we turned vsync on it fixed it
completely and it was irrelevant of
whether the graphics card was
overclocked at stock settings we have
been under clock the grabbes card and it
was still prevalent so this is a weird
setting with destiny - maybe it's just
this configuration I'm not too sure but
if you're gonna play destiny - then you
maybe have to have vsync on if you wish
to use the three monitors surround
so we just finished up with the last of
the games here and this was project cars
- and it ran really well was so smooth
it was locked at 60fps but because these
monitors are 60 Hertz monitors the
experience was so exciting I mean you
can see things on the left and the right
that you otherwise normally couldn't if
you're on a normal 1080p single monitor
even 1440p or 4k so the surround display
does give you a little bit extra than
what you used to but of course the two
monitors on the outer sides do kind of
morph out the closer you get to the
outsides of the monitors I believe
they're kind of like half a monitor sort
of thing in terms of their grab setup so
if you want to get a surround setup you
will need about two times a graphical
processing power but it will be worth it
it is a very immersive experience
especially for your peripheral vision of
course these monitors here they do have
bezels on them so you could get some
monitors with very thin bezels or even
frameless monitors and they would look
even better but for me personally it
didn't bother me it was just such an
enjoyable experience especially when
you're paying 150 Aussie dollars for
three of these monitors right here so
here we are now a conclusion time with
the triple surround setup and you're
probably thinking isn't worth it and you
probably tell by the smile on my face
it's a big yes especially for these used
monitors here we got these for around
108 dollars us a pop and then moving
through some of the other components
like the Rison v 2600 that's currently
going for around one hundred and
sixty-five dollars and again we coupled
that with a water cooler like the h-60
you're going to get great overclocks
as well as keeping things quiet and cool
at the same time really digging those
six cores and twelve threads the B 350
from asrock that did an absolutely fine
job as well had no problems whatsoever
when it came to getting things up and
running
there's our board itself comes in
currently at 87 dollars - so it's
definitely not going to break the bank
at all the Corsair Vengeance Pro memory
looks good performs well comes in at
around a hundred and eighty dollars that
is a little bit expensive for ddr4
memory but as you guys already know ddr4
memory currently is very expensive and
like this for quite a while now and now
moving on with some of the other
components we had the CX 650 from
Corsair a kind of budget option for a
650 watt power supply coming in at $62
currently and the good thing about it is
it's got all black cables as well so
it'll add to the aesthetic of the build
but also have ample power available
especially on the 12 volt line and the
1070 I in the risin five six core even
when they'll both overclocked met no
problems for this power supply
whatsoever for the SSD we're using the
MP 300 which is currently coming in at
67 dollars off Amazon for the 240
gigabyte solution which is absolutely
fine for a boot drive and even loading
up those most played games that you
constantly load up all the time and even
then we've got the backup one terabyte
storage from Toshiba coming in at $45
doing a fine job for the money as well
then lastly with the aesthetics we're
looking at the Corsair spec o-5 it's $50
comes with a red LED fan of the front
transparent side panel building in this
thing was a breeze I had not one problem
everything was so easy to do except
maybe the eight pin CPU power cable I
did have to pre route that before I
installed the motherboard so if you are
doing a similar build in a spec of 5
then do route your CPU 8 pin before you
put in the motherboard that'll save a
lot of hassle if you want clean cable
management but as for peripherals these
are very subjective things we've got
claw grip as palm grippers fingertip
grippers it all depends what you are
when it comes to a mouse even when it
comes to headphones
do you like treble do you like mids or
do you like a nice dark and warm sound
if you like a warmed set of cans then
the HS 70s are definitely going to give
you an immersive experience I really
enjoyed what these were about the Mach 2
keyboard of course the strafe that's a
very solid option as well giving you the
media keys included then last up that
dark core mouse being the palm grip is
style Mouse I do like using a bigger
palm grippers Mouse when it comes to
world of warcraft but when it comes to
FPS for example I like using a fingertip
and when it comes to editing videos
personally I use a fingertip as grip
mouse and we guys that about wraps up
the triple surround setup all the links
to all the pots I used in today's build
will be in the description below even
though you probably want
got to pick up these same monitors for
the price but you can get some thin
bezel monitors which will even be better
than these for not too much extra and of
course the 1070 TI brand new is actually
come down in price too so check out the
links and if you enjoyed this one - be
sure to hit that like button and let us
know in the comments section below have
you played World of Warcraft before if
so have you played it on a triple
surround monitor setup if so what was
your experience like if not do you want
to get on it and why love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in the next one pretty soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
