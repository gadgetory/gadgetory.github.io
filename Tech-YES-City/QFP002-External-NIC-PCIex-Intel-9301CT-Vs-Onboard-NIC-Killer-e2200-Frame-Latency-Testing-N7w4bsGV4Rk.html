Barone's coming back to you guys today
with episode 2 of quest for perfection
and last week you guys would love in the
series I was getting a lot of positive
responses from you guys thank you a lot
I'm loving it too I'm doing all this
research I'm finding out which is better
for what and it's really fun so I'm
doing frame latency testing with this
stuff and this week we're coming back
with a PCI Express ni C from Intel the
CT 9301 and we're going to be putting
that against MSI motherboards killer NAC
so this is the onboard lan control from
msi now it's a new generation from msi
they're putting out these killer NoCs so
i want to find out how good they
actually are and also want to find out
how good the Intel is so I put these
together I've also also one more thing
is I'm going to test it with them
without the software because I want to
find out if it makes a difference also a
few people wanted to find out if it
makes a difference to now I'm going to
be testing this across three different
games the first two games which are
black ops 2 and here is a new earth
these two will be done at 120 Hertz and
the third game will be Neverwinter which
would be done at 60 Hertz because some
rod reason it doesn't support 120 Hertz
or does but it's buggy so these three
games all load GPU settings and shadows
off this puts a least amount of strain
on the CPU and GPU because I want to
find out if there is a difference
between the NSCs I want to find out
where it is and this will definitely
help show it so the let's get on with
the results anyway so I'll show you guys
the results now and I hope you enjoy so
the first part is the speed test and
last week when I did the speed test I
was like I was really impressed with the
rout of us no rather I got a 0
millisecond pang I was just like yeah it
doesn't get much better than this baby
89 1:04 megabits per second 70 megabits
upload but then I did the speed test
with the Intel and I see and my
god 171 megabits per second this was
just insane when I saw this pop up on my
screen I was like oh my god god damn
this thing delivers so this Intel and IC
delivers on its promise of its speeds it
is a fast and IC so kudos there to Intel
now another thing to note is if you guys
are thinking no but that's just a speed
test you won't get that in real-world
conditions have a look at this
learning Counter Strike global Offensive
the next day look at those megabytes per
second that's megabytes not megabits 22
point 4 megabytes per second so if you
were to put that into megabits per
second probably like 180 so these speeds
are legit and the Intel does the liver
so that's a win for Intel there but
let's move on to the excel results okay
so let's look at the results that we got
in Excel now this is if you guys are fi
that these graphs don't be this is frame
Lancie testing where I'm pretty much
using a program called fraps and I'm
doing in this time in this term around
I'm doing 82nd runs basically what I'm
doing is recording every single frame
and then I'm getting an average for
those frames and then I'm putting that
average against every individual frame
and any frames that deviate from the
mean will stand out in the graphs
basically what that means is that it
could be if it's if the difference is
too much and it stands out say above 20
milliseconds it's considered a slight
mic rest honor anything above 50
milliseconds is generally considered a
noticeable micro stutter yeah let's get
onto the results here we had the killer
this is black ops 2 120 Hertz and the
killer with no software on performed
really well I mean there was no
noticeable micro stuttering here so
kudos to the killer with no software did
really well the worst frame was 12
milliseconds I believe which is an
impressive result moving on to the
killer West software I must admit that I
did notice these two little deviations
here they were noticeable when I was
playing black ops 2 ever so slightly so
but nonetheless it was a pretty decent
result all around with this software on
I thought the no software off produced a
better result than having the software
on if it's anything to go by and the
worst frame was 13 milliseconds and that
happened two times so interesting to
note there so these these two graphs
almost look identical but they're not so
anyway let's move on to the Intel now so
the Intel performed really well in my
opinion it produced a solid result I did
not notice any of this micro stuttering
here and even though even though it did
produce a 13 millisecond frame the other
frames were relatively scarce there
wasn't many of
deviating from the mean so I actually
did not notice that when I was doing the
test the other results here is you can
see here there are these the frames that
deviate from the mean in with the no
software on and the Intel there's scarce
so better we leave this win to both no
software and the Intel I'm going to say
probably the software on probably lost
this just ever so slightly and again
please keep in mind that this is online
games there is just variants it's I
can't you know ascertain my results and
say conclusive evidence when it's online
games because there's just variants
involved so yeah that's something to
keep in mind but what I will look for is
inconsistencies so let's move on now to
heroes and us 120 Hertz this time the
killer with no software did pretty
impressive I thought that this there was
some times where it did have these
little micro stutters this time here I
did notice this one in test number three
I didn't remember noticing that one the
other test though I didn't really notice
the the other spikes that went up to 18
and I mean again this is just an
absolutely amazing result none of the
frames here are going the whole time I'm
playing this even on the frame latency
spectrum with no software on it didn't
go below 60 frames per second like with
the worst frame lenses the killer was
software on the worst frame here this
did go up to 42 milliseconds so this I
did notice this one as well I did put it
on when I was playing the game I did
notice this it was a slight micro
stutter and I noticed it and I was like
hmm
okay I'm going to look at the test
results and yeah this did pop up so that
was probably a loss for the software
versus the no software in here as a new
earth as well so the rest of the
experience though was pretty smooth and
the antenna and I see it performs solid
it was just a solid performer as you see
here there was no real you know big
stutters sticking out so it was it did
really well as well so I'd say the
victory here again goes to killer with
no software and the Intel ni C let's
move on to the last test this is
Neverwinter and now I could only do this
test at 60 frames per second when I
tried to put on 120 Hertz even though
it's supposedly supported the feature it
just didn't work it went back to 60
frames per second so something that
never went to have to fix or video with
their drivers either one but nonetheless
they thought it'd be good for the unit
60 Hertz gamers out there to have a look
at how this game performs with the
killer and the NAC and the Intel and I
see so the no software from killer did
produce this time around did produce the
worst frame at 42 milliseconds so that
was the worst out of the whole group I
think I think also the software on
bridges 242 as well so it was a tie
there but now interestingly enough the
software on this is where things get
really interesting with Neverwinter as
you guys know the killer n IC software
is supposed to prioritize the gaming
packets and now interestingly enough
with Neverwinter is when you're playing
the game at downloads patch files and it
patches the game while you're playing
and so I noticed when the software was
on with the killer the patch files were
downloading very slowly and this is why
it produced this smoother result I
believe because it was just downloading
this patch file slowly it was actually
working so I will give kudos to a killer
and say that their software legitimately
works so if you're the casual gamer who
just downloads a lot of stuff and plays
games and you want to you know still
have a good ping then leave this
software on and definitely never went to
Knights have proved that it works
I'm sorry Neverwinter as I never went to
Knights but yeah the Intel ni C and last
we move on to the Intel and I see it
produced an amazing result it was again
a solid performer none of the frames
were going over 40 milliseconds which
was impressive and the rest of the
frames are pretty tight so it did
produce a good result I will say in this
case I thought the software on possibly
won this test would never winter due to
its shooter the software actually
working so let's move on to the
conclusion now okay so in conclusion
basically yeah if you're a gamer and
you've got the killer and I see you do
not have to go out and buy an Intel and
I see it really isn't worth the money
there wasn't much of a difference I mean
this is online games it was there wasn't
you know none of the killer and I see
and with deer software off against the
Intel and I see there was no there was
no standout differ
says I couldn't really pinpoint and say
which one was better I will say that the
software on in 120 Hertz games I thought
it did a little bit worse than the
software off so if you guys are
wondering turn the software off if
you're not downloading anything while
you're playing games turn the software
off that's the that's my recommendation
with the killer if if you are the type
of person who downloads stuff while
you're playing games then this software
does legitimately work so we'll say that
so it's up to you guys the choice is
yours the software's there I will say
though lastly in regards to the N I see
it does have the legit one gigabit
throughput speed it was an amazing
experience when I got that 170 megabytes
per second download did you see that me
downloading counter-strike go that
twenty two point six megabytes per
second freaking hell so the Intel NAC
definitely delivers in terms of its
bandwidth and throughput speeds I think
the killer Odyssey does as well but has
a problem where it only negotiates at
100 megabits per second on my computer
I've tried to get it to a gigabit but it
doesn't do it the Intel and I see
definitely delivers on its speeds the
millisecond response times was zero on
both and I will say though lastly with
the NAC for what it's worth I will say
when I was playing black ops 2 it felt
like when I was on the Intel LOC it felt
like every single bullet I was firing
was registering when I had you know when
I play with the especially with the z77
extreme for the Broadcom it felt like
sometimes the bullets were missing and
with the killer and I see it felt like
once in a while a bullet would miss I'll
be like I'm shooting this guy won't
never what that bullet miss that's the
kind of a with United with the Intel and
I see I did not get that experience once
so for what it's worth I will say if
you're a hardcore FPS guy a really
competitive then go out and buy a net I
see that's if you're a PC like top of
the line player it might make it it
might make that difference in
competition but you guys probably review
our competitive FPS player you probably
already have an external PCI Express MSE
so anyway all in all the killer and IC
from MSI is an amazing onboard LAN
controller I will give it a thumbs up I
will give the Intel and I see a thumbs
up as well
they both work and they both work
extremely well sorry guys I hope you
enjoyed this please give it a thumbs up
if you did and if you haven't already
subscribed attack your city and next
week I will be back with the sound card
I'm going to comparing a PCI Express
sound come from a Zeus and I'll be
pitting that against the onboard Realtek
ALC 11:50 so stay tuned for that I'm
going to be doing a number of tests
going to be doing FPS tests frame
latency tests I'm going to also be doing
my own ears I'm going to put these
things on my ears to you guys with my
ATH Pro let's pull these up here and put
these on these are awesome headphones
let me tell you guys which in my opinion
sounds better across a variety of music
genres and a variety of games I'll tell
you which was is the overall winner and
also that's about it if you guys want to
see the review of the Intel and I see
I'll put it in the description below
guys that's about it peace out for now
if you have any comments or questions
please put it please blue comment the
conversation below anyway peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
