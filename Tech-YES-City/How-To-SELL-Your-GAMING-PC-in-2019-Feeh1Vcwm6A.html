I've been getting asked
is why isn't my gaming PC selling?
And that could be a few
things, for starters,
if your PCs are looking
anything like these two,
then you're probably not going
to get much interest at all
but today we are going to go through
a checklist of things you wanna be doing
if you're trying to sell a gaming PC,
and if you're having these troubles
what you can then do after that,
but first thing's first, if
your PCs are in this state,
let's talk about what you can do
to get 'em out of this state.
(upbeat music)
So firstly, only the table
here, I've got the DataVac
that just blows a crap
ton of air on this PC,
it's gonna get all the
dust that's really built up
just out of that whole case,
and then after that we've got
our Calvin Klein underwear,
and also our multi-purpose spray
just to give it a quick clean down.
This is if you're lazy,
and you don't have time to clean PCs,
this method is going to
be so quick and efficient
but at the same time,
it's also gonna give a
really good look shine.
Now there are some other
things you can do but,
of course, we're gonna
quickly do the once over
and just show you how quickly
we can make this dirty PC come up,
in just a matter of minutes.
(upbeat music)
So we've quickly cleaned it over
and it looks so much
better than it did before,
but the case didn't come with
a side panel when I got it,
and also I strongly
recommend changing the memory
from two single channel
mode to dual channel mode,
which I don't know why the person
had it in the previous configuration,
but another thing as well is,
I wouldn't actually sell this
PC, personally, in this state,
I would then take off this CPU cooler,
clean it up a little bit more,
change over the thermal paste on the CPU,
and also, for this
graphics card right here,
take the cooler off and also change
the thermal paste on
that just to make sure,
because when I sell a PC,
I want the person to be
having a good experience.
Another thing I noticed
too down the bottom here,
cable management's a little bit rough,
so I'm going to actually
clean that up as well
so these are the three
next things I would do
just to add that little bit
of extra care to a build.
(upbeat music)
So now usually with this
I would use alcohol wipes
to clean off the thermal paste,
but I actually ran out of alcohol wipes
so I've gotta go to the store
to go get some more later,
but in the mean time Calvin Klein,
he's come to save the
day, so have no fear, ey?
(relaxing music)
So right now, we've cleaned up the GPU,
or some people know it here
on the channel as the Gravis card,
and we've changed thermal paste on that,
we've changed the
thermal paste on the CPU,
changed the RAM back into dual channel,
but there's still one more thing to do,
and while the GPU's out we can quickly
manage these cables and make
'em look a little bit neater,
and then see our final product
if we were to then put this up for sale.
(relaxing music)
So now we just finished taking photos
and generally you wanna
take at least three shots,
obviously the more expensive the PC gets,
the more photos you'll want to include
as people tend to start
care more and more,
the more money they're forking out.
And now this PC, I still
don't know what exactly
I'm gonna do just yet,
because there is kind of an imbalance
between the case itself,
I think the case isn't that good at all,
there's no real cable management options,
but some of the other
parts are really nice.
We've got a new-new 1TB hard drive,
1060 6GB, i5-4690, 16GB of RAM,
but we also have a
mediocre power supply here,
so case and power supply, really mediocre,
and so what I was thinking is, maybe,
and the motherboard as
well seems pretty mediocre,
so we should probably take out the RAM,
put an i3 in, leave the same cooler on,
put a lower end GPU in,
switch the hard drive
for a 500GB hard drive,
and then we'd have
something like a low end,
entry level system, and
people wouldn't care so much
with the looks of this particular build.
Do remember one thing, guys,
and that is in the past I've done a graph
where I've showed the correlation
between price and also looks of a build,
they should go hand in hand,
that is the more you're asking for a PC,
the better it should look as well.
But not only just perform,
but also the aesthetics
should go to match that price point.
Next up here we've got a
different kind of scenario,
this was a bang up trade in,
and we can see here a lot of people
nowadays have this conception of,
okay just get one of these
OEMs, whack a graphics card in,
and you're gonna have a
great gaming experience,
and, sure, that can work,
that can definitely work if you want
the best price-performance,
for instance, you get a used 1050 Ti,
but there is a problem
with some of these OEMs
and that simply the graphics
cards won't work at all
because there's no option in the BIOS
to disable secure boot, enable
CSM, and things like that,
so some of these motherboards
are completely useless
for anything other than office PC,
but what we've got right
here is an ugly HP system,
and seriously if you tried to,
even if you got an OEM working
with a 1050 Ti, for example,
and you put it up for sale like this
I'm pretty sure not many
people would want to buy it.
So what I'm gonna do now is test it out
with a GTX 1050 Ti,
see if it does boot up,
if it doesn't then pretty
much what we're gonna do
is take the CPU out
since it is an i7-2600,
we've already taken the RAM out,
we did get a 1TB hard drive,
and then we're gonna whack an i3 in
and then indeed try and
see this as an office PC.
(relaxing music)
So now we've just established
that this board is one of those boards
that won't accept any decent
graphics card for gaming,
and since it did have an i7-2600 in it,
we've pulled that out, put an i3 in,
we can also burn up two 2GB sticks of RAM,
just to have something
that really can only do
like office work, like Excel,
or something like that,
or just watch some basic YouTube videos.
So we're gonna put a 250GB hard drive in,
sell this for real cheap,
like even under 100 Aussie dollars,
which would be like 70 USD,
and someone could use a computer for this
so I'm gonna clean it all up right now
and just sort of work
with what we've got here,
but at the same time,
another good thing about this
sort of whole configuration is
this motherboard has definitely got
a Windows license activated for it,
so instead of letting that go to waste
we can actually utilize that
so someone can save some money,
and I can get some money
back on this build.
(relaxing music)
So now here we have, we got two PCs,
that have been cleaned up,
they look really good in the photos,
they present nicely, I mean,
considering we're working
with what we've got here,
and also on top of that we've changed
the thermal paste around on both the CPUs,
in the case of this mid-range rig here,
we've changed the thermal
paste on the GPU also.
So we're making sure that
the PCs not only look good,
but they have the performance
and the consistency to match those photos.
So even though this is an office PC,
still take care of it,
still make it look good,
and basically, when it comes
to selling a gaming PC,
presentation is everything.
But now it's just time to
sit down with you guys,
face to face, have a bit of real talk,
and there's some other
factors that may be going on
as to why you're not
selling your gaming PC.
If presentation's good, then
you've also got the photos,
you've also got the specs,
and the price point right,
what else can you do to
try and get that sale?
Here's where I offer things
like a three month guarantee
on my systems, for instance,
if you've got a three month
guarantee on your system,
and the other seller doesn't,
I think the buyer is more
inclined to go with you
because there's that
risk of not getting hosed
that is suddenly gone away when you offer
that three month guarantee,
if that makes any sense,
so definitely offering that in
your ads can spice things up,
of course, you may have to replace
some faulty parts as
time goes on, but again,
that's a good thing if
you wanna keep doing this
because good word of mouth will spread.
Oh, hey, this guy actually repairs
his PCs that he sells,
if there is a problem.
Of course, you will get people that will
take advantage of that,
and I have had people that
have had software problems,
it has got nothing to
do with what I'm doing,
and they've corrupted the Windows,
or they've done something,
installed a virus,
and they're like oh, this
computer isn't working properly,
I'm like, look, I don't really cover that.
Basically, there's always gonna be
the bad that comes with the good,
my advice would just be
to cop it on the chin,
and keep on hustling.
But now you've tried everything I've done
up until this point and you
still can't sell your gaming PC,
what can you do?
Well there's some other things
like replying to people's
emails and messages
straight away because we are living
in the day and age of 2019,
where people couldn't live
without their smartphones,
and so with that people have
sort of come into this field
where they demand instantaneous responses,
instantaneous replies, I
mean I'm a sucker for it,
like with some of my
ex-girlfriends in the past,
if they didn't reply to
messages for like two hours
I'd start getting
insecure, and being like,
hey, why didn't you reply,
why didn't you reply?
But then you realize, hey,
back in like the 1980s
people didn't even have
phones or anything,
like I talk to my parents
and they're like, yeah,
we'd sometimes go
without days for talking.
Basically, now in 2019,
there's this element
that never existed in the past,
and if you wanna be on top of your game
then you have to change to the trends,
and I guess one of the trends
going through with this
is that people expect quick responses,
and if you get that done
then that's another element
that can help you sell your gaming PC.
But now if you're already doing that
and you still can't sell your gaming PC,
then what are some other things
you can now do as a final resort?
And that is simply look
at what the competitors
are selling in your area,
see what is selling,
are LEDs in craze, is RGB in craze,
is over the top in craze?
Because different areas are gonna have
different sort of cultures and demands,
that relate to those cultures
so I know where I'm at
in South East Queensland
there is a big demand for PCs
that look really bling bling,
that is they've got LEDs in them,
they've also got the front RGB fans,
people just like that, and
they like the look of that,
they want that on their desk,
especially opposed to something
like a boring HP machine,
especially the older OEM ones
that just don't have anything
but just an ugly looking case.
So if you do wanna step up your bling game
then I'll put some
links in the description
below for some $1 LED strips,
even something like this
with a Molex connector
is super easy to install,
you just put the LED strip down
and then plug in the Molex
connector into the power supply
and you've now got LED
bling inside your PC.
Coupled with a clear side panel,
that is definitely gonna help out,
you may wish to go get
some LED fans as well
and people laugh at LEDs, but man,
as we said countless times here
on the channel LEDs do sell PCs.
Though lastly, there is one more thing
to talk about with you guys,
and that is just simply the market itself
and market conditions.
Now I'd say where I live
in South East Queensland,
it's easily a buyer's
market at the moment,
there's so many sellers trying to sell
gaming PCs left, right, and center,
but also coupled with the fact that
in South East Queensland itself,
where I'm at, at the moment,
there's also a downturn
in the economy here
and that is that I've been
speaking to people locally
who run businesses and they're telling me
that trades are being laid off,
and so when a lot of jobs are going from
full-time to part-time, or
people are being laid off,
that's also money that's
circulating the economy
that no longer is circulating
in the economy anymore,
so with that, that's
the discretionary income
that people have to buy a
gaming PC is no longer there,
so you're gonna find it
a tougher market to sell
and so with that things are
gonna get more competitive,
people are gonna drop their prices,
and so under these conditions
it can get very difficult
to sell your gaming PC.
So that is the last thing,
sometimes you go through recessions,
and boom/bust cycles in economies,
and these relate directly to
how your PC will sell on the market.
Anyway, guys, in closing off this video
I will say be consistent if
you wanna sell gaming PCs.
Have consistently good photos,
have consistent performance,
and also have consistent service
in how you respond to
people's emails and messages,
and also help them out
with aftercare service.
