7700 K in the dead heat of the Navi
salma at 5.1 gigahertz let's find out
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
look at asrock small form-factor
solution for the z 270 lineup this is
the Z 270 gaming ITX fatality
motherboard and as we all know that
gamertag tends to get thrown around a
lot it is almost in every product though
does this motherboard really have all
the necessities that a gamer would want
well in my opinion yes
the vrm features Texas Instruments next
step MOSFETs which are rated at 40 amps
at 125 degrees the chokes features gross
premium 60 amp solution and the
capacitors are 12 K solid-state
japanese-made which makes up an eight
phase-- power delivery the six phases
being dedicated for the CPU power
delivery itself though although not
boasting as many phases as from other
boards out there it is still performing
really well especially when stressing my
7700 KS 5.1 gigahertz which was the max
performance I could get out of this CPU
even when testing it with full-size ATX
boards that I have here that are much
more expensive though with that said the
vrm heating was only hovering in the
warm to touch region of just over 40
degrees Celsius and furthermore all this
was done in the sweltering heat of a
noisy summer which on this particular
day was over 30 degrees so sporting the
ability to overclock any Cabul eight CPU
to its max potential on air and water is
a really solid feat for a board this
small so the goodness doesn't end here
there is an nvme m2 PCIe port on the
back of the board which provided native
support and also allows the speeds well
in excess of what you could expect on
side of three there's also a USB three
front out one USB 2 front out HD audio
out six out of three ports and one Sadr
Express connector and 3/4 pin fan
headers and one additional three pin fan
header for a total of four fan headers
with one of those being able to provide
18 watts of dedicated power to a water
pump as for memory there are only two
DIMM slots which have support for up to
4,000 megahertz overclock I managed to
have no problems whatsoever locking in
XMP Pro volt at free
with my 5.1 gig it's over block on the
CPU and also managed to hit a custom
profile of dropping down the timings of
one tier 2600 megahertz though I will
point out there was an odd compatibility
issue I had with some kingston memory
and more particularly the 7700 k the cpu
would work fine with some corsair memory
initial installed and after a BIOS
update the kingston memory would then
work with my g 4560 pentium though still
wouldn't work with the 7700 K after the
BIOS update the course their memory have
a work fine on both bias reiteration
though since this compatibility issue
did occur on a retail bar it is
something to be mindful of looking at
the river board there is a dual band
PCIe wireless with the signal strength
being very strong with the included
receiver plugged in I had no problems
achieving really fast download speeds
there were only a little bit behind my
fixed connection just above that there
is a clear CMOS button which is so easy
for resetting bad over coffee at any
time and below that there are six USB 3
connections left on the bolt connector
DisplayPort and HDMI out an optical
audio in supporting 7.1 surround sound a
PSP port and 5.1 analog surround sound
support plus a separate mic and line in
and lastly an rj45 connections supported
by an Intel I to one 9 v neck the audio
itself is a very strong point of this
board with having support for creative
Sound Blaster cinema 3 software and also
featuring the realtek ALC 12:20 codec a
dedicated tetris instrument headphone
amplifier and also nichkhun capacitors
gave this board very low crosstalk and
also when testing for bass rollover or
bass roll-off
there was almost none which was great to
see especially all the way as low as 20
Hertz which out is can't really hear
based below those frequencies anyhow
besides getting that boom boom bass
going on it wasn't just the audio out
that was strong on this motherboard the
mic import was also very impressive
sporting some very low noise figures
that I'll let you guys have a listen for
yourself so here's what ABI motor boom
pro microphone will sound like plug
directly into the mic input on the
asrock fatality Z 270 Mini ITX
motherboard with a volume level of 60
and a microphone boost of 10 DB so there
are these guys when people off
and function over cosmetics as where I
clearly listen this is quite simply the
best mini ITX board I have reviewed
hands down as rock have gone to the true
heart of the formula that I consider at
the asrock formula and that is to cover
all bases from what I would want from a
board personally that is a solid vrm
amazing onboard audio and a solid
onboard neck there is even a really good
included dual band wireless the boot
with a receiver that works really well
the board is also very sturdy featuring
a nice thick glass fabricated PCB those
the only downside to a mini ITX chipset
is that it only has two slots for ddr4
memory so besides that if you want to
make an extremely solid mobile gaming
machine then this is the motherboard
that passes all the tests with flying
colors and at 168 us it is a little
pricey though it does have all the bells
and whistles
one would want from a mini ITX
motherboard even has that still armor
plating on the PCIe connection which it
do a pretty good job I just left the
motherboard sitting on the card itself
no support and it was doing fine so it
doesn't have any RGB lighting so you can
add that in yourselves if you want to
also if you're in Australia I don't know
when or if this product will be hitting
the shelves down here and if you liked
this review then be sure to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comment section below what would you
want out of the Mini ITX motherboard for
me personally this thing hits all the
boxes though do you want RGB lighting on
I mean if you want that just drop it in
there and do your thing and get a jiggy
with it and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
