something odd something that I noticed
when switching from the RX 480 to the
GTX 970 amounted to a difference
the Nvidia graphics card didn't look as
good at the exact same settings as they
did on the AMD card so what exactly was
this graphical dilemma let's find out
welcome back to Tokyo senators Brian
coming to you guys today with an odd
sort of video that just came to my
attention when I was doing my recent
review of the RX 480
as you probably already know I am a big
visual whore I'll scrutinize any minor
thing or major thing when it comes to
either a monitor or a graphics card
review whether it be things like input
lag or even cross hatching or stuttering
no detail is spared from a TYC review so
how does this all betaine to doom well
when I had my rx 480 in the test bed at
1440p on high settings I noticed that
the game looked well visually pleasing
though when I immediately switched to
the GTX 970 I noticed that I thought
something looked different in other
words the GTX 970 s visuals looked
inferior to the RX 480 and I double
checked this was at the exact same
settings so I then started testing
things side-by-side and at first I was
kind of surprised I thought I was going
mad or even insane because with
standalone frames versus standalone
frames they looked identical though it
wasn't until I did some further testing
that I finally found a difference and
after loading up the game several times
I found that I could actually pinpoint
what the difference was and there's good
news or bad news as you would call it
was that this was replicable and that
there was a visual quality difference
and it did especially differentiate when
the levels were first loading as you can
see the Nvidia card did indeed look
worse for seconds at a time when
textures were loading and whatnot I even
further tested this at 1080p with the
GTX 780 which is of a different
architectures of the GTX 970
not to mention the vram limit still had
some breathing room at 1080p this in my
opinion is an undesirable effect and
this is finally when my subjective
thinking caught up with my objective
results things did indeed look better on
the AMD card at least four seconds at a
time when moving into a new level or a
new scene so there you have it it wasn't
all in my head and there have been
rumors floating around the different
games with AMD verse Nvidia cards do
exhibit similar behavior though what
exact games this pertains to I'm not
exactly sure I just noticed this
difference in doom when I was testing
things for you and I could actually give
you some objective results or proof as
you would call it and people are
probably also wondering will this
the gtx 1070 and also the gtx 1080 well
actually don't have either of these
cards I did have one on backorder for
over two weeks which I subsequently
cancelled because it was overpriced and
it was just taking too long so I will
once I do get those cards in I will test
them for you and let you guys know
though in the meantime I would assume
yes this would affect Pascal since it
was affecting both Maxwell and Kepler
and Pascal will use similar algorithms
in their drivers I'm sure of that so
it's kind of a bit of a sad day for
NVIDIA users especially when you get to
a different game and you may be getting
a visually inferior experience to what
you would get on an AMD card anyway let
me know what you guys think I also did
test this on two different motherboards
separate motherboards here so I've got
this on my dual CPU rig and also my x99
rig and the differences were showing up
on both motherboards as well so it
didn't pertain to a power supply a
motherboard or different Ram or whatnot
it was the graphics cards themselves
anyway let me know what you think in the
comment section below
have you noticed anything fishy or
anything different between two cards
that you have at your own house or what
not be sure to include some links or
post some videos in the comments and
I'll be sure to look at them and if you
haven't already hit that like button
actually no I was going to say pump it
there before you head out don't forget
to slam that like button and if you
haven't really subscribed because the
truth the lies and all the in-between
will be exposed on this channel from a
yes man from a tech city and I'll catch
you in another text videos very soon
he's up a now bye oh
new I want baby's name
it's between both yards for energy tea
has so many a matter to do this is my
first time doing a script and it's I
I need a teleprompter ASAP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
