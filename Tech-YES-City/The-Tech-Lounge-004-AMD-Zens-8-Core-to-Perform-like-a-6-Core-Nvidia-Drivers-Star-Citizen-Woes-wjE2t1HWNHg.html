episode 4 of the tech lounge i'm joined
by cab showdown will say it again how
you don't give hit show it out um you
guys still going crazy i'm joined here
by brian city um Kevin now this era
name's been real good for um let's show
actually jump into oh let's talk about
your um yep clothing okay so okay
quickly Luke lets got the new shirts
true third shirt bang the shops up their
tech city so shop spreadshirt com / tech
city go yourself true hurt truth hurts
shirt you can even get your your
girlfriend wanna if you want or you can
get whatever so there's shirts up there
go grab one but we got this pc are built
here as I'll sound before so the audio
should sound really good now and we've
got this pc 51 50 watt power supply 7970
fork or a gigabytes of ram is going to
kick ass i'm going to put call of duty
infinite war for infinite warfare on
there because the games $32 now how what
I'm going to do with infinite warfare
right is I'm technically I'm going to
fly over to Europe by by the game and
activate it and then fly back to
Australia what okay that that's for the
record okay uh yeah yeah so that's how
you say you get it for 30 to distrain
dollars which would be like 20-something
USD I mean that's dirt cheap for a title
that's just been released incredible
yeah so you know that yeah have you been
doing anything the last week ah yeah
just one of them is under NDA so I sorta
have to keep it to myself till tomorrow
but yeah if you're subscribed to my
channel you'll see it drop tomorrow
morning but yet so just been doing that
and checking out a few other things
trying to get through the 1050 and 1050
TI videos so i'll be doing a showdown
with them very shortly as well and quite
impressed so far they were there pretty
good for I Nvidia's really stepped up
nicely with their entry-level GPUs this
time around I'm actually pretty
impressed 10 50 to 70 ti yeah I mean
yeah
they were going to come in hard when we
saw the 1060 at 200 ray you got the 10
6203 gigabyte edition you you knew that
they were coming in are the terms within
the 1050 GI I mean that went without
saying especially you know I saw the RX
460 performance and it wasn't that good
you know like we're comparing that to a
70 TI and people out there apparent 29
50s as well it's kind of like this thing
should be handily beating both those
cards but really it was really strange
it was such a drop down because the 470
was so good in terms of value for money
of your audience like the 47 he's just
superb so yeah that was quite
interesting but I should we talk about
Zen then so yes it wasn't long but first
up we were aimed ease n sub at reg
processes now this is the funny thing
okay so we've got here when they did the
blender test they'll compare it to it
I'm pretty sure as a 6900 ka was the
eighth call from internal right yeah now
we've got here the rumors that are
coming in 250 to 300 us now this angle
is going to have performance similar to
us 6850 k which is a six hundred dollars
if you now me personally I by the 28th
pcie lens this over 6,800 k here I've
got the you know 5820 k their the six
cores that matter right there the six
cores that are coming in right 400
whatever yeah and they perform just like
a 6850 k2 right you're only buying the
extra pcie lanes so who in their right
mind is going to start comparing it to a
higher priced CPU that really not a lot
of people are buying you know that's
what I don't like straight away from the
gate guys like let's compare this to a
four-hundred-dollar CPU ok so MDR
releasing a three-hundred-dollar cpu
with two more cause that's going to
perform similar to a six core from the
competitor that's a hundred more dolls
that's what we're looking at now
realistically let's cut the crap out of
the news here and you know that's is
that realistic sure they can be
releasing the CP or three hundred
dollars but what I don't like is that
it's got a Coors vs 6 on the Intel if
it's performing similar doesn't that
tell you the IPC is going to be maybe
twenty five percent less if it I don't
know right so would ya yes it's quite
bizarre this because that a picture they
have underneath that says in a core 16
thread and then beside of a core 60
three broad well II which is the 6900 k
yeah so I don't know why the top of the
article is the 6850 k that's a 6-core
that's all me immediately I know why
they think a lot of viewers are dumb
that's why but not not the audience in
tech city they're not dumb these guys
know their stuff men like it's funny
because a lot of the guys in the
audience you know sometimes man they
pulled me up on things and I'm like eh I
got to look knowledgeable here folks but
now I mean it's it's yeah you're
completely right and if we look back to
AA has Willie like what you were saying
um yeah it's I mean the 6900 k is
effectively a 59 60 X isn't it with you
with the course disabled it's pretty
much the it's very similar so 60 out 50
x year 69-58 yeah 69 yeah yeah and so so
yeah I think it'll be quite interesting
but I always worry about this from AMD
because a lot of times they're marketing
and they're overhyping it's really
misleading and they and then when people
actually get it to test they will have
performance I'm not doubting that Zen
will be a high-performing cpu I'm pretty
sure it will what I've seen on paper
would lead you to believe that but I
just worry about them saying you know
it's going to waste save 6900 k yeah
half the price or something I mean
that's a tall order to deliver on so
yeah it'll be interesting but I thought
what what also as interesting as the
little sort of spec sheet you guys can
see there is if you look aim d Raven
Ridge which will be on the Zen
architecture as well if you go down the
GPU architecture on it I'm guessing this
is going to be a very high-end apu since
it only goes up to four course is Vega
so that will be very interesting also so
yeah quite cool and also that they're
saying it might be running hbm memory
that'll be what its supports so could be
very interesting there on the APU side
of things could be hotting up in the
future too
yeah ap use I've they're getting okay I
mean there have been always okay but you
know there's still wears that yes isn't
there never comparable like to a
discrete cpu and GPU yeah that's still
kicking its ass you know what I mean so
yeah I'm not me I have to see it to
believe it on AP use but the Zen
especially on the cpu line in the aim
for motherboards we have to see
something we have to otherwise AMD are
done like pretty much yeah exactly
exactly and I mean they got a good from
a marketing perspective because they can
say what they're saying already is
around forty percent IPC gains on Zen
compared to excavator which is pretty
good from a marketing perspective it's
because the excavator is so old now but
I'm you know still 28-nanometer but for
Intel's perspective with kb lake I mean
as people are saying it's about a
one-percent IPC so I think from a
marketing perspective they'll be able to
exploit that but we'll have to see in
the real world how well it does and a
lot of people are very very interested
because if this does good framed even
it's going to really hammer Intel in a
market that they've almost had a
monopoly and yeah but when I see
performance equivalent to I 768 50k it's
kind of like I I get worried because you
know yeah sure it's gonna be 30 dolls
but this is gonna be their flagship
right they don't have any more than
eight calls coming out on a in fall like
this for enthusiasts it's overclockable
so it's like you know they're gonna need
a 12-core to compete with Intel's 8 I
you know I'm sort of why wasn't there it
is extinct or coming out or is that just
for I think that was just for lulz vampa
service oh you know yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah cuz I thought eight core would be
the I mean they've been they've been on
about eight cores for a long time now
going back to ya bulldozer was a core as
well so um yeah if it would seem maybe
backwards to a lot of people for them to
go down from that so make nothing is is
it you know is it possible this will
come out of 300 us and I think now that
I'm look
right if the performance is on our when
the 6850 k then yeah I think it will be
coming out 300 us if the performance is
on par with a 6900 k then you can expect
to pay more for this thing so that's all
that's yeah that's that's it it's it's a
bizarre thing as well because it doesn't
they never said how they were at least I
can't remember if they did when they
were showing the comparison was that
single threaded or was that multi it was
multi-threaded it's still low compared
our 6900 k that's thing you had eight
years a state cause like and you hadn't
roughly the same clock speed so it was
really lean good yes it was really
looking good but now we're kind of
getting these articles out and I'm kind
of I'm worried you know I'm like okay
because it was only a blended test ride
we didn't see any other tests we didn't
see ya you know especially the cinebench
which I'm really looking forward to
because that's just like raw you know
grunts yeah yeah no to be interesting in
the single threat of performance as well
because that's what will count for a lot
of people up there you multi-threaded is
fine and you know it's good especially
if people were using it for productivity
stuff which there will be probably a
market for especially if it's coming in
at that price point um you know people
that are looking for a good workhorse
type cpu but they don't really have the
budget to jump up to say something like
a 6900 k which is a very expensive cpu
yeah I think that'll be very very good
for those people out there with you it's
hard to say right now but i can say
personally that i'm very excited and i
hope it does well not because i'm being
an AMD fanboy but i just think intel
really needs the kick in the backside to
make them either drop prices or really
start to innovate and they need the
competition i think about would be very
good for all the consumers out there it
would be man it would be we need this
competition we need it soon otherwise
you know it's just like yeah i've been
i've always been then cell so lazy yeah
I've been a bit I've been cautious about
and this is like when I read these like
this again I just get more cautious so
aim DS n you guys let me know in the
comments what do you think do you think
it's going to be the best thing ever i'm
hoping it will be
you know like I'm optimistic about it
being the best thing ever but when I see
news like this I kind of get down
because you know i'm looking forward to
something new and i'm sure a lot of
other people are but that being said
electronic arts rolls out new disclosure
rules to extreme is in influences do you
want to take this one a week is you're
well-versed in this yes so basically
they're they're saying now this is
something i've talked about a lot in the
past with tech reviewers and game
reviewers being biased or being bored
out and something I've sort of rallied
against a lot but es you know doing
something really good so basically
what's there's going to be two types is
going to be supported by EA and
advertisement so if it's supported by EA
that means it covers all content that EA
has supported such as through
invitations to events or shows or
coverage or travel expenses here will
have no direct influence over the
creation of the content however so that
basically means that EA has taken a game
reviewer something brought them to a an
event they have tried out a game and
then they've put out a video about it
yep and so then they would have to say
right this supported by EA thing well I
don't like that one that one's my
favorite I like that one yeah yes that's
nice and it lets everybody know so
that's for any youtuber streamer active
influences as they sang and they will
now need to run that watermark at the
bottom of their video or whatever so
that's really good and then there's the
advertisement and that's for pretty much
they're just saying actual advertising
so content that EA could have editorial
influence over or content that EA itself
has created so that means people who
have been paid directly and have made a
video for them they will need to say
that it's an advertisement for EA or
even if I don't think they're being paid
but EA has some creative control over
the video that they're doing and
directly then they'll also need to say
it's an advertisement so I think this is
very good I think it
going to be good for a like game
reviewers have probably had it pretty
rough I mean I even saw sort of like
headlines about it here about them a lot
of people losing faith in them a lot of
them being extremely caught out by
halves I happen myself ma'am and I read
these game reviews it's like these
things the best in the world then you go
play this lady this is me do command it
shouldn't be getting the school is it
scary but i like i like the band
supported by EA sounds good second ones
basically you're getting that review but
it's really a showcase you know what i
mean like hey let's yeah showcase but
let's call it a review i mean so the
second one's kind of like yeah you know
do you even want to watch it kind of
thing so i mean the first one supported
by a okay these guys have you know here
I've given them a game or whatever and
you know they paid for a few things but
they're still gonna have their own
opinion which is good so I'll be looking
at the first one and being like i watch
content with the first hashtag the
second one of my just like we okay cool
I'll see you later yeah I mean again
yeah I think it's gonna be good for our
people and it will tie in well with what
um steam announced that we talked a
little bit about last week and that now
every game on steam going forward from I
can't remember when it will they'll
start to enforce it but they will not be
able to run like artwork and things like
that for their games pictures you know
when you're going on the store to look
at a game to buy you'll have to use
in-game screenshots only so that people
as I say it's called the no man's sky
effect that people will actually know
what the games about because a lot of
times it is confusing you don't actually
know what type of game it is because all
the pictures they have it just art works
at once which do look nice but people
need to know what type of game it is and
have screenshots so they can really
understand what they're buying so I
think that's really good from valve as
well yeah so I got asked in the comments
cabbie lake has been a release that's
been leaked on NCIX so I haven't heard
of that yet so yeah all right you want
to know my go and check it out I got
rolled by wccftech again
all like this thing you can't even close
this thing down like again I see you
can't even close it down like like what
the hell oh my god is it terrible like I
put on our block as well just for this
one because it is ridiculous I'm trying
to do a stream here I've got this
freaking add dislike pop and right up in
my face that you can't even close down
and a trickle down yeah we're just
scroll down and ignore yeah but it'll
keep running adverts layered which keeps
me so we'll close this tab off to wait
on the basic coffee late let's talk
about it another iteration that's coming
out on 40 nanometer like I thought
Intel's new strategy was like tic toc
toc or whatever it was but like now it
seems like they're changing it again
because coffee lake is 14 nanometer
again but this time around interestingly
enough we're going to get a six core 12
threaded cpu on their mainstream
motherboards apparently hmmm which
needed to happen a long time ago to be
honest yeah i think this being stuck on
oh no but that that would be in their
graph it's coffee like x so wouldn't
that be there enthusiast series not the
standard line nothing is coming out to
the standard line like I say any more
Intel mainstream chips without six calls
you know so februari 2018 so you know
the obviously the you know the other the
X line is going to get their their hash
of treatment probably 2019 you know who
knows when that's coming out because it
still get a really sky like X and you
know but uh yeah people are saying in
the comments i got this military ads
because of my haircut was good i like is
a high face i love ya it should be
really interesting and I'm very
surprised that they won't be dropping
down to seven nanometer which is what a
lot of people would be expecting so
hopefully they do because AMD will
reportedly be dropping down to seven
Anna me too
for their CPU release in 2019 yep so be
interesting to see it would be funny
actually that AMD would be a hit of
until even though Intel's been creaming
it for so long and they should be the
ones leading and AMD chasing so that
would be very bizarre situation if that
was to come to light but it could yeah
is this being one hundred percent
confirms because I don't know just rumor
mill man Superman yeah I like it's it's
it's remember stuff I guess I wish we
got we're wccftech ride you know so
we'll close that down they can keep
their military advertisement star
citizen is this now we're gonna go
straight into here like star citizen you
know no one wants to touch star citizen
especially devil advocates you know what
I mean no one like lately you talk about
oh don't talk about star citizen man is
the best thing ever known a man like no
one ever touches this topic star citizen
right all she ever hear is it's coming
it's coming it looks amazing the demos
look amazing and you know the demos do
look good okay some of the demos do look
good but they look like far from
finished right far from a finished
product I mean very far yeah you know
they've ever simply released this demo
where you know these guys would team
deathmatch in space or something it look
like a mix between a battlefield and cod
with you know massive amounts of
stuttering and I mean this is 100 and
like whatever 120 million dollars i mean
it's like when does when does someone
just start putting their foot down and
saying okay this is dragged on long
enough like when are you getting a
product like not an hour for or whatever
you know it's like I remember seeing
when starcraft 2 right we look at
Starcraft 2 for example that was in
alpha I remember seeing that an alpha
now that looked like a really polished
game even in alpha that was ages away
from release this was like ages before
release you had people testing the game
it looked amazing now yeah this is an
alpha it's not it's not even an alpha I
wouldn't even call it or they offer it
just it looks like it's whatever
you know point three of twenty percent
of our fillet it like I mean I'm not
gonna bash up it's like it's been so
long now yeah people have been waiting a
long time they just I mean it's a fungi
I have tried it it's it is quite good I
like the I definitely like the idea of
effy there's a lot of Appeal there but
how it's actually translating so far
into an actual game is sort of being a
little bit disappointing but we can hope
that they will turn around just it
should really be spit up heads this is a
very taking a very very long time well
you're longer the bottom line is this
the bottom line is this trajectory of
funds right they went up up up up up
like really fast to and then now they're
plateaued and now the trajectory of
funds is going down down so in other
words they better start releasing
something soon or they're going to go
out of business just by just yes on the
trajectory of funds right so you look at
business models right and they you know
they do this that these guys biz their
business models starting to go down now
so um you know yeah I mean I saw another
demo like this massive demo whether it
is going through like just you know
keeps going through this world and it's
really big and all that but it was a
bear world there was nothing in it and
then like the ownership and then like
they go drive a little bike and then
there's this like Star Wars ripoff
mission and I was just like old
facepalming i was like oh god no yeah i
mean i don't know it's times where i
mean i'm gonna start putting my foot
down because we talked about star
citizen i think i talked about with
joker like ages ago yeah and you know
like he's just when's it coming when's
this game common when's you know when
are we going to get a finished product
that's out there people can play and
people can start obviously spending
their money on buying skins or if
there's a monthly fee or whatnot because
you know these guys the trajectory of
funds is going down it's going to be
Boss tola soon if they don't make a
break like the time is coming now for
them to make a break so exactly yeah
they need they need to get it together
okay Jacob do you want to search you
want to search NCIX i777 hundred k do
you want to go search that quickly well
I'm just we talked about in video
quickly take away do you want to say
anything about star citizen there before
we go no that's all a but yeah okay you
don't want to touch on with you just
wanted a okay we're not going to touch
on star citizen and don't touch on that
your copy that a massive amounts of hate
but yeah we got here in video games
Nvidia and also the whole market the pc
market share we can talk about that 2016
200 over 200 billion dollars has gone
into pc hardware that is huge you know
consoles have got 90 billion and
arguably consoles have been doing a
terrific you know ps4 xbox one whatever
so PC hardware has a lot of money in it
now actual console to console is armed
you know it's doing a lot differently
like so you know you've got consoles
whatever they're selling for 400 bucks a
pop now the average person would be
spending a lot more on pcs per person
right it'd be like what you know is
people spend it like three or four
thousand on a pc right that's 10
consoles well that would be at that
tiring but yeah yeah most people I think
spend around yeah probably 1500 to 2000
Australian dish would be what your tip
median would be yeah yeah well saw mean
this is really good news but at the same
time it's like I'd still say console
gamers kind of maybe outnumber pc gamers
maybe yeah i would have been like so
just because you in especially in terms
of by Triple A titles and stuff like
that so it would be that the kids as
well I mean parents that want to buy a
game system for the kids and I'll just
buy that and it's much much easier I
mean they definitely still have their
place as much as pc enthusiasts like to
think they don't the reality is they
have a place for us it wouldn't be such
a huge market for them but I just
checked out this NCIX kb league yep cpu
leak and all it is basically is this
saying that the seven sevens yeah I
seven
777 700 okay yeah I'm got leaks and yeah
it's coming out with it makes cash four
point five gigahertz and they're saying
the price was 538 Canadian so 400 us and
that's basically it so and this thing is
going to be okay night no they didn't
say it base clock is 4.2 yeah that's
what I thought I mean dear so yeah I
guess what the okay so that's all it was
specially saying surprise was that
pretty much what I think a lot of us
were expecting any way I'll get in stock
I see someone put up a screenshot of
being in stock yeah you've got a hip got
it yeah yeah okay that's what I was just
looking at but that yeah but okay so
it's not in stock anymore no they said i
read that they pulled it down because
obviously it will still be under NDA
happily care so there's no there's no
actual like there's no actual like
product like no actual benchmarks and
stuff here is cinebench coronado okay
now okay guys you get if you're gonna
like keep spamming and in chat like
least make a huge news topic come on
unless so we're meeting something else
but I can't find anything else that were
on kamaka anyway back to GPU shipments
forty percent increase a nvidia pretty
much up like the thirty-nine percent
sorry thirty-nine percent EPMD shipments
are increased twenty percent too yeah
awesome right so everyone's doing better
here Intel's a I guess GPU would you'd
say there whatever their integrated I
GPUs yeah shipments were obtained person
so I mean everyone's doing better it's
really good news I lovely i love hearing
news like this everyone's grabbing a
piece of the pie yeah it's just because
there's the new GPUs out now and I
expect that it will jump even higher ah
with MZ when vaguer comes out when we
get the RX for 90 yeah I think it will
do another big jump and of course in and
video will get a big jump as well maybe
a huge amount with the 1080i because it
will only be the enthusiast buying it
but um it also get a little bit of a
jump anyways see ya I imagine because I
mean I think of me but a bunch of
everything right use GPUs are coming
down a lot nuts thanks to those two
hundred dollar gb is like GTX 1060 at
200 is really good value same with an RX
for 70 that ya can be a little bit
cheaper whatever those two cards are
really i think doing a lot of or bring
in a lot of people into pc gaming
because it's like okay time to build a
pc because you can get a GPU that
performs really well at 1080p like
extremely well and you know it's cheap
it's it's not going to break the bank so
I think those two GPUs in part would you
know doing really well so the value is
definitely there in pc gaming i'm really
impressed with what you know both those
companies are brought to the table with
the sog bees i think they think they're
actually really damn good yeah so that's
I guess that's another driving force is
that it is a really attractive market
too at the same time so yeah exactly i
mean it's really good right now for
pretty much if you're a person in the
market for a GPU to upgrade which let's
be honest that's the most important part
of any gaming pc because that's where
you're going to see if the biggest
difference in terms of performance right
now is really good for the mid-range
because you're pretty much all the
mid-range GPUs have come out you've got
the 480 and 474 AMD and you've got the
1060 a high sublime the 1050 TI probably
doesn't really count as much but you've
got the three gig in 6-10 60s yeah and
you might be able to get yourself cheap
1070 as well so it's really good for the
mid-range we're just now waiting on the
high ends because right now you've got
the 1080 basically up there I know you
could say the Titan XP but let's be
honest here the alienating saline high
end one and and that's where we that'll
be it would be interesting going forward
with vega obviously competing i very
much hope it blows the 1080 out of the
water because it would be very good and
then the 1080 TI as i predict will then
blowww figure out of the water so
that's probably what will be happening
going forward and that would be really
good and then you have the full range
then you'll have the entry-level 1050
1052 m 460 the mid-range 474 80 and the
1060 and then you have a good high high
range there 1070 1080 1080 TI and Vega
yeah which will be at least two GPUs the
people saying this is going to be one
are kidding themselves it would
definitely do it maybe it'll be two
definitely yeah 490 and a 4 90 x that's
the main thing you know we've won it
will be a slightly trimmed down version
that the 490 will probably be to go
against the tents M&amp;amp;E and then the for
90 x or whatever that'll be the 1080
killer which will most likely get killed
by the 1080 TI because they'll be
running the same GPU has the new Titan
yes yeah see that'll probably but
that'll be significantly expensive so
yeah it'll be interesting how this would
be really good and some people are
saying your fury too ah I mean I that
could be true but um yeah and people III
don't see Vega blowing the 1080 TI out
of the water I that would to go against
that Titan GPU would be very um yeah
that would they would need they would
need me they would need a new
architecture to be honest I don't think
any we don't yeah we're not gonna get
that at a gcn I don't think yeah its
carbon I do that yeah yeah exactly and I
mean they might do the Georgie hbu what
james edes done in the past so yeah sure
that's a great prediction i think that
there'll be a very real thing that'll be
to Vegas together on my pc be that will
probably see that do if you could be a
fury x 20 or whatever yeah that could be
a furious yes 02 yeah something like
that so um yeah but very interesting yet
it's probably what I'm I'm excited about
sin but I'm more excited for Vega just
because I think it's going to make the
GPU market if it does well really really
competitive and let it be great I'm
really excited for Vega because I gotta
say invidious drivers and especially the
GeForce experience and like telemetry
all this crap there
as their drivers are going to shit like
in video if you guys are watching this
please fix your fuckin drivers up make
shadowplay back to what it was get rid
of telemetry and i'll be happy you know
happy as larry man this it's stupid what
they're doing with these Dre is
disgusting right yeah like I I'm trying
i get a performance hit just for
clicking and just for having shadowplay
even ready to go like you know come on
well you guys get rid of this account
crap for geforce experience just make it
back to the old way it was I really
didn't like that I really didn't like
yeah now i'm recording i'll take a quick
snippet for a video I'm doing and no I
take a snippet I've got to wait like
five or six seconds for this stupid
message to come off and on you know
recording a do i click the freaking hot
key like you know i know i know i
recording there's the icon there telling
i'm recording as well like it's really
shake it sad face palm lights because
facepalm they did with the software like
okay just when you install in video
software just have it noob option person
who knows what he's doing option i'll
click on that one you know i'll click on
the burden knows what he'd do an option
and give it to me you know raw baby
known as the ulema tree crap none of all
these you know noob messages popping up
shop some people might like that but is
just i got a rant about it because it's
just it's pissing me off lately when
I've been producing content why not you
know yeah and it in AMD like I installed
these 7970 the other day and they've got
the options that minimalist install and
then they've got this software and the
minimalist install was so good it just
installs the driver which is really cool
like you know aim dear I'd say this day
it's true like people argue it I'd say
yeah and these drivers are starting to
get better than in videos which again it
blown me away it's like what because
once upon a time I remember once upon a
time AMD drivers were terrible yeah here
so it wonder-percent correct so it'll be
it'll be very interesting going forward
there and what ties in really nicely
with a us talking about drivers is sub 6
which they're saying that the direct x
11 hour versus direct x
well performance on nvidia is pretty
much identical um what's this admire e
yeah yeah we're gonna do that now oh
yeah we really had that are coming up
we'll do it now though since we're
talking about it yet yeah well I just
thought were talking about drivers and
that's exactly what it is like with that
Nvidia you know that it's not really
that good on a video but AMD on the
other hand you all see big bigger game
so we've got another word here sit sid
meier's yeah or Sydney is Sid Meier
Sydney Sydney is my eyes I think it was
I think you're rusty I said I think
you're my I just want to take a
different perspective most people don't
usually say they say 76 you know you
just say you wouldn't say the whole
thing Sydney aya yeah okay then we look
at Sid VI is a civilization 60 x 12 sts
well now they only test this on nvidia
cards at the moment apparently so got
the performance benchmarks yen and dry
you want to do a drumroll okay yay fuck
all of a difference okay so we got here
d x 12 verses dx11 and you know you've
got more the thing is you've got more
GPU utilization apparently with arm dx12
but you're not seeing you know you're
ninety-seven percent versus
seventy-three percent and you're not
getting any difference in results so
yeah like I mean this dx12 update is
kind of useless right yeah I mean
hopefully this will be addressed in the
future it is still early days so this
will probably be sorted further down the
road but I yes still quite shocking
early on and in general if we look sort
of back against that have come out AMD
has generally done quite a bit better in
regards to dressy x 12 then nvidia but a
lot of people also say that's the reason
that nvidia released such good directx11
drivers that there isn't such a huge
discrepancy where AMD maybe their
drivers on directx 11 are not as
optimized so I mean yeah it'll be
interesting
hey let's let's be honest lady x12 has
been crap so far we we haven't seen
anything realistically good out of it
yet I mean I'm burying you we've been
getting trickled out shit like that's
the bottom line with a x12 everyone's
IDs well Windows 10 you got update the
windows 10 I was the same I was on that
same boat all you gotta update that the
XP and Windows 10 to get dx12 looking at
it now it's just been a complete flop
well yeah I think it'll get better in
the future that I honestly I don't know
if it will man I mean I'm worried when
are we gonna when are we gonna see like
a game that's just built from the ground
up it's just a total kick ass on d s 12
and you made like ripped x11 so old
though I mean we can't see how nice
everyone goes to what volkan but it
works it's it's working just Elevens
watch yeah yeah that's better than the
Eckstein it's better than dx9 is got you
know less overhead than the x9 and you
working better and yeah dear 12 is just
don't turn out now dx12 taxon the GPU
more and you're getting the same frames
whoa so yeah I mean Vulcans definitely
are people with Andy graphics cards have
seen very good games yeah Vulcan Vulcan
is good Vulcan has been good especially
with doom that was impressive especially
not really i mean the gpus was good to
see a GPU side gain that was really cool
i really like that had also people with
the dual xeons man with all those
threads and really we're talking like
jeweled GTX 1080s could now really
utilize all those threads on Vulcan that
was impressive you know I saw one guy
with the did you know the jewelry that I
had he had 210 80s or something and it's
just you saw all those threads just
being utilized to kingdom come that was
a really cool thing bespeak yeah but we
were just jumped off drivers but do we
want to jump back on drivers right
apparently the video released a 737 5.86
and it was like leaking memory had that
was down clocking the memories like
severely and then they released another
driver recently which apparently fixes
it so oh yeah there's been a lot of
problems lately nvidia drivers if you
guys are running them you will notice
the amount of drivers coming out lately
it's been I should just go over the
edges
just go on the title mass like nvidia
drivers in turmoil we should just start
doing it so yeah it video disarray and
then you look look at the real news that
GPU shipments about forty percent
they're doing better than ever but ya
gotta do a new age sin and spin on this
a nvidia drivers in turmoil companies
about to go bankrupt yeah this is love
it it's far from the truth yeah yeah
it'll be fine it's just a little hiccup
they've had I mean but the having a lot
more lately used to be one of the
biggest things to do with and video that
people liked was how good the drivers
were on by comparison to empty but yeah
lately they've been dropping the ball
they hand on the heaven yeah we got here
we got here the Z 270 fatality
motherboard has been pictured have you
guys argument so it's got it's been
pictured it's got Joe and I see which is
pretty cool for a consumer motherboard
especially for the fatality as well on
the consumer grade motherboard and
that's really cool like as what I've
been doing some pretty solid things like
I like what they've been doing with
motherboards you know me personally I'm
working with them pretty closely as well
you know you've seen a few motherboard
reviews because like when when the x99
boards first came out I was having a lot
of problems on other x99 boards i tried
the asrock board freaking bang man hit
every point i hit every nail on the head
and I was like ever since then I've been
loving a lot of asrock boards they
haven't they haven't really let me down
like I've had the faulty one whatever
here are there they know that one that I
had in the States but I'd say that was
an open box from microcenter wasn't
really you know I can't really put pin
the blame on asrock for that one but um
you know yeah I really you know I've
really been liking what I've seen out of
asrock and this you know i'm looking
forward to their z 2 70 series even
though i'm not looking forward to cabby
lake yeah i mean it's it's going to be
interesting i see the rear I oh really
interested me that two Ethernet ports
that are we quite good as well you have
little happy yes it'll have you have one
yeah Jill wireless there because it's
got the two rings there so ya know this
looks quite interesting I think it'll be
all right I mean what you said about x99
was true for me as well I mean yeah and
when I read about a lot of people had
trouble on the x-plane I was like when
it first came out of his brutal man it
was brewed yeah and these were like I
tried the Ezra pause it was bliss it was
like oh this is the way it should be
right now I 5820 KS he's just running so
well everything works on-board audio is
really good too though something about
you know has rock when they get hit with
x99 the on-board audio was extremely
good Mike Mike into so yeah I'm Tibetan
yes on to some babies AMD raid on gpus
limit HDR color depth to 8-bit over HDMI
two so kind of kind of weird i think you
know who's sort of liked it i think
they're both think you know the people
who make the standard hdmi to or like no
it's not our problem we've got it in the
standard and then and he's like well we
can't do use it because and i think Andy
have i'm kind of believing AMD on this
part because they're ready allowing it
to go over displayport 1.2 and not so
you got 10 bit color depth over those
over displayport 1.2 and above but you
can't get it over hdmi to so something
going on here and looked exactly what
you know entirely sure what's going on
here what the problem is and why they
kind of get it over the hdmi to point I
standard that yeah so this is something
it's something software wise um
bandwidth wise hdmi 2.0 does as good as
displayport 1.2 so this definitely
something funny happening here um but
yeah i mean in terms of when these came
out hdmi to point i was very good and
AMD did take a long time to implement
this on their GPUs which upset a lot of
people that you know things like the
fury x didn't feature hdmi to point our
which at the time all the high-end
nvidia graphics card already did so yeah
not not the best but i think this will
be something that's addressed relatively
quickly through some sort of
software fix yeah it will not be a hard
for a problem I would very doubt it's a
hardware issue yeah I to do with hdmi to
point out yeah right on yeah all right
call the Judy go pick it up 32 docs been
in warfare I had that up there because I
was going to buy it I was going to use
it in that pc that I just built so this
is the yeah whatever sub 200 USD call of
duty infinite warfare pc that's going to
be hitting the channel i'll be testing
battlefield one on it to see how well
that Ron's I'll be testing a few other
games like csgo we're gonna hear a
little Julianna Sarge man he's getting
astroturf you know apparently WikiLeaks
yeah government control now WikiLeaks is
under government control Assange has not
even been seen for 30 days I only might
even be dead um you know like he I going
to say he had a huge influence over
those us elections ready like some
pretty damning stuff on Hillary like
knows you know um that was crazy right
so you know II this is a problem if this
is true there's truth to this then I
feel sorry for the guy I mean what the
hell he's just trying to do the right
thing by public and society and show us
what we're really being exposed to you
know mmm yes it's a scary world man
that's like an end Dave fuckin scary
world that we live in if this is you
know if this has got this is carrying
weight to it which it looks kind of like
it does you know it could although I be
very moving I don't know how he would
die in the embassy well barely Dallas a
viral hoax claims wikileak this is
another article but again that these
guys aren't really providing any proof
that this isn't oaks kind of thing like
you know this is just mm-hmm it's kind
of like you read the to the twig town
article it man it's more believable than
the other article i'll say that so yeah
this is actually pretty soon pretty damn
scary so apparently WikiLeaks is not
even under control by Julian Assange
anymore the rumor is is that CIA and
another department came in Boston yeah
which will give this up because they
were saying that the Democrats are
saying that that you know WikiLeaks was
leaking stuff stolen by the Russians
um it would be straight you know but
it's hard to say right now it's all just
rumors so I think it'd probably be
better if we wait till there's something
more concrete to go but this is I mean I
was leaking secrets pre-series is scary
touching like those see it's a freaking
scary dude like you read some of that
stuff man some of that dirt it's
terrible like I was watching this thing
I just I don't know why I popped up on
my youtube like she was a hillary was
like in court like demand it different
like they're like why did you let these
people who requested more security
detail for like years why did you not
give them more security and she's like
oh this started like literally just
started like deflecting so hard the
whole thing and they like look at this
you'd basically you're doing it you take
their just telling it straight up you're
doing a terrible job and yeah she's like
oh no no no I'm just put like just it
was just so bad like you know if you're
in the states you should be glad that
Hillary didn't get elected of anyone
that like goddamn and I think a lot of
feel felt like they didn't really get I
mean it's sort of like how a lot of my
Australian Prince says well that there's
not really really good choices out there
yeah um right now with just sort of the
downfall of democracy but the thing is
that anyone but her like the goddamn and
like anyone but her like just yeah okay
yeah we'll see we'll keep you guys
updated if there's something happens
with us but as of right now there's hey
this just went up 50 bucks just no way I
had this up before this this monitor was
at 350 before it was the og 27 inch 4k
monitor it was up like I failed as a
damn i wanted to say like if you guys
wanted to get a 4k monitor that's
absolutely kick ass it's got free sync
and what night it was like 350 bucks
before now it's gone up to 400 so it's
done yeah so do we want to I'll talk
quickly about just something I wouldn't
talk about the community but the if you
guys want to leave any questions for us
we can't start gathering some of those
up just anything to do with like GPU
CPUs anything maybe
also going to do any questions you have
to start shooting through to us guys and
we'll yeah I've seen but the but I just
wanted to say um to do with the
community I've made a whole video about
before we get on to that will quickly
plug these oh it was a giveaway giveaway
is over 10,000 entries Cavs gonna be
shaving his head in his beard is going
to go for the tech city look you know he
might even get some military ads popping
up on his browser soon and and then we
gotta i'll be doing a public unboxing no
ETA on that just yet but there'll be a
public unboxing coming soon a lot of
people requested a strip club but if I
did if I did that I'd have to ring up
and say look can I do this event and I
have to make the video over 80 litre it
afternoon bring cameras yeah actually
yeah true you can't bring cameras and
they go well of course I wouldn't know
but on that they get the a you know you
wouldn't be able to yeah yeah just eye
when you get in more trouble just do
something like a busy cafe or something
in a downtown tiberio something that
would probably be pretty good or or
Westfield or something okay yeah okay so
we got a boy everybody loved it in last
article d last article promised you guys
then we go to Q&amp;amp;A everybody loves
overwatch is somber do you want to talk
about sombra oh yeah forgot yeah I'm see
a summer is out if you guys play
overwatch you might have tried her she's
very complicated to play she runs a SMG
that's like an Uzi and so it's very high
rate of fire it's quite good she's a bit
of fun she takes a while to get used to
I don't know right now she's overpowered
or under palette honestly I think she
feels actually pretty balanced out of
the box which is quite impressive but um
yeah it's just a bit of it's a fun new
hero to try out so if you play overwatch
and you haven't tried her idea here we
go she is quite cool there's she's like
a hacker and you can stop people from
using abilities and stuff like that so
yes pretty some bro ok I haven't played
it yet i've just been busy making all
this content I'd love to let's see if I
do one see much of the mighty and what I
was going to say about the community was
some one of the saddest things I see a
lot of times then this will Brian will
be definitely
in here is it if you do anything that
people see as not like everyone has this
sort of idea of how a builds supposed to
be you're supposed to users cpu you're
supposed to use this type of thing and
honestly it seems like if you go
anywhere outside of that do anything you
were creative the community will just
pounce on you and say you know why would
you run that cpu why wouldn't you run
the i5 or something as the main one
everyone says you know anything like
that so I feel it's quite sad now that a
lot of tech youtubers feel like they
can't do very original or super
interesting builds for the fact that the
community oftentimes will so just
jumping what are we talking about here
like we're talking about old FX CPUs
because I haven't done a bill I well the
thing is I haven't done an FX build
because me personally I wouldn't do an
FX bill because even the older phenom
runway better you know like you know for
I remember testing a fork or lower
clocks and it was beating an AMD for
call this is like really recent and it's
like you know people like oh but that
were true for callers versus you know
new you know for cup it doesn't matter
right it's like damn AMD really with
that FX lineup it hasn't come fired all
right and so I guess it's his AMD builds
maybe because you know and that's I mean
people have I guess maybe people have a
valid point in that regard like I'm for
me I would always go the old-school
Zeon's they just kick ass like I'm yeah
because in man some people might go on
feel about it but not the odds Eli
haven't copped a lot of hail a if I call
paid for using old Zeon's then my the
boys in the comments will just go at
that person's like this is hands down
the best value in the common out yeah
yeah you just can't argue with an old
xeon especially like a 5670 or what not
like those on zealand to just kick ass
you know you got yet like someone in the
comments the 1100 t eats the 6300 dots
it smokes a man this is such an old cpu
and the FX 6300 like there that still
technically there later cpu out on the
market for a six cool so yeah i mean if
you're referring to just AMD builds it
with on the CP oh no I
general it is in general it seems like I
think they end with jumping on people a
few results are different in a benchmark
to someone else's or anything that I'll
say this person got this you're wrong
blah blah blah you know type thing so
yeah I just think in general it needs to
be less a sort of hive minded you know
you think for yourself and make your own
judgments about things so stop just
repeating what you've seen someone else
say really think for yourself when it
comes to tech and stuff like that do
your own research yeah so yeah we know
the website is coming as well we got a
new website at a whole new website tech
city TV it's coming we're getting a
revamp forums everything a really good
friend of mine he's just said look Brian
your websites and dire straits brother
you need it you need a makeover I just
said I couldn't agree more Bravo my
previous website was terrible so he's
done he's getting the forums up as well
he's going to get forums integrated into
this it's going to be the whole nine
yards you know it's going to be awesome
so yeah the new website will be up I
don't know the ETA maybe give it a week
two weeks but it will be coming so a new
website is coming so I got us out other
questions and we've also got the there
is something really cool coming to in
the channel as well I was speaking to
this Russian guy really cool guy he was
given with DLO on some pretty cool stuff
so there is going to be a very very
interesting build coming to the channel
I don't know how long it'll take but
it's going to be freaking cool yeah so
you it should blow it should open some
eyes should really open some eyes up
this thing is gonna be awesome I can't
wait down this build so I someone bought
a 12 31 p 3 yeah if two hundred nine
dollars goodbye that's that's you know
12 31 33 is an awesome see be human so
yes I now saying that 4770 is still a
great ship yeah it was that's what I ran
a 4770k for the longest time although
yet by comparison to the 47 90 k and
there was kenyan they temperature
difference when actually did the
showdown comparing the two of them
together
we did that 47 90k were an a hell of a
lot cooler yeah then the 4770k which was
a very hot running yes cpu Hall voided
that did that heat up horn also said is
it worth waiting for the GTX 980 TI or
the RX for 90 I would see if you're if
you're in the market for a really
high-end GPU right now I would say just
wait because you haven't got that long
to wait before either of those drop and
then you'll be able to make an informed
decision from then so if you're an
enthusiast you're going to spend a lot
of money on your next GPU you went want
really high anything yet wait around
well with the with the waiting thing
it's always the question of can you wait
right for me if I'm on I've got a decent
grab Scott at the moment yeah I could
wait for another year right but if
you're on like say you know HD graphics
for an instance and you want to play
those games maybe you're going at a 10-7
II you know yes stop stop hurting
yourself you know what i mean so it
depends if you're hurting yourself at
the moment and what you're on so that
that's what it all depends on so I
honestly I'd Wade out if you can wait
out of course it's always good to wait
out until the latest and greatest drops
because not only does that drop with its
you know whatever it's going to offer to
the table but it also brings down the
price of other cards more importantly so
that's exactly sort of be good for
everybody out there right now I think I
think it'll be worth it someone else to
said will Andy have a tone XP yes as I
said earlier I believe they will
probably bring out a jewel GPU based on
Vega and that will probably be what they
use to go against the Titans and get us
to 1070 the one tied next period
honestly just get one 1070 and then just
hold out for the 1080i and then get that
and then yeah so you take a minute yeah
and then you can tell you tell you 10 17
you'll just you know probably lose like
50 bucks on it so that was the biggest
mistake so many people made last time
they bought the time next and then the
980 TI came out and the ninth et I got
almost identical performance at about
the half the price yeah so i would
definitely wait
I would say that that will be a similar
affair with the 1080i you'll see very
similar performance to the time XP
however you will it'll be at a
significantly lower price point see if
that'll be interesting to you last in
the comments do Australians have pens
yeah got a pen got a screwdriver to okay
ah yeah not much else so if you guys
have any last questions for us you want
to just shoot them straw yeah sure there
you go sorry about the audio issues at
the start of the stream I'll cut that
out of the stream when it goes like to
archive but yeah won't happen again
though I don't know why I did that
automatically is like it automatically
changed it back to this realtek thing it
was like damn you know yeah what about
sin fall hat I will get that made up I
forgot about it this weekend look I've
been I've been on my game up and where
I'm wearing my t-shirts you know we're
wearing the t-shirts I've been giving
the judge our mug on cam every week the
tinfoil hat just has to come now i agree
i did a tinfoil hat for the whole stream
that's gonna be coming soon late okay
son year late ladyboy someone kids he's
asking the whole episode about ladyboys
I had a pretty cool experience I
wouldn't call cool i wouldn't call it
cool this was not not last time i went
to that guy the first time there the
first time I went to Bangkok I arm this
was the first time it ever it ever
occurred to me right I was oblivious and
now I went into the men's toilet right I
went to the men's toilet just you know
do my thing and as I was taking a piss
there was like i looked like i looked to
my right and there's like a chick like
you and then I didn't realize was like
yeah I freaked out like shit am I in the
ladies toilet like well what the hell
like is there someone in front of the
mirror just doing her hair I were doing
his hair I don't even know what you you
know to do that and I walked outside i
double-checked I'm like yeah this is the
male's toilet you know like yeah and you
know known as it went back in you know
finish off and um I was slightly shit
yeah that's a ladyboy I know that's a
legit right people and it looked like a
woman like literally it looked like a
woman like everything I was just like
holy
shiza you not I mean so yes that's the
thing I don't know so yeah that's it ha
out of all the questions you guys asked
yes I mean he kept going on the stream
yeah that's the second time I went in
Bangkok I never really had any um never
really had any hiccups or anything any
interactions there so yeah yeah this is
this one is quite good this week Google
will made this our last question because
it's quite a good run by a techno Steve
he says hey guys what is the best GPU
for streaming at 60fps while playing on
the same pc so streaming and gaming in
the same PC he's running a I 546 90k
that's a very good deals Kenyan GPU I
cpu and he's running okay aftermarket
cooler on asrock z97 so if you're doing
that personally right now um I'm
guessing you're playing at 1080p also
and streaming at 1080p I would say yeah
probably the 1070 would do you very well
um that should give you enough I do you
agree round two and 74 a 46 money k
streaming gaming 1080p dear yeah yeah
that should be a good model of 1070
should be more than enough especially if
you're overclocking or 90 so let me know
ti if you pick them up yeah you could do
that a lot cheaper as well so it depends
on what you got when your budget is but
yeah 1079 TI there's they are just
ridiculously powerful cards you know I
mean they really are like you can eat
the turn 80 stupidly fast and then of
course if you get the 1080i coming out
that's gonna be even more stupidly fast
so you know and then you get the iron
ore that are known for 90 come out of
whatever Amy's going to do our X 4 90
that's going to be a really nice card so
you know they're gonna be nice cards so
yeah you'll do well so it's a maybe if
you can't wait just a little while
longer to avega comes out which i'm
telling a lot of people looking at by
high end GPUs because i would say it
will bring prices down definitely nvidia
will probably do a little bit of a drop
in anticipation for so yeah that'll be
enough sir alright guys uh that's about
it we're gonna wrap this bad boy up i'm
going to head to the gym overclock
myself and juice and then finish up yeah
willing to finish up this pc as well so
that's just got installed the games on
it too so pretty awesome pretty damn
awesome so thanks for tuning in guys
we'll catch you next week in the stream

start what not guess so we'll catch you
