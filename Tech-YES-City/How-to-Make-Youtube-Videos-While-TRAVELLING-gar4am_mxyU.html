late this afternoon came down with a
tummy bug and all that stuff and
whatever the show must go on
and got some questions in the last parts
hunt about how I do the traveling and
how I make things work I think there's
this misunderstanding that I'm paying
for everything like I'm actually going
out of my way to go to Vietnam just to
do a use parts hunt which would really
knock the price performance out of crazy
ratios because then I'd be paying
thousands of dollars for air tickets and
accommodation just to hunt 100 and $200
gravis cars and that's not the case at
all
don't
we talked about all that a little bit
later because right before I left
Vietnam a subscriber you might have seen
him at the end of the GOC video boo he
took me around to a local PC shop star
computer it's got a different name in
Vietnamese I cannot pronounce it for the
life of me and we went there and they
got mining gravis cars p1o sixes which
essentially are gtx 1066 gigabytes and i
was able to pick one of those off for
1.3 million dong which in australian
dollar terms would be like 75 Aussie
dollars a USD would be under sixty US
dollars so this one I got doesn't have
any display outs though I'm gonna try
and get it working through the
motherboards graphics by using the GPUs
the engine apparently you can do that so
stay tuned I'll have a video coming out
very soon to see if I can get that
working but we also managed to get an Rx
for 74 gigabyte and this has a DVI out
and we've got this for 950 thousand dong
it's a sapphire nitro version hopefully
this will just work off the DVI cable
itself and if so that'll be a great
bargain coming in with USD pricing of
that of close to like 45 US deal
something and then in Aussie dollar
turns like 65 Aussie which is
ridiculously cheap for cards of this
caliber now the VGA BIOS on these cards
is different to that of a gaming
graphics card so I'm gonna see if I can
even mod that to see if it can perform
to that of the gaming variants and one
thing about these mining cards is there
are a lot of them now especially now
that crypto has bottomed out there's
even more and more of these cards coming
up for sale pretty much everywhere now
it is a flood of gravis cards and it's
probably only even gonna get worse going
into Christmas but you guys let's get on
to the main topic of today's video and
that is travelling and how I do things
because lately I seem to be going to a
lot of different places and doing parts
hunts and people like Dan Brian you must
be rich and believe me I'm not I my
YouTube channel doesn't make a whole lot
of money it has picked up a bit since
the ad pocalypse which is great so I'm
not so stressed I can eat more than
baked beans now but when it comes to
traveling I do extract maximum value out
of these trips if you've noticed that
every time I've been to a different
country other than Australia whether it
be Italy or Thailand
now Vietnam I've always had to cover an
event whether it be for AMD or in this
case it was for Galax they asked me look
we'll pay for your flights and
accommodation and you come over and film
our event and let the audience know
about what our latest releases or what
we're doing and I'm more than happy to
do that
pretty much just for flights and
accommodation because I do want to see
new places in the world because I've
hardly traveled at all when I was
younger and so in these places come up
I'm like well great I can give the
audience a used PC parts hunt at this
particular place plus I could just go on
overdrive with work and then get the
content done for the particular company
and so it's worked out so far you guys
are definitely loving it by the feedback
I'm getting in some of these videos so I
guess I'm just gonna keep this up
whichever company decides to bring me to
a particular event I'm more than
grateful to go there and just cover it
for them and then on the bonus I'd just
go around and learn that whole area and
possibly personally I think it's a big
challenge so I just go to these places
solo
and then essentially just go Yolo and it
works out it always has worked out
except for Italy that was pretty tough
that was probably the toughest parts hun
I've done yet because I only had three
days there and I was shooting for all
three days for AMD so I had very little
time to do a parts on and the one really
good deal that we came into ended up the
guy ended up pretty much running away so
with the deals itself I'm only ever
going to get a deal if it's a proper
deal like I'm not gonna overpay for
something or I'm not gonna go hey I got
an i7 3770k for $200 that wouldn't be a
deal and so I always pass off bad deals
but when something like Vietnam for
example when a 1063 gigabytes from
biostar came up for a really good price
cheaper than I could get it for even a
really good price in Australia then I'll
jump on those deals now in terms of how
I travel in how I edit videos out on the
fly I use the Intel NOC and when it
comes to what's inside that NOC I've got
32 gigabytes of ddr4 so-dimm and also
one terabyte nvme both of which I hustle
deals off Gumtree so everything I do on
the channel I guess
has the passion showing through it's not
just the videos that you see it's also
behind the scenes everything I do I try
and get a deal and just like the
traveling I try to get a deal where I go
bargain hunting in that particular
country doing something else covering an
event for example so I guess at this
stage maybe the companies enjoy watching
the content as well because I do seem to
be getting flown out more and more to
these events every year and honestly it
is a blessing but it is a lot of hard
work so in the hotels themselves I'll
usually have a TV or a monitor and the
case of Vietnam I actually pulled the TV
off the wall mount and used it like a
normal desktop setup and that's where I
can get my work done really effectively
and efficiently for me I've tried a
laptop in the past and I just can't work
as fast as I can with a dedicated
keyboard and mouse and a bigger screen I
find that helps me get videos done way
more efficiently and so I can get you
guys the content day in day out but from
time to time there will be some problems
like the AMD video where they'll sort of
like this ringing coming through and
that was actually from the hotel room
and I oddly enough just thought it was
my tinnitus because there's some big
soccer match the night before with
Vietnam versus Philippines and Vietnam
won so literally the whole streets of
Saigon became just one big party that
was absolutely out of control but what
about Vietnam itself and I think a lot
of the viewers thought when I went to
Vietnam I would have been the guy who
got hustled
and believe me some people did try to
hustle me hard the taxi driver for
example when I first docked in he was
actually trying to take money out of my
wallet and I grabbed his hand I slammed
it back into his chest I said don't
touch my wallet in that stage I think he
kind of was like shaking a little bit
I'm like dude you know you trying to
steal my money and I had my phone with
roaming on so I had internet so if it's
one thing if you come to Vietnam ake
sure you got a smartphone within net
going straightaway so you can just
Google on the fly if something's a bit
fishy but the taxi driver ended up
taking me to my hotel and he wanted to
charge me like about $50
and I said no way I checked the average
price that was around about ten to
fifteen dollars so I just gave him $15
on the generous side and I said please
don't try to scam me next time and then
just slam the door and walked out but
other than that the one thing I was
really annoyed about with the taxi ranks
was I went to the official taxi rank and
I was the guy came to pick me up and I'm
asking the other guys there I'm like yo
is this taxi okay and the other two guys
at the taxi rank and nodding and they
like yep he's fine
so I was kind of like the first problem
I came into with Vietnam and if it's one
thing as if you guys are traveling to
Vietnam just install an application
called grab it allure it's like uber but
it'll just save you any hassles of
having to be hustled or scanned by taxi
drivers because you'll know exactly
where you're going and what you're
getting so definitely install that if
you come to the country also in terms of
exchanging money I went to a bank in the
middle of the city they gave the best
rates it was like a 2% spread as opposed
to the airport's they'll charge you like
nine percent on your money so definitely
want to change it over a bank but anyway
the next crazy thing about Vietnam and
one thing I haven't experienced out of
the whole time I've been traveling was
the misrepresentation of my first hotel
I booked it on a go TOCOM and it was
they said it was a four-star hotel and
when I went into this hotel I actually
show some photos for you guys it was
filthy like it was just disgusting I'm
like I am NOT staying in this hotel it
was a dirty pillow there was hair over
the couch and it was just filthy in
general like running paint and I'm
pretty sure I got a headache from the
paint fumes that the guy was just
slapping way too much paint on all the
furniture inside so at that stage I just
got pretty much just got out of a taxi
where a guy tried to scam me so my
patience was wearing thin and I'd seen
this hotel where the pictures on the
website which was just completely
different to what I was getting and so I
just walked out I handed them the key
card and said I'm not staying here
PayPal is gonna fix me up thank you very
much
see you later and so from there I just
went to a two-star Hotel that night that
had a spare room and you just pay cash
so I checked out the room before I
stayed there
and that ended up being pretty good and
then I went on to booking.com and I
booked another hotel that ended up being
cheaper and had a rooftop pool and a gym
as well and they included buffet
breakfast so when it comes to hotels I'd
probably recommend just actually coming
to Vietnam on the spot and going to the
hotel and checking it out first and then
saying okay I will stay here and pay the
money because in the past over all the
different countries I've booked hotels
with by booking Kimora goda I've never
had a hotel been misrepresented this bad
before anyway the next thing that came
out of all this was the young girl who
was driving me around Daisy she was my
translator and also my tour guide which
really was unexpected because what had
happened was when I got into Vietnam my
suitcase had been delayed a whole day
apparently it didn't make it from the
plane from Sydney to Vietnam because I
had to transfer from the Gold Coast and
I had to wait another day for my
suitcase and what I do when I fly is I
usually put pajamas on because it's
really comfortable and then when I get
to the airport I'll change clothes for
my suitcase and then I'll look normal
but since my suitcase was delayed a
whole day I'm walking through the
streets of Vietnam in my pajamas and
they're like okay we're gonna deliver
your goods to your hotel the next day so
it was just a nightmare the whole first
days so many things that happened where
I tried to get scammed by a taxi driver
hotel was misrepresented and my suitcase
didn't show up but that night ended up
crashing out having a really good sleep
and I woke up and I just started looking
for clothes so I was like I need to have
a shower get some new clothes on and
that's when I stumbled into the store
where Daisy was at she had shirts for
sale her aunty had shirts for sale and
they were like okay I was like look I'll
just buy a shirt I need anything so I
got this a Vietnamese shirt with the
star on it and also some pho King shirt
and I was like look do you have shorts
underwear belt and socks and they were
like no but we know a place where you
can go to to get that and I was like
okay can you help me out
and she was like okay go to my niece
she'll take you around the corner and so
I jumped on this scooter with her and
she took me there and she spoke English
and she did all the translating to make
sure I didn't get ripped off and after
that I'd had a whole fresh new set of
clothes and when I got back to the shop
where they took me to the other shop
from I just said to her thanks you'll
like the first person who he hasn't
tried to scam me be he's been really
nice and you know the city pretty well
and you speak English so I offered I
said to her do you want to be my tour
guide and she turned around said sure
I'll do that for you so the trip just
got better and better from there my next
hotel was really good and then I just
went around did the whole pods hunt
anywhere I wanted to go she took me and
so there it all is with Vietnam I was
there for a total of six days and it was
crazy how cheap things were over there
everything's really inexpensive of
course you do have to be mindful of
being scammed by people if there's no
price list I'd recommend going somewhere
else
priceless is usually an easy way to say
hey I'm not gonna be getting scammed
whether it be you're eating lunch or
you're getting a massage or you're
getting some sort of product always look
for a price list it'll help you out in
terms of eating and not trying to get
sick definitely just go eat where
everyone else is eating generally
popular places will be popular for a
reason that's one thing I've learned
from traveling around different places
and other than that this has honestly
been the most value extracted holiday
I've ever had in my life I think I
changed over about 700 Aussie dollars
and I've still got like 150 Aussie
dollars in my wallet in Vietnamese dong
and I've got like five graphics cards
and I ate like a king
and so you dollar does go very far when
it comes to Vietnam and just living in
general so it was a really good
experience and also a big thanks to
everyone who helped me out over there
especially boo and also Daisy you guys
are awesome really made the trip so much
fun so I definitely wanna go back there
