world TV and this is episode 4 I believe
YouTube might have messed up saying it's
episode 3 but I did change it and we're
joined by science studios Greg how you
doing man yo what's going on brand sorry
I'm making that gonna post right now on
the Facebook page we have all our bases
here now first of all with Greg we've
got to quickly clear the X I know I've
read comments in the past whenever I've
done sort of a collaboration with Greg
people have been like I hate Greg I hate
science studio there's some people out
there that hate him and I in the last
year I've spoken to Greg a lot behind
the scenes I've met him at Computex IRL
is a genuine guy and so I know there's
gonna be people who don't like him but
for those people we have made up a
special intro do we want to roll this
intro Greg no we're gonna roll it okay
let's do it
so all's forgiven after we rolled that
intro so there's a special insurance
yeah people is prime yeah people are
gonna love you now people are gonna love
you
it's chats gonna go crazy for you but
with that said we've got some awesome
tech news lined up today Z 390
motherboards and a cause I believe they
will be announced at Computex and of
course what's this spelling for the
market we're going to discuss that we're
also gonna take a look for you guys at
Samsung's new 32 by 9 ultrawide monitor
and black ops 4 on this side now we're
going to move over to Channel Greg's
channel and then we're gonna do a live
stream there but let's roll the intro
for tech world TV
I detect a we have not actually this is
my first time look at that okay so
welcome back officially to the channel
and Greg how you doing man I am doing
alright this is what my Saturday night
your Sunday midday ish big exactly so we
figured both Greg and I discussed the
time and will like well I mean I don't
have a life Greg told me you said you
don't have a life right no no I pretty
much sign that away when I turn 19 yeah
so we figured what better time to stream
on Greg Saturday night my Sunday like
midday and that way we can catch the
Aussies because it's a Sunday most
people don't work on a Sunday so these
will be able to catch this stream and
then Hermits in the US will be able to
catch it catch it right and at the same
time like you know the weekends I don't
really see too much traffic but the live
streams from the tech tubers anyway so
we figured they have lives so we figured
we would seize on that opportunity and
just stay inside like good Hermits and
hopefully we've got some followers I'm
gonna seize the opportunity we seize the
day we've seized the opportunity I said
we got the first topic up here but in
the last I guess it's been three weeks -
I have to apologize for not streaming
before I am and people probably bite
where's tech deals tech deals is m.i.a
still I'm still waiting for that reply
from about two weeks ago so no idea okay
okay but also the I am vlogger that'll
come out soon but in the last week it's
been nots man I've got the next can yes
fix it episode will be hitting the
channel very soon I'm organizing with a
guy called tag mods Ethan his really
awesome met him and I am we've actually
met at Computex the year before and if
here and there and he does custom builds
and he's like look I'm coming to the
Gold Coast we're gonna do your custom
build and it's been be perfect Darth Jar
Jar with the SR to build that's what's
gonna go I can't wait to see that anyway
then so I figured wait it's gonna take
like a week or whatever but
I'm gonna do like a three-part series
with it behind the scenes Ethan will
feature Ethan and then we'll do the
whole build itself so there's like three
built three videos that will come out of
that it'll be really good and then next
month is well I'll do the gym the health
check you know how to be a healthy
hermit kind of thing you look pretty
healthy yourself Greg yeah you got any
tips actually a little longer
probably underweight I only weigh like
135 sorry I don't know what that
converts to in kilos around 58 yeah yeah
I really like to be a lot heavier and in
college my first year in college should
say I really bulked up I put two
workouts in protein creatine you name it
I was probably on it I didn't you know
juice operating like that but I was
taking supplements and that was really
the only way I could gain weight and
then once I stopped that I lost all the
muscle and and I pretty much this size
since ninth grade I mean I'm about 78 kg
but it's it's you know maintaining I'm
not it's not a potbelly I used to have a
potbelly so I can relate with the
audience you know so yeah there'll be
that guy hitting next month as well this
month were just finishing up a heap of
stuff and then early next month is
Computex could we go super chat sorry oh
my super chat is broken if you can read
that comment Greg that'd be awesome
yeah he says what's up YouTube YouTube
okay awesome what's up YouTube YouTube
okay I just word for word I'm reading it
exactly I'll try andrea Nabal it wait
that might be why I think it'll work now
I think I've got it working now but with
that said let's pull up the first
article here z3 90s chipsets revealed so
me coffee likes new high end
motherboards so what we're seeing here
it looks a lot like Zee 370 but it's got
USB 3.1 gen2 there seems to be a big
thing of course you've got support for
the eight core 16 thread CPUs that will
be coming to this chipset and you've
also got integrated Wireless as well I
like to the main chipset I honestly like
I didn't even know that the h3 was 8b 3
6 th 3 1783 10 I didn't even know that
they
had those features in the Z 370 didn't
did you know that I didn't I
I know that in c37 another reason we
only had Z 370 to begin with list
because it was more or less a rush
launch right to keep up with pryzen and
they you know they took a while because
they wanted to refine these these newer
platforms right that didn't have it
overclocking support and I'm sure what
had to do with was that technology was
just kind of now being implemented when
those new boards came out and at the
time it wasn't ready to be thrown into a
Z 390 platform which is why it wasn't
included what ended up being Z 370 is
kind of a compromise short term yes
really it's really bizarre kind of what
they're doing here of course there's
those ice lake delays as well
so we've got the 10 nanometer which has
been delayed but I think there's a big
announcement going down at Computex of
course z33 disease 390s they're not
gonna launch the motherboard without
launching a cpu not a high-end
motherboard so I think we're gonna see a
core 16 threads at Computex from Intel
and what the most curious thing I'm I'm
really curious about is to see do these
things overclock and how well do they
live a clock compared to the six cores
cuz really like I don't know about you
man but for me 6 cores 12 threats is the
sweet spot if you're game you know you
don't even productivity you know I said
this in the past numerous times is like
thread ripper and 7900 X's and stuff
they don't really change my world at all
in fact in some cases this slow like you
go to photoshop you're that 5 gigahertz
bank snap snap snap snap dropping 5
files into Premiere Pro a you know raid
zero nvme it's just like the Z 370 has
that the z score 12 thread has that it's
just mmm I don't know it's like that car
that's not as powerful doesn't have as
much horsepower but it just handles like
a beast yeah and yeah I definitely think
that the the frequency has a lot to do
with it still and I know people are
always talking about how the next the
next core account right the next step
which would be eight I mean we already
have a pre mainstream on AMD side but
with Intel we don't have that yet so
that's something that we'll be talking
about a second but with Z 390
that's kind of paving the way
for that next step on Intel side because
they see it they see the demand for it
we've seen the differences in the 2700 X
and 8700 cam when it comes to have
multitasking and you know the frequency
of the 87 or K definitely makes up for
it do it to a great extent in some cases
and sometimes it even outperforms it in
games it's still the gaming King we've
proven that you know you much every type
of channel I know is proven that but
when it comes to live streaming right
there's a big open door for AMD to
suddenly push there a core agenda and
until knows that and and that's why you
know there's so much hype behind this
new platform yeah I mean I don't know
like the Z 390 it's I'm wondering about
pricing and all that and of course isn't
8 core 16 thread going to work on Z 370
I do I mean I've heard rumors I heard
these a while ago to the the 8 cores
will indeed work on the Z 370 I heard I
was actually gonna ask you that I didn't
know yeah I mean that's the rumor I
heard so and this was a while ago of
course I don't really know but I guess
with motherboard compatibility should we
go I was going to make a dedicated video
to this but I guess we can discuss it a
little bit like I was noticing with the
AMD when I did that eSports build this
time around they only released the X 470
motherboard right so you only got X 4 7
he didn't get B 450 or a 420 and on 420
magical number for that motherboard bit
we maybe that's why they avoided that
one it might be a 410 the what what they
didn't do right this time around was of
course they've got the backwards
compatibility there but people want to
go out and buy a 2nd gen CPU you know
what I mean like they want to go out and
get that 2nd gen Seaview and get that
cheap motherboard but there's no option
now this time around to get that cheap
motherboard except if they've got to
sort of take the gamble and see if that
motherboards already had a BIOS update
if it's a piece 350 or if it's an a320
and so for me like I had some troubles
with that as well board ID to go back
get another CPU then put a GPU in update
it and then my APU could work of course
AMD will send out the upgraders kit but
there's still that problem that if it's
like if you're building your first PC
and you jump into a BIOS you're gonna be
like what
is going on here I don't know what I'm
doing I'm scared you know
and because I do like ages and age it's
going I first got into PC building
remember when I first jumped into a BIOS
I just I just shut everything down and
ran for the hills I didn't know what was
going on yeah of course there's YouTube
guides and all that but this time around
I'd love to see
I mean rumors are coming out that p450
will be announced at Computex to the I
think AMD if they've got the backwards
compatibility they should release the
cheaper lineup the motherboards with the
more expensive one that's just how I
feel about that yeah real quick I'm
gonna reply to that go ahead dear the
super chair or then not super check in
the chat box Paul yeah it's Paul Ryan
not the chat okay go ahead and make
there's a guy want you to to search for
a scroll up a little bit his name is
crypt Annika okay easy want to be a
moderator yeah I'll add him off to the
show yeah I mean they can't moderate
easy will what trust him yeah and then
also the discord link I can't post a
link on your soup on your chat box like
that's like so hot oh the discord if you
have it up I can link that for them okay
I'll fix you guys up after the show
midstream I can't like I can't really do
any of that at the moment otherwise you
can go on Twitter yeah and just post up
on Twitter on Wayne no no no anyway just
tell Krypton ik I'll take care of him
after the live stream Bela okay yeah and
yeah I need you I need your full fledged
attention here Greg Greg's gone afk
during the livestream that Brian can't
apparently do on his live stream some
heaven death yeah let's see here again
man GG wait yeah exactly guys I'm the
biggest noob when it comes to live
streaming like if I change things I'll
probably mess something up and then
that'll be like terrible audio or
something we'll just be messed up so
it's like when I stream it's like I'm in
a sandbox and this is the live stream
outside of that nothing else happens so
yeah that's that's live streaming for
you I get it paint live streams are
Royal Pains I totally get it yeah yes am
i I've ly cut off the live stream like
in the middle of it because I clicked
the wrong button
and I kept talking for like a full-on 15
minutes thinking I was still alive so
it's back yeah it can get a lot worse
and hence why yeah like me doing stuff
and hosting the stream and shuffling
things live it just is not happening
guys so yeah also I got a cherry MX
Mouse now I did do the video with the
thousand FPS lag and the Intel and all
that stuff but I went back and watched
it and my Corsair mouse like it's got
the reactive lighting but the problem is
so inconsistent like the light was
coming on after the reaction was coming
out on the monitor and I'm like wow damn
I can't do a reliable video with this so
I went out and bought a cherry MX mouse
did you know they make Mouse cherry no
yeah it's very direct like like MX
direct yeah you know the guys who make
the switches they make mice yeah so I
was like cool this is a bit of nostalgia
but then why make sense they're all
category so it was the next step yeah
then I'm gonna pull off the shell and
put an LED light on it and then we've
got that you know consistent react I
guess there's no way around you just got
to put an LED light in the circuit and
I'm dreading it because I'm terrible at
soldiering if you guys in the u.s.
soldering soldering hit else I know
that's it I said soldiering in my life
there we've done I'm pretty sure I did
and I don't even think I meant to do it
on purpose the world's changing Greg the
world is changing in mysterious there to
be fair when it comes to a word like I
used to say insulation then someone
pulled me up and said it's insulation
and to be fair it sounds better
insulation sounds better so I started
saying okay insulation yeah so I've
changed you know I had no clue like what
your were even is that you were
referencing inspiration inspiration yeah
inspiration behind these gyprock walls
here I'll rock you guys clothes rock
walls okay anyway mainstream coffee lake
so main screen mains
green mainstream mean whatever
eight-course 16 threads is coming at
Computex how much do you think this
thing will cost is there's no real word
on pricing do you think $500 would be
fair if we just look it we can just kind
of make a little trend here right so
what the i3 8300 is and what actually
what's the they have 83 50 K does that
exist I would oh yeah it does okay um
that's 175 bucks a new egg right now
which i think is a little overpriced for
an unlocked at 3 but if we do I 580 600
K pretty sure that's in the ballpark of
to 220 yeah maybe 240 okay so 240 so 180
240 the I sevens another grow yeah it
starts to grow like exponentially as
well I would say I would say mid to high
for hundreds I you know they gotta
compete they know that the the 2700 X is
on the other side of the fence right so
they they've got to keep the pricing
there but at the same time like people
buy Intel because it's Intel right you
know they don't care about the prices
people are gonna be brand loyal and then
when they're in that mindset so I don't
think they're too worried about trying
to steal you know steal some of AMD's
fan base I think what they're trying to
do is keep what they already have which
they're totally fine with and by doing
you know by releasing the a core CPU
boom there's your direct competitor
right without going extreme platform
which a lot of people don't want to do
because the motherboards are way more
expensive and you know you're not paying
hundreds of dollars more for the extra
PCIe lanes or whatever you get with the
extreme lineups in the same core
categories so I think this is just
literally a direct play to people who
are already in tell Savi and who want to
stay with the blue team but who don't
want to be stuck with a six core CPU you
know if they're building a workstation
or something and they're dreading moving
on to X 90 X 299 then there's their
option searing we should have like a
betting how many percentage of people
will upgrade from previous Intel 8th gen
CPUs to the eight core dere a konami
percentage do you think people lie do
you think they're still like I know
there's some diehard Intel
boys out there still but they're quiet
they never show up there like never
helment they never comment
well they hey the opposite right the
aegis Mandy they will chew them if they
say and it kind of goes both ways but I
would say that the Andy fan base right
now is really I don't say obnoxious but
they're really strong and vocal because
they now have that voice again right
they can now be vocal because they
actually have something to kind of rely
on right and it's their proof it's their
agenda you know results speak for
themselves
do you think this C 390 release will
spark reignite the fanboy wars because
there'll be eight cores versus eight
cores mainstream and I mean after eight
cores really it doesn't get much better
at least not for a few more years I mean
eight core 16 threads is like maximum
you'd really want to go unless of course
you're doing you can actually utilize
those cores and threads and if that's
good that's great but if you're gaming
like when it when it'll bring it all
comes back down to gaming right and I've
seen a lot of games like I tried even
the ten core twenty thread and some of
these games that were really well
optimized it's like you go to 10 cores
20 threads it's like okay the four
threads aren't being optimized or aren't
being utilized at all so it's sort of
left a little hole in this sort of more
cores more threads argument especially
for gaming so I think eight causes 16
threads is like your limit for your
saturation you know anymore and yeah
anymore and you're just probably wasting
your money but hey it's tech people love
waste yeah oh honey I think big I think
the Achilles heel for this whole thing
is gonna be the fact that we didn't
already have XIII 9d when we got Izzie
370 right because that was like that
that was like that year that's a
placeholder you know if you want the new
stuff which arguably isn't much of an
increased IPC wise it's just got an
extra two core stuff into basically the
same you know this is the same die which
is slightly bigger but still and then
you have XIII 90 which is that proper
step right which has the enhanced power
delivery the the voltage regulation all
that's proper for the next node for that
step to 10 nanometers but you have to
get a new motherboard and that's always
tough for people to do is not only
purchase a new CPU
is purchase a new motherboard as well
which is why the question of whether or
not this will be compatible with Z 370
is if you ask me looking back at how
until it's done things in the past I
don't think that it's gonna be a
plug-and-play situation I don't think
we're gonna be able to run ten
nanometers on Z 370 and I don't think
that even if we do I think there's gonna
be so many power issues with it that
people are gonna be motivated anyway to
move to Z 390 because that was the big
deal with with why they couldn't use Z
270 with coffee leak was because they
were having power delivery issues but at
the same time I don't know I just get a
feeling it's not gonna be a simple
scenario definitely gonna need a bio
flat BIOS flash that's almost a done
deal but past that I'm not too sure do
we not I'm not sure either and I think
Intel of definitely gained a track
record of not I mean I mean they're just
every time something new comes out like
new chipset new CPU new chipset new
chipset so I mean people like ok
XIII nineties is gonna be pretty much
that's it it's for an eight-core 16
thread there's no upgrade ability with
this that's what we've come to expect so
yes it's a bit it's actually really
annoying because you spend a lot of
money on this real fancy motherboard and
you want that really nice vrm and you
want to be able to utilize that for a
few years I mean the life on some of
these motherboards is like at least five
years if you were going really hard on
the overclocks
so it's it's a little bit unfair to
expect people to pay that kind of money
and then not being able to utilize it in
the future it's like it's good for one
year and that's it see you later
so I don't know yeah I'm looking at this
block diagram z3 90 is definitely okay
different are the feature sets are
different they've added things to it it
almost looks as though it looks what
this looks like is it's going to be
compatible with any 8th gen Intel CPU
any Intel CPU desktop grade starting
with the number 8 is going to be
compatible with this you'd have
yeah but but it's not gonna be the other
I don't know I don't know about Z 370
though yeah that's what I meant yeah I
was referring oh yes II don't know if Z
370 would be compatible with z3 no yeah
that's up in the air yeah no one's gonna
notice that's a talk yeah but what about
what about another tough one and what
about this one for a tough one
Samsung's preparing a new 50 120 by 1440
monitor with a hundred and twenty Hertz
refresh rate yeah so this is I mean this
is like massive have you seen one of
these monitors in the flesh dude I am
NOT in person I seriously yeah because
it looks ridiculous
it is and that's that's what it is it's
ridiculous I saw the 1080p version it
was at the 49 to 49 inch it was just
like I jumped on I'm like this is just
too much for like what I use like woo
wrapping around your face it was like
the alien facehuggers man like you get
in faiths touch yeah exactly and that's
what it's all about some people like
getting faced hugged I mean personally I
didn't like my first reaction was like
Oh 1080p I could notice the 1080p as
opposed to having like 1440p ultra white
already on my desk and having a 1440p 32
inch and even against 32 inch I'm gonna
speak I've been using 32 inch monitors
now for a couple of months and I
honestly think for a desk to 27 inch
monitors is probably the sweet spot and
then or one 34 inch altra wide I think
it really is starting to capped that
limit of okay this is getting ridiculous
because my friend came around the other
day and he sat in my desk he's like dude
these monitors are way too big and I'm
like yeah I'm looking at Emily they are
pretty ridiculous so I gotta figure out
a way to kind of sit back and you know
get more vision peripheral vision here
and sort of yeah like be able to see
more on my screens but it doesn't happen
because you know I can't really pull my
desk outs permanently attached to the
walls but you know yeah free sink but
apparently the monitors also go free
as well so you're looking at freesync
chg 90 qulet wanted a free sink to baked
in so apparently they they just baked it
in the oven and baked it in yeah so it
was literally an oven and it's like a
slow roasted it yeah so just bake that
one in and yes 32.9 let us know in the
comments do you think 32 by 9 is yeah I
honestly don't think it's gonna be as
popular as ultra-wide was when that
first released you know 21 by 9 did give
you an advantage it was like they sat
down and said okay how can we make
things more immersive and I think this
is sort of going to ridiculous lengths
of like yo this is how we can step one
up on 21 by nine but I sat down in front
of those like y'all I can't even see
like I think the key thing here is gonna
be price I think I think yeah it's like
you know you can get an ultra-wide you
can get a 1080p panel that's a decent
hundred hertz 120 hertz 1080p panel for
what to 300 bucks on a good day maybe
maybe 400 tops but if you want to go
high in g-sync all that stuff obviously
gonna pay more for those things but you
can get in the u.s. I would say between
three four hundred dollars are really
solid 1080p high refresh rate monitor
and an IPS you know you're not making
compromises on picture quality or
anything like that but then you look at
the ultra wide options in 1080p right
2560 by 1080 and so it's basically the
the horizontal dimensions of a 1440p
monitor but you're vertically limited to
1080p that option is usually about the
same price if if you're gonna pay more I
would say maybe a hundred bucks more 200
if you're going for something like
Samsung but moving from 16 by 9 or 21 by
9 to 32 by 9 which is literally -
sixteen by nine panels literally mesh
together into one but back to you yeah
you're paying for two panels essentially
you're paying for two separate 16 by 9
panels and in 1440p at-bat which is
another hundred $200 Delta from 1080p
it's supposed to be a thousand bucks
easy I would say at least a thousand oh
this is way more than a thousand I think
the 1080p why I don't like when they
start you know like they're always a lot
when it first when these become
you know I would say common on sites
like Newegg and Amazon they're still
gonna be a thousand bucks yeah it's it's
expensive like really is expensive I
mean if this is a 1440p version it's 120
Hertz and it is a thousand it does come
down to a thousand I could see myself
like at least wanting to see how it goes
in the flesh and then maybe try before
you buy if you could but I mean I think
it's gonna be like near 2 grand man to
be honest like I'm looking at the specs
it's like you got QD u 120 Hertz and you
got 1440p like Samsung aren't gonna be
like hey guys we pioneered this so we're
gonna give it away they're gonna want a
mil you have you actually looked up like
Q LED like what QE LED is though yeah
did a whole video on it man I love Q
allottee um because I was under the
impression when I first looked at this
yeah like quantum dot LED technology
you're not like I I was under the
impression that it was straight up like
active-matrix organic LEDs you know like
I I thought that this was like oh it's
an LED Pam right so it's gonna have no
backlight it's gonna look just clear and
clean like it would on any AMOLED
display but looking at what quantum dot
actually is and seeing it in person
slightly underwhelming I think that
they're hoping that is like this oh it's
this new thing you know like you guys
are really gonna love the picture it's a
huge step up from just your idea like
yes or no it's a subtle dance it's a
subtle difference you can notice it in
the Reds especially that's for me anyway
I've got the Samsung ultra wide QD LED
here and it's good technology it's just
not as good as OLED but then again yeah
where are the OLED PC monitors I mean
yeah Dell was one who promised to bring
one and they just like completely
scrapped it haven't they like it's weird
what's going on with the LED monitor
technology I'd love to see something new
come into the scene because quantum dot
LED it's still at the at the core you're
still using blue LEDs behind everything
yeah yeah yeah a little bit of a
disappointment there but let's do into
the lost some again right yeah we got
black ops full I mean I've been a big
fan of the black
Cirie's for a while but this time around
I feel like blackops is really gonna
flop I don't know why a black ops 3 did
not do well on PC at all and you look at
fortnight in pub G they did extremely
well on PC
of course consoles just there as well
but do you think this time around pop G
and fortnight are really just gonna take
the thunder from black ops 4 like the
that usual market of cod players are
like well I don't want to play cod
anymore what yeah I mean that's one of
the reasons why this headline right just
mentioning that battle royale mode
because I think that's something that
people really like the issue is when you
think of a platform like cod and then
cuz I still play black ops 3 like all it
openly admit I play it on PC you know
even though it's you know III literally
get on like after a week or so of not
playing and I'll see the exact same
people showing up every time because
it's just the fan base at this point is
small oh yeah actually that not too tech
therapy yeah awesome man is really cool
I told you and I see this I see this
game and it almost seems like a
last-ditch effort right and because I
especially the black ops series a lot of
people like black ops a lot of people
like black ops 2 I feel like things
change when they drop zombies which was
like the selling point for black ops and
then and what did they replace it with
like aliens or something something weird
it just wasn't the same I remember in
high school we were playing cod zombies
just come on our phones it was hot now
it's it's battle royale like that's the
new thing so I feel like they're doing
the right thing by shifting to this to
this new you know this new style of
gameplay and dropping single-player if
if this is true I'm pretty sure this is
this is gonna be the case I just don't
know if it's too late or not yes I mean
they've openly admitted like this is a
response to 49 and babji and stuff and I
just think like the cod formula that
black ops 2 was my favorite cod
franchise release of all time I love
black ops 2 was really cool the
multiplayer was polished
especially on PC it was smooth it was
just awesome to play and then yeah it
just seemed after that they just kept
sort of not innovating not even wanting
to innovate it was just like okay here's
a formula to make a bit of box and as a
gaming and as an enthusiast you can feel
that right you're like there's no
there's no soul there's no heart in this
game it's like I've just given up now
again instead of just saying okay battle
boils popular why don't they try and do
something completely different
why do they have to get up before night
and hop G as my biggest critique is like
you're gonna fail because your passion
your heart's not in it you say what
about it what about the consoles though
right cuz pub G's such a terrible I know
for Knights huge mmm but what about with
console do you think it's gonna change
it all in consoles now that like if they
wanted to do something they're gonna do
something unique like really unique with
a game they got to change it you know
some sort of like maybe introduced some
sort of mobile aspect where you can
level up your character or something and
you've got a five verse five in Call of
Duty or something I don't know but they
really have to get innovative if they
want their franchise to start doing well
because what you're seeing now is just
is follow the leader trend except black
ops especially black ops 3 and previous
games after black ops 2 they didn't have
a lot of momentum going in and they
caught bad reviews it cop you know this
that onion hit with like they weren't
optimized that well me personally I
played them I I mean I did dollars a
sucker I've made pcs for him and I
played them but I played them for like a
week and I got bored so quickly it's
just this is riddled with hacks as well
which is disgusting like some of these
guys man you just may even now you jump
on armed black ops 3 multiplayer and you
got some guys just got his hacks on
advertising his website that's his name
is like the website for where you can
buy his hacks and he's just sitting
there shooting through walls would like
the machine see it's so bad man like I
just and this is happening in like one
in every three games so that's pretty
like out there this this is a guy just
openly hacking to advertisers website
what about the guys who are like subtly
hacking you know what I mean yeah yeah
yeah whatever they use
I know with modern warefare to which was
the game I that was my that was my thing
was modern warfare 2 and I shifted to
modern warfare 3 started getting a
little weird you know what I noticed
yeah and this is the same with black ops
3 this is where they messed up with the
threes ghost was kind of like a the
awkward middle child black ops 3 and mod
and especially that one because I still
play that knows I know that like the
back of my hand the idea that you can
just jump in midair across half the map
or use these stupid guns that like would
never be like real I think that they
just lost the the real kind of like
down-to-earth factor with modern warfare
2 with black ops 2 right those games
were either based on old-school guns
that we know existed or the new stuff
that was just kind of now in development
but that's actually tangible yeah and
when you start getting these like jet
packs and like all these weird like you
know cloaking devices and stuff like you
just kind of lose especially after what
you've seen in previous generations of
cod you lose that that just
down-to-earth factor and you kind of
June so you got to keep up you just jump
into it some guys are really good
jumping across the map shooting people
halfway across it with a scope other
people can't catch on you know what they
see it as a disadvantage and something
that they can harp on because that was
never in the other Cod's so there's a my
default hate the new title and now you
can't blame them for it they're you know
they're the fans you listen to the fans
so I think they missed they missed a lot
there with the improvements well they've
kind of alienated the original audience
yeah so I mean it's like for me it's
kind of like rest and paste Cod I mean
what do you guys think do you reckon
it's a rest and paste job or what do you
think Greg it's a BIOS whole is gonna be
a rest and base job a lot I won't buy it
yeah mate I'm saying it now I might be a
sucker depends how cheap it is like
sometimes it comes out it's like 20
bucks and you're like mmm you know
they're gonna they're gonna bag you with
those purchases and games like you know
you're gonna get for 20 bucks to get
like access no like to battle royale
games a week like you're gonna be
limited and then on top of that if you
want any gun that's actually halfway
decent you're gonna pay five bucks
apiece for it just to get full access to
the game yeah but then you can like you
can show it in your benchmarks as well
hey guys I'm testing one of the latest
greatest titles paid 80 bucks this gala
honestly make it any more you make it
look like you make it look like to the
audience that you paid $80 this game but
you see it on sales 20 bucks you like
can't can't really pass so that's just
depends that's wait it goes but we're
gonna pull up some watch out so there's
the articles we're gonna move across the
greg's channels well do the after-hours
chat and la hoopla that's it hoopla
because this is the way we are gonna
start trying to do it okay live chat is
not working all right
so my life that isn't working my hands I
blame you you did this all right I'm
gonna skip over all that I love you any
comments here did you play Modern
Warfare did you play anything Modern
Warfare titles I started I started
getting into Cod when Black Ops was
released and then I played the one after
that but I love black ops more than that
what was the one after black ops modern
warfare 3 when was it mw3 I don't know
if it was interview 3 MW - I think it's
dumb 3 or like whatever I think black
ops came out that mw3 came out but I was
loving black ops more and then black ops
2 came out and I just played that I not
was better than black ops I was just
like I was sort of for me it hit the
pinnacle yeah it was modern warfare 3 so
many love comments so we'll go to
questions guys ask your questions away
it will answer a few and then we'll head
over to Greg's channel because maybe
there's like do we want to reroll Greg's
intro and if there's a chat want to see
it one more time it's pretty sweet
that's like someone's gonna do me the
heat pot one well I'm just you know
cartoon character saw some heat vibes
sort of was ghost was 2013 that was in
between black ops 2 &amp;amp; 3
modern warfare 3 was released right
before black ops 2 like and whatever for
two was right before black ops
dad that was their prime time right
there right after world at war what
happened along Shannon +6 so what I
think of the
plastic I don't even even tried a
oneplus phone man I'm just a why away
fanboy my audience knows like Huawei is
yeah for life man but think about that
meat book xn8 books Pro you seen that
yeah I'm not into phones much man just
like by my wall ways and that's it light
will this 100k laptops is well not a
huge fan of laptops I'd like to see how
the six because isn't that release the
six core on the laptops they have Shree
lot cooler so now KP like our CPUs okay
because I tried to knock and I was like
damn knock is like the new knock is for
me is like so much better than a laptop
cuz its 1.3 kilograms
it's got so much input and output on
that thing it's just it's it and you
know I know if I'm people like oh well
you got a screen with a laptop it's like
I can't edit videos on a small laptop
screen like that so if I'm if I've got
to do an event and I got to go somewhere
it'll be like booked a hotel or book of
Airbnb with a with a massive monitor or
like at least the 32 inch TV so I can
screen Raz drop you know whatever is a
1080p I can artificially make it 1440p
or whatever and then I can add up videos
probably bring a keyboard and a mouse I
can't use a laptop touchpad laptop
keyboards as well for me they're just
not optimal great if you're a uni
student though I will say if you're a
university student laptops are
phenomenal you just bring them into your
lecture bang you can sit there write
notes and pull up extra diagrams and you
know you can sort of on the fly you can
make your professor look like an idiot
like oh yeah did you know this this fact
he's like huh
like kid I ain't getting paid enough
denote that I mean that's why I because
I'm not a fan either of ultra-low-power
altra low power ultrabooks right cuz
that's the compromise you make when you
get those thin profiles you get the low
power chips they used to be only dual
cores with hyper-threading
yeah the jump from that to true quad
cores was a big improvement but they
operated such low frequencies under load
especially when your video editing and
you know just content creation in
general
or gaming that there's not a huge jump
not what we expect as long as the
thermal capacities yeah cuz they're so
small and and that's exactly why I went
with a MacBook I know this is like
totally unpopular reason why I did was
because I can use you know programs that
have been using a software like quick
sync like Hardware encoding that allow
things to render much quicker I'll have
a full video on my little 13-inch
MacBook rendered by the time I finish
editing the video because it's it's
rendering all of it as I go and and
that's just that's a huge software plus
write that at the same time I'm limiting
myself to whatever you know just Mac OS
in general so that's why I've used Mac
books because I also hate just the
versatility of ultra-low power yeah
laptops I said we got asked if we were
both youtubers if we weren't youtubers
would we still have the RGB The Bling
and all that other stuff and I'm gonna
say yes I would still have like not the
studio obviously the studio wouldn't
exist if I didn't have YouTube but a
nice setup would definitely exist like
I'd have a bit of bling a nice chair
nice keyboard nice matte like you I just
love gaming and I love it PC hardware in
general I'd probably would have
something not as crazy but I'd have
something pretty simple pretty minimal
but a little bit of RGB bling sort of
like that subtle RGB you know that
there's the glowing stuff and mm-hmm
and just yeah I don't know it still have
a nice setup with a bit of RGB and all
that stuff what about you I've always
been in the white built because I
usually you know you can approach this
from like buying all RGB components
upfront and kind of paying a premium for
those those extra functions with those
components specially with RAM with
coolers and graphics cards a lot of
graphics cards are if they're RGB
they're barely RGB and if you want the
really nice stuff you got to pay the
premiums they only come in the higher
and coolers with the better bin GPUs so
my approach to it all cuz I was always
on a budget was all right well let's
just paint stuff white or you know by
white cases as long as their price about
the same and just stick them or RGB
strip in there and then I can change
your color whenever I want because it
basically reflects whatever color
I you know I shine on those components
because they're white they're not black
they don't absorb the color so that was
always my thing like I could just change
it on the fly and white to me it looks
pretty crisp and unique on its own yeah
I'd probably be painting a lot more
stuff a because I guess I guess so
backlogged with stuff but I'd be doing a
lot more before I started getting sent
new parts in like what you saw with the
Japan days was me working but then just
doing all the stuff I just really loved
and kind of in ways like I'd out of no
man in ways I have been thinking about
maybe just finding a full-time job and
then going back to that formula because
I love doing the use part stuff just
love painting stuff and I'd be like
probably getting a lot of aliexpress RGB
LEDs or just stuff on a budget I really
love just making value out of whatever I
can do you know I mean like just budget
value and then sort of like compare it
against the latest and greatest that
costs three times more I love doing that
it's always been a passion so I don't
know yeah you know I'm not gonna lie on
my Twitter I've like I've said to my
viewers been a little bit down lately
there's some some IRL stuff we can talk
about on the patreon livestream also
another thing I didn't talk about as
well YouTube sponsors there's this
sponsor button come up I might just like
if people ask me I might just link your
video but yes it's basically guys it's a
new option YouTube rolled it out they've
adapted me I think Greg's got a too on
his channel now they've enabled us to
have YouTube sponsors so you just get
some little extra perks we're gonna
offer I'm gonna not list for my viewers
I'm gonna offer the exact same features
as a patron user would get access to
discord access behind once a month
behind the scenes live and behind the
scenes patron a video that'll be the
same for YouTube sponsors who some
people don't like to put their money
through patron they don't trust it or
it's not the options aren't available so
YouTube has that option now if you want
to be a YouTube sponsor you get these
chat perks there's some pretty cool
stuff I like how you did the battery
thing that was pretty cool but but oh
yeah I was like oh god I gotta come up
with something cool and it's probably
not the most creative thing ever but
it's just something to kind of motivate
people like they want to keep
subscribing or sponsoring then you know
they're gonna look better over time
right
it can change I mean the whole idea is
like you know if they're willing to do
that for us right you want to be able to
feel like they're getting something in
return not just like a pretty face on
camera or whatever you know so you want
to kind of feed listen to the feedback
and change things according to what most
people want you know if you want to keep
them happy especially so you know OGB it
saves the world doesn't it algae-based
taken over why'd you be everything now
it's getting to the point where it's
getting a little bit ridiculous low it
will say interesting customization
people feel satisfied because they can
change it on a dime you know they're not
fixed to a certain thing that they buy
they can change it whenever they want
that's the idea what do you think about
RGB on headphones oh and like RGB on a
chair I think it's that sort of limit
for me like like batteries on a chair or
something like batteries like you're
just draining your batteries on your
headset like yes so here's how I look at
it it's all about the compromises
involved I guess okay I mean this is
this is gonna be a hot topic no matter
what a lot of people hate it just
because you know it's like the opposite
of the trend and people like to be
against the trend but the idea right is
customization and it's how much people
are willing to pay extra for it an RGB
chair if I'm if I'm courted if I'm
plugged into a wall I can't get on board
with that if it's gonna drain the
battery of my headset significantly
faster than it would without having RGB
not on board with it
it's got RGB I'm not paying extra for it
and it keeps my battery in check you
know I'm not paying much more or I'm not
having to recharge this you know about
the same as if it wasn't on at all by
it's not gonna hurt me if it's there
just don't take features and perks away
from me for the sake of having it on
there if it's the only thing you're
offering like if there's only an option
to buy this model and RGB then I'm
paying or RGB tax and you know I can't
opt out of it in any way so I'm glad
that we have choices with a lot of these
things you can buy headphones that don't
have them totally cool but the fact that
they exist and that they're on shelves
is just a testament to how popular they
still are and
people still there they're fine with
making as compromises to look unique to
set things up the way they want yeah
not on the money it our GP battery so
did we miss the medieval I just
completely blanked out of the chat here
were you watching any of the questions
that were coming through sorry guys
yeah there will be the there will be the
parts hunt coming later this month so
stay tuned for that it's always comes
around the end of the month yeah so so
yeah you like oh thanks Manny lysis
because of the budget nature yeah yeah
good old hardware in box he does his
benchmarks as he's gonna become a
walking graph soon I think there's
always yes me yo what's cracking guys
RGB glasses there that'd be pretty cool
eh so there's some yeah someone give
Brian a coffee actually we're gonna stop
the stream and move over to Greg's
channel and I'm gonna get a coffee and
then we'll be reignited on Greg's
channel so I think I'm actually hungry
more than anything I actually yeah woah
I haven't had breakfast yet I'm doing
the whole fasting oh dude I thought you
had that before we got on no I actually
forgot I was so pumped about getting the
live streamed um and now I forgot to eat
that was bad I was literally eating
while we were setting I'm doing this
runs annoying of like eating coffee use
tea okay I'll eat something first and
then I'll see how I feel it's just I
reckon I gotta eat that's all it is cuz
I went to the gym yesterday and mad
workout cardio as well Katya so good
it's like I'm sleepy carbs dude you got
a car but before you go in no I eat
potato chest well I don't notice these
potato chips have a pecans in it they
gotta keep the cards that you get a lot
of sodium to to absorbs water it can
actually counteract anything that dogs
would do energized I find I always have
a mad workout if I eat potato chips
before a workout that's just me or ate a
snooze yeah was whatever it is I mean I
mean it's definitely got the carbs but
it's not a good kind of carb listen to
you but kind of closely to you buddy men
don't listen to you buddy we gotta get
some old fashioned mashed taters oh we
got a donation to he said thanks optimal
carbs that
Oh what does that our ass or our I'm
gonna I'm gonna really fix the I'm gonna
refix the stream is that it looks like
the notification things aren't really
working this week but hey at least the
stream at least the audio was good yeah
the audio was good and we did everything
sort of pretty to the point yeah I
haven't seen anybody really complaining
about the audio I don't make trash we're
working on that yeah audio well that's
when you know you've got things right
when no one's complaining about
something then you know it's generally
okay you know and I've got to get a hair
light I know guys my head like my head's
gone it smelled Linson yeah and blends
in with the background I know this I
know this I'm actually going to go to
Bunnings Warehouse local hog whistle
pretty much after we finished doing
these live streams back-to-back I'm
gonna get a like a just a lamp and bang
and I got any some like decorations in
the background here to make it all fancy
and and you beaut you beaut have you
heard that yeah it's a short rib
beautiful yeah you beaut you like a
beauty it's an Aussie saying you heard
that a lot in your lifetime right can
you do an Aussie accent to like I like
it when you do yeah and now I give a 5
seconds and then it starts blending into
an English accent and then I'm like why
do I go from here
yeah that's going pretty crazy right
yeah it's crazy we're gonna have we're
gonna stop this stream and light we're
gonna go over to Greg's channel start
streaming over there oh I'll try to make
it as cool as your setup I'm gonna fix
the stuff back here I'm gonna get
after-hours like that little sign you
got there in the front I love this sign
I need something like that it's
aesthetic this means that someone turned
here works on yeah that's what I need a
neat that works IRL baby alright guys
thanks for tuning in to this one of
course it's the first dream I think Greg
was a little bit nervous I'll show you a
little bit nervous man like I didn't
hear a little bit that we need more
banter coming out soon little bit of
banter coming out of I need to disagree
with you on / yeah that's it nay to
disagree I think you're like of black
ops 2 is disgusting yeah there we go we
need more of that and be like yo what
planet did you come from
actually didn't even do conspiracy
theory this week we always go down
conspiracy theory Avenue
so did we do like last week I didn't
even talk about it last week a lot not
last week last time a new live stream
and it was chromosome 2 that everyone
wanted to talk about chromosome 2 did
you know about chromosome 2 I know her
no wow you go dude you're gonna get into
this conspiracy stuff apparently with
aliens engineer dude ok 10/10 for hats
ready to go apparently we were
engineered from alien race and it's like
pretty conclusive apparently yeah it's
like telling me or telling me a
confusion in the chromosomes so like
we've got 23 I think 23 pairs of
chromosomes apes have like 24 and like
where it fused was like when they
started examining it it was really
suspect it like that kind of fusion
doesn't happen naturally in nature and
so you look at it look at it man like
look we got that we've got no missing
link between Apes and humans and then
we've got all this like ancestry stuff
about aliens all the calligraphy I mean
like half life 3 is confirmed you've got
three enigmas there and so chromosome 2
confirms that there's 3 half life 3 is
confirmed now you're cheating look dude
you're ah you're gonna get research this
after all this is yeah see this is a
funny thing this is a funny thing I was
expecting you to go a bit of a joke
tangent I'm like you know Greg ain't
being like joking here he's like can't
really prove I mean you can look at the
what we see right we can look through a
microscope and see something but we
can't explain why it's this way we can
just kind of like fill in the pieces we
can that's how that's how we did it with
ancient humans right with all the
different just hominids evolutions of
human stuff to this point we have proof
of those things we have actual skeletons
and and you know trace DNA of these
ancient humans and I'm filling in the
gaps talking about how we got to where
we are now that's the thing we can't
really explain it is we only
these like snapshots in history we you
know and in my geology classes we
touched on this more than once with
regards to Ray is Greg Charmaine Greg's
enemy like researching chromosome 2 oh
yeah and as his live stream fascinating
stuff some too it's just second crumbs
yeah and there's just
yeah it's chromosome 2 conspiracy theory
I'm a big believer in a man I reckon
we'll engineered from alien it's an
extra pair of chromosomes well it's a
fusional so you go you know I know but
don't don't apes have you said apes have
a second have an extra pair atoms yeah
yeah we do downs people with Down
syndrome people with Down syndrome have
an extra chromosome much man like I'm
not going to going to that man I'm
pretty sure pretty sure that there's
something like that when you've said
that they have extra pair chromosome
like I'm pretty sure Down syndrome is
like that's what happens when you have
down syndrome the chick no it's okay
anyway we're gonna go off live stream
now I'm gonna get something to eat
you guys let us know how many people
went in Google chromosome to Sara can
lay everyone waking googled it and as a
real man it's real it exists and we love
you guys we're gonna catch you next week
for another text show so this is sort of
like the the time we're gonna do it
Sunday Saturday night we don't have any
lives so we figured we wise we'll pick
up the people who is like us and don't
have a life as well
and go figure and also in Computex as
well if you guys are coming to copy text
me and Greg we're gonna have like a
party or whatever we'll have made up so
make sure you come to Computex can be
awesome this year's gonna be nuts gonna
be off the chain good and you'll catch
you guys over at Greg stream and yet
chromosome two that's this way we had to
drop it man the people lost it for it
last time
and yeah bombshell my brain is racing
yeah bombshell just demon that's it
Steve this is it she'll just dropped on
tech wall TV baby that's bringing the
world here I need something like that on
my half now dang it now I gotta find out
how to match that yeah there you go
arabela we'll get you on this direction
