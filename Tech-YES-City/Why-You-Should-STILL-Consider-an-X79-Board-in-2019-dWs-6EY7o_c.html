was released in late 2011.
And it boasted some big upgrades over X58,
in the means of not just
getting rid of the Northbridge,
but also having things like
Native SATA 3 on board,
as well as PCIe Gen 3 support.
However, in 2013 there was a Xeon variant
that was released on this architecture,
that was eight core, 16 threads,
and it was overclockable.
The irony of this was there was never
a consumer i7 desktop variant
released to the public.
And here's the funny thing,
in 2018 I used this
CPU in my main computer
for editing videos, despite
me also having access
to the 9900K, and also the 2700X from AMD.
So today's video is
gonna be a prelude to the
upcoming comparisons which is gonna be
a three part series, I'm gonna talk about
why would someone even want
to consider X79 in 2018.
Let's take a look.
(upbeat music)
Welcome back to Tech Yes
City and first things first,
this X79 platform, it is
not a value for money play.
In fact, unlike X58 I don't
really see X79 motherboards
with CPUs and RAM coming
up for really good deals,
and that people aren't
really chucking them out.
In fact most of the
best deals on X79 I see
are people deliberately
selling the motherboard,
CPU and RAM in sort of
like a bare bones combo,
for instance on Gumtree,
for 400 Aussie dollars
which is a little over 250 US dollars,
you can get 32 gigabytes of DDR3 memory,
a six core Sandy Bridge-E variant,
and also an X79 Sabertooth motherboard.
And although this is a
pretty good deal in itself,
it's still not the best
value for money when we look
at some of those deals
that we get in the past,
with X58 where people
just throw out those PCs
and not realize that those X58
motherboards are really good.
So with X79 I don't think you're going
to be getting a good deal
on a good motherboard.
For instance when we
go on eBay and we look
through the motherboard list,
there are Huanans for
sale and anything with a
decent name on it whether
it's Gigabite, MSI,
Asus or ASRock, would
usually command a premium.
In terms of overclocking
and getting enthusiast
performance out of the Huanan boards,
I've tested one of these
motherboards in the past,
and they're pretty
lackluster, I'll put the
link up here if you
haven't seen it already.
But basically they only
support dual-channel memory,
they don't officially use an X79 chipset.
I do have another motherboard
on hand which I'll
be doing some testing on,
which is called the Running,
that's supposedly meant
to be an upgrade on that,
but even then putting an
eight core 16 threaded Xeon
on these imitation boards
wouldn't be recommended
in my opinion, instead for me personally
I am using the Rampage Extreme Four.
This is a pretty much top
of the line X79 motherboard,
and I picked this up on a deal
where I got it for around
300 Aussie dollars.
I also managed after that to pick up one
brand new in the box,
for 350 Aussie dollars.
Now you're probably gonna stop me there,
and you're gonna say well that's crazy,
why would you spend that
much on the motherboard,
when we look at an X470
motherboard where you can
pick that up for around
150 to 200 US dollars,
and then you look at also the Z390s
where you can get a decent
board for around $200 as well.
That's coming in under
the price of these good
X79 motherboards and also
the CPU's themselves,
the 9900K is currently going for 530 US
and the Ryzen 7270X is currently going
for around 309 dollars on Amazon.
So the CPU prices and
the motherboard prices
aren't looking too good for
this X79 setup I've got here,
because when we look at the 1680 v2 price
the cheapest I can find it
for is around 400 US dollars,
and yes, that is how much
this 1680 v2 still commands
in 2018 and this is where
another element comes into play,
these CPUs and also these X79 motherboards
are worth money because
that's what they sell for
on the marketplace, they
have pent up demand,
and pretty much with the 1680 v2,
it is the best in slot CPU,
in my opinion, for X79.
You're not gonna get a
better CPU for high end
single desktop power usage
than this thing right here.
Now another benefit of
this, which I've tested
in the past and we're gonna be retesting,
is of course the DDR3 memory,
and it's low CAS latency.
This has quad channel memory support,
so the bandwidth of, say for instance,
DDR3 1600MHz memory will still be equal
to that of DDR4 3200MHz
in dual channel mode.
So that's one great benefit of X79.
Another awesome feature
of this chipset itself,
is essentially using an ECBU,
it does have PCA Gen 3 support,
and now you get 40 lanes
itself direct to the CPU.
For instance, you can
have two graphics cards
in full 16 x support, as
well still have 8 lanes
left over for other things.
Whether it be PCA NVME,
which, yes, it does work on this platform,
and you can feed that
data directly to the CPU,
getting no slow downs. For
instance, on my main rig,
I'm using a two terabyte, 970 EVO drive.
And the performance is
absolutely incredible,
and yes, this is a boot drive.
Keep in mind, you do need a modified BIOS,
which is uploaded on the
web, and they're out there.
But this was baked into X79
when they initially designed it.
So when we look at X79, this was really
leading the forefront of technology,
sure, you can say that
they've upgraded since,
to the DMI 3.0 from DMI 2.0.
And that's where the USB 3,
for instance, the controller
is still on the chipset itself with X79.
So, if you're running USB
3 through the chipset,
there'll be a slowdown in the DMI link
between the CPU and the chipset itself.
And this is true, except,
as we said before,
we do have 40 lanes
available with PCA Gen 3,
as opposed to the Ryzen 7
2700X, which only had 20 lanes,
and also the 9900K, which
only has 24 lanes, I believe.
And also, on top of that with X79,
you've got USB front out
connectivity, as well as
Native SATA 3, and a lot of
USB 3 support at the rear.
And then there's the argument of,
well there's now USB 3.0, there's Type-C,
there's also ThunderBolt 3,
and even the DMI 3.0 link
from the actual CPU to the chipset itself,
which on X79, admittedly
it's only got DMI 2.0.
But, all that aside, for
what I do personally,
I do not need the DMI 3.0 link speeds.
When I've got those NVME drives
going directly to the CPU,
feeding the data, and
when we look at USB 2,
if we're gonna use our mouse, for example,
this is when old school rumors,
I don't know if you have
guys heard about it but
you use a USB 2 for your
mouse instead of a USB 3.
And that's because it had
to go through the chipset
in the case of X79, and
then get fed to the CPU,
as opposed to the UBS 2 slots,
which are going directly to the CPU.
So in this case, yes,
we would use our mouse
to reduce input latency
through the USB 3, and then
we would simply just use our
NVME drive on a PCIe slot.
And so when we do that,
we won't have to incur
any slow downs from DMI 3.0
versus 2.0, for example.
And then we look at USB 3 versus
3.1 or even Type-C for example,
and these speeds don't
affect my everyday workflow.
for example I've got
flash based memory cards,
which hook up to a controller
and then they copy data off,
and the USB 3 speeds are
more than plenty enough
to max out those memory cards, as well as
when they connect external
SSDs to the computer itself,
USB 3 is still plenty fine.
So with all these new upgrades on Z390
and on Ryzen side X470,
they don't apply to me,
and they don't affect
my workflow whatsoever.
However, when looking
at X79, the last thing
I'm gonna talk about in today's video
is the enthusiast nature of this platform.
We're getting CPUs like
the 1680 v2, for example,
which have base clocks at 3 gigahertz
and we can take that all
the way to 4.6 gigahertz
with a decent cooling
solution and good motherboard.
That's over a 50% gain in clock speeds.
You look at the 9900K or
even the 2700X, for instance,
the 9900K you get 4.7
gigahertz out of the box
on all cores with a good motherboard and
good cooling solution,
without even doing anything.
You try overclocking that to
6.5 gigahertz on water or air,
it's not gonna happen, you're
gonna need LN2 to do that.
You try going from 4.7
gigahertz for example,
on a 9900K all the way up to 6.5 gigahertz
on air or water, and
it's just not happening.
In fact, the most you'll
really get out these
is probably an extra three
or four hundred megahertz,
where you can take it
to 5 or 5.1 gigahertz.
So, the overclocking gains in 2018
on these newer CPUs really aren't there.
Furthermore, when we look in the BIOS,
in the settings needed
to get a proper overclock
on X79 for example, there was much more
than just the simple three
settings of jumping in
and changing the CPU
multiply, CPU core voltage
and setting in your X and B profiles.
You're required more finesse in my opinion
even going from X58 to X79
was a more simplification of
overclocking, in my opinion.
So when we look at the
upcoming comparison that
I'm gonna be doing in a three part series,
of eight cores versus eight
cores versus eight cores.
It's gonna show that 2013,
a whole lot of things haven't changed.
Of course, in the 2700X
and 9900K you do get those
new instruction sets, I believe it's AVX2,
FMA3 which isn't available
on the Ivy Bridge-E.
But even then, those same instruction sets
were introduced in X99.
So in closing with X79,
it's gonna be that one exception
to used price performance,
where the price is pretty
much going out the window.
So when it comes to the
upcoming videos and comments,
I really don't wanna hear about
the price performance in this case,
more so much the 2013
versus 2018 wow factor,
in that I wanna look and really see
on single and desktop users,
how far performance has come.
And I can tell you from
using this personally,
I don't think it has come that far,
but we're gonna be testing out things,
not only just benchmarks
like gaming and productivity,
but we're gonna be testing
out input lag as well,
which I do have a feeling
that we could've gone
slightly backwards from 2013 to 2018.
All will be revealed in the coming days,
and I hope you enjoyed today's video.
If you did, the be sure
to hit that like button
and let us know in the
comments section below,
have you ever tried X79,
or does this video bring
back some nostalgic memories?
I guess it's one of those combinations
of nostalgia mixed with relevancy,
because I feel like X79 is still relevant
to someone who wants
the latest and greatest.
Anyway, we'll be finding out very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.
