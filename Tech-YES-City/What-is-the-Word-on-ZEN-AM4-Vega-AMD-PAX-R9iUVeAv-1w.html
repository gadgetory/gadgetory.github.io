so we're at pax and this is day two and
I'm joined here by Dawn hears from AMD
he is qualified to speak on some things
involving zen and also some upcoming
products from AMD so what do you got to
say to the audience well I know
everyone's super-excited about zan and
of course then is attached to the
upcoming am-4 platform and that am-4
platform will see the light of day in
OEM systems starting on September 5th
you'll start to be able to buy these
these are of course our next gen
platform supporting ddr4 2400 of course
USB 2.1 you know gen 2 nvme all the
newest i oh so this is our first
launching of that and for platform on
desktop now it won't be available in a
channel for some time we haven't
announced that availability but in OEM
systems it'll be the first chance for
people to see what what our next gen
platform can do so the OEM release is
coming first you guys heard it from AMD
themselves that's coming in the OEM
system so we want to see summit ridge
until a little bit later that's the
overclockable CPUs on the platform and
then the cost of motherboards obviously
coming out around the same time exactly
we haven't announced a date for those
things but they'll be coming out
together in the channel you know when we
have some Ridge available obviously
we'll have platforms for it and stuff so
you can build your own from the parts
but for now it's all bundled OEM systems
in theory those sockets those am-4
socketed systems would accept a summit
ridge processor but of course we'd have
to I mean that the kV it is the OEMs
would have to support that with a bias
flash and we can't guarantee that but
and also the recent benchmark we saw
from AMD with the the summit ridge cpu
being up against the 6900 cave from
Intel we saw eight cores vs 8 cores 16th
reds verses 16 threats now I did speak
to Don yesterday and that was in
relation to the blender benchmark and
the aim d actually came out in front by
a little bit yeah we did zens looking
just amazing it's very exciting time for
us we're really excited to bring that
product and market where we can actually
really offer something relevant to the
really high-end enthusiast space again I
know a lot of people have been asking us
for that and we it took us a little
while but the process technologies
caught up with us and and it's really
exciting how well this parts come out
internally we've been very very excited
for a long time but just a little bit
more of a wait so it's just a little bit
more of a way for Zen I know a lot of
you guys are pumped out there I myself
and pumped I'm wanting to get one of
these motherboards one of your CPU
overclock it see how it works also any
word on Vega as well I know a lot of the
enthusiasts are waiting on the top end
AMD graphics card there ah I don't think
we can say anything more about Vega yet
except it's looking good also the only
thing we have talked about this weekend
at pax is a availability of the new FX
8302 that's a cpu we previously offered
in asia now it's available in the rest
of the world full eight cores a great
little part 95 wats so not not at the
top of our power draw and with a nice
high 4.2 gigahertz boost clock so agree
we've actually got it running VR in the
background here so some other questions
you guys wanted to know was about the
obviously those stock prices coming
through the roof recently with AMD which
would signal have come back and one
thing that I've noticed from behind the
scenes is AMD also acquiring a lot of
talent now I speaking with done before
and he was working with tom's hardware
for approximately 10 years was it with
the GPU side of things and I know Scott
Watson's on board they've got a lot of
new talent coming in I think this is AMD
making a really big push it is a really
big push we are trying to fit people in
high positions of Scott Watson's amazing
that he's the first guy to really take a
hard look at you know frame time
variance so that kind of input is really
I think what we need in the in it in the
GPU industry I think I think he's
helping push us in directions we really
need to be going in so I mean you know
anytime you can get somebody of that
caliber it's great and of course as we
go on and gain more market share back
with Xin and and am for I I think we'll
see that trying to continue for sure in
earth and now before we get out of here
I will just introduce you guys to Jerry
as well he's actually going to talk
about the RX fourth series and how they
come out with a bang
we've seen the RS for a teacher's
selling out everywhere over the charts
no the RX 470 introduced and the 460 and
they're actually taking a head-to-head
with him video with the GTX 1060
especially the 480 right yeah of course
I mean like our arcs for a year for 70
and 460 of X done really well in the
market like we I go on newegg com every
day and I'm seeing them like out of
stock like every single day so I mean
that's a testament to how well their son
i mean like we targeted this to the
majority of gamers eighty-four percent
of gamers are looking for you noticed
mainstream under 200 allah cards and I
feel like we've really hit the mark on
that one well definitely the sizzix
agree with AMD actually pulling ahead
with some enthusiasts market share their
so that's a great thing to see them
crawling back in the market especially
where they need it i think with the big
strong word of mouth comes from those
gamers and those people who actually
know a lot about tech would you agree
they've been doing a quite well like a
i'm actually not too sure about the
sales numbers for that but i honestly
like if more people are buying them
they're they're seeing like how great
are enthusiasts products are and i mean
that trickles down to more and more
market share it's all good for us that's
what we want to see aimed a more market
share more good news for you guys
because that means better products more
competition love it thank you thank you
very much anything you don't
AMD has been acquiring a lot of talent
we are in the worst part of the arena I
think we got a rock band here we got an
announcer behind us so thank you for
doing the interview my pleasure man but
for doing all the gravity and those
people who actually know a lot about
tech would you agree a circus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
