entry-level keyboard which comes in at
80 USD or 119 Australian dollars though
one has to question whether this
keyboard is worthy of a spot in the life
of the yes man well let's find out
welcome to tax vide this is your yes man
coming to you guys today with another
keyboard review though this time it's
coarse as entry-level Cherry MX red
switched ten keyless solution so it has
the 10 num code keys on the right
missing making it a bit narrower than
your standard keyboard though with this
model coming in at 365 millimeters wide
by 170 millimeters tall it also weighs
in at 1.1 kilograms so it does have a
little bit of weight to it though what
about the elevated key switches well of
course they have decided to go with the
Cherry MX Reds in this model which
actuate about halfway down enter a
linear switch with ABS key caps the key
caps allow the static red LED
backlighting to show through there's
also a red backplate underneath the keys
which allow the red light to shine
through and looks quite good especially
in the dark I have found typing on all
the keys to have really good consistency
and also be very rigid in that there was
no flexibility and all the keys and the
way they have been implemented in the
k63 are all top-notch that's the noise
on this keyboard I found it to be about
midway between that of a blue switch and
that of a top-rate though I'll let you
guys take a listen the responsiveness of
the keys however is only a flash behind
that of their new cherry MX speed
switches which Corsair using the K 95
Platinum Edition which actuated a
slightly higher point than that of the
Reds so this is something the
professional gamers looking for every
bit of advantage may want to consider
with the K 63 versus a higher-end model
I personally prefer the higher actuation
points even though I'm a scrub has been
nowadays when it comes to professional
gaming looking at the top of the
keyboard Corsair ever included media
playback keys a window
is lucky and also a brand new ski that
allows the three different levels of
brightness adjustment I personally
preferred max brightness kind of late
one is to prefer mr. max powers to miss
the no game and on the rear side of the
keyboard you get four rubber feet and an
additional level of height adjustment
there is no wrist rest included with
this keyboard and the cable is a good
two meters in length testing out the k63
and games showed it to be just like any
other mechanical keyboard when gaming
and that is a matter of opinion and
what's best for you though I will say it
was a good experience when playing some
csgo very responsive and also very easy
to use though I do feel like your mouse
is a much more important choice if you
are serious about being competitive
the included q2 software also allows you
to change standard keys to different
keystrokes and also program individual
macros the lighting effects also allow
for multiple effects at once where you
can adjust speed and opacity of those
effects though on this keyboard you can
only do that in the color red
lastly Corsair claimed this keyboard has
anti-ghosting properties and full and
key rollover and with my super spam test
it performed very well missing no keys
at all so when it comes down to it the
key 63 is a solid keyboard from Corsair
one with consistent build quality all
throughout the keyboard was an easy
matte black look as well that doesn't
soak up any fingerprints and sure there
are cheaper options out there for
keyboards especially ones with knockoff
clone switches but I don't think that
will be as consistent as this keyboard
is the only thing I'd like to see on the
K 63 in the future is the use of speed
switches instead of the Reds though that
is just a personal preference and I
think it is price it is a great option
for someone looking for a premium
keyboard but doesn't need the features
that more expensive keyboards have
especially if you aren't going to
utilize those features anyway and better
still there is the option to assign
macro keys with the software and you
still have the backlighting to see your
keys at nighttime or in a poorly lit
room anyway guys the k63 at its current
price point definitely gets the nod of
approval from me and let me know in the
comments section below what keyboard are
you currently using and why I love
reading your comments as always and if
