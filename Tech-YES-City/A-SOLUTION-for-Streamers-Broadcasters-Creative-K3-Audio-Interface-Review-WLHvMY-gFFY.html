have the Sound Blaster k3 plus which is
creatives attempt at making an audio
interface for streamers or people who
want to do voiceovers record or even
people who want to go to karaoke and
sing so today I'm gonna be recording
directly from it going through all the
features and also doing a comparison
between this and also the current audio
interface that I use at the moment this
is the edirol you a 25 X now think about
the 25 X and the thing I love about it
enough use it for so long it's got an
onboard compressor built-in and so
essentially that'll fatten up your voice
make it even so in post you don't have
to process it and whatnot but for 130
dollars it does come in at a pretty
decent price considering you got two XLR
mic inputs you've also got two
individual
headphone outs as well for individual
monitoring with their own volume
controls so we compare that against the
skull at 2i2 which is a very popular
unit at the moment that is a hundred and
fifty US dollars of course the U a 25 X
that I use I got that for about $30 used
in Japan you currently can't buy them at
the moment but let's go through a tour
with this device and see what we can do
and actually see what makes it pretty
special when it comes to an end streamer
who just wants to get into streaming and
have some cool effects available
welcome back to take your city guys I
got this thing on the desk here the
sound blaster k3 plus we're gonna go
through all the controls and what it
features here two XLR front inputs and
also a quarter inch jack inline in there
which you can use with a guitar for
example and you've also got your two
headphone jack outs which 1/4 inch - got
the volume controls for them right there
when I can't touch them since I've
already normalized them and also your
mobile out Jack as well for controlling
that mobile in Jack if you want to use a
4-pole connector with your mobile phone
and get input to this device you can and
then you can control the volume of that
with this knob here 48 volt power we're
not going to turn that off for reasons
being I'm using the condenser for this
actual review and then moving over to
the left here we have an interesting
button called the sound board so let's
press that and now we get access to a
heap of different sound effects which we
can use on the fly double tap ok and
then we can turn that off and we've got
our sound board effects I'd like to see
creative maybe add in the solution if a
firmware or a software solution to come
in to add your own sound effects in and
then flash them to this advice that
would be awesome but we've got the
voiceover feature as well apparently it
cancels out background noise we'll test
that later when we hook it up to get
some measurements on the output and
input of this device itself so then
besides that we have the treble and bass
volume turn that up get more trouble
turning it down eliminate some treble
and also bass same thing so if you have
a mic like the BAE ring and b1 which I'm
using now is actually a little bit bass
anemic so we can turn that up just a
little bit
and turn the treble down just a little
bit and it'll balance out the microphone
quite well of course we got the volume
knobs for our inputs there I'm not going
to touch those for reasons being that
I'm again using this device to record
this review okay so if we press the
reverb setting now we can move along
with that change and if we want to
change the reverb effects so if you want
to sing for example
so there we go
now we can turn that off of course that
is your reverb effects so now on the
right here is the auto-tune setting and
before I turn the knob we can go through
all the different settings and I'm gonna
say I do not know anything about
auto-tune never used it before but we've
got all the different settings and I'll
just quickly flick through them for you
and in here just changing my voice in
what is known so you can put this on C
and then you can sing for yourself a
little song and the same way we turned
it on so that's pretty much the bread
and butter of the creative k3 plus easy
to install very simple to use also has a
very low signal to noise ratio so you
plug your microphone in you shouldn't
have any people complaining about noise
with your condenser microphone I know
I've tried some audio interfaces and
even some USB stand alone condenser
microphones in the past when you turn
them up they introduce noise and that's
something you just don't want especially
if you're live streaming having to
report this thing doesn't have that at
all it's also good a 96 kilohertz 24-bit
output so what we're gonna do now is
gonna move over to the main desk test
this thing out and see the frequency
response curve because maybe some people
don't want to buy it just for its
condensed a live streaming functionality
maybe some people want to replace their
onboard audio or even upgrade their
sound card for example and they want to
see if this is the all-in-one solution
that they can need so let's jump across
now
right now okay so it's on right now and
I'm gonna keep smoking and then I'm
gonna try and turn it off right now okay
boys over is off was there any
difference let's find out so we just
finished the voice-over effect and I
thought that made no difference
whatsoever I'm not entirely sure what
does but at the same time I wouldn't buy
an audio interface for that feature
anyway for me I'd like to see that
button change to a compressor button if
anything and guys if you need to remove
background noise from your recordings
then you should be buying a dynamic
microphone not a condenser microphone
condenser microphones will basically
suck in all the noise in the whole room
of course the further you get away from
the microphone the more tinea becomes
but the last thing we've got to check
now is the crosstalk levels and I'm glad
to say that they were phenomenal over 65
DB difference so left and right channels
were separated perfectly all up to a
volume of 100 and the best news is that
the frequency response curve was
phenomenal as well there was basically
no bass roll-off up until 10 Hertz and
then after that it rolls down to zero
and it's also a very smooth curve and
then of course up to 20 kilohertz it's a
very straight line and a smooth roll-off
- so in other words this is gonna be a
very flat very good very rich sound
going to your headphones and of course
with that volume level it's going to
power even high-end headphones quite
nicely so this is a unit that will
double down it's not only a recording
device but an excellent replacement for
an onboard audio unit or a sound card or
even onboard audio itself in a
motherboard so here's what the onboard
camera audio was sound like obviously
very tinny I'm sitting about two meters
back from this thing it's going to sound
horrible but let's switch over now to
the bearing of b1 going through the k3
plus so now I've been using this
combination for the majority of this
review you probably already used to it
it sounds very nice in my opinion
I love the sound going into the k3 plus
from the bearing of a1 of course this
microphone is a very good value for
money option a little bit bass anemic
and a little bit treble like very
slightly so you can actually balance
that out with this unit itself however
it doesn't have a compressor on board
let's compare that now against the UA
25x
which does have a compressor on board so
now I've got the babe ring of B 1
connected directly to my edirol you a 25
X the compression nozzle is set up
around about two-thirds of the way up so
here's a little test of what this will
sound like and so we can jump back now
to the creative k3 plus and you guys can
analyze whether you think this Audio
Interface sounds better or the k3 plus
sounds better because I'd love as much
as I analyze it myself
to hear your feedback in the comments as
well so we're closing out the k3 plus
from creative is a tight little unit
comes into 130 bucks comes in 20 dollars
cheaper than the scarlett 2i2 which is a
very popular audio interface out there
at the moment I'm very impressed with
what I've seen here with the numbers and
the frequency response curve but also
the noise coming into this unit itself
so if you want to get into streaming and
you want something that's reliable
simple and easy to use this has
definitely got a lot going for it plus
it does look really cool on a desk as
well very simple black design with that
brushed aluminum on the top so it is
made of hard plastic and metal too I do
like the design I do like the simplicity
of this thing creative have done a
pretty good job with the k3 plus there
was for Aussie and UK pricing I'm not
entirely sure yet I will update the
description below when I know more about
those details but any guys that's about
it for today if you enjoyed this video
be sure to hit that like button let us
know in the comment section below what
you think about this microphone going
into the k3 plus lover and your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
and then we can move on to auto-tune and
it's many different modes and see the
frequency whisper and usually mobile
phones have their four pin which is
works and then we go here on the right
ensure that our knowledge no cool well
