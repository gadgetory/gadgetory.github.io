just coming back to you guys today with
a review of the Altech 109 mechanical
keyboard so this is the cherry blue
model now there's a lot of there's been
a lot of craze with the mechanical
keyboards as of late and I think it's
because they're just a lot better for
your fingers like they offer more
consistency and they're also you know
coupled with you know mechanical
upgrades they actually are better for
gaming is they do offer better response
times with the N key roll over and the
ps2 up option as well so this keyboard
today is called an L tech 109 so here's
the box here and as you can see here
it's got blue sort of this cherry MX
blue switch there's two models for this
they have the black and the blue so if
you're in Japan this will set you back
about $80 or lakhs in an account go in
and the black model I thinks about
nana-san Yaya Quinn and I got this from
Amazon so Amazon are awesome in Japan
they offer really good warranty and
replacements and stuff that I know my
guys first off looking at this keyboard
guys picking it up it has good features
so it's got Pierce - as well Pierce -
full and key rollover support it's got
USB as well 1.8 kid meter cable so it's
really good lengths for a cable about
the right size it also has four orange
keys so if you want to replace your ASD
W keys you can and it also comes with a
key pool which is really convenient so
and add another bonus it comes with a
wrist support as well so overall let's
let's take a look at the wrist support
so it does you know it's just basically
with the box it's really neatly packaged
so it came packaged with this and it's
really just you just get the Box the
wrist rests and the keyboard and the
extra keys pretty much now this wrist
rest is nice and rubberized so it feels
really good it doesn't feel cheap at all
feels really sturdy guys the keyboard is
really heavy it's probably 1/2 kilo so
it's actually a really heavy keyboard
now I'm gonna put this on my desktop
soon so you guys can hear the clicks but
yeah I the reason I got the cherry blues
is because I remember I tried I'm out in
the store about a year
and I did like the blues the best
basically the Blues offer a nice balance
so they're good for typing they're good
for gaming they don't they're not that
heavy so the keys are really soft Reds I
think are the easiest to press and then
obviously Browns and then blacks so
blacks being the hardest I wouldn't get
blacks because yeah after gaming for a
few hours you your hands will probably
get tired so I think blue offers a
really neat balance now this offers two
levels so if we look here guys first
we'll look at the keyboard this offers
two levels of adjustment which is really
cool and it's you know it just feels
really good so they got rubberized
bottoms here it just feels really solid
really well put together keyboard
unfortunately there's no backlighting
but you know it's only $80 and a lot of
the competitors that are offering $80
keyboards don't offer the number pads at
all so I like that they're packed all
these features in especially these extra
keys so that being said guys let's let's
put this keyboard to the test and see
how it performs I'm gonna be using the
PS tube and because you know offices if
it offers better latency than USB 2 so I
know use that and now lastly I'll
explain the full and key rollover so if
you don't know that is guys it's
basically if I press all these keys down
at once it'll register every key press
USB to only usually I think office 6
keys at a time max so if I press more
than 6 keys down and learn the register
the first six keys that were pressed so
if I press all keys down on this
keyboard it will register every key that
I pressed which is better good for
gaming so it's a really good gaming
aspect for when you're moving you know
you might be moving and hitting a
grenade shooting reloading all the same
time clicking all these buttons they're
not registering and you're gonna be
having problems why you're getting so
yeah not to mention this has none lock
and it has caps lock and scroll lock so
it has all your simple features of the
keyboard so yeah let's put this keyboard
to the test and
check it out okay guys so as you can see
if we look up close there's the four
keys removed I'm going to replace them
with the orange keys and as you can see
there's the cherry blues right there so
if we look here so there we go looks
pretty good okay so let's put the keys
on and then show you the keyboard okay
guys so here's the keyboard in the flesh
turned on now the wrist part actually is
it feels really good so it's really nice
wrist rest it comes with a really nice
wrist rest the lights up in the top
right hand corner here as you can see
I'll just give you a closer look at that
they work really well so they let you
know when you've turned on your caps
lock your num lock and of course your
scroll lock so really good feature I
like this a lot I do like those lights
up there so and here's on the right
here's a Microsoft Economics so that's
what I use every day normally so this is
gonna be on you keyboard for I guess
everything so let's put this to a test
guys so just give you a nice good feel
of the sounds and stuff now the only bad
point so far is that these keys don't
actually fit properly I try to put it
putting them on before and they just
don't fit I think one of the keys fits
properly which is this one here this
actually fits properly but the rest of
the keys actually don't fit the keyboard
so I'm going to take a little little bit
off for that you know and like why
include something if it doesn't fit so
anyway let's have a look at any
everything else on the keyboard so I
guess if we sit here and we sort of just
bring up I guess a Word document or
something okay
so okay say yeah if you can see it feels
really good
like there's nothing really I can false
without this so it feels awesome guys
the the keys and everything on it feel
really good so the keyboard looks to be
well built this space bar is a little
bit small I think because I usually like
to build my right hand but that's not to
worry I'll probably you know I think I
can get used to them anyway that's
that's the I'll take guys so if you're
in Japan you're looking for the Altech
if you're looking for a mechanical
keyboard I'd have no problems
recommending the Altech mechanical
keyboard so pretty good keyboard guys
overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5 simply
because you know they install things
that don't actually fit the keyboard so
these orange keys don't actually fit
which is pretty stupid I don't know why
you know I guess they didn't really test
that I don't know B I tried fitting it
to my ASD keys and the only key that fit
was the W key so anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this cube or this review about
the mechanical keyboard and if you've
got any questions about it guys leave in
the comment section below and of course
if you want to know anything or you got
any requests let me know and I'll do
them as soon as I can anyway this was my
birthday probably wondering why I get
this keyboard I got it because my it's
my birthday coming up soon him my wife
bought it for my birthday so pretty cool
present yeah I guess
peace out for now wait sorry and lastly
we'll just do a quick comparison between
the typing sounds so let's
so that's the that's the cherry blues
and then on the right we have so that
you can feel they're completely
different this feels more just yeah I
guess mechanical it feels really like
you can really know when you're clicking
you know you can really tell the
difference between you know these
keyboards and this keyboard so overall
guys you can hear the sounds - one more
time okay so it's not that noisy it
really isn't that noisy Namine so
overall I do recommend this keyboard
guys so hopefully you enjoyed this
review guys and peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
