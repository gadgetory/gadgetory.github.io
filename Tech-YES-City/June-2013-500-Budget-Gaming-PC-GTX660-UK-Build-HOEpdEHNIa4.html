Brandis coming back to you guys today
with June 2013 500-pound budget built
and we've come under 500 pounds this
month so amazing value for money let's
get stuck into it everything that's
going into this build is quality as well
so let's have a look the azuz m5 a 970 s
and 970 and the @ + 3 + motherboard it's
also got USB 3 so it's got USB 3 it's
got a good onboard audio solution as
well the realtek alc889a it's got a real
Techland control it's gonna be fine it's
gonna give you the basics to gaming and
you may even do a little overclock if
you wish to get in you know to the
enthusiast side of PC and PC gaming so
very good guys are very good for the
money oh yeah and you ever get a UEFI
BIOS there as well so it's really good I
like the value of this board at 55
pounds it's very good value for money so
great great buy there there's only one
left so if you're watching this and
you're gonna get five hundred pound
budget build get this motherboard ASAP
so if not you can get the asrock 970 d3
i think it's like 53 pounds as well
that's a great alternative if this if
you don't get this exact one here so
let's move on to the other other case so
this is the in win case you've got front
panel USB front panel power button front
panel audio meshed front looks great the
big fan here you get like big 22
centimeter fan this is just gonna cool
your components really well I mean a lot
of people in some of the people in the
review sets cheap but you know at 40
pounds you're getting all the cooling
with this as well you're getting all the
fans as well so you know you got one at
the front one inside one in the rear I
mean you just got so many fans that come
with this so you're getting for fans
like you're getting the big-ass 22 not
22 centimeter but you're getting the big
ass fan on the on the panel you're
getting the two fans here you getting
the fan at the front you've got the
extra extension there for the graphics
card if you wish to put it in in the
future I mean you've got you can use
this case in the future as well you've
got to cut out there for the CPU in a
cooler install it's really good you got
the clips they're really good case for
the money this is what I'd be going with
let's go to the next part of the build
now so that's 42 pounds of something
that's pretty damn cheap so it's a good
good value for money case this time
around these coulomb are I mean sorry
the Corsair CX 500 so CX M so the M
means it's modular and I mean it's only
as well as like two pounds more than the
CX 500 and it's modular so you're gonna
pay another two pounds they get in
modular power supply which is gonna make
your build a lot more cleaner so you
won't have all these cluttered cables
lying around so it's I do recommend it
there's only one left so be quick again
get that power supply if you don't get
this one then you just grab the standard
CX 500 there 80 plus bronze as well
they're gonna save you some money on the
power supply and 500 watts is gonna be
plenty enough for the build we're doing
today and it's gonna power this graphics
card absolutely well this is the gtx 660
now this is a hundred and forty-two
pounds so in a video with the 7-series
release they're bringing down the prices
of the six series and I really like the
price of this car the 660 GD x talking
about it's just a really good card it's
at a real good balance especially 142
pounds I'm gonna recommend it over the
7870 because it's just so damn cheap at
142 pounds you're the overclocked
edition from gigabyte so you know it's
really good plus you know it'll give you
a idea of you know with the CPU you can
overclock in both you know buy a fan CPU
fan if you've got extra money and you
can overclock this as well get into the
whole enthusiast this this 500 pound
budget bill just screams potential it
gives you a lot of experience to when
you want to step up to the high gear so
this will play battlefield 3 all those
games at 60 frames per second or 1080p
monitor in ultra or high it'll be a
really good card really good value for
money this is what it just it's it's
screams value for money sir great buy
there 442 pounds so in stock as well so
that's probably wanted that and the
power supply pretty good I mean that's
the probably the best buy today that
that's really good value for money that
in the hard drive as well so the FX 6300
now this is like 20-something pounds
cheaper than the XFX 63 50 so the FX
6350 is essentially the same thing but
it's just clocked higher and it's rated
at a higher TDP so you can use the FX
6300 and probably overclock it to 3.9
gig anyway with that motherboard the
Zeus motherboard is going to support
those overclock so you just essentially
paying 25 pounds for nothing so I'd
rather recommend this the FX 300 over
the FX 6350 it's a better Buy especially
at 90 pounds and it's great it's gonna
it's a 6 core processor 3 modules it's
going to run games really well
especially coupled with the 660 great
point they're great synergy so really
good balance and I like this processor I
really do I like where it's at it's a
very well valued processor for the money
so let's move onto next plug build
Western Digital one terrib
a hard drive this is the caviar blue 50
pounds this thing is a steal I mean if
you don't have a hard drive already to
get one of these if you already have a
backup hard drive then get an SSD
like seriously SSDs are just amazing
this is Western Digital I love Western
Digital said before I'm a 1k pound
budget build I'm always gonna say it I'm
also gonna recommend Western Digital /
Seagate any day of the week so that's
just my personal experience and a lot of
my friends as well that's up that's our
experience with Western Digital so
anyway
great great Drive they're from Western
digi and get that for 50 pounds so
really good value for money
also the LG DVD writer if you already
have a sada DVD writer then you won't
need this but if you don't have one then
you're gonna need this for the OS
install really good or unless you're off
course you're installing from USB which
you can on the 970 as well since it's
got a UEFI BIOS you can definitely do a
USB install but whether you can get the
windows on in this USB Drive is a
different story so that you know it's a
little bit complicated but you can
definitely do it but this is recommended
this is just recommended for 12 pounds
it's cheap it's gonna work it's gonna
backups and DVDs if you need it to and
that's that so it lasts part of the
build is the RAM this is the corsair
1600 megahertz or c l9 1.5 volt ram i
recommended this in the 1k pound budget
boot
i'm gonna recommend it again it takes
excellent value for money you're getting
two sticks or four gig they're for 39
pounds very good it's gonna be in stock
in June the 12th so it's gonna be three
days but it's worth a three day way it's
there's such good value for money so you
grab this it's low profile as well it's
gonna fit in there's gonna be no
problems if you wish to install CPU
cooler in the future excellent value for
money just this month around this
month's probably one of the best 500
pound budget builds in terms of value
for money it's just insanely cheap and
that leaves the whole balance so the
whole whole build comes to 482 pounds
you know that's under 500 pounds so if
you have extra money and you you know or
if you can sort of if you already have a
case or you already have a power supply
then save yourself money on that and get
yourself one of these for 66 pounds 128
gig SSD they are going to make a
difference in your whole user experience
not for gaming pacifically but just be a
whole experience on using a computer
installing programs especially
installing games you know just
everything loading up windows loading up
the games loading
levels everything's just gonna be a lot
faster than a standard hard disk drive
so really I do recommend SSDs if you can
afford them but if not it's no big deal
just yeah so that's the whole build guys
so that yeah that's the whole build
their leaves the whole total to four
hundred and eighty two pounds and forty
seven quid excellent value for money so
anyway I got a boot I gotta go and times
of the essence so if you like this bill
please give it a thumbs up if you have
any questions please leave a comment the
comment section below and I'll get back
as soon as I can and if you haven't
really subscribed take your soon hey
what are you doing yeah I guess these
over now like</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
