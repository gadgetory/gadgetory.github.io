Betty
welcome back to take a city this is
biryanis coming back to you guys today
with a review of the SIF Betty which is
a mini ITX case and it's a JDM product
so that means it's not sold anywhere
else in the world now this thing retails
at $60 and for $60 you are getting a bit
of product for your money
however since as I said in the intro it
is a mediocre case and that there's a
lot of good there's a lot of bad and
it's all mixed in together so throughout
this review I'll be talking about the
good and the bad and I'll be mixing it
all with each other so let's have a look
at the first the point the aesthetics
and the build quality when I pulled this
thing out of the box it was packaged
pretty well when I pulled it out it was
like yeah damn it's a pretty sturdy case
like it feels pretty well built the
front of the case is nice it's like a
nice meshed look here which is good for
venting air as well and it also looks
really clean we've got a cutout here for
a 5.25 inch optical disc drive which
fits in no problems has also got clips
to fit this ban which I really like for
ease of access but however it kind of
makes me wonder it's like who's kind of
gonna be sliding in and out a disc drive
all that I don't do it that much at all
I'd say it'd be more convenient to do it
for the hard disk drive anyway well
let's get back onto the review we got
the power button here and the
all-important power button the click
feels good it's got a nice I think it's
got support for blind people as well
with those little points there to let
people know it's a power button anyway
we've got two two USB ports there we've
got a mic in and a headphone out jack
we've got the subtle hard disk drive
light and it's a nice red subtle look
however the bad thing about this next
light to it is the power light this
thing is just simply way too bright if
you guys are going to be using this for
a home theater PC which is pretty much
its only application this case then you
might want to disconnect this power LED
it is just simply too bright when I was
watching movies in low-light it was damn
annoying so let's look at the mismatch
now this is another point that I do not
like about this case it's got is some
like cutouts here that kind of look
really archaic kind of like from the
Egyptian hieroglyphic Age so I don't
like it that it's kind of I wish they
just used men
on the side here as well and they kind
of really small I don't think they could
vent a lot of air the actual paint
though looks a little bit different from
the or the finish looks different than
it is to the front which is kind of like
a styling mismatch as well that being
said the rear of the case again the
styling it looks pretty bad we've got a
simple gray styling on the back which is
not a problem because you don't really
see the rear of the case however when we
move over to the side of the case here
it's also a gray as well and so if you
want to mount it like this that's not a
problem however if you want to mount it
like I do and flat and put it in the
cupboard then this kind of gray thing it
kind of stands out if you look at it or
if you can see it especially in a glass
cabinet so that's kind of not cool yeah
not cool at all also looking at that at
the end of the case here there's just
simply no cutouts for fans there's no
fans included in this case so this is
gonna reiterate my argument of this
thing is only good for a home theater PC
moving on now probably to the worst part
of the case and that is inside we get
the power supply now this is this thing
is absolute garbage it's rated at 300
watts and it says that it has 16 amps on
the 12 volt rail but it doesn't like I'm
telling you now when I put an under
vaulted Pentium that's right i under
wanted my Pentium 2.9 volt i under both
the RAM - like 1.45 volt and everything
was running well on my 650 watt power
supply when I did this I put a 750 Ti
through it as well and this thing on a
hundred and forty watts load from the
wall which is not even what the power
supply is delivering to the system it
cut out and I mean this was like after
about five minutes so the fact that this
thing cut out it really scares me
because that has the potential to damage
your components so it cut out once I
never used it again however when I just
decided to hook up just the Pentium to
the motherboard and just the RAM and one
drive on one optical disc drive it
actually ran pretty well I mean this was
a 50 watt loads
on a home theater PC this power supply
is okay and that's about it
I wouldn't even put an APU through this
power supply so keep that in mind like
if you're using a hundred watt APU
I'd just be careful I wouldn't do it so
anyway the power supply garbage I mean
yeah not foreign and anything slightly
enthusiast based however let's look
inside the case when we look inside the
case we see here a nice clean layout you
get you put your four screws in you and
then you can then lay down your mini ITX
board everything went in with ease we
look at the top of the case here we've
got a cutout therefore a 3.5 inch hard
disk drive you can also fit an SSD up
here however there is only one of these
bays so you can only fit one hard drive
in this case which is a bit of a bummer
we look at the top of the case lobe
we've got kind of like we really got
this rail here on the side and that's
that allows you to fit a 5.25 standard
size optical disc drive which is pretty
cool for me because I didn't have any
slimline DVD burners lying around so I
was good when I could actually fit in my
DVD drive and save some money and it fit
pretty well it was sturdy however one
thing to keep in mind though if you do
fit the optical disc drive then you're
gonna need a low profile CPU cooler
something like the Intel stock heatsink
fan is absolutely fine it'll fit however
anything taller I'm gonna work with
caution it won't fit so maybe like
you've got literally at probably about
maybe five centimeters of room there
without the drive you probably have
about nine centimeters so that's up to
you guys if you want to use that so
looking down at the bottom of the case
here we have a cutout here for a PCIe
graphics card or a PCIe and IC or
whatever you want to use however when I
try to install it's only a single slot
and it will only fit something that's
low-profile do not forget this because
when I went to fit my 750ti
the dual slot cooler it was just a
complete fail it didn't fit on the
length and it didn't fit on the depth so
I was kind of like damn but it did fit
on the width so that's one thing that
did fit so I mean you could fit a slim
low profile grab his card in this case
however if you're gonna couple it with
this power supply
recommend doing it so another thing as
well is that this case does not have any
options for cable management so
something to remember there however
managing cables is there wasn't many
wasn't much of a problem however it just
looks a little bit messy so in
conclusion I will say that this case is
what it is I mean it's a $60 case and it
does come with a power supply and it is
pretty well built however if you are
going for anything even slightly
enthusiast based then I'd recommend
putting your money elsewhere however
let's talk about the good with this case
I mean look it is small it is really
small and I like that
the styling is kind of a bit of a mess
but honestly for a home theater PC and
for $60 this thing gets a recommended by
if you're looking for just a home
theater PC couple this with a cheap mini
ITX motherboard and intel pentium and 4
gigabytes of ram and you're good to go
you've got yourself one little tight
home theater PC so in in in
recommendations I will say for sis I'd
like to see them maybe put in a better
power supply and definitely maybe put in
maybe make this black and make the
styling more of a whole meshed look and
also add support for a dual slot CPU
cooler
I mean jus a dual slot GPU and you'll
have an absolute win of a product so
that's all I'll say it's kind of like a
bit of a mess but hey for $60 it's good
but I'd like to see sis release like a
flagship AM ATX case that's like a
hundred dollars and improve on those
things and this thing honestly be really
good anyway I'm gonna try it my next
enemy MITx case I'm gonna try as the
silverstone Sugo I think if you guys
have one or if you know if you've seen
one let me know how they are because
yeah
again I will say the size of this thing
is pretty impressive I mean it's pretty
light as well so I've been carrying it
this whole review also the next review
I'm gonna get done is the motherboard
within this I'll make that quick as it
wasn't that impressive this case kinda
wasn't that impressive either I did have
some big hopes and I was kind of like a
bit disappointed I've also got the MX
100 review coming and you guys are
probably wondering what happened to the
be one well that unfortunately died like
literally I got TechTalk done and then
it died Lyle's lucky i'll i just started
doing this review and i was like one
minute in and I was watching the first
part is like hey the microphone doesn't
work so anyway it's dead and that's
about that it's not the preamp as well
because I'm using this off the print and
so anyway by by bearing a be one and
hello to the shore sm58 it's only
temporary I am thinking about getting
MXL 770 a better condenser mic or I
might just borrow the 82 or 35 for
another 8 months from work who knows
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
review if you did please give it a
thumbs up if you want to know anything
about this case then let me know in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you guys as soon as I can and if
you're not a yes man already then hit
that sub button and become a yes-man
today anyway I'm gonna roll the outro
and peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
