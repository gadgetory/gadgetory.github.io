from Philips you can pick these up for
around about fifty dollars and people
all over the internet are raving about
how good they are
but exactly how good are they let's find
out
welcome back to tokyo city ladies and
gentlemen this is brian coming back to
you guys today with a review of the
philips s HP 9500 s now this is sort of
for me it's going to be a mixed bag
though ultimately for the money these
are very good headphones so first off
we'll go over the build quality then
we'll talk about the sound quality and
also the comfort and all that juicy
stuff solely in the SHP 9500 s
themselves they're made of plastic and
metal and the design is really good
they're extremely comfortable they're
extremely flexible and honestly I wish
Philips had have done this design on the
philips x ones the fidelia's I found
they were just too fatiguing after a
long time however these on the other
hand are extremely comfortable and you
will not get any neck fatigue after
using them for long hours so they're
very comfortable looking at the top of
the headphone you've got here Philips
written on here and it's kind of like a
hard plastic that they've used below
that is a head strap there for comfort
which is kind of this cloth material
which is touted as being antiperspirant
though in practice I find this material
made my ears sweat a lot especially
compared to my Fidelio L ones or the
previous X ones that I've used in the
past this same material continues down
to the ear pads which are non removable
which is kind of a bummer since I would
like to honestly take these off once in
a while and run them through the washing
machine so it's kind of a bummer as they
do absorb sweat and it kind of has this
even after using them for about a month
now I've kind of got this little bit of
a gross feeling to these ear pads though
that being said looking at the side
we've got a really nice design here with
a little bit of metal integrated with
plastic and you've got the L written
there on one side and there are written
there to let you know which is your left
and right looking below that you've got
a 3.5 millimeter jack which will allow
you to make this headphone with a V mode
of burn pro so you can essentially have
one awesome gaming headset now look at
the adjustable headphone here you've got
a metal clip in here which is very solid
and it's very nice like I like the
feedback that you get from this clip and
the actual clamping force is actually
pretty loose I'm surprised I would say I
have a medium-sized head and these clamp
on
just at the right comfort they're very
comfortable lastly about the design they
are an open-back headphones so noise
will leak and however the benefit is you
will be able to hear everything around
you if you're at home I consider this a
good thing though if you're out in
public
I consider this a bad thing so that
being said everyone's probably wondering
how do these headphones sound brain and
I'm going to tell you straight up that
they sound very good in all kinds of
genre the the sub-base is kind of
lacking though that's to be expected on
an open-back headphone the bass is at a
nice little level you will get some
decent bass out of these headphones and
the mids are still there they're still
solid medicines one thing I love about
Philips is they always consider the mids
in all the headphones I've tried the
Fidelio ones the Fidelio x ones and now
the sh p 9500 s they always hit that
mark on just giving used nice solid mids
now one thing about this is the treble
is a little bit up there though I found
it to be quite comfortable still
especially compared to some of the other
headphones I've tried in the past I like
where the treble is out as well I'll try
and pull up a frequency response curve
for you guys but you can see honestly I
had no problems eeeek ewing down the
treble a little bit and making these a
very balanced sound I know some people
have put cloth mods on there and felt
mods on there to reduce the trouble but
your mileage may vary
I honestly found these headphones really
nice out of the box to listen to EQ or
non eq'd though lastly people are
probably wondering how's the 3d imaging
how do they sound are they better than
the Fidelio x ones and the answer to
this is quite simply no I do not
consider these an x1 replacement or an
x1 contender
I remember having my X ones on and the
3d imaging on that was superb it was
phenomenal
they're in a different class I still
consider the Fidelio X ones and most
likely the Fidelio X twos which I
haven't tried yet I still consider them
on a different level though how do they
compare to the Fidelio L ones I would
say they're around about the same they
have similar soundstage in my opinion
though these have a little bit more
juicier bass and they're a little bit
warmer and honestly I do like the
material inside the Fidelio ones a
little bit better than these they don't
tend to sweat as much and the isil
a little bit better though I don't care
about the isolation too much as long as
I can hear things outside so on all
these headphones are quite simply
phenomenal for fifty dollars the quality
of the sound that you're getting and
also the decent 3d imaging for fifty
dollars is really superb not to mention
that they are an extremely comfortable
headset though I will give them I will
deduct some points for not having these
ear pads being replaceable at the very
least not even removable if I have to
try and remove them I will break the
headphones so that is a bummer because I
do believe they're absorb sweat though
they tend to absorb a lot of sweat and
they become kind of yucky even just for
me after using them for a month so again
your mileage may vary though they are an
excellent headphone for fifty dollars
and if you want to couple them with say
a $30 v motor boom Pro then you'll have
one awesome gaming headset for under
$100 now that being said guys I hope you
