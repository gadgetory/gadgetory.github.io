lounge and sorry about that little
technical difficulty before and that was
my bad i bugged all my audio and I got
everything else switched off and decided
to not give out an audio input at all so
my bad anyway how you don't get are
doing good bright hey um just make sure
everything's going good this time again
hopefully should I mean um we've had
that Mike from a few times now yeah it's
my bad this is what happens when you do
a show in the morning you just wake up
you you do forget it is my day I
apologize sincerely guys I say yes so
what's up what's been happening in the
last week give me some tech related
stuff what's been going on uh I just was
checking out audio back man oh yeah it's
good now everyone saying it's good night
grace good oh yeah i did my another
rising video i'm testing out a rosin
against the ricin 1700 within Eric's for
ad against fraud well II that was just a
funny video I mean I wasn't planning on
making I was planning on doing a memory
speed video since everyone had been
asking me to do that I'm checking memory
speed with risin which everyone was
really keen for me to do but the isus be
350 prime plus motherboard i had would
not oak up the memory no matter what i
did i tried everything and it would just
wasn't happening and that motherboard is
a nightmare so i just gave up and made
the other video instead which was
testing with the RX parading it that's
what i ended up doing what we're gonna
talk a little bit of that memory in a
second we'll talk a bit about that
because there's a lot of like just a lot
of stuff getting thrown around there and
some of its good some of its really
accurate some of it i agree with but a
deal on the other hand there is like I
guess these expectations of reviewer
talk a little bit about us soon but in
the last week as well man I've been like
content has been slow and I apologize
guys it's just yeah I going to get my
blood test results back today so I'll be
able to find what was the root cause
of the the plague that i got from
mosquitoes i got some plague so I'm
still a little bit tired still reeling
from it but the headaches the massive
like head exploding headaches are gone
so you don't have to worry about me my
head exploding so that's pretty cool
okay you're like not existent again but
we'll move on straight into the first
time we've gone straight into the first
time I give memory and rising so I got
spam this length there's a guy called
mind blanked a con YouTube yeah he's
made a good video because i like this
straight away he gets into the video
shows his overclock straightaway so the
guys like look this is what I got this
is where it is and then he starts
testing performance after that so good i
like i like the first frame like in how
he says he's got his memory up to 3,600
or eighteen hundred megahertz and it's
at 1t now that's the thing i'm going to
focus on the 1t okay because this is
like okay because Linus did a video just
recently too and he said in the comments
to like people said Ivan you got an old
boss and he said he updated the Bison he
still couldn't get their memory higher
still now from my experience 1t 3600 at
won t is like really good memory right
that's extremely good memory so you know
you've got to go and spend money for
that Leigh if you just go to Amazon for
example and just banging ddr4 memory yep
give me some of that cheap you know give
me some of the cheap stuff mang like
give me some of the values stuff here
like wherever it be this start like just
if you get the value stuff right the you
know whatever if you want to bang in the
cheapest crucial sticks grab four sticks
of that for 26 bucks 100 bucks you got
four sticks or you get the Vengeance
stuff if you want to get this memory
this is like the you know this is the
entry value level stuff if you want to
get this and then expect three thousand
six hundred megahertz 1t timings you're
probably going to be out of luck because
a lot of the times the companies like
here like try and z corsair platinum
Dominator this is the bin stuff they're
bending their memory and they're giving
like they're selling it for a higher
premium because that's why i guess
that's a smart thing to do you'd want to
sell your higher performing stuff at a
higher price
so I guess the majority of people are
going to be going out I dare I'd say by
the value stuff and it goes to say I'd
say Darren said 2666 won t because
that's about where all my memory goes
I've called I've got run-of-the-mill
stuff here like I don't have any super
special memory here and so I'm guessing
that's what Linus used but maybe I
actually don't know what's he actually
memory used but he got speeds here but
if you've got for instance the Trident Z
3600 this isn't too bad for 170 bucks
but it's still a seventy dollar premium
over the value stuff you're still paying
like seventy percent more for stuff that
goes 600 megahertz higher and that even
then this stuff isn't guaranteed to get
one T I don't think because I don't even
say the command rate timings so it's a
big thing with the command rate timings
because yeah 3600 tip 1 T is very
aggressive if you've got some of that
memory you've got some of the good stuff
and now there's a lot else that goes
into it right it's not just like a cpu
where every CPU that's sold is the same
right you've got our rising r7 1700s and
they're all going to be the same some
will overclock hiya Simon overclock not
as good and so within that you've got
with memory a different kettle of fish
because there's you know the amount of
layers of PC be used and whatnot that
affects the overclocking as well because
you get more interference if you've got
less layers of PCB in there so generally
the more you pay for memory the better
quality memory you're going to get as
well and that will affect overclocking
so it's like walking into a tailored
suit it's like walking into a tailored
suit store and then you know if you if
you're looking for this kind of memory
it's like the guy coming up to your
straight away in st. would you like
cashmere wool you know would you like
would you like the most expensive suit
out there what are you going to say keV
if you came into my tailor suit store I
said here yes I can't get let's Taylor
you up a cashmere wool suit what would
you say I mean are you gonna be paying
for it is all I can't know you'll paint
you're paying for it you're paying for
it ah I mean that would be that would be
nice but um yeah would you ask for the
budget options would you say Amen I want
to see your other ways
yeah yeah of course I mean that Kashmir
is pretty expensive unless you're
getting it tailored and like Vietnam or
something then it works out pretty good
but um the yeah yeah you definitely
would I see I see the analogy of getting
at this to see what I'm getting at do
you think the title of this video should
have been cold rising on cashmere wool
yeah exactly yes it's I think that's a
good Big Al Leiter I think the whole
argument with it is quite um with these
memory speeds and all the rest of it is
it's an interesting point and it's
definitely something different to what
we've seen before because Intel if you
guys are not aware the Intel chips don't
react that well with the faster memory
reactors sort of the wrong word but they
don't you don't really see many gains
there um jumping from ddr3 to ddr4 we
certainly saw some but within ddr4 just
speeds alone you don't tend to see a
huge difference maybe half a frame or a
full frame difference in speed whereas
with brazen because the infinity fabric
it's looking like it's quite
considerable you may see ten percent
gains or things like that of course I
want to test this for myself before I
comment on it too much and because of
the problems I had before but that video
is up coming but the yeah I from what
I've seen and from other people we've
talked to like Steve from hardware I'm
box who's been testing this out quite a
bit as well it does seem like this is
something that people should prioritize
now with their rice and cpu is trying to
get a good memory fast memory that is
now but also be a motherboard that can
actually handle it because a lot of
these motherboards are having problems
with it if you're on be 350 for example
as well you're going to run into the
ceiling
I suppose you would say a lot quicker
since most be 350 s are limited to three
thousand two hundred megahertz memory
whereas X 370 you can go up higher than
that so yeah it's it's it's definitely
an interesting thing it's it's making
memories feed more relevant again
because no one really cared about it
before you wouldn't have people really
talk about their memory speeds so much
it was mainly how much memory had but
now sort of people are carrying again
about memory speed so yeah will be
interesting to test us for myself well
I've already incidentally I tested it
when I was doing my overclocking
tutorial and I was doing a benchmark I
forgot to lock in the XMP profiles after
I was doing the overclocking tutorial
and yes it makes it like in my case it
made like eight percent difference going
from 2133 to 29 33 so there's definitely
a difference there I just wonder like
I'd say the majority of people are going
to be getting on 26 662 2933 now the
BIOS updates are making a difference as
well basically as far as I see the BIOS
updates at the moment they're allowing
people with better memory to get higher
overclocks now whether or not you have
better memory is up is you know that's
up for you to find out that's up to you
to find out for yourself you know I mean
you can't just come in and expect a bias
update to magically let your memory run
up to 30 600 megahertz of 1 T because
again that is a very aggressive setting
not all memory is going to go to say
like not even anywhere near all the
memory is going to go to 30 600
megahertz 1t that's a very aggressive
timing for ddr4 but tuchi that's what
I'm looking out for when are they going
to release an update or if they're going
to release an update that allows to t
command rate timings because that will
then allow a lot of people to get to 30
600 megahertz a lot of people but that's
the thing within that within rising
itself this is what worries me a little
bit i mean it's a concern i don't know
if it's going to be true or not but is
it possible that due to that jewel CCX
design is it possible that there's a
guess a delay kind of like ECC memory
that's already inherently input into the
whole platform so essentially one T is
the best you can have because
don't know if you can have three T
timings on ddr4 yeah yeah yeah it's
definitely interesting one thing I would
say of notes you guys as of right now
though this will probably change in the
future is you need to be very careful
about which motherboard you pick for
your eyes and see for you because we are
seeing a big discrepancy and how good
the motherboards are going from one to
the other so far from what I've heard
from lots of people around the industry
and lots of my youtuber friends and that
the isus motherboards are having big
trouble guys they just really are
there's no two ways about it I've run as
these motherboards in the past and love
them but their am for motherboards are
having big trouble damn they just say
order to be 350 yeah yeah that the be
350 is prime plus I was testing was just
a disaster Steve had massive problems
with his ex 370 crossair so you yeah
just just be very wary of them on the
flip side even though I haven't tested
it while Brian can attest this the
asrock boards are getting very good
reviews they're doing very well the MSI
ones as well ms is doing good and I've
tested okay bye Boyd end and the
gigabyte seems pretty decent um yeah I
didn't have too many grudge so that
still still few little bugs in there but
it seemed pretty good for the most part
what's happening is there a strums
little sad thing is I've only used the
asrock boards Asif I haven't actually
had any experience with all the
motherboards hit on on rising I've only
used the asrock ones but from what I you
know I talked to Wendell he loves his
Azeroth touchy like he loves that thing
so that's good enough for me to know
that asrock are making good boards so
yeah in my experience I just I have
probably had these infant problems and
stuff but they could all be solved like
I could all solve them from my end which
is what I love about the ads were aboard
his even if it does have a problem I can
solve it so and then it's no more yeah
no longer a problem and that's really
good for an infant stage you know
processor like risin so in platform yeah
yeah yeah it is it is still good i would
really like to test these rocks because
i'm hearing they are the main ones to go
for ya on that right now but you guys
also do need to be aware of the
limitations of the b3 fifties not just
within the mother what manufactures but
just in general I you will be I think I
I would go as far as say if you are a
true enthusiast you will feel limited on
the be 350 I'll just put it that way in
terms of features and specs you would be
much better off going for the X 370 for
those that are just gamers or don't
really care especially if you don't care
about overclocking and you're always
just going to be running a single GPU
then sure stay to I'm be 315 you should
be ok but I personally as an enthusiast
and I can probably speak for Brian as
well we would stick to the x3 70s
personally if we were going to build a
risin wreck yeah I would stick to like a
Tai Chi i love that board like after
after overclocking with it it's just a
beast of a board i would personally go
for one of those building a rising rig
which i'll hopefully in the lake the
next two days i'll be building my
workstation reek but as for the be 350
I'm yet to test it so I can't really
stay my opinion on it yet after I try it
out i'll be making some recommendations
with it so hopefully it's going to be
good i'm really looking forward to the
be 350 i think that's where a lot of
people are sort of keeping their eyes on
at the moment because it's sort of like
the budget end they want it to perform
well especially with like a cheap six
core cheapie core that's where people
want to put that I guess all their eggs
in the basket SB 350 I seven 1700 or the
r6 was 16 the non X the cheap tix cool
yeah yes okay they're sixteen hundred
years at some that's gonna mean see I
mean should we just quickly before we
move on next topic just talked since
we're ah communities memory here testing
rising five very soon what do you think
of the four new risin five CPUs you get
the 26 scores and the two quad cores
which 1a uomo
exciting you were still keen on that
1,600 a the nine XX Corps yeah the
budget six quiet I thought that's even
if you looked at it I think we looked at
it last week even if you look at it from
a pure price performance standpoint it
is the best from what I can see with
those pricing figures it even beats at
ba it even beat beats out the eight
cores well and the good thing about that
too is you got let to less cause it'll
use less power when you drop it on a be
350 so that's why I thought with the be
350 plus the six core it was going to be
that match made in heaven kind of thing
for budget gamers even people doing
budget video work I mean that six core
will be killin it even for video work
the majority people do in Premiere Pro
and stuff like that will be able to do
fine on a 6-core i mean i'm using my
fork or at the moment while I build the
workstation wreck for course handle
premiere profile the 5.45 gigahertz at
the moment can get 5.1 bits like yeah
point what's the point yeah so yeah yeah
yeah I mean it's pretty much like a
kazoo coming from a 6800 k anyway or is
the 6850 k 68 yeah I got the budget 6100
yes so six core to begin with so um yeah
I think it'll be very very good I think
it will be another chip that will be
perfect for the creator's who gained you
know people who are wanting to you know
do productivity stuff and gaming I think
it's going to be excellent for them
especially if they're people that are
going to read more on a budget um that
don't want to go up to rise and seven
and dreamless as was i think stream is i
think the six calls very mystery nice 26
yes streamers streamers or like it so i
think that'll be pretty good the quad
cause i am quite I'm it's gonna be very
interesting with them I'm not so sure
about them because that's starting to
get into Intel's bread-and-butter area
in terms of the 7700 k and a 7600 k for
all their heat issues that we talked
about that is still a very those are
still very far CPUs for gaming very fast
aren't and when
to go down to a quad-core you start to
lose a lot of the productivity people
because they'll always train towards six
and eight core or higher ah CPUs so
getting the quad core for productivity
is probably going to be stopped making
less sense so then the the main focus in
terms to gaming and how could they are
that and that's where I'm having
reservations I think it might run into
some trouble they're going up against kb
lake or even compared to sky like for
example like a 6600 k so yeah I mess
we've seen though again I'm not going to
speculate too much on the performance
that we actually got it I do want to
actually disable the whole CCX and do
some different different testing not
your mainstream testing but that'll come
soon so yeah basically if you guys are
want to be like the enthusiast beast man
on rising platform then I'd recommend
going out and getting some more
expensive memory Dara you know that way
you can get the best speeds on your
memory and you know that you can jump on
forums you can jump on reddit you can
just tell everyone about your lead
overclocks like this yeah but you're
going to pay a premium for that just
understand that's all yeah so we move on
to the next topic here though you've got
you sent me this year the rumors there's
a an x 3 90 and possibly an x 3 99
motherboard now the thing is but before
we get on to this really really rumor
mill stuff I think even the maker of the
article himself said he doesn't even
believe it's true but it is interesting
to see I think there is some substance
here though I think there is some
substance definitely does some of it
does make sense because it's like AMD
have hinted at having a 16 core
processor and they could definitely
target the market with quad channel
memory too right so yeah yeah I mean I
mean you got to take this article with a
grain of salt guy so you know this could
be completely made up but it's cool to
think about anyways yeah so if they're
that this top diagram we see here
obviously you can tell the quad channel
memory there and they're also saying up
to 44 pcie lanes which is pretty up yet
pretty impressive compared to x99 s40
that you can go up to with the top ones
yeah i think all them actually accept
the 6800 key from memory so yeah that's
interesting honestly that will for the
average user you're not going to care
about this to be perfectly honest quad
channel and all those lanes you're
probably not going to really care about
but for those ultra enthusiasts or crazy
productivity people that yeah crazy
crazy productivity that's about have to
say crazy crazy productivity people that
they will look at this and be pretty
happy um that's a lot of memory could
have in there you know actually going to
be going crazy as far as you notes as
well that's right sorry just just do the
PCIe lanes though that is a legit thing
because I know a lot of people use up a
lot of pcie lanes nowadays like you've
got you know you have someone with a
PCIe ni see for example you've got
someone with the PCIe m2's pci you know
two graphics cards you've got one for
dedicated work 14 dedicated outputs
there's a lot of people out there with a
legit need for more than 20 or 24 BCE
lens so that could be itself a selling
point for this for people who want to go
on AMD and then they want the more pcie
lanes i think straight away that could
be a good selling point for this
motherboard with the soccer day and 44
yeah yeah for sure I think this this
shows up a lot of um the X 3 90 anyways
it shows up a lot of the complaints
people were having with X 370 compared
to x 99 in the sense that you fairly had
the dual channel memory the PCIe lanes
weren't really ideal for a lot of people
I give it 2 x 99 so I think it's just
filling in that if they're going to be
pairing this with a 16-core then the
productivity is going to be insane so
that will
be good also but yeah it's it's an
interesting thing if this turns out to
be true which I would like to believe it
does it will put Intel's Broadwell II if
it's if it comes out by then but by this
time you'd think it might be X 2 99
might be out and sky like X might be out
by this point it's going to put in till
in a bit of a funny situation with their
higher end extreme series CPUs Intel's
really going to need to pull something
out of the bag because Cuba leaks going
to be fine and still well not about fine
but it will carry on however I have very
serious worries about Intel's
productivity platform um they really
need to hit back with something very
good and not just that but they with the
ex 390 the Andes looking to bring out
the other one x 3 99 this looks like
it's going to be a jewel socket design
which will be crazy Jill CPUs that
allows the 16 core processor so well
until can fight dirty nuts until can
fight back easy this is drop the prices
yes I mean that has anyone ever thought
about that's the easy solution for in
telling just drop the process if they
want to compete but I another thing on
this am 44 one thing that I'm worried
about here is that is this going to be
for CCX modules on the cpu and then for
your ex 399 you've possibly got your 32
core whatever so you could 16 cores
together you just doubling up the CC
exes every time you double up the core
count that's something that I'm curious
to see because I mean to CC X's is kind
of like where people I'd say would draw
the line okay it's fine AMD we've got
our dual CCX design CPU it's kicking
arse and productivity and gaming but
when you go to a 6-core a 16-core sorry
and then you that keyboard is
obnoxiously loud to you you got to get
some quiter switches bro I so so sorry
Isis people in the chat was saying it's
some sky likey it's aight aight
used to say that but there I've spoken
to different people at Intel but they've
been quite tight lipped about it but
from what I've been told its sky like X
they're changing it from a to X so yeah
sorry carry on Brian yeah it's just the
Emperor will send you over some like
membranes or even these creative ones
i'm using at the moment they're very
quiet he'll do a little typing test for
you see it's quite right yeah yeah now
that's pretty good okay so okay so
anyway do you think it's going to be a
quad CCX design and if that's why mental
people draw the line at 16 cores and
they're like okay well I'm getting for
four cores like that's a bit too much
for gaming it's going to actually be a
detriment to gaming now it's only going
to be pure productivity do you think
that's a possibility what do you think
they go on with yes yes and for John
yeah now I agree with that it's not
gonna be for gaming I don't know but I
think they're going to go with a quad
CCX design that'll be crazy yeah yeah I
do yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah because
I'm I think it'll be I mean from what
we've seen from productivity from rising
7 um why not if it's designed entirely
for productivity why not the
productivity scores are phenomenal so
yeah I think um no it'll be very they
did call it infinity fabrics so with
that infinity right just means we can
link up any number of CPUs or CCX
modules kind of thing maybe they hint
into that too I'll be interesting so
yeah yes so that's and the it's already
going to be quad CCX I believe with
Naples think that's been confirmed like
a I can't remember but um yeah it's
going to be pretty crazy I think um yeah
it'll be interesting to tested it when
they come out but but the one thing you
guys need to remember with this if
you're getting a little bit hyped is
this is not going to be cheap I doubt
these extra 90s will be cheap and the 16
core will not be cheap this is going to
be squarely aimed at that high high-end
super high-end market see in say New
Zealand Australia you got to start
imagining this
views i would say at a guess we'll be
coming in at maybe around the 1500
Australian dollar mark maybe something
like that this would probably be quite
expensive and x 3 90 I also imagine be
very expensive also by comparison to the
x 37 e which is actually somewhat cheap
when you compare two x 99 and CA it's
going to be for those people not not
average users as we much too expensive
for them well the dual cpu socket design
that's for Wendell so oh yeah that that
one won't even be for consumers yeah
hope you know that it'll be for the
industry it won't be for the public as
much it so personally is just when we
move on here to cabby like X the 70 70
40k I think they're going ahead with
this with x 99 x 2 99 sorry x 2 99
platform details so that looks like they
actually going through with this for
core which is a little bit weird for an
x 2 99 board I mean I don't know anyone
is going to go out and buy next 29 on
board then buy a fork or I mean again
someone who strictly needs the PCIe
lanes but how many pc Eileen's feelings
does it have is it going to have 40
something yeah I think um yeah yeah I'm
believe these kb lake x cpus will bring
jewel channel memory and probably the
same amount I this one's really strange
to me I don't know what really the point
is aside from getting the chipset
upgrades going from Z to 72 x 2 99 it
would have to be busier Elaine's I can't
think of anything or than you yeah it
has to be what I mean that's about it i
just don't really I mean intel has
probably done the research on it and
figured that people want this but I I'm
kind of scratching my head of where this
falls into their lineup mmm maybe it's
to combat rising I guess if you were
someone who picked up a rise in five and
chucked it in
supposedly in the future that x 3 90 it
would be to combat those types of people
that want the pcie liens but yeah i'm
i'm kind of scratching my head that
scene is very very strange the sky like
X of course that will be this the
upgrade from Broadway Lee they're saying
is going to be a six core a core 10
corso the same old we've had before
they'll probably make some adjustments
there be a bit faster bit more IPC gains
field things but it's probably going to
be nothing to impress so the main thing
we're going to be looking for well I
could also be for myself than anything
I'll be looking for an X 2 99 is those
upgrades that the CPU wise we're going
to see not much difference I imagined
but the chipset upgrades themselves
might be very good x 2 99 looks like
it's going to coming with some crazy
features rumored to have pcie four point
oh yeah although I think it's a bit soon
since this thing it's going to be coming
out in August I didn't think they'd have
it ready by then but who knows they
might surprise us that might be there on
ace up their sleeve at Intel so X 2 99
should be coming out soon and it's been
a long time since broadwell they sang
August I spoke to a rep it until he told
me August as well someday it almost
seems like when it's coming out but if
it does include pc a four-point-oh that
will be a very good selling point then
um but do not okay like not a game as
though I don't really think like maybe
maybe maybe I mean maybe if you're
looking for like super future-proof kind
of thing like is the way the way the
graphics card industry is going we've
been seeing every year like gains men
gains on gains that's why the 10 ATT
I'll go look at this custom bad boy lee
that half the backplates missing that's
how that's how that's how unorthodox I
am but I've ready tested this thing it's
so good i used a thermal grizzly on it
really like awesome it's so good i don't
recommend doing it at all but just you
know why not kind of thing it's actually
pretty cool up the video coming up soon
probably in the next couple of days but
where was that going so yeah the way
that yet and i gave that a good review
cuz they grabbed the gains
they're on the graphics cards so maybe
pcie for kinder could make some sense
because the gains man which every year
we're seeing massive massive gains bang
bang more MORE as opposed to CPUs we're
not seeing that it's just like little
trickle little trigger well yeah it's
like it's like so it's like someone's
standing on the hill and like this like
you know just heaps of people begging
for coin and he's like just trickling
out you know like one cent pieces like
you know like that sort skirts what's
going on this is people want more and
they're just not getting it fit on the
grammys card market you know that's like
this standard on the top is just rolling
out a hundred dollar bills you know so
yeah yeah no I get that that's quite the
one thing that's interesting about Intel
is it seems like they're overlapping
wouldn't you agree a lot of their
product lines seem to be overlapping
each other we've seen it with the like
these key be like ease or okay be like X
was it yeah Katie like X i should say
that's sort of an overlap with their
obviously their normal kb lake 7700 KS
and stuff but also we've seen it you
cover this quite a lot brian they
overlap with the i3's and the Pentiums
yeah it's a funny thing intel's doing
right now it's like they're trying to
over saturate the market and they don't
mind if they overlap their own products
with it yeah well i mean see they're
probably seen as well a sale within our
own companies better than a sale to the
competition so they're probably like the
g 45-60 honestly that that hit really
hard i don't think that's going anywhere
to i think for 2017 that cpus already
cemented like wow you know you recommend
that thing it's not going to get a whole
lot better than that for budget budget
and gaming because it's such little paws
sips power it doesn't even use that much
power can be coupled with a real cheap
motherboard some cheap memory and it's
going to perform really well for a
budget game old someone look into place
and sears go dota 2 and get good frame
rates and even play some of the latest
titles absolutely no problems especially
the popular titles you have no problems
with that thing so that was where they
really hit hard what I'm waiting to see
though is more now now that AMD have
stepped up I'm waiting to see more
competition in there
mainstream for core market I'm waiting
to see because this is shaking it up
it's going to be shaking it up
regardless when those are fives drop
that's going to shake things up again
the r7 is already shaking things up when
the are five drops it'll shake things up
again regardless because people want to
try something new so until have to do
something new to and I mean they will be
doing that with a 6 quart cannon lake
and wait other actually that's one of
the probably the most curious parts i'm
waiting for from Intel but other than
that they kind of have to change things
up again maybe even a three core six
thread-like dare I'd say if they could
do that that'd be pretty cool yeah I
mean that would be interesting I think
it sells naming scheme is also very
confusing now they have copy coffee lake
and cannon lake so if you guys are
confused between the two coffee lake
will be pretty much another optimization
over what we got from a QB lake so if
you remember back if you guys can ruint
too broad well II which are broad well I
should say um that dropped us down to 14
nanometer then sky lake which was again
bots in an Amir now kb lake also 14
nanometer and then we'll have coffee
lake also 14 a mexico boy so we got
broad well II I mean sorry broadwell
Broadway Kylie what's in Cabul it so we
getting cool we getting fourth
generation or on 14 nanometer so usually
it was the change the shrink and in the
optimization then a shrink than the
optimization now you've had shrink and
three optimizations and then we go to
Cannon lake which will be 10 nanometer
and you'll get yours so is it coffee
like there because they came out with
this new like tic toc toc thing forgot
what they call it exactly but it's our
top yeah yeah but now now like they
gonna have to go back and change it
again ticking talking to talk that's
what they should call tickety toc toc
also like that I understand that from
people have heard around the industry
and that they're having a lot of trouble
it's not just Intel but they're having a
lot of trouble at 2 nanometer and seven
nanometer as well going forward on
they're having a lot of trouble so I
think maybe let's do it Moore's law but
it's I they're just having trouble like
and and so I think until instead of just
waiting to get it right and drop down
they feel like they have to release new
CPUs in which case they're stuck that
they can only optimize on 14 nanometer
so they're just keeping on doing it and
I just don't see because when cable it
came out I mean we all covered it well
me and Brian all the ticker he has
covered it and honestly we weren't blown
away there's some cool things kebbi
leaks okay but I mean it's not like when
it came out we're all super hyped I
think most of us just kind of
begrudgingly went out and did all our
videos on it it wasn't like raisin where
we're very excited because it was so new
and I think that'll be the same with
coffee like it'll come out all the tech
reviews will begrudgingly go over and do
their reviews on it but honestly guys
you can't expect there to be much
difference at all you'll probably see
five percent performance gains if that
and you know maybe some other features
but i highly doubt it honestly it's i
don't know it might be okay but i'm sure
i mean sure opera sure but what judge do
you agree me or do you disagree I mean
yeah like I I'm a gray I think Moore's
law was finished ages ago like I mean we
all thought Intel was just trickling I
mean they might just be trickling but I
think there's actually legit problems in
shrinking that node there's legit
problems there I think that's being
confirmed by not just into a lot of
other companies have had so many delays
over the last few years so you know is
it the point of oblivion for tech
enthusiasts do we need something
radically new that graphene technology
gee there's a quantum mechanics coming
into the whole play quantum processor
and stuff like that so there are a few
things but that's going to be a radical
change and that ain't coming anytime
soon for mass release like hell no so
you know it's a tricky spot it's
difficult yeah it is and kb like as well
as before you know well no there were no
I pc games i tested this in my video
where it did the simnet 600k against the
6600 k I caught them at the same speed
and everything was the same like
performance wise everything was the same
cable a only makes up that performance
because of its higher clock speeds which
is a good thing and I'm not taking that
away from it but what's coffee like
going to bring are they really going to
raise the clock speeds that much higher
again is it going to be what I predict
personally would be probably the best
thing Intel could do is make coffee like
like devil's canyon when that came out
um Brian or remember this and some of
you guys might be but deal was Canyon
was pretty much the same as has well the
only thing they changed was they changed
the thermal interface material to a much
better one that lower temperatures they
bumped up the clock speeds and they also
added some more capacitors I think to it
because as well was so funny with power
you needed very clean power we've got
very grumpy and I think maybe that will
be what they try with coffee league they
maybe they might change the thermal
interface material so people will keep
your legal a cold voice finally if
they're too scared to deal it and maybe
just make it a bit more power efficient
and maybe give you guys some better APC
but such on that I'm not actually that
sure where and so can go on 14 nanometer
right now it seems like they've kind of
back themselves into a corner and some
but it's not it's not as Intel though
it's the industry now the the x86
industry now is kind of getting forced
into a checkmate where it's the only
option really now is to go with more
cause more threads I think now is the
crucial time where they're going to be
saying like look man if you want to get
gains we want to sell CPUs we're
probably gonna have to back developers
and start optimizing things from
cause more threats so then we can go
that route and we can sell more cause
more threats because that's how the
industry is no one's going to keep
buying why do you think they look at the
used price performance segment it's just
shot up like people use parts people
just buying these parts because of these
gains are so little over generation over
generation the use parts of becoming so
much more attractive but we look at that
and we're going to say okay where can
the industry go for the next 5-10 years
I think logically that it's only can go
with more cause more threads now that is
very difficult for the developers to do
they can't just whip up this magic
program that now runs on so many threats
especially for games especially for
games so where are we going to go I
think we're kind of getting forced now
to go to more cores more threads so with
that said you know you rise in our seven
for exams got eight core 16 threads but
yeah that's a good way to go but then
you've got that whole future proofing
argument will rise in that in itself is
only going to get better so maybe if you
if you want to use an eight-core in the
future when a lot of the games are
getting made fate cause 16 threats for
example just hypothetically bye-bye it
when it happens kind of thing for now
just wait for the Orizon are three or
cheap for core until the game start my
charity games start using eight cores
for example so yeah I mean yeah I just
see the industry going with the more
cores more threads now I think it's like
a forced checkmate kind of route now due
to this little gains and radical
radically different technology is going
to take time so yeah it's interesting
where the industry is going but it's no
 it's nothing just you have shits
and giggles about because it's serious
you know where are we going to get it
exactly right that's what I means so I
feel like going forward this year I'm
really only honestly the only thing from
Intel that's really got me interested is
X 2 99 um I am very interested to see
what they do with that but aside from
that hmm i don't know i guess scale like
x depending on what they bring but for
the consumer line up here it's going to
be this just not the hell of a lot to
get excited about guys unfortunately ah
yeah what's kind of like cars in the
early
90s kind of like cars you know sports
cars in the early nineties the Japanese
or the early eighties whatever Japanese
had the turbos out there everything was
just getting absolutely coming along so
well until the 90s and then like bang
you kind of hit a brick wall you know
and you just got all these aftermarket
stuff like that but yeah kind of like
the same has happened in CP years you
need something radically new and that's
going to take time so we've got here
Vega now you want to talk about Vega
around the corner and stuff like this
when we're getting teased but this time
around we've got different memory
configurations I think that's the main
focus yeah yeah so MDS vice president
and general manager of gaming said that
the adding and inboard partners CEO
people like Giga by Zeus and Messiah all
those guys will have the freedom to
configure Vega graphics cards with
different memory capacities so they're
talking about four gigs and eight gigs
but also will be going up to 16 gigs so
that will be of hbm to um yeah that'll
be interesting that's I I would imagine
you'll see probably on the Vega 11 which
is going to be the smaller one I it's at
the yeah that that will probably only go
up to eight I would imagine and maybe
the beggar ten got to 16 but it is
interesting because a few of us out
there were a little bit concerned
thinking that the maximum was eight
which is ah that's fine 88 is dimly a
lot of vram but is it super future-proof
I mean the GTX 1080 runs eight so dis
offense 70 and that is a good amount but
I think there's people out there that
want that super future-proof or they
just want more and they would like it
especially if these are going to be
coming in with quite a high price tag
that may you know be an issue for them
but personally yet if they come with
eight I think that will be just fine
I've never run into I think people often
overestimate how much the video memory
you need I run a 4k display I play all
my games at 4k on very high settings and
the highest I've ever seen v ram usage
out of any game I've tested is Ghost
Recon wildlands at 4k ultra and that
used five point six gigs so still had
quite a bit of headroom there and that
is a game which is extremely poorly
optimized at the stage so I'm especially
in that regard so I think a lot of
people especially the game is so in the
game at 1080p 1440p which is the vast
majority of guys there's only like one
percent of gamers game at 4k according
to steam so eight gigs is going to be
plenty for you guys maybe the four key
gamers maybe they'll want to go to the
16 but for all your other guys eight is
going to be plenty take it from me I do
the testing I look at see how much you
need um yeah it's the they you can also
take off some of some things just add a
lot to the video memory and don't really
give you much better of an experience so
you can always think things like um
let's filter some stuff like that tend
to chug up quite a bit um but yeah if
you guys need it sure go for 28 63
[Laughter]
what's up that's 28 degrees in here and
then I just wanted to say 16 ah 16
gigabyte spend like okay so I don't know
ma'am I've had different experiences at
4k I think I've had some different I I
think there will be I've seen more than
5.5 you byte savvy ram usage definitely
I've seen any people are saying GTA 5
that's yeah their eyes I did play but I
don't test in that does that actually
use that much I've okay I can retest but
I remember 1440p is getting some pretty
high v ram usage yeah that's why I'm
thinking so like 5.5 the matches up for
I'm sure I've seen higher than that man
even for instance like black ops 3 back
when I was playing
for cafergot how much that used exactly
but I mean 8 gigabytes is fine for now
but again someone spending this amount
of money on a graphics card wants it to
last I dare I'd say two years three
years I'd say two years is kind of like
the medium at least someone who's
spending this much money on high-end
card would want it to last two years so
is eight gigabytes going to be enough
for the next two years of 4k gaming I
would say maybe right there's a there's
you know there might be some really good
games that come out that might need more
like for having a good experience
because we know the higher resolution
you go the more vram you're going to
need it's a natural thing so I mean the
16 gigabyte option might be good yeah
yeah I get what you're saying my point
is is that eight gigs is enough because
the vast majority women speaking purely
just about the 4k gamers yeah then I
would agree with you then maybe would
definitely want to trend towards the 16
my point is is that very few people
actually game at 4k most of the gamers
out there are at 1080p or 1440p um or
maybe they're on subtly of it I'd say a
small amount as well are on the ultra
whites but the for those people I mean
to EP gaming 8 gigs is just heaps and
the same at 1440p for 4k and the people
running ultralights let 3440 x 1440
maybe they would shrink towards those
big ones as well the 16 but um yeah I
guess I guess it's the main point is
though is that regardless of the
argument it's good that they give you
this many options rather than things
like the 1080 where you only get one
option and this would be good for those
that can then pack depending on the
resolution their game at which hat which
amount of memory they want and probably
save themselves some money so if they're
a 1080p gamer they could just go with
the eight gig or even potentially the
four gig and save themselves some money
that way whereas the 4k gamers can go
all the way up to 16 so I think that's
pretty good
that will arm well they've got a very
good Vega 10 GPU died in the picture
there and they also saying the vague 11
the cut-down version of Vega 10 will be
available in laptops and notebooks this
is really cool I'd love to see it AMD
bringing some competition to Nvidia in
the notebook department so that's pretty
cool something to look forward to their
on this next I'll be here we've got
every custom model of GT x 1080 TI
revealed so this is kind of like a topic
that we've showed now we've got EVGA
they're bringing out their pretty sexy
for the wind 3 that looks pretty good
which one's your favorite out of these
cards give um how to say I would
probably be no 3d is not that thing
looks hideous man like it looks like it
looks like someone I love it's like a
cyborg it's like a Frankenstein thing
it's like they'd like head to spare
parts around the factory and they're
like oh we'll just put it all together
and like this is the cooler we came up
with um it's the cyborg looking think I
don't know that EVGA looks pretty sexy I
would say yeah the gigabyte horas I
think might look aright as well the back
looks quite cool though that sort of
looks like a g1 gaming that's crazy I
wouldn't I would very much expect that
there'll be that Google by oras one but
they'll be gigabyte extreme gaming and
that would be really cool to see that'll
be a big boy um but out of those like
yeah I say probably that the EVGA or
possibly the easiest one well it looks
like so Jack and gigabyte may be key but
to its so Tiger definitely using it fat
PCB I love that on graphics cards those
real fat like the Strix you know that's
something that's cool zotac ado on that
that's a really cool design i like the
fatter PCB i'm a big fan of it and you
know because you can get them lower
cooler sort of thing a flatter cooler so
then you got the founders edition i
reviewed that was pretty decent of
course if you're going with the blower
type if you like the blower type cool or
blow narrow the case then that's all
they're so yeah good for
running multiple GPS but uh so yeah I
think this would be quite quite
interesting the gigabyte one I they will
bring out an extreme gaming i'm
ninety-nine percent sure and that thing
will be a beast man most of the topping
cards i've tested in the past when I we
go back to and you always gonna happens
I knew it was gonna happen someday
someone's just going to mow the lawns in
the background it's happened today I
can't hear anything I guess that's good
right okay so do we want to move on to
QA and let us know guys watch it what is
your favorite upcoming 1080 model that'd
be cool to hear so we've got here the
first question from the forums here from
hungary have either of you tested AMD
Radeon ramdisk for production and gaming
and is it worth buying no I haven't
tried it yet ramdisk i'm not going to be
using because i utilize all my 64
gigabytes of memory for when I video
edit in 4k I need that all for video
editing so it's doing itself if I start
loading up stuff in the ramdisk yeah I
could only imagine the problems I'd
start having that's just me personally
have you tried AMD Radeon ramdisk no I
only at 32 gigs of Dominator platinum or
is it something drive you actually have
new by a vote of MSI's ram disk and
stuff on there i actually haven't tried
radeon ramdisk so i don't exactly know
what it is i'd have to look into that
more but yeah i personally I just have
the memory that I need and I don't use
anymore but definitely for someone
getting to 32 gigabytes and a gaming
system for example if they want to get
their favorite games into their ram
that'd be pretty interesting I mean but
the thing is like the fastest SSDs will
load up nvme drives will load up your
games so fast anyway so it's is it worth
it kind of thing you know I mean I got
us Intel sim 50 series envy me so you
know yeah you gave last few games just
like that so yeah so we have the next
question here what is the better buy a
decent air cooler or a 120 ml water
cooler in a push-pull config and he's
got the easy on w 3670 i believe is
the six core and I have been able to get
it to foggy goats on a hyper 212 evo
which overheats yeah the hyper 212 is I
mean award a 120 ml will do a better job
than I hyper 212 evo and especially in
push pool and these people ease PC
doesn't have the clearance for a 240 ml
rad either I mean yeah any like the 212
evo was essentially designed for
mainstream CPUs I don't think it was
designed for like heavy overclocking on
a 6-core so you know it's a bit sort of
beyond that i mentioned i think he is
right that the 120 mill water cool and
push pull the one thing you want to look
for with them is the thickness because
you can get very thin ones and you get
very thick and you want the the thicker
radiator mostly holds more coolant and
that's good but make sure you have the
clearances there if you're going to be
mounting it to the back of your case you
can run into problems with it heading if
you have tall memory or japan how how
its laid out um you can run into some
clearance problems there so definitely
check that first before you invest
especially in push-pull with a thick one
they can you know take it takes up a lot
of room so be aware of that first but a
big air cooler like some of the crazy
not to ones they can be very good also
but yeah yeah it just depends on
clearance with those yeah so well the
thing is the next question here so
leaflet says arm what are we getting
more love on the forms okay I'll start
plug in the forms more i plug it on
every week on the tech lounge so you
guys go to tech seed on TV go on the
forums awesome place question number two
any plans on doing more fun videos like
your ram motherboard and cpu drop tests
the static tests to use parts hunting
and such it feels like this is turning
into another tech channel aside from the
used builds yes and no i mean the thing
is i like I used to do a lot of that
stuff when I had a full-time job in
Japan like I was getting good money over
there and so I had like I just I'd loved
it as a passion and you know like I
offered a patron i'm not going to whinge
or anything like that but you know i
offered a patron and like just for
example I
okay so yeah a hundred and eight bucks
per month i'm getting a hundred eight
but i can't live off that guy's i can't
live off 108 dollars per month and do
all used builds and stuff like that like
how do i live you know i mean so in ways
i have to do if i want to keep doing
tech where I can go out and find a job
as well that's fine but the if I do a go
and find a job the used parts honey and
stuff like that it'll be a lot slower
because i'll have to work a lot more in
australia because my job in Japan was
pretty flexible like I didn't work a
whole lot like it was a full-time job
that I still went to work from like
eight to four and that was it kind of
thing like I just came home I had all
this free time I live like two minutes
around the block so I had so much more
free time than I would if I have to get
a job here after drive to work come home
so the video is even what you see now
with the years price performance stuff
on the channel it'll still be at the
same pace if I go out and get a job and
turn my channel back into just use parts
hunting and stuff like that so I'm in a
bit of a dilemma because I can't live
off 108 bucks per month so you know as
much as I want to do that stuff I want
to keep doing the unorthodox tough this
is it's going to calm like you're going
to see something like this very
unorthodox I'm going to be keep going to
bring that video out very soon I bring
marches pc vlog out very soon but again
guys like my plate is pretty full I
don't I spent so many hours every day on
the channel editing making videos and
stuff like that it's a hard gig at the
end of the day I did actually a podcast
with chris from corset we did a actually
more of a business in games sort of
podcast i'll put the link in the
description below if you guys want to
watch it whether we go through a lot of
things and you know it's not easy at the
end of the day it's not easy at all like
you know in ways it's kind of like I
kind of wouldn't mind just going back to
going out there and just working every
day and having a lot more free time to
just play video games and enjoy my tech
because of the moment just working like
I'm doing like 14 hour days man I don't
stop like yeah it did what it doesn't
really stop that's kind of let the
problem with it is that you if you have
a standard job one that you can leave it
the other day you just walk out the
front door and you forget about it come
home and you just do whatever you want
you don't
to think about it with YouTube I'll
that's why you're seeing a lot of tech
future or just youtubers in general now
having officers for making videos rather
than doing it at home because then you
can somewhat do that otherwise it feels
like you're constantly just doing
YouTube you know you're constantly I I
don't like looking at his work because
it's too much fun so I looking at is
like a there's a hobby I supposed to put
the they the thing is is that you you're
constantly doing it it doesn't really
stop so that that can be quite difficult
and I think the other thing a lot of you
guys forget is that different videos
take different amounts of time to make
so I would imagine things like use parts
hunting and stuff doing all those videos
and doing a full build with it you know
going out getting the parts making the
vlog then doing the build and stuff like
that it's probably a lot more time
consuming than other types of videos so
that's why I think all you guys assume
that every type of video we do takes the
same amount of time some videos take me
three times as on and to make in terms
of the whole process then other ones for
example a laptop review for me takes me
about three times as long as it does to
do say a keyboard review or something
like that it just just it's a much more
silent monumental video to tack or when
I have to do it so those videos don't
come out as often because they take up
so much of my time to get done yeah so
it says yeah the other day it's kinda
like catch-22 I know the viewers love
that staff and a notes makes me very
different but same time I can't live off
it you know what I mean like I'd love to
yeah just can't live off of the it's
like I sell a pc i make a hundred bucks
it's like okay though by me you know
foot baked beans for a week so and gas
put gas in my car and stuff like that so
it's it's hard man it's hard it is the
hard gig end of the day it's not lead so
especially nice especially in odds and
new zealand right the cost of living
here is is through the roof when we
compare like just phenomenal me yes so
it being at being a youtuber in general
and australia and new zealand is like
doing YouTube on hard mode everything is
more difficult like
especially take you to it with the
weight like I think billion years for
everything to arrive virtual where you
know it's just it's just like doing it
on hard mode you your cost of living is
way higher so it's like costs a fortune
as well it's just it's much more
difficult here it is pretty funny though
that's true yeah YouTube on how to
extreme difficulty sir go to the next
question what is a safe temp for the
Northbridge on an x58 motherboard is
getting over 80 degrees at all that's
that's pretty hot man on msi x58 pro so
you got to lower that because that'll
help with overclocking as well that's
actually a piece of silicon as well that
is subject to the silicon lottery just
like the X 5650 you got there but it
would be yeah it could very well be a
reason why you're struggling to get more
than a three point eight gig oh it's
over clock on your ex 5650 definitely I
would you'd have to take like I've done
it in a lot of my builds in the past you
take off that heat sink you clean off
the thermal pastes I wouldn't recommend
sanding it down actually in hindsight
that was stupid I got lucky that that
still worked actually because I'll speak
into some people who are very you know
in extreme enthusiasts and they like to
do that was a stupid move um it was you
know but there's still worked in the end
which I was lucky but yeah ladies I mean
so I'd recommend getting like something
that's from her or something and just
getting off that old thermal paste
getting like a plaster pit or a USB
plastic whatever you know a just
something plasticky getting off that old
thermal paste putting some new stuff on
there putting that northbridge heatsink
back on and then where you go you should
notice a difference you should be
looking sitting it around I think it's
around like 55 to 65 on idle depends it
does get very hot anyway but 80s way too
hot so next question I assume you have
shipped a lot of pcs do you use any
special packing message methods now I
just like the because I get like cases
in I just use the old case boxes and so
pack it in there and yet you just want
the standard if you're shipping a PC you
just put it in the box and ship it like
how you got how you'd get a case kind of
thing you might want to put a vexer a
bit of extra bubble wrap in there for
good measure but that's about it what
about you keV how do you ship a PC ought
to be fair I've
ships one myself never had to all the
pieces I've sold a broken down for parts
and sold them individually rom it's been
better to do that New Zealand has a very
competitive like use pc market ultra
competitive ah see I i I've always
thought it'd be better I did sell one
years ago but I've made like there was
just no money and it's after that I just
always broke things down and sell them
or for individual parts that way and
it's worked out to be a lot better but I
think you're generally pretty safe II
justjust the main thing to worry about
is the graphics card usually because
that gets bounced around a lot that can
crack where it's lot son ok leave
leaflet he wants me he's got another
question he wants me to do a Canadian
accent I'll give it a go guys go this is
the air weekly just channel Linus
podcast we've got episode 20 and we're
going to move on to the next question
yeah yeah any plans to come to the UK oh
definitely now okay I want to go back to
the UK and do a roadtrip man that's when
I save up enough money to go for a
holiday yeah UK would be awesome and I
love I when they before it's a road trip
man best holiday ever road tripping
through the UK would be so much fun this
time I go man would be hunting for tech
deals to like yeah just hunting for use
parts go around the whole UK just
hunting for is it really that much of a
road trip I mean like it is a bottom but
yeah into the top of Scotland must be
from like I don't know from like
Melbourne to life yeah camber it's not
like it's not huge it's not as a thing
that's a good thing about it though it's
not a huge road trip but the thing is
every place you go through is you can
stay there you can stop at a bed and
breakfast that's what made it so
enjoyable like it was such a good road
trip because every like hour or two
hours you're at a new place new bars you
bed-and-breakfast new things to do like
it was so good i just i love that trip
so much man when i went a road trip into
that you know you go like straight your
road trip bro you just got desert like
you're not desert lee you just got
desolace for like four hours that you
dry
you're like okay boring half so yeah
there isn't that much to let see that
special it takes so long to like you
look at something on a map and you're
like oh it's not that far away and then
you actually drive and it takes like
five hours oh well okay where would I
recommend buying new hardware in a stray
do you have any preferences I would say
yeah you months of it you might Nemus
why the two guys I go to for in-store in
Australia and then lastly we got here do
you think Ghost Recon wildlands isn't
well optimized not sure if you haven't
played it yet if you haven't next
question so you'll answer that yeah I've
had benchmark benchmarked on ghost
Landry Recon wildlands it's not
optimized for GPUs like it's basically
whatever they're doing uncompressed
textures or whatever like that so what's
your what's your opinion on ghost Ghost
Recon wildlands is not well optimized at
the moment yeah this is some more time
the CPU side of things looks okay like I
didn't get any stuttering anything
largest it's a GPU intense game and like
crazy gpfs memory Hulk for sure and then
what do you think of paladins enjoying
it yeah it's pretty good about try the
new so far wouldn't know haven't tried
any games recently how about you give
all right guys huh all right just so I
just quickly brine down there if you
refresh the page there was um and then
another guy asked quickly if you're
building rising for productivity work
what we be doing with your jersey on
build probably selling it yeah recoup
some of the costs that I spent on it so
yeah I wanted to actually finish it off
with some transformers stickers and
stuff but yeah most likely think we're
getting some cash crops yeah someone
else asked since racing can use ECC ram
do you think it will look okay do you
think it will be able to use one stick
of 32 gigabyte ECC ram AKA having 128
gigabyte 4 x 32 gigabytes depends me i'd
say probably know depends though yeah it
could work like it theoretically could
so it just depends I mean that's the
kind of stuff did happen on the x58
boards and stuff so
it just depends you'd have to try it to
see it I don't think it would though
actually I mean I know ECC memory does
work on a bit just depends you'd have to
try it in practice and again like would
you want to use ECC me think would you
want to use ECC memory on risin if
you're a game up doing productivity no
because it'll add an extra it'll add an
extra command rate timing on that
automatically like yeah that's what in
and then won't overclock anywhere near
as good as consumer grade memory so
there the trade-offs and it's like no
way for me I wouldn't even bother using
ECC memory on it that's just might
necessary so but of course for someone
like Wendell me he loves that kind of
stuff yeah he is probably it's probably
better to ask in magazine loves that
kind of stuff and he would probably give
you a better answer than I could
definitely so yes he is actually into
the using ECC memory on the rights and
boards so I just don't believe in it at
all so because because of what I'm going
to be using it for new I guess we're
going to wrap up the show anything your
dad get away no no just um yeah I'm
really looking forward to testing out
rising five I am yeah should be coming
up almost there's something I should
have said just then uh-huh yeah it's the
air coming out quick alright guess it's
all look at you if you gotta if you've
got questions for next episode then jump
on to taxi DTV and there'll be a new
thread there episode 21 s questions be
sure to jump on if you haven't already
check out keV I'll put his link to his
channel and description below tech
showdown and also i'll put some modern
even know what else but we'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon and
I'm going to piece on out here keV you
any closing statements ah thanks for
bringing on the show again Brian had a
great time and I hope you guys enjoyed
the show right peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
