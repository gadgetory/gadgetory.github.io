welcome back to tech yesterday this is
barelli's coming back to you guys today
with a preview of the mini ITX rig this
is the next ring that I'm gonna be
building so I've sold the aim D rig and
this is my next project now there's a
lot of good videos that are gonna come
out of this so let's look at the first
part that's going in this mini ITX rig
this is the gtx 750ti
golden sample from gang wood now I'm
gonna be testing this with this case and
I'm gonna see the power consumption of
this graphics card because this is
pretty much a really good graphics card
for a performance per watt it only uses
up about 60 watts on onload that's what
I've heard and it actually gives you
really good frames however the next part
of the bill that I'm gonna be testing
this with is the pentium g 3220 now this
is a very cheap cpu it's only about $58
again it's a very low power consumption
so one down two videos going to be
coming out of this I'm going to be doing
a full dealin tutorial for you guys I'm
also gonna be testing this CPU with this
graphics card and they're gonna be
putting this graphics card in my main
rig which is a 460 70k overclocked 4.6
gig and I'm gonna see the difference
that a CPU makes with a mid like a real
mid-range card so that's gonna be
interesting I hope you guys look forward
to that so we're gonna see really just
how good are the value of the pentium is
now another part the next part of the
build which I'm sure you guys are
probably gonna be really curious about
is a JDM mini ITX case this is the SIF
Betty from SIF they actually call it
size in Japan for some reason now the
good thing about this case is a at $60 B
it's ridiculously small it's a mini ITX
case and C it comes with a 300 watt
power supply that's right so 300 what
pathway it does have about 18 amps on
the 12 volt rail which I'm hoping should
be enough so this case I'll be giving
you guys as I revealed this case in
about a month's time I'm gonna see how
it holds up with this build and see if
this 300 what OAM power supply is
actually decent so for $60 this could be
a very good answer to a lot of those
folks who are looking for a cheap mini
ITX rig
and they just you know they want a power
supply that's also small form factor as
well all included in the case a $60 case
great an expo build DVD burner who cares
enough about the build as the SSD and we
throwing this bad boy in the Mini ITX
rig I've already reviewed this for you
guys but that should definitely make the
whole built one smooth puppy now the
last part of the bill I'm gonna be
looking forward to showing you guys is
the asrock h 81 and Mini ITX motherboard
now this is the cheapest mini ITX
motherboard I could find so it's
basically guys I think it's about $70
and it's got all the bells and whistles
I need I will be giving you guys a
review of this motherboard and showing
you guys the features and what is
included in the box in the very near
future so anyway as for RAM is all
you're probably wondering what Ram is
gonna go in there I'm gonna be pulling 2
to 4 gigabyte sticks out of my main rig
and I'll probably be getting another 16
gigabytes and then I'll be putting it in
the mini ITX rig so I haven't thought of
a name for this build yet or this
project but once I complete it I will
showcase it with a project name for you
guys now this whole build should run up
about 450 dollars which is actually very
cheap for a pretty potent mini ITX rig
also if you have any tests or anything
you want a particular in particular that
you want to see with this rig then
please leave a comment in the comment
section below and I will make magic
happen so anyway if you like this video
