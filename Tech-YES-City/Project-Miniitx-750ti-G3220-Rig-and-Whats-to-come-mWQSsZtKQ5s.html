welcome back to take a city this is
beretti's coming back to you guys today
with a preview of the mini ITX rig this
is the next rink that I'm going to be
building so I've sold the AMD rig and
this is my next project now there's a
lot of good videos that are going to
come out of this so let's look at the
first part that's going in this mini ITX
rig this is the gtx 750ti golden sample
from gangly now i'm going to be testing
this with this case and i'm going to see
the power consumption of this graphics
card because this is pretty much a
really good graphics card but for
performance per watt it only uses up
about 60 watts on unload that's what
I've heard and it actually gives you
really good frames however the next part
of the bill that I'm going to be testing
this with is the Pentium g32 20 now this
is a very cheap CPU it's only about
fifty eight dollars again it's a very
low power consumption so one now to
video is going to be coming out of this
I'm going to be doing a full GD Lynch
tutorial for you guys I'm also going to
be testing this cpu with this grabs card
and then going to be putting this
graphics card in my main rig which is a
4670k overclocked 4.6 gig and i'm going
to see the difference that a cpu makes
with a mid like a real mid-range card so
that's going to be interesting i hope
you guys look forward to that so we're
going to see really just how good are
the value of the pentium is now another
part the next part of the build which
i'm sure you guys are probably going to
be really curious about is a JDM mini
ITX case this is thus if Betty from Seth
they actually call it sighs in Japan for
some reason now the good thing about
this case is a at sixty dollars be it's
ridiculously small two mini ITX case and
see it comes with a 300 watt power
supply that's right so 300 what pathway
it does have about 18 Anton the 12 volt
rail which I'm hoping should be enough
so this case i'll be giving you guys as
I reveal this case in about a month's
time I'm going to see how it holds up
with this bill and see if this 300 watt
OEM power supply is actually decent so
for sixty dollars this could be a very
good answer to a lot of those folks who
are looking for a cheap mini ITX rig
and they just you know they want a power
supply that's also small form factor as
well all included in the case a
sixty-dollar case great our next pope
ill DVD burner who cares another party
billed as the SSD and we throw on this
bad boy in the mini ITX Rick already
reviewed this for you guys but that
should definitely make the whole built
in one smooth puppy now the last part of
the bill I'm going to be looking forward
to showing you guys is the asrock h81
and mini ITX motherboard now this is the
cheapest mini ITX motherboard I could
find so it's basically guys I think it's
about seventy dollars and it's got all
the bells and whistles I need I will be
giving you guys a review of this
motherboard and showing you guys the
features and what is included in the Box
in the very near future so anyway are as
for RAM is all you probably wondering
what ram is going to go in there i'm
going to be pulling to take two full
gigabyte sticks out of my main rig and
i'll probably be getting another 16
gigabytes and then i'll be putting it in
the mini ITX free so i haven't thought
of a name for this build yet or this
project but once I complete it I will
showcase it with a project name for you
guys now this whole build should run up
about four hundred and fifty dollars
which is actually very cheap for a
pretty potent mini-itx wreck also if you
have any tests or anything you want a
particular in particular that you want
to see with this rig then please leave a
comment in the comment section below and
i will make magic happen so anyway if
you like this video please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions
please leave a comment the comment
section below and if you haven't already
become a yes man and hit that sub button
and I'll be catching you guys with a
video very soon now roll the outro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
