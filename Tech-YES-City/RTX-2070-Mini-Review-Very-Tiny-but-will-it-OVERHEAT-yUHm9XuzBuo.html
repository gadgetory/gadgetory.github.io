is something that
honestly is so impressive,
and that's because they've managed to put
an RTX 2070 into a small PCB that measures
about 165 mil long, but because they put
two 80-mil fans on the top,
it measures in at 178
mil long on the shroud.
At the back, we've got a display port,
HDMI and a DVI port, and here on the desk
we also have a banana
to measure up the size,
and then besides that we've
got a Tech Yes love-in cup,
and none of these three things
have anything to do with each other.
Except that she said she likes all three.
(bleep)
Anyway, with all the jokes aside,
let's just get straight into
the benchmarks for you guys,
and then after that we'll talk about
what else the RTX 2070 Mini
from Galax has to offer.
(upbeat music)
So this little Galax stood out
with something that I've noticed
Galax have been doing with a
lot of their graphics cards
coming through here at Tech Yes City,
and that's their VBIOS and the
way they're programming it.
This one, however, does deter
from the normal efficiency
formula even more
in that it's super-efficient.
What we got here is a
2070 that's essentially
using less power than basically
all the RTX 2060s that I have here,
yet it's still performing
a little bit better.
Make no mistake, however,
Galax have definitely
tuned it down to levels below
that of a standard RTX 2070,
so what you're gonna see is kind of
performance that measures
somewhere in between
an RTX 2070 and an RTX 2060.
Actually kind of smack bang in the middle.
However, the good thing is, it still
manages to overclock
quite well, and with that,
it's the most power-efficient
2070 I have seen to date.
However, going through the numbers
a little bit more in-depth,
flicking through Dirt Rally 2,
Outward, Generation Zero,
Tom Clancy's Division 2,
Anthem, Apex Legends, all these
titles were tested at 1440p,
and what we could see here is a trend
where this card can definitely get
some good frame rates
at 1440p high and even
ultra settings, depending on the game.
And because it has that eight
gigabytes of VRAM buffer,
especially versus the
RTX 2060, for example,
has the bigger memory bus, it's
actually a really nice card,
not only if you wanna fit
into a small form factor
but also fit it into a larger desktop PC,
because when I looked at the temperatures
and also the noise results,
they were very impressive for this model.
Running at 100% fan speeds,
we saw a temperature
of 61 degrees Celsius,
noise level of 51 decibels.
Dropping it down to 80% then
saw 67 degrees, 48 decibels.
60%, 75 degrees, 45 decibels,
and then the auto fan speeds level at 72%,
scoring 47 decibels and 70 degrees C,
so it was boosting the fan profiles
a little bit louder than that sweet spot
of 60% that we see on bigger cards,
but at the same time, the fans were
actually really quiet on this model.
I like what they've done to the point
where you could actually
leave this thing on 100%
if you had good sound deadening
and really not notice it a whole lot.
But what about the clock speeds this thing
averaged out to on the CUDA Cores?
Out of the box, we're
seeing 1710 megahertz,
which is a little bit
lower than the standard
RTX 2070s that come through here,
and then we overclocked plus
204 megahertz on the core,
which averaged out to
about 1905 megahertz.
Memory saw a sizeable boost
going from 7000 to 8077,
which you then double for
the effective memory speeds,
so it was impressive overclocks,
and this was all done with
very low power consumption.
Galax is keeping the temperature limit
at 100% with this card, and that's so
you essentially don't put more heat
out on the cooler than it can handle,
as this card does weigh in at 525 grams,
so it is lightweight and it
does have a back plate included,
so it's gonna be great if you wanna
put it in a mini RTX solution
and drop the weight of the whole build,
but still get RTX 2070 performance
in something really small.
Also, some things I didn't
mention earlier with this card
is it is a dual-slot solution,
measures 40 mil tall and also has
the standard 112-mil PCB width
that nVidia uses on their cards too,
and as we said in the
intro, it's 168 at the base
and then the shroud
extends to 178 mil long.
And basically concluding
things with the RTX 2070 Mini,
we got the banana for the size comparison
and it is just ridiculously small.
It's also got a really good build quality,
everything on this feels so solid.
I love what Galax have
done with this card,
not just with the actual build quality
but with the efficiency curves themselves
to keep this thing under wraps.
In any sort of build you're gonna do,
you're gonna get great cooling performance
as well as great performance.
Keep in mind, it won't perform
as well as a standard RTX
2070 desktop solution,
but it will save you power
and will be more efficient
than those variants, and at the same time,
it's coming in at the MSRP,
so this thing isn't gonna break the bank.
It also only needs a
single 8-pin connector,
so it will work with most
budget 500-watt power supplies,
but do keep in mind, you will want to
get a decent 500-watt power
supply to power this thing,
don't go out buying those
no-name crap brands.
But on the other token, as we saw,
the power consumption results,
me pairing it with a
9900k is still juicing
just over 300 watts, which is phenomenal
for the performance this
thing is going to give you.
Anyway, guys, that's about it
for the RTX 2070 Mini review from Galax.
I'm really impressed.
Honestly all the Galax cards
that have been coming out
with the RTX 2000 series
and also the GTX 11 series,
I've been really impressed with them,
super efficient, great build quality
and they're just hitting over MSRP.
But speaking of those prices, I'm yet
to see them hit hard in America,
and I know a lot of you
guys have been wanting
to get your hands on these in America,
so I've been asking them,
when are they gonna start
mass-shipping these things to the US?
They just say, like, their production line
is already in demand
from all Southeast Asia
and also over in Europe with KFA2,
but I will update the description below.
But love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always,
and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
And also if you enjoyed this one,
be sure to hit that like button
and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.
And yes, there is WD40 in this cup.
