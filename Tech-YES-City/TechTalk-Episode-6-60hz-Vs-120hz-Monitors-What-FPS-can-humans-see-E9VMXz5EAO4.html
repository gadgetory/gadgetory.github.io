you just coming back to you guys today
with episode 6 of tech talk and what a
big one we have today we've got 120
Hertz vs. 60 Hertz AKA 120 frames per
second versus 60 frames per second as an
individual can you tell the difference
and should you buy a 120 Hertz monitor
now guys I'm going to address this in an
unbiased way personally i do have 120
hertz monitor i can notice the
difference but i'm going to let you guys
remember this one point about this whole
thing is that everybody is different
okay so every to set no two sets of eyes
are the same unless of course you're an
identical twin then that's kind of
different story but the first thing i'm
going to address guys let's go to this
side okay this is going to be the
easiest way to test if you want to get
120 hertz modern you're thinking about
it go to this website do this test okay
it's called frames per second spot calm
and i'll put the link in the description
go here guys you can test out 30 frames
per second 60 frames per second and
obviously if you're on a 60 hertz
monitor you're not going to need 120
frames per second so we can chop that
off but you can chest here and just look
obviously with the 30 frames per second
you can see the choppiness and this
since this video is going to appear on
youtube which is rendered at 30 frames
per second anyway the bottom one's going
to look choppy as well but for me the 60
frames per second looks a lot better
than the 30 frames per second and but i
can still notice the choppiness it's
still there so if i turn this up to 120
so we want to leave off motion blur
because no games use motion blog that's
for film I'll get into that later but
basically the 120 frets hurts frame the
120 Hertz ball it looks better for me
okay I look at this and I'm like yeah I
can notice the difference between the 60
Hertz ball and 120 Hertz ball and if you
guys can get on 120 Hertz monitor and
try this out then do it otherwise just
look at the 60 Hertz ball and if you can
notice that it's doing little chops on
the screen it's doing little chops it's
doing little stroke i think they call it
strobing and if you notice that the ball
is strobing slightly then maybe you are
a good candidate to go and buy 120 Hertz
monitor I definitely can see it so for
me i bought the hunt this is why i
bought 121 its monitor so anyway let's
move on to the next point and
obviously first i'm going to say guys it
was such a hard decision okay because
the 60 hertz 1440p IPS panel is
absolutely gorgeous okay so it was such
a tough call for me to make the fluidity
of the 1080p 120 Hertz or the the beauty
of the 1440p IPS panel so for me it was
really hard call I went with 120 Hertz
because I like gaming competitively
that's something I like to do I want to
game the best I can so I get 120 days
models for me so anyway let's go on to
you guys I let's throwing out
recommendations later anyway this is the
next time military Navy pilots you've
probably heard this you've done some
research of your own on the matter
you've probably everyone's throwing out
military pilots navy pilots and
basically what I want to stress here
guys is as you get older your acuity
declines or the quality of your vision
declines a case of these guys and your
reaction speeds decline as well so
obviously maybe if you're approaching
your mid-40s or you're going into your
50s you may wish to just go with the 60
Hertz monitors you might not notice the
difference between 120 and 60 Hertz
however for me I'm still I'm 27 years
old but I know as I get older my acuity
will decline it's just natural that's
that's just how humans are so you want
to maybe look at your age that's an
important thing and realistically guys
I'm not joking is I'm just realistically
looking at the matter how old you are
depends and these guys these did they
did tests on the Navy pilots and all
that and they found that as the Navy
pilots were older an age their reaction
speeds declined and also their acuity
their quality of acuity declined as well
in this graph so the majority of people
were here but then obviously had it and
another thing to take out of this so the
average some some people were getting
point 15 of the second reaction times
that's really that's huge anyway that's
really that's pretty fast anyway so if
we go down to acuity here one thing to
take out of this graph is basically the
more bright or the more brighter your
monitor is in the higher contrast your
monitor has the better it's going to
look so keep that in mind as well so
that's something that comes out of this
test as well so that's a good thing i
like that i looked into this test and
they'll summer that's good there's a lot
of good research here and another point
i want to raise up is do you play games
when you're tied if you're a tired
person and you sleep deprived
a bit of a joke but if you and if you're
not playing games when you are aware
alert than you're missing out because as
you can see here they did tests on more
pilots and the simple motor simple motor
complex mode of visual perception it all
gets impaired as you get more tired okay
so remember that you want to play games
you want to play games the best that you
can play games when you're not tired
guys okay so the next point I'm going to
move on to guys is this one I really
take this with a grain of salt because I
couldn't actually find the actual solid
research to support it and it was
someone like they did experiments 1 220
eighth of a second and the pilots were
able to consistently see the after image
and identify it so that was pretty
impressive so basically if you put this
into layman terms it's the pilots could
basically c 220 frames per second so i
mean that's pretty interesting but
remember the guys Navy pilots are elite
okay they're like the elite of the elite
okay they're healthy individuals their
eyes are brilliant so that's something
to take out that so anyway let's go this
is another really cool thing guys I want
you to go here and I want you to check
it out blind spots did you actually know
that behind our nerves like behind our
eyes we have the nerve which actually
blocks part of our vision and basically
since we have two eyes they each help
each other out so this effect doesn't
occur if you've got both eyes open but
if you close one eye for instance if I
close my right eye and I'm just using my
left eye I want to look at the right so
if I got my if I close my eye right eye
I'm gonna look at the right dot and as I
go in so I'm going to move in with you
guys live the actual plus symbol it
actually blanks out it's really crazy
and the funny thing is my mouse cursor
actually disappears as well it's really
crazy and I just when I looked at this I
was like what the hell so basically the
blind spot on our eyes our brain
actually makes up that information and
puts in just okay this is just going to
be green here which is going to pop some
green in there no worries yeah you're
not gonna be able to tell the difference
so I was like huh okay my blant brains
playing tricks on me stupid brain so
that's something to remember that's
something just that's a really cool
thing that I found while researching
this whole topic
anyway let's go on to a guy's lightest
actives actually this is one of the
funniest things was when I was
researching this I was looking for have
people tested this effect and now Linus
went on and he got his friend to do
blind tests on this 120 Hertz monitor
and his friend is a pretty young guy
could not tell the difference so i'll
put the link in the description below
you can watch the video and now he
couldn't tell the difference however
Linus he tested it and he could tell the
difference five out of five times he
told which one was 60 Hertz which one
was 120 which was impressive and for me
I could tell the diff I know I could
tell the difference as well and it's
because of this guy's i want to point
you to this brain plasticity ok so i'll
put the links to the Linus videos in the
description below great research I love
how he did an actual test to do that
it's really cool and it just goes to
show that some people can notice the
difference some people can't but I think
another thing to remember is is what
your brain gets trained to do so if
you're always seeing in the night time
your brain is naturally going to get
better at seeing in the nighttime your
visions not going to improve but you're
just going to get used to seeing at
night time now the same with 120 frames
per second this is what I believe ok
since i've been using 120 frames per
second every time I game I'm used to it
ok I'm trained to now be used to 120
frames per second so maybe even if you
can't notice a difference and you try
out 120 frames say you try it for a week
and then you go back to 60 Hertz I'm
pretty positive you will notice a
difference so if I drop my monitor if I
change my settings back to 60 Hertz I've
done it once and I just changed it
straight away because what I noticed was
my mouse cursor actually got really slow
lady got choppy I was like oh god I
can't do this i got isn't going to
change him back and so I did it straight
away I changed it back to 120 Hertz and
I never looked back at that but I want
to share this with you guys so brain
plasticity your brain is getting trained
at like my brain has already been
trained at 120 Hertz and that's what I
think exactly what's happened in Linus's
video he's used to playing at 120 Hertz
therefore he can tell the difference and
so I think it's it's not about Ken Linus
count 120 frames or can I count 100
20 frames in one second hell no I
couldn't do that what it's about is
noticing the difference as a gamer can
you notice the difference and now I'm
going to so that about wraps it up in
terms of solid research that I can find
I'm going to go a little bit off topic
and talk about persistence of vision
which is in is in favor of the 60 Hertz
it basically says that we basically we
get an image and that image is imprinted
in our brain for a short amount of time
roughly Oh point zero four of a second
so what that means is is that yeah we
see an image it gets imprinted in our
brain and we kind of remember it for a
little bit we get the next image and it
helps smooth things out so honestly they
they have debunked this and they've
called it a myth I I honestly don't know
as I believe guys we are biological
species and so we can't test a
biological species with mechanical means
and we have no means of testing
biological species yet as there's no
biomech sort of test bed that we can
apply to a human's vision that makes any
sense but yeah if anything to get out of
this whole argument guys is that no one
exactly knows how many frames per second
an individual can see because we are
biological species and we see in a
completely different way as to a
mechanical way so anyway let's have a
look at the wagon wheel this is pretty
cool like it movies a shot at 25 24
frames per second right and so when we
turn 120 my heart monitors 120 frames
and when I have this thing going at 120
rpm even on a 60 Hertz model would be
the same but it shows the floor in 24
frames and the just look the wheel just
looks like it's still so it's just
stupidly and that's that's the thing
with 24 frames per second it's a
weakness basically and here it is you
guys can see it for yourself go here if
you want to put the description and i'll
put the link in the description below
basically it shows the 24 frames per
second just staying completely still I
was just like okay hmm but what I want
to point out is had this will been going
at 120 frames per second it would look
completely different and so would a
normal wheel on a car in daylight so if
you guys go outside and you look at a
car wheel you'll see that it's moving
you'll never see this effect unless it's
low light or its poor light I don't
think so anyway but you see it in movies
frequently because
of this effect so if we move it up a bit
it'll be going backwards so that's what
you see in the movies the 24 frames is
causing this so anyway guys that's a
cool thing to check out if you want to
now lastly people ask me for some 120
Hertz monitor recommendations now guys
honestly make your own mind up about 120
Hertz versus 60 Hertz you have to be the
judge okay I can't do this for you okay
because that is just wrong and I think
it is wrong when people say oh I can
only I can't notice the difference
therefore you can't notice the
difference and I and it's vice versa as
well I can notice the difference so you
should notice the difference now I'm
going to come back to everyone liked my
analogy last time so I'm going to come
back with a different analogy this time
everyone knows the jealous friend okay
so be mindful of the jealous friend they
look there there guys trust me so when
you want to buy that 120 Hertz monitor
and you can notice if you go to that
website and you can see that 60 frames
per second is a little bit choppy and
you can notice that and you're like yep
I'm going to get 120 miles mana don't
listen to that jealous friend you know
what he's like he's like he bought his
60 Hertz monitor and he's like secretly
he noticed the difference he's like yeah
tried 120 Hertz monitor I could see the
difference but god damn it I made the
wrong purchase decision I can't take my
monitor back now and he's like doing
that he's like died man don't get 120
Hertz model that you can't notice the
difference you can't notice it man you
can't do it you kind I didn't notice it
it's just stupid humans can't see behind
beyond 60 frames per second year at that
time you like geez man why is this guy
getting over reactive about this whole
situation it's just 120 Hertz monitor
man it's just two hundred and fifty
dollars it's not like the end of the
world so you're probably thinking that
to yourself and this guy's like and
you're like oh just you know okay I'll
try them out I'll test him out see which
one I like and then you change the topic
and then you come back and he's like
he's just like I meant 120 Hertz monitor
don't buy he's like still going on at
that point in time you know that guy is
just super jealous he is just like he's
just like wheeling so at that point in
time guys if you know if that jealous
friend is out there and he's trying to
influence you to go with the poor choice
you say to him man you know what I'm
just going to try the 100
it's modern that time he is going to be
just like Oh is going to be more jealous
than a fat kid watching spiderman he's
going to be more jealous than Keanu
Reeves watching himself on the matrix
guys he is going to be so jealous and
you have to rub it in you have to be
like 120 Hertz oh yeah oh yeah baby but
goes anyway that's the jealous friend
okay so don't listen to the jealous
friend when you were to buy your monitor
by your monitors so with that being said
I'm going to pop out some
recommendations guys for 120 Hertz
monitors for 144 hurts monitor this is
the latest one coming out from a Zeus
it's actually a 27 inch monitor which is
probably a little bit too big but it's
144 hurts so it's just huge it's I think
this is designed for pro gamers okay so
pro gamers definitely need this you know
it's that little competitive you map
thinking does just a couple of
milliseconds but it can matter okay in a
competitive tournament that two
milliseconds can make a difference guys
so that's the one you might want to
think of this is the monitor I
personally have it's the samsung s 23
700d which is a gloss panel so even
though it looks matt here it's actually
a gloss coating and it looks beautiful
guys so it's your choice you can get the
mat or you can get the gloss I love
gloss personally that's just me as a
person I made that decision myself and
you guys can be the judge of that okay
so go try these things this is a great
monitor I got this at 120 Hertz it's a
true hundred twenty earth it's awesome
monitor cost me about $300 and it's
worth every penny it is just a beautiful
even though it's a tan panel trust me it
looks phenomenal for a TN panel now the
next recommendation i'll throw out there
is the bank uxl 2 420 T this is quite
expensive as you guys can see it's 120
Hertz as well let's say I think it's a
matte coating on it and it's yeah it's
got some good specs on it it's so pretty
much the same specs as the Samsung as
well so there's three good monitors i
can think of there's a lot more out
there and obviously guys the most
important thing is is that yeah way up
do that test okay find that do that test
see if you can notice the difference and
obviously for me it was a hard choice
between because the 1440p IPS panel is
beautiful go check it out go down the
stores try them both out see which one
you like for me the 1080p 120 hertz was
better so hey guys i hope you
enjoyed this episode of tech talk
episode 6 if it's one thing to get out
of this is that no one knows how many
frames we can actually see it in a
mechanical basis because we're
biological beings anyway guys I gonna
have my gyro I got requests to do a gyro
build that is going to be coming soon
I'm going to give a 500 and a thousand
euro build so stay tuned for those also
a 500-pound budget bill will be coming
out soon and also a five-hundred-dollar
Ozzy builds going to be coming out soon
hey i'm going to give you guys that much
love so can i get a thumbs up and if you
haven't already can i get a sub because
it's hard to get a sub nowadays it takes
a lot to get us off nowadays i think i'm
doing the research i think i'm trying to
explain it as best as i can I kind of
deserve it sob anything yeah okay hey
guys my wife says I should cut my hair
soon what do you guys think do I need a
haircut is this kind of getting crazy I
don't know let me know guys anyway guys
for now peace out for now and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
