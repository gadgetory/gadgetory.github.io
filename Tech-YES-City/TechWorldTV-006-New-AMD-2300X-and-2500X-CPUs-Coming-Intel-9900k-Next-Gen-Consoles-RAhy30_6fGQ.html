think we're live right about now wagon /
yeah I think we're shakin baby
welcome to the tech world TV I think
this is episode 6 I believe if it's not
I'll have to go back and update it we're
joined by the Greg the Salazar of the
studio with science involved how you
doing man what's going on right not much
just a Sunday here weather's great
everything you probably see some
hardware on the desk here we've got an
ex 79 motherboard which has got 64
gigabytes of ddr3 there's also a Xeon in
there which is a 16 atv tzu so that is
going to be a new build dropping on the
channel very soon because finally found
a video editor and he's really good he's
like bringing new metas to the channel
people have been loving the video edits
lately they've been saying man's videos
look good so he'd been added in a couple
of them it's really getting the workflow
up I mean I've got to go to Italy later
this month and some other stuff as well
Austria and then Japan so things are
gonna be really cool there's gonna be a
lot of used parts hunts to say the least
so if you guys have been like damn and
missed the part science then I'm gonna
be giving you a triple whammy so stay
tuned stay tuned in the last month has
just been chaos here absolute chaos and
so I mean yeah it's just been chaos
there's just parts everyone why
shouldn't do a vlog with me cleaning up
this place is so much crap around here
how you been anyway I've been alright I
was a building PC today I was trying to
get Lisa to help me with it and it's
it's an i-5 8400 gtx 980ti just trying
to see the viability of the i-5 right if
you want a pure gaming rig going with a
cheaper end i-5 just for gaming and the
maxing out the graphics card with the
1080i so you know if that's a viable
option still if you're in the budget of
around maybe 1500 or so USD actually
quite a little less than that we're just
having fun putting stuff together she
actually leaves Wednesday so we're
having to have a lot of stuff into this
last little week here before she heads
back to Germany so so you know you're
kind of busy with leisure I'm kind of
busy with
okay man it's a good blend yeah I'd love
to be busy with leisure but yeah I know
people in chat get an excited coalition
gaming what's up man he's getting
excited about this Aeon I'm excited
about this Zeon - first up here on the
news we've got the 2500 X and 2,300 X it
looks like they come into the market for
three or four cores eight threads and
four cores four threads seems like an
update over the 1000 series just
straight-up risin cause rising goodness
what do you think about this one yeah
this one's looking I was reading a
little further down where it says
cramped positioning here so this is
where they start talking about the
viability of these chips in the current
positions price-wise that they are
already having to compete with other
chips from AMD
so the 2200 G and the 2400 G come up you
know what's the 2500 X is gonna offer
the 2400 G doesn't be seeing as though
you get Vega right with the 24 G but you
don't get anything like that with the
2500 you will probably get better RAM
support and that's just something that
we've seen a lot with Verizon - the 2200
G is another one that they're
questioning when this 2,300 X rolls out
then we're where is the comfortable
price position right for that chip as
well not because the 2200 G is already
doing so well at around a hundred bucks
where do you price the 2300 X you know
with the same 4 core 4 thread layout so
I don't know that's a good question and
I'm why if they priced it below or above
what are they gonna do here curiosity is
hopefully yeah rejuvenating the cat
rather than just completely you know
calling it the poor cat like we don't
want that cat to die guys so 2,300 X
what do you guys think in chat do you
think it's a tough position with this
CPU I mean 4 cores 4 threads is already
very competitive I'm going to be honest
you've got 8100 you've got the 2200 g-20
200g coming in cheaper than the 80 100
plus it can be coupled with generally in
my experience at cheaper motherboard -
like an a320 2200 is actually a really
good combo if you're on a budget and
then if you wanted to step up things a
little bit more you've got that 80 100
and the haste raid 10 cost a little bit
more
but we'll give you a little bit more
performance so it all depends you've got
some really tough budget choices there
that I think the 2300 accent that I mean
2500 X I like that positioning I mean
for look at the 2500 X if it's just if
it's got that juicy amount of cash on
board which is saying it's only got four
maker that's a little three which is a
okay if it says if it has that juicy
amount of cash like it did last time I
think it was the 1500 X was it then yeah
16 point yeah I actually like that one
so it depends on what they're gonna mean
this is still not official yet so we
don't know if these specs are official
but it looks like they were gonna
release they're going to release a fork
weight threaded CPU and a fork or 4/3 at
this view and when I spoke to them over
in Thailand when when it was under under
NDA they sort of hinted that they didn't
really want to release a fork or or a
fork away threaded CPU like just with
the CPU no aid APU because they already
got the 2400 G the Vertigo the 2200 G
which kind of services that market
already so interesting position to say
the least yeah yeah but anyway anyway
can AMD do can AMD ever do any wrong
that's the question they they're they're
gonna have to price it I can't see them
pricing this higher than the 2200 G and
2400 I just don't I mean I I know they
have an edge when it comes to certain
things like just being able to run X and
P straight up with these newer second
generation processors is a beautiful
thing but I just can't see them charging
more for this knowing that you're not
getting you know onboard graphics and
and you'd be just I mean if you're gonna
buy a 24 to G anyway in that price range
you're probably gonna go without a
graphics card and if you're not then you
probably could have spent a little more
maybe on like a risin 5 1600 2600 I just
don't know I mean the 1500 was fine the
15 red X is already fine the way it was
so was the 1,300 X and the 1200 and it
just seems a little redundant I mean I
don't know do you think it could confuse
people to do you think that's a pulse
yeah unless they phase out rise I mean
if they phase out the 13
and the 1200 and I mean it doesn't make
any sense in my book right now to buy
the 1200 if you can get the 2200 G for
the same price right like why would you
short yourself something that you might
need in the future
um so they kind of already faced it out
do you want to go into this week's
conspiracy theory then oh yes okay so
what if the person who's doing the
marketing with AMD he just liked numbers
and now what if he just likes to see
more CPUs out in the market more numbers
and when he goes to a store like Micro
Center he seizes more AMD chips on the
menu that's kind of like his do you
reckon that's the reason he's got this
fetish he needs to see more numbers so
do you think that's the the conspiracy
theory that we're looking at to you guys
let me know in chat do you think that's
what's happening here with the 2,300 s
and 2500 X just let us go yeah so we've
always got to make conspiracy theories I
has every every every every week there
has to be a conspiracy theory
otherwise the shows not gonna be
interesting people are gonna tune in to
let us know you guys you think there is
someone there who just loves numbers and
he likes seeing more products a big
stack so let us know that could be a
possibility other than that we got the
apparently the knife Jen again when is
when is this knife Jen coming I mean we
got number microcode updates and it's
just honestly man this is getting
dragged a long way too much like Intel
hurry up and release these CPUs I'm
getting over this leg you know you got
to apparently go to 9600 K in 96 hundred
ninety five hundred ninety four hundred
ninety four hundred T ninety one hundred
nine thousand why don't we just going to
cz 390 and these CPUs being released we
know they're coming we know they're
coming I mean I got I heard about it
last year and now we got apparently we
got yeah the 9900 k-8 core 16 threads
when are we gonna see this out in the
mall it is just really like every time
every week we seem to hear a new room is
about these CPUs come into the market
and just like it is I'm sitting here
waiting I'd love to see the eight core
16 thread that's the one I'm most
excited about I want to see how much
they're gonna charge for it how high it
over clocks in respects to the six
twelve thread but it just seems like we
just get keep getting teased
yeah a little bit of a teasing what do
you think with that like honestly a lot
of this stuff seems we've done it anyway
I mean this is something that's been
Intel's rap for years but if you ask me
right I see the 8600 K and where it is
and then I see the 9600 K or what will
be the 9600 K and I'm looking I'm like
what's different I mean like what are we
expecting a big IPC jump from Coffey
Lake to this next gen I mean this new
line of processors gonna use the exact
same I mean it's coffee like it's all
the same stuff right like it's probably
gonna be like yeah like you said the
only one that looks intriguing to me is
the i-9 and and what I'm looking at now
and I look at the i-9 and we were
talking about this earlier when I see
eight cores 16 threads and people are
telling me okay if we can get any coarse
16 threads to five gigahertz that's
gonna be pretty epic but then you have
to ask the question how on earth you're
gonna get power delivery day course 16
threads on a-z 370 chipset that's why z3
90 is such a big deal but if you have to
upgrade chipsets and upgrade to the CPU
here oh it's gonna be a big chunk of
change especially if the CPU comes in
around 4 to 500 bucks which knowing
Intel that's what I'm do this is the
only one that's even worth in
entertaining right here in my name is
the i9 I did hear a rumor about a six
core 12 threaded i-5 but I mean that
would be pretty cool I mean it seems
like if they're gonna release another
i-5 and it's the same thing it's like
what incentive is there gonna be for
anyone that's what I'm saying
exactly and they do have the i7 9700 K
listed here with the same core count as
the 87 okay but yeah I agree if they
wanted the i-5 to be something new right
look with what they did with coffee lake
when they gave it six cores or what we
know it's coffee like now then they've
got to give it hyper threading I mean
doesn't make sense to give eighth course
no hyper threading and at this point I
prefer he's gonna go along further than
you know try to pack two extra cores
another die yeah I mean it's just really
I'm waiting for this I don't know when
it's gonna come I mean I've just this is
why all this stuff here used PC
price-performance is getting so popular
it's just becoming out of control
because we're not really saying we're
just seeing more cause as well in
general hey guys here
more cause more threads admittedly I
just test the 18 core and did you test
that as well and Premiere Pro was it not
just me that was some people are banned
I'm not getting all the calls all the
threads it was all the cause all the
threads was just killing it man in that
person that was what made me want to
build it because I had it I had
originally tested a few months back and
I kind of put it away because I just
really see 25 dollar donations III 70 X
for Sony I'll take my X 58 any day oh
dude yeah the x58 where is it at and
that's why I love X 58 and I'm gonna
keep recommending it for people who are
on a budget and want some extreme
awesome value I do do the video editing
so I do need a little bit more power and
that's why if this right here X 79 at
1680 v2 if this is legit
you're gonna see on my channel I'm not
kidding you I'm gonna be changing from
an 8700 K to an Ivy Bridge Xeon yeah
that's why I'm gonna be putting the used
price performance where my mouth is and
you say yeah and you what are you gonna
do when you see that video Greg and
that's the one up you man okay what are
you what are you gonna do this is the
bet is right here's that mean that's the
problem this is a good price performance
it apart right before exact I got the
Mader from cars that's the sound plug
when you donate money he's telling y'all
y'all go on have fun now because we're
doing stream were busy working here for
you guys so yeah so this one can't wait
to deliver this absolutely phenomenal i
I'm just so pumped about this right here
and there is 110 core Xeon as well
there's a 1681 v3 that is so elusive if
anyone has one or anyone knows one for
sale please link me that one is a ten
core 20 threaded Xeon and it's so
elusive it's a very special sample I
believe anyway back to the news so we've
done with the AMD stuff done with the
Intel stuff hallelujah I'm kind of
getting over a little bit of talking
about Intel versus AMD Intel versus AMD
I mean I did a I did a sponsored video
for Intel
and I mean hey I'd do a sponsored video
for AMD or Nvidia I didn't really care
now I just got to heat the comments
about the Red River in the coma in this
section I'm like guys is if AMD wanted a
thread ripper sponsored video I'd do it
you know yeah it's I didn't put
reviewing the title it wasn't a review
if I do put review on the title then
please unsubscribe from my channel I
don't deserve you has a viewer you know
sponsored content sponsored content and
it does definitely help the channel so
anyway next article we've got up here
fortnight so the pack there's you know
the saddest thing about apparently those
malware yeah I mean apparently is laced
it was laced with it was an aimbot that
was laced with malware and a lot of
people downloaded not malware but the
saddest thing about his article is
78,000 people downloaded this frickin
malware
I mean 78,000 people that's so sad man
do people really need to cheat that bad
to try and get whatever I mean I'm
guessing there's a lot of guys streaming
and they're trying to look pro with
aimbots yeah probably it's just
disgusting man like I remember back in
the brood war days if anyone was map
hacking they just got shunned from the
community like it was just one of those
things that you just don't do man like
two people do you need a cheat like do
you need a cheat is that how bad it is
like 78,000 I could understand it if its
download a thousand times whatever you
say yeah a couple of trolls but 78,000
people downloading aimbots is it's nots
man that's a lot that's a lot oh that's
so much people care about games like
that about winning okay I don't know
apparently Joe Joe is freaking someone
out in chat man oh that's come on man
what's wrong with Joe Jon cheese George
I was gonna save this channel you know
family because apparently YouTube
channels are dying off yeah oh thanks
cool he blasted it he's going hard on
the donations thanks man
I appreciate it apparently apparently
YouTube channels are dying but I know
Joe Joe he's gonna save tech yeah City
man that's why I've had him here this
whole time like easy so anyway for nine
who cares I don't even play for ya
I do care a lot because this sells
gaming PCs like you wouldn't believe
oh my god true that's right CAPITAL
LETTERS plays for tonight 1080p high
settings 60 FPS oh yes that salesmen I
remember three years ago it used to be
RGB if you could put in a Craigslist ad
that your computer had RGB and you could
change the colors wherever you want that
was like that was the top seller dude it
didn't matter who you were you were old
young male female I sold him to all
kinds of people just because I had RGB
in it and then that was those are
something that you did led fans
led fans is actually people out there to
think LED fans will make your computer
run faster like no kidding man no
kidding
so I'm gonna be teasing a guy's a guy on
the cold coast he's I call him the king
of the coast you're gonna find out why I
asked him for an LGA 775 board he gave
me six I asked him for some ddr2 memory
gave me like a hundred gigabytes of the
stuff
this guy's absolutely out of control
yeah he's on another level
king of the coast we're gonna be teasing
him a little bit on the channel having
some fun here you guys I'm gonna make it
a little bit of a series this guy is
amazing because he sort of came up after
I was doing my used price-performance
stuff and he took it next level there's
some really cool stuff he's done anyway
Infinity Ward they posted a teaser
return of Call of Duty so they were
posting a job ad and the main thing is
right whatever it Call of Duty it's
another probably another copy/paste job
on previous engine or whatever but the
multiple date when they said in the ad
they need someone to make this game they
need it for multiple next-gen platforms
multiple next-gen platforms so that
means we're getting some new consoles I
mean how do you feel about this Greg I
remember you telling me just don't DMS
before like damn I can't wait to get off
PC and um start my playstation it's all
like dude what's wrong with you I
thought if released for Christmas the
only thing I plan there is Mortal Kombat
X oh and that's only because I I destroy
anybody who comes into contact with me
in that game so that's that's just a
good pastime but I
much prefer much prefer PC gaming at
this point it's the consoles have a very
like there's this very specific use case
scenario for consoles where it's just
easy to power on start playing you don't
worry about overclocking blue screens of
death Windows 10 all kinds of driver
issues and what-have-you but I love
being able to control the hardware to
this extent and it's just know it's a
hobby more or less it's not really that
it's it's not that it's better even
though it is it's just ready I'll try
out I'll just I'll try and pull up the
DMS guys but pretty short a Gregg's
deleted them already he's just gone back
and your alter-ego dig the console game
all right we got a blended under five
bills thanks a lot for that man really
appreciate it
so we got so and elder piles saying that
the dude the blue LED fans dropped these
temps by 20 degrees okay yeah I see
where we're going with this okay so
that's top your PC from throttling and
increased performance okay blue LED fans
guys if you don't have them they may be
for blue LED you need four of them - you
can't have two you can't have three you
gotta have four blue LED fans and that
will speed up your performance so so
next up here we've got this article on a
battlefield 5 so the closed alpha Radeon
rx 580 beat the nvidia gtx 1060 and now
i'm saying a few articles on this
because I checked my newsfeed and
apparently it's it's given it a big a
44% increased FBS and the biggest
problem I have with this article is a
closed alpha that's the biggest problem
I have now if we heard about every
single game in closed alpha where one
company was beating the other by 40 fps
we wouldn't be like we're just this text
showed be gone 24 hours a day I mean
isn't it a little bit stupid like if I
mean this feels like a fanboy war
article where I mean closed alphas
closed alpha guys it's so infant in the
development stages mean closed beta may
but yeah I mean closed the office I mean
you remember Starcraft 2 that was in
closed alpha way way below that game
wait even for least men remember eyes I
saw it in closed alpha two I was like oh
my god I can't wait for this game to be
released and that took ages from closed
alpha to be released on PC ages I have
to look at what they exactly I mean
there are so many details so many
questions you would have about these the
use case here about what they had set up
how they had on the graphics head you
don't api's what have you all these
variables to consider I mean you think
about this reminds me not the keys or
some mad donations come on call he said
there's fifty bucks from me go get
yourself some Zeon's of it thanks dude
I'm gonna be dude I've already got
before the new tax year in Australia
that because they open 10% GST I got
some x34 46:34 30s but I'm like I got
this Z on as well I'll be doing it in
the video but just to note to you guys
if you want to get one I'll put maybe
I'll try and put some links in
description below we can get them cheap
before I do the videos if I do the video
they might you know sell out I then
hammer time oh guns ablaze thanks dude
so much for the donation $50 he just
said he want to say kudos about doing
builds for the underprivileged man yeah
dude I when I meet these kids I'm prone
ago to come pouring in a crime man
because there's gonna be such a good
it's such a good cause and I think yeah
if I do this video and then a lot of
other people start helping out you know
just people like that way we can make a
difference I mean I got talked told
about Edie from tax sauce given a PC I
like it it's a really good guy if you
meet him in real real life he's really
cool he had a guy who essentially gave a
PC to a whole set up and he went and
sold the PC the next day but I mean II
dude you should have seen that coming
man you walked into that guy's house you
should have been like dude this guy does
not need a PC and I highlighted another
$5 I get cool thanks man
I'll Andy you should put a bit of text
in there brother if you wanted but with
Edie
I think Edie picked the wrong dude the
warning signs were there as soon as you
walk into this guy's house I mean he saw
I saw the video and the guy's house was
just incredible and I would have thought
to myself this guy does not need this
pace it you know what I mean there's
more needy people than this dude that's
just my two cents so yeah and he Braun
would do company to hope you find a
autistic kid to donate to yes so did you
get my ice thing I sent some zealand's
to you do did you get them in the mail
if not just send me another email sorry
I'm so busy yeah I'm I'm gonna find just
you know kids like I said in the video
that are just sol men and then look
after him so sorry anyway Greg talk to
me oh I'm sorry I cut you off as well
yeah I cut you off good what were you
gonna say just reminded me of what AMD
had done not that am be someone who's
done something shady like this but when
they compare you know like for capers 4k
cpu you know CP versus e pu which is
like okay you're completely eliminating
the cpu from the picture when you're
playing in 4k higher ultra settings you
know so it's not really a comparison
that's worth making and that resolution
and it just kind of reminds me of like a
similar thing with that when you're
talking about closed alpha I mean a game
that has so far to go before it actually
starts selling right I mean it's not
even beta phase like you were talking
about and sometimes you play games in
beta even alpha but it's just yeah I
think it's a little far-fetched a little
too early little premature you in
assuming just from one story like that
yeah so anyway that's I mean I looked at
the closed alpha pod and I was like yeah
okay I'm probably not gonna be partaking
in really like macho I mean it's great
thing that AMD's RX 580 is doing really
well that's good
so yeah but it's still it's closed alpha
that's no really ridiculously early so
you you have to go now do you Greg yeah
okay so Greg has to sign off short time
guys I'll join you guys in chat sorry
this world's the tech world TV episodes

other out bounce off each other he's a
really cool guy

in the past for just being um I guess it
just been new to YouTube I mean the guys
young so go easy on him
but it is you know he's he's really good
and really cool guy in real life and
that's what I mean for me it's like I
mean I mean a lot of you guys in real
life they actually the Gold Coast
community I rocket jump ninja is really
cool dude as well so we're just building
up a community and I just like I said
I'm always gonna judge someone on who I
meet in real life and I've met some
people online they like they seem like
the shadiest Babel or they just seem
really weird then you made
laughs and there's just such a cool
people that's what I'd take any day over
the opposite someone who seems really
nice online than your meter in real life
and they're an absolute d-bag so anyway
let's just join back on chat Tech yes

I'll find some deals there I'll just go
bang on people's doors in the street and
be like yo can I clean some ice out the
front of your house and just in exchange
for an old PC or something I'd make some
magic happen doesn't matter I don't know
if you're allowed to exchange labor for
PC parts in that in that show but
whatever makes something happen so yeah
so okay it kind of like scrapyard warts
challenge when you get over to my
country anyway dude a lot of people are
requesting I made one in Australia just
like something in Australia I'd love to
work with guys like green hand gaming

a few cool guys where we could do
something really cool in Australia it's
also there's a lot of cool tech channels

to bring it if that's that's gonna be
like man be so cool if I do that and
can't wait to do it for you guys anyway
wind up I might just join you guys in
actual chat now thanks for watching the
show was a little bit short sorry about
that
again Greg had to cut him cut the show
short cuz he had to go see a movie with
his wife because she goes back to
Germany soon and I mean it's tough doing
a long-distance thing I mean I honestly
don't know how he makes it work to be
honest long-distance relationships are
very hard but hopefully she can move
over to the US or something like that in
the future so he's just better he's
making the most of his time with her
which is which is a good thing so I'm
not going to hold that to him anyway
so judge our chat let's get it on guys
if you enjoyed this one and be sure to
hit that like button sorry if I sound a
little bit as someone said I sound
depressed no not depressed at all man
there's just so much on the plate like I
said before I've had to put my used
hardware even on this desk here
because there's just so much crap in
this studio at the moment so many
donations coming in as well thank you
guys so much for that
and that's one thing I do before I get
on out of here I say you know everyone's
got a gift and I think I'm starting to
realize what my gift is and that is that
I can just take trash trake stuff the
people have abandoned and turned it into
gold and I used to do this I'll openly
admit I used to do this in Japan with
car pots and that's you're probably
wondering why does he use wd-40 and then
brake cleaner on computer pots that's
how I tested that stuff out because I
used to use that to clean up the car
parts that's just there guys just
putting that out there so it's sort of
like one thing I did one thing in
another field sort of brought that over
to the computer parts and it works
absolutely fine brake cleaner however
don't use it on mice I have killed a
mice in the past like both are real like
you know running around little mouse and
endures later rat I think yeah rat and
and I've actually killed a mechanical
mouse too so yeah that's brake cleaner
and wd-40 is safe to use on everything
never had a problem with that at all but
just be careful when you spraying that
on a CPU or GPU because it will not
conduct as well as thermal paste so when
you zoom in my videos always cover up
the cpu spray a bit of wd-40 down if
it's on the circuits and then put the
stuff on anyway you guys are awesome
love you'll I'll catch you guys in chat
as for my car as well I get asked that a
lot - what car am i driving all the
Astral yet like the Astra I want to
actually do a video on it because the
Astra broke down like literally the day
before I was getting my next car the
Astra broke down on the street it just
broke down and it was so it was just so
unlucky man you know I don't know my
luck sucks when it comes to cars so I
was like nah I'm gonna go find a deal
got a really good deal on a car I'll be
um I'll show it yeah i'll show it soon
it's it's a special car i love it so
anyway guys we will catch you guys very
soon I'll just join you in chat now
thanks for watching you guys are awesome
