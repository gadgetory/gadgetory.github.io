came into one big mess and so today is
gonna be a vlog for you guys where I'm
changing things around and finally got a
temporary solution in the background
here to give you guys with content
all right so we're at a place called
office works now and then they've got
some desks so I need a new desk I'm just
gonna see what they've got and we're
gonna go to another place after this
place so let's go see what's inside so
we're just looking at chairs now I am
liking this chair here though it's
pretty damn expensive then I'm like $149
for a chair like this like dead set from
memory and Japan would be like for the
80 70 dollars something like that so
anyway we just got the desks here so I'm
looking at this I think I might get this
I'm not too sure but yeah I'm gonna keep
looking around different stores and see
what they've got so I'll just show you
guys my favorite pics right so then I
come over here and I look at more desks
like this and it's like I like this
would install as well so I don't know
there's gonna be a lot of choices to
think from but choices choices choices
and this is the last desk I see here
like this is by far the best-looking
desk I've seen so far I don't know why
yeah different it's different isn't it
oh wow I don't know yeah so I'm gonna be
thinking about this one definitely it
looks awesome
could you imagine that guys in a
backdrop it's not that special just a
desk okay let's get going
so which is a suit for a mine now
they've got some pretty cool des they're
like big thick wood ones and little
thick wood ones and stuff but there's
two that caught my eye is this one here
is the black one
that's pretty just standard nice
whatever and then they got this one here
the glass which is pretty cool so I'm
liking this too this dark glass set up
so I gotta have a think really gonna
have a think then of course I got some
chairs and whatnot but lots of thinking
to do and then another place called out
domain I think it is domain and Harvey
Norman so we're gonna head here just see
if they've got anything decent before we
make up out of my so they've got the New
York desk in yeah I like it except I
don't have like two and a half grand so
that one's kind of out of the picture
please go this one here the apex desk I
like it but again I want to get the
whole corner so like decisions decisions
thousand dollars for a desk damn man I
think it's like a it's just one of those
days or it's techno city baby at this
place anyway so we're at a place called
domain now now Dan with three thousand
three hundred dollars like today like
the stuff is expensive but also besides
that like the place just smells
expensive too so we're gonna get out of
here so we've been on gumtree and now
we're looking for some low cost desks
now when you deal with low cost paths
you have to come across as a low
maintenance individual hello eyes at a
desk on gumtree are ya how much was it
okay is that the one up in near Brisbane
okay would you take a hundred big ones
for it I just had a rough week with work
mate no worries mate thanks for that
hell I saw your ad on gumtree for a desk
for a disc yeah I would you take 50 big
ones for a mic okay mate do you want to
send us over the address and you know
I'll come pick her up
all right so we've got a desk here that
we're gonna go pick up 450 AUD which
would be like 35 USD a song so let's go
check it out and pick it up hopefully
yeah from the water coming to your house
and what I'm telling you about yeah dude
what were you telling me all right so we
picked this desk out for around about
$50 and we're clearing out the room
where it is in so so far we've got this
desk out the front here that is going in
the trash because it's like old and
dated and then we're gonna put this desk
in the corner and here's the works so
far so we're gonna get this is like the
family computer so we're gonna move that
over here and I'm gonna be using this
whole corner to do YouTube
alright so move that over there and I've
got this place cleaned down for the
corner so what I'm going to do is in
whack the desk over all this since it's
a linen that cable and I'll worry about
cleaning
all right so we're gonna do some cable
management here so we're just gonna talk
all the cables behind the desk
so here's the new setup here it is just
temporary for now I mean I've got to get
the monitor standing still and I've got
to set up another monitor so I can have
the dual monitor setup but in the
meantime I have just a keyboard box
wrapped in some carpet stuff and sitting
on there sitting there perfectly fine
we've got all the graphs cards that I've
brought over and they're kind of like
the second-hand graphs customer to do
some views build with them or something
and there's my setup there until I get a
new case so that's all ready to go on a
new case so I can just picture it all
it's gonna happen magics gonna happen
for you guys and then underneath look at
that Ed from tech sauce would be so
proud of me right now
look at that cable management and I did
all this in two hours two hours you
