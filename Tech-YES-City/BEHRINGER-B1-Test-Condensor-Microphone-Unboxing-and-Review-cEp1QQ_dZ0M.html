test for the BAE ring of b1 so this is a
on an M audio guys fast track mark 2 or
model 2 and yeah guys I've got the
settings in Windows at 90% and then I've
got the M the Mick gain is about
two-thirds of the way up and the outputs
two-thirds way up and as you can hear
guys this is crystal clear so it also
makes your voice a lot more bassy ER
which is cool I kind of like it anyway
guys if you're looking to do
commentaries and you know you're looking
to get a professional set up that's
really cheap this thing only costed me
like one hundred and seventy dollars the
net costed me $80.00 the m-audio costed
me $90 and all in all guys this is a
awesome combo if you want to do
commentaries or podcasting as you can
tell my voice is crystal clear and this
microphone is really good it picks up
the lows and the highs so let's give it
a quality test guys count from 1 to 5 1
2 3 4 5 and let's do it let's do a pop
and P filter test heyguys pop pop and
pop up a per√∫
so there's a P yes it's got it's got a
pop filter on it guys like comes with a
windshield pop filter and it's really
good unit you know if you're gonna buy
this microphone you'd even need to buy a
pop filter I wasted another 10 bucks
actually no $15 on a pop filter not to
worry not to worry at all so anyway guys
this thing is awesome if you got any
questions let me know in the comment
section below guys and also check out my
m-audio fast track review and if you're
gonna keep watching then please keep
watching as i'm going to be doing an
unboxing of this and show you what you
get in the package anyway guys i can get
really close and get closer and get
closer and it's really cool I can speak
right into the microphone now or I can
skip back and sort of talk back from
here you may be able to hear my birds in
the background and you may be able to
hear my heater as well but anyway guys
let me know what you think woo
okay guys so you've heard the microphone
test and now let's look at the product
itself okay so when you first get it
this is what it would come in from
coming in just a nice simple box with
all the specs stated there so gold
plated 3 pin XLR output connector just
good I'll show you that later
and you know it's 10 decibel - 10
disability put potentially sensor yeah
here in the box and that's all you get
the manual and the other manual and this
nice case here so so this is the meal I
haven't actually read it yet but this
case guys let's have a little product
itself the case is a nice really nice
and good sturdy case you know the good
good if you need to carry microphone
around and you know take a good take a
good beating so inside it's all well you
know nice rubberized and foam on the top
here so it's you know it's gonna keep
the microphone pretty you know pretty
safe so let's say look what we get guys
we get the shock mount so this is the
shop nut here and that is solid guys
that is pretty well constructed so fill
solvent and it feels nice good quality
okay
plus it's got the clip there so that
will clip into your microphone stand and
that's that so then we get here we get
like a windshield and a I guess sort of
like a pop filter as well so that's fear
my friend put over the top there and
here we get the v1 itself the microphone
so this is the big this is the big
package right here is what we're all
interested in guys so this is it here
guys nice gold-tone construction there
and it says b1 on the front with a
ringer the symbol there so I don't know
why the ing is highlighted bold up song
and tell me why and this is the switch
here so your three modes D and switch
between them and the actual construction
of it feels really solid guys so you
know feels like going to take a bit of a
beating and you know if it feels
well-made like it doesn't feel like a
cheap microphone at all guys so you know
it looks really good so you're looking
at it here looks really good so the
there's the three plate again three
prom gold-plated XLR output there so
very good guys and overall you a nice
solid product guys so if you're looking
to get a microphone that goes you know
I'll put that in later but yet if you're
looking for a nice cheap so it's only
$80 guys all this for $80 and it sounds
awesome so if you're looking for a cheap
budget a condenser microphone cardioid
then this is your microphone guys this
is your go-to microphone so I actually
haven't tried the c1 and the c3 but I
heard they want that good and I really
have heard all but nothing I've heard
all good reviews about this microphone
guys so anyways here it is guys
recommended by me too and I hope you
liked it and peace out if you got any
questions about this microphone guys
please leave in the conversation below
and I'll get back to you as soon as I
can and yeah guys peace out for now
we're on easy bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
