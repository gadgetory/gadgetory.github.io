welcome to tech city this is brand
coming to you guys today with an odd
sort of video where I'm swapping out the
reference cooler on an Rx 480 with an
excel or over zh n' 3 to see if the
rumors are true if you can get those
higher overclocks with a better cooler
but not only that we're going to
benchmark it in games and test
temperatures and noise verse this little
bad boy but anyway let's bump the x3 on
there
so I had a bit of a hard time getting
this cooler on it wasn't entirely
compatible with the RS 480 the gddr5
memory was soo close to the died so I
had to actually knock some of these off
to enable the cooler to fit on now I
don't recommend doing this especially on
a tool that has the memory cooled from
the get-go but for benchmarking purposes
then why not also it does look kind of
ridiculous with this card on this PCB
but anyway let's get on with those
figures
and a quick noise test
so basically with an Arctic seller on
there the results were very interesting
the initial benchmark runs enabled this
cooler with the Arctic to reach the
magic 1,400 megahertz
whereas the reference peaked out at
around 1300 and 60 megahertz so we
gained a little bit more there on the
overclocks though the noise was a lot
and I mean a lot less than the reference
which is to be expected given the sheer
size of this cooler though what was the
weirdest part was that after about an
hour of benchmarking when playing some
csgo at 4k which stressed the GPU 100%
by the way the clocks on both reference
and Arctic coolers came down to a
thirteen hundred and forty beggar Hertz
that is I had to manually set these
levels otherwise I would incur a black
screen or artifacts while playing also
the ambient temp swirly pretty damn high
for this kind of thing but unfortunately
I don't have a con in this room anyways
it was fun to test things other than low
ambient temps and lastly I know other
people especially like Jays $0.02 and
stuff have put water coolers on the rx
for ages and done all sorts of crazy but
with one of these coolers the great
thing is that they are relatively cheap
compared to a custom water block setup
and you can use them from generation to
generation of cards that is you can
reuse them though this one wasn't a good
fit so I'd recommend going with
something smaller and something that
fits properly I don't know why I'm
shaking this card I'll stop now anyway
guys that's about it really
aftermarket cooling solutions they do a
great job of cooling keeping the noise
down and sometimes giving you better
overclocks depending on the ambient
temperatures and also the card and if
you liked this video then be sure to hit
that like button and let us know in the
comments section below are you running
an aftermarket solution on your graphics
card if so what and I'll love to hear
your comments is always an all catching
the next tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
comment section below are you running an
aftermarket cooler on your GPU if so
what I'd love to hear your thoughts turn
down the volume</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
