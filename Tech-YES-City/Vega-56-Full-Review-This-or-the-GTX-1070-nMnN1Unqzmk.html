finally released their rx Vegas series
gratis cards this here being the 56
Edition which is rumored to come in at
399 dollars MSRP however due to ongoing
supply and demand issues and lots of
different rumors going around I will be
basing my conclusion on two different
sets of MSRP s both 399 and 499 as well
as that I'll be comparing it against the
gtx 1070 which i believe is its main
competitor and also a lot of you guys on
twitter asked me to not only overclock
and do the results overclocked as well
as stock but also under vault this card
and do a little bit of tests with that
so i'm gonna be doing all three for you
guys and we're gonna see what's cooking
up in yes city
so here it is here in the flesh this is
Vega 56 this is the black version I
believe in the 64 Edition you can get a
limited edition and also a water-cooled
version though this is the reference
cooler and as you guys know it will push
a lot of air out of the case though it
can get very loud and this one's no
different actually it is a little bit
different I believe it's the loudest
cooler
I have heard to date and on that note it
is also one of the most powerful coolers
I've ever seen for a reference cooler
this thing can blow some serious air
I'll let you guys take a quick listen
and a quick test
however I know you guys came here to see
the bench master today I'm gonna be
comparing this against the EXO C sniper
from gal axe and with the sniper it does
come overclocked out of the box
however in Australia Galax sells some of
the best value for money and video
graphics cards out there which come in
cheaper than the founders Edition cards
which I'm sure a lot of people are going
to be buying a custom model if they can
considering they're usually cheaper and
they perform better and also they remain
quieter in regards to an adding board
partner cut on an Rx Vega I'm not too
certain yet but with that said let's
roll those benchmarks where I compare
both stock and overclocked settings to
give you guys a better feel of what the
numbers will present if you want to do
either roll with these cards so moving
on into the first benchmark we've got
doom at 1440p in Volk and this is on
ultra settings and all the games here
will be at 4040 PR the very high ultra
settings and we're moving into arcade
mode on a level that I can just
replicate these settings you can see the
vague of 56 on the balance mode which is
essentially out of the box settings
score 109 fps beating the 1070 out of
the box don't want overclocked both
these graphics cards to 1070 did pull
ahead by quite a little bit against the
balance mode however when we overclocked
vega 56 that then pulled ahead of the
1070 overclocked one thing about the
vega 56 over clocks is they use of
substantial amount more power and we'll
see that soon at the end of these
benchmarks the moving on to the next
game we've got here f1 2016 and in this
benchmark AMD did score a victory with
the vega 56 balanced profile beating out
the 1070 galaxy by one FPS and then
overclock we saw similar results with
the vega 56 overclock being the 1070 yet
again then moving on into Far Cry primal
we yet again see that the vega 56 card
did pull ahead of the 1070 with a 70 vs
74 on the other clock settings and 67 vs
65 with the out-of-the-box settings
Grand Theft Auto 5 however was where
things turn around for the green team
with the gtx 1070 both OC and no no C
profiles during a victory over both
balanced profile and the overclocked
settings on Vega 56 our Vega 56
overclocked settings did have a sizable
gain over the balance profiles in this
particular game
and old but not forgotten title is
Crysis 3 and even to this date it is
still such a very demanding title 1440p
very high settings with Vega 56
overclocked scoring the slight victory
over the gtx 1070 overclocked however
out of the box settings the victory does
go to the gtx 1070 if you're one of
those people who hates getting outside
in the real world and getting dirty then
dirt for may be of interest to you and
sitting behind a monitor here you can
get good frame rates on vega 56 OC with
115 average FPS and even the balanced
profile out of the box did score a
victory over the gtx 1070 both OC and
non OC profiles next up here we've got
deus ex man king divided and this is DX
12 1440p very high settings vega 56 OC
did score the victory here in the
balance profile did score a slight
victory over the out-of-the-box settings
for the gtx 1070 then the overclocked a
mode of course did give a little bit of
a burst of the 1070 though not as much
as Vega 56
moving on into the very popular player
unknowns battlegrounds 300 seconds at
the ruins 1440p ultra we saw that the
gtx 1070 OC and non OC profiles did
score victories over OC and balanced /
falls on the AMD graphics card however
it is important to know that I did test
this as well on the latest driver for
the AMD Crimson drivers so this was the
18 point to which I believe did bring
optimizations for AMD graphics cards on
pub G so it still does lose out to
Nvidia graphics cards on this game by
quite a bit
especially considering this Vega 56
overclocked is very aggressive so
classes the division is a very
consistent benchmarking we saw that the
vega 56 out of the box did score slight
victory over 1070 out of the box and
overclocked settings did show that as
well then the last game we have up here
is battlefield 1 1440p ultra settings
vega 56 out of the box did score a
little bit of the victory over the GTS
1070 even when it was overclocked as
well they scored similar numbers and of
course when you overclocked vega 56
that's when its performance really came
out and it got some pretty high figures
with 108 FP
yes moving under some alternate
benchmarks out of the box the gtx 1070
got around 68 degrees there when we get
the fan speeds up to 80% which is still
very quiet on this car by the way let
you guys take a quick listen let's go to
62 degrees so it was staying very cool
when we move over to Vega of the 56 the
balance profile did score pretty well I
mean it scored very low noise I'll let
you take a listen and that went up to 74
degrees the Vega 56 OC of course that
fan it just ramps up and it does do a
very good job of cooling coming in at 65
degrees and now moving on into power
consumption in the heaven benchmark 455
watts out of the wall this is Vega 56
overclocked this is on both the HBM
memory and the core itself I got 8.5
percent extra out of the core and I got
I believe the memory up to nine hundred
and thirty five megahertz on the HBM to
the balanced profile score 321 watts so
it was pretty good and then the gtx 1070
of course overclocked scored 295 watts
and 274 was this is total system power
draw as well on the 7900 X that I use
for benchmarking then when we take all
the different power consumption profiles
and then measure them up against each
other you can see that the out of the
box profiles is the balanced mode it's
probably the best way to go I mean out
of the box if you guys don't really want
to tune anything the turbo mode does use
an extra around 30 watts however you
don't get that big of a performance jump
from turbo over balanced and power
savings didn't really save that much
either oh this is on the 56 I've heard
it's different however for Vegas 64
though with the OSI tune this is a very
interesting overclock because here I
raise the memory speeds and it did make
a significant difference in performance
as we saw in the benchmarks however when
I dropped the core down itself and
undertood that we managed to save around
31 watts and still get very high
performance figures they pulled out the
last benchmark here we've got
battlefield one again with all the
different profiles on Vega see there the
turbo mode for the extra power it uses
up really
and worth it over balance mode of course
the overclock modes themselves for the
extra power draw aren't worth it either
however if you are a water cooling
enthusiast and you do want to put this
thing under water you will be able to
extract good performance figures out of
Vega if that's what you wish to do so
there it is all the benchmarks it shows
that Vega 56 can definitely perform and
this is pretty much the infant drivers
for this grabs card things will get a
little bit better over time I'm sure but
one thing I will say is that out of the
box this thing really is nothing special
especially compared to the 1070 and keep
in mind though the 1070 of course is
overclock down at the Box compared to a
reference card but that's what people
are buying at the moment that still
doesn't answer the question of which
should you get Vega 56 or the gtx 1070
and really with the current
cryptocurrency mining boon on I would
get whatever's cheapest at the time this
does do a pretty good job of coming in
and being a competitive card however as
we saw with the power consumption
figures it still uses more power out of
the box than a gtx 1070 does when it's
overclocked and the overclocked 1070
figures did score better and this thing
did out of the box so i would recommend
if you guys just want to get a gratis
card put it in your computer then the
1070 is probably the better buy at the
time though if you're an enthusiast and
you can definitely keep this thing under
wraps you've got good case ventilation
you're going to put a water block on it
then vega 56 is definitely going to be a
lot of fun for you or of course if
you're in the market day at a gratis
card and couple it with a free sink
monitor and Vega 56 is again a good
proposition though I will say a $399 if
you can pick this card up with that
price it will be a good buy though it
499 dollars I just don't see many people
buying as then you start to get into GT
X 1080 territory and that thing will put
up a fight and do so whilst using a lot
less power
than this thing will especially when
this is overclocked though the adding
board partners do remain to be seen what
they can do also graphic driver updates
I am looking forward to those so coming
back and revisiting this in about three
months will be a very interesting case
there was it stands now Vega 56 is also
probably the card to get
the Vega lineup I believe those extra
stream processes won't do a whole lot in
terms of performances this thing was
limited by the HBM to memory speeds by
quite a lot and also a big shout-out to
gamers Nexus who helped me confirm that
this graphics card was indeed a Vega
56 and not a 64 is when I first got it
there was no labeling at all so I didn't
know what graphics card it was and then
of course I looked up in gpu-z and it
said it had over 4,000 stream processors
which was 64 but then Steve helped us
test out the numbers and make sure that
it was actually a 56 by the numbers that
I was getting out in fire strike and the
GPU scores so I'll put his channel in
the link in the description below so big
thank you for that also a lot of people
were talking about under vaulting this
card and getting the most out of it I
didn't have a lot of success as opposed
to others who did I believe get some
sizeable drops in power consumption and
they did get relatively the same
performance as I said before in the
benchmarks I managed to drop the core to
around about fifteen hundred and thirty
two megahertz I managed to get the
millivolts down to 1080 and at those
speeds it was performing pretty close to
the max overclock settings and I did
save around 30 watts so there is some
advantages of course 2 under vaulting on
this card and getting that best tuned
scenario and it will save you some power
savings on the power bill and of course
in turn saving heat in your case saving
heat on the cooler so it is worth doing
if you're on Vega 2 under vault if
you're overclocking the HBM to memory
but what about the three profiles out of
the box the turbo the power save and the
balance well none of those three
profiles impress me at all in fact the
fan curve profiles were very
conservative to the point where I
believe this card was throttling in some
of the benchmarks I was doing too so I'd
like to see that get fixed because as it
stands out of the box if you guys want
to use this thing just buy it and use it
I'd much rather recommend getting a gtx
1070 as it stands it performs better and
more consistently what I did custom OC
it though did perform really well
however it was very noisy and also some
last-minute things this Radeon logo does
light up in the dark you've also got two
8 pin connectors with GPU tech
indicators the
can be either turned off or switched to
a blue color and then there's a switch
here which I believe is normal and uber
mode though for me it did absolutely
nothing even when I resented the
computer
I just got nothing out of this switch so
yeah I mean must just be the model hey
guys hope you enjoy today's Vega 56
review and if you did them sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comment section below if this was in a
perfect world $399 and the gtx 1070 was
three hundred and seventy nine dollars
and you can pick them up which would you
pick up and why love reading your
comments as always and i'll catch you in
another tech video very soon and also
sorry that I didn't make a tech video in
a while I actually came down with him
flew Ensor and that's probably why I
sound different in this video - this one
actually took me a long-term record -
because I was like bed bound for four
days and I'm still recovering now so
yeah that's that but anyway I'll catch
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
