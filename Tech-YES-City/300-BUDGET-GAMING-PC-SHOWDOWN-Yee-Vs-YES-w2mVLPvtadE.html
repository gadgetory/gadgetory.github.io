going to be decided by the comments so
that's right you guys in the comments
have a week to decide who wins this
competition based off of three different
things you guys are going to decide who
had the better aesthetic who got the
better value for all of the parts and
who had better performance so what are
we waiting for ye verse yes and the
loser has to give the winner their
profits are you ready I look forward to
an easy paycheck ye vests yes so this
will be my first time meeting
Christopher ye and I've already got a
deal lined up for an RX 484 gigabyte 475
bucks but I gotta get this thing quickly
because it's getting a little bit late
so hopefully comes soon and then I can
just use his car and get this deal
because I don't have a car and it's time
to start the competition in Vegas - who
can build the best $300 PC
nice to vation man we got no time to do
a competition but let's do it
so I just picked up the RX for 80 this
is a 4 gigabyte solution but in a
competition something like this is
pretty much the best value for money the
performance this gives hopefully we're
looking for around a thirteen and a half
thousand 3dmark firestrike score which
will be great
now we picked this up off Craigslist it
was seventy-five US dollars and I'm
emailed the person and they emailed me
back and I've got to get a few more
deals like right now we're gonna go get
a 120 gigabyte SSD which I found on
Facebook marketplace for 15 bucks but
they also got a one terabyte hard drive
for 25 so considering I do want to flip
this PC after I'm done I will be indeed
purchasing both the drives even though
I've still gotta talk to Chris about how
to do this price off this build because
you don't necessarily need two drives in
a competition but regardless gonna get
the two drives and then I'm still gonna
look for a power supply because
something is really bad news for me
personally and that is I can't use offer
up all let go in America because I've
got an Aussie number and offer up just
straight up won't even install on my
phone and let go won't even let me send
any messages because I don't have an
American phone number anyway enough of
looking at this graphics card let's go
get the
so I just picked up the drives needed
for this build right here we got the 120
gigabyte SSD that's gonna go really well
also get a one terabyte hard drive
because there's gonna be a great item as
we said before for the flip and then
we've got he managed to have some extra
ddr3 memory I had to to get sticks into
four gigabyte sticks I said with Java he
said what do you want for it what do you
want to offer for and I was like I'm 15
bucks so that's 10 gigabytes of RAM for
15 bucks it's not bad I always managed
to utilize ddr3 memory regardless but
usually anything that comes under about
24 USD for 8 gigabytes of ddr3 is
usually worth it because then you can
get it brand new direct from China for
that price here we got another really
cool addition he had this lying around
for some reason I just had to get this
it's a legit copy of Windows XP
Professional x64 Edition and it comes
with a key and yeah that's just a blast
of the past maybe I can do a video for
you guys with Windows XP vs. Windows 10
but from here on in I've gotta go pick
up a power supply now which I have no
idea how to get one because I haven't
sauced one yet I did message a guy on
Facebook he had one that was available
for ten dollars but he didn't know if it
worked and he wanted me to meet him
before 5 p.m. which was impossible so
maybe we'll go pick that up tomorrow if
it's still available but I'm gonna
borrow a Christopher use phone now and
see if I can find a budget power supply
to finish off this build dude why did I
even bother buying a harddrive because
it just taxed one of these in your car I
would have made it free so just the same
location now we quickly Bank a offer 15
dollars on a 400 watt a VGA power supply
the guys like yep I've accepted so we're
gonna hostel this and go pick it up now
man that's actually pretty lucky
so here's the final piece of the puzzle
this is the 400 watt EVGA power supply
it's got an 8 pin PCIe motherboard and
CPU pin so we're good to go it's got 30
amps this should be absolutely fine for
an RX 480 and an i-5 6400 so that's the
last of the deals
we're gonna go to quickly get out of
this car and go get something to eat and
then we'll talk about what is to come in
terms of my builds and also what other
specs I've put together
so here we are now we're gonna eat a
Japanese style ramen in the what's this
place called Mon Tech monto so now we
just finished up the ramen and it was
amazing but I've got two other pieces
that I'm gonna be using for this bill
we've got the $20 case that I picked up
in California and there's no point
buying another cases that'll just be put
to waste and it's already got LED fans
in it but we've also got that $50 combo
that I've already flipped a couple of
them but I've still got one available
and that is I 560 400 Aysen motherboard
it's got Wi-Fi included and it's going
to make about a stick of ddr4 memory so
this whole combo together tallying it
off the top of my head for the minimum
entry point - the one terabyte hard
drive I think we're coming in around 175
US dollars which is absolutely amazing
but there's still one problem that is
I'm still sweating about this power
supply and the graphics card we don't
know if they work the hard drives I
definitely know that they work as we
went into the guy's house he said that
they'll working he's cleaned him up but
the power supply we picked it up off a
kid and he was like sweating when I
asked him like what are you doing with
his power supply
why he's selling it and he was kind of
like oh I needed an 800 watt power
supply is like Chris then asked him what
for he's like ah for my gtx 550 pc so it
was really weird and then we had the
other guy the first guy i was asking him
about the RX 480 and he was like well i
just pulled it off a computer where the
motherboard blew up and I'm just
thinking to myself yeah I'm gonna go
back to the hotel room and try and test
these things out fingers crossed that it
all works out because if it does is
gonna be one amazing price performance
rig but what we're gonna do right now is
I'm going to sit down with Chris and
we're gonna talk about the rules of this
competition which we're then gonna kind
of cut back to the intro of this video
and tease it a little bit should be
pretty interesting let's go do that
we just got back to Chris's house now
and a really nice place we're going to
test out now my RX 480 and also my power
supply because I can't be going to a
hotel room and building this PC and it's
quite simply having problems potential
problems is much easier to test things
out before I put this build together
so Brian's definitely seen a few of the
scam videos here in Las Vegas not not
everything that gets advertised works as
it should
oh it's not just that I mean the viewers
out there know I've been hosed time and
time again in the past and after a
couple of times you learn you learn to
sort of read the body language the
language that they're using and you kind
of seem to cede out a scam in the making
and you kind of avoid those sort of
bargains potential bargains but yeah
let's test these pots out now and then
after that I'm not too sure you want to
test out your pot or have you got your
stuff together
you know I'm okay I'm good he's gonna
save his stuff for his channel and his
build I'm doing the yes build right here
okay we've got test one here and this is
the did christopher yee win by default
test and no he didn't
this past fly works so we didn't get
hosed on this but now it's time to test
the RX 480 in the background there see
you'll put out a signal are you sweating
right now are you sweating we didn't get
hosed on so it's now like midday next
day I slept over the 10 hours straight I
was just so tired just coming off CES I
was pretty sick went to the gym how to
shower all freshened up and we're gonna
start building this PC right now and
then install Windows so let's get on
with it mr. Yi you haven't seen my cruel
intentions just yet
so since the Coolermaster half doesn't
have any 2.5 inch support here we're
gonna mount this diagonal and then use
the tension of the screws to our mouth
is SSD like this little trick since I
don't have any double-sided tape and of
course I don't have a lot of time either
just got phase one off this bill done
and we're absolutely fine with working I
am going to reconfigure these fans
somehow since we only have one
additional three pin besides the CPU
cooler on this board so it means I'm
probably either gonna have to get an
extender or just take two fans out since
it isn't that hot of a build and the
case is pretty big anyway so I think the
LED fans gonna stay and the two normal
fans are gonna go for reasons being LEDs
cell builds but we're gonna install
Windows right now and then we're gonna
install the grabs card because while I'm
installing Windows I can actually change
the thermal paste on the graphics card
and also change over the settings on
this motherboard since I need a disable
secure boot and also enable CSM so let's
get that on the way now I haven't spoken
to Christopher yet about Windows 10 in
the price of that bringing in the key
cost but if you guys are after a cheap
single end user license Windows 10 x64
pro key then SCD Keys today's video
sponsor have you covered for as little
as twelve dollars by using the link in
the description below and entering the
coupon code TYC sk on check out you can
save 12 percent and get an absolute
bargain on a single end-user license key
what are you waiting for links in the
description below totally legit
I've used it so many times before in the
past really good service recommended
let's get back to the build
so we just finished installing windows
everything's going really smooth the
secure booth disabled we've got CSM
enabled and we've also changed the
thermal paste on the graphics card it's
time to now complete this build and do
some cable management to
and his build now it is finished it is
looking pretty Sweden it's actually
really quiet too so we got that led
bling we've also got the apps
downloading now so I am downloading csgo
and dota2 which will take some time on
this hotel internet I don't know if
Christopher wants to install another
game for this showdown in performance
we've also got a 3d mark 5 straight and
also heaven and Cinebench installed and
ready to go so all that's left for me to
do now is tune windows up and also
overclock the graphics card and as well
get some really nice b-roll for this
build
since I'm in a hotel room and the b-roll
is very limited at the moment another
awesome thing about this build is I
don't have to add the cost of Windows 10
on to the whole build this time because
it's actually already pre-installed from
the previous build of the OEM
motherboard CPU and RAM came out off so
that's a really good thing
just finished running the unity in
heaven benchmark for now we've got a
score two thousand seven hundred two
points and that is it a core speed of
thirteen hundred and three megahertz in
the memory one seven fifty so we're
gonna try overclock this graphics card
and then get it ready for the showdown
for when we present this PC
so we spent about 20 minutes
overclocking the gratis card
unfortunately I got it up to 1450
megahertz but the computer just shut off
so I guess the 401 has its limits with
overclocking in terms of the RX 480
but now we're go to the sweet spot of
just over fourteen hundred megahertz on
the core clock and the memory will get
up to 19 hundred and fifty megahertz
quad pumped anything over two gigahertz
and it just crashed the whole system so
the memory wasn't that good on this
graph scar but we've got a score now of
two thousand nine hundred and four which
is beating two thousand seven hundred
I'm gonna do one more thing and that's
tune up Windows now come back and run
this benchmark and then for the final
prep it will be ready to meet mr. yi
and here's after the tune and it's now
basically the same but it's finally time
to go meet up with Christopher ye take
this computer over and see what he's
come up with and then put it
side-by-side mister for ye are you ready
so we're now at the year studios and
here is the half this I've called this
you know what I've called it the yeast
layer so it's now time to run benchmarks
on this thing and I'm gonna let you do
the honors yeah he's gonna destroy the
build but I'm sweating because he hasn't
told me exactly what he's got yet but he
did pick up a GTX 970 for 50 bucks
that's right $50 so there's a lot I'm
I'm actually sweating off to seeing this
because that's a really good deal so I'm
waiting to see what he puts together
because he still hasn't put the whole
bill together yet so this is gonna be
really good
and you know I love good competition
this is the viewers love this - I'm sure
let us know in the comments if you guys
are loving this let the benchmarks begin
1080p you wanted to 1080 yeah 1080 high
settings yeah we've got that wrong okay
he's ready he's hoping there'll be a
just a sudden crash out of nowhere will
it happen yeah she know the half is
actually a really good case so we got
two thousand nine hundred and nine
now what's benchmark do you want next
that's not the answer we're looking for
you got to download this one it's
actually a FPS benchmark then it's in
community maps and then after that all
console should come up and give you a
number
yeah hold on average framerate 214 28
okay there we go
so we've got two hundred and fourteen
point eight eight FPS in csgo but now
we're running I think what is the
Achilles heel of my build and this is
Cinebench since we're using an i-5 6400
it's running at 3.1 gigahertz I think on
all-cause so this is not gonna be the
best result for me and hopefully it's
not the best result for Chris either
depending on what he builds oh wait I
gotta focus is I have 518 that's
actually not bad
like I thought this would run a lot
lower than a 518 that's what do you
think in a 518 click that Run button
oh yeah this is the one you have to have
[Laughter]
so here's our official fire strike
numbers we have a combined score of 4946
physics 6860 quick look Chris what's he
feeling and a graphic score of fifteen
thousand three hundred and thirty-eight
ooh now it's on to the last benchmark
dota 2 let's see what the yeast layer
can pull off so we're in dota 2 now and
this is the only game out of the
benchmarks that we're running here where
we have to do a custom benchmark so this
is how I usually benchmark dota 2 anyway
i use a river tuner with afterburner and
i set it to a hotkey so I've got f7 to
start the benchmark FA to end it so
we're gonna benchmark for around about a
minute
of course storm spirit middle and just
playing the game and then we'll close
the benchmark off it is max settings so
we are playing at max settings at 1080p
so we've got here 75 Hertz and exclusive
full screen and see here that we've got
the setting set to max but we've had to
go advanced settings down here and
change that to 240 FPS and I didn't know
this monitor 75 Hertz you didn't know
that either yeah that's so cool I mean
Chris tell me you got that monitor
thrown in for nothing
like why would someone give away a 75
Hertz monitor let let's just start the
benchmark anyway so there's the dota2
benchmark finished and I was having a
little bit too much fun so went over a
minute but we go to average of 99 and a
1% low of 63 then a point 1 percent low
of 38 so this actually was surprising I
thought this bill would do better in
dota 2 so yeah he's got a smile on his
face now okay alright so that concludes
the benchmarks of the yi slayer we're
gonna move on to christopher's yes
slayer
so the Yi slayer is officially
benchmarked it's done the yes layer is
still in the works and it's almost
midnight so we're gonna call it a night
then tomorrow we'll hopefully get back
to benchmarking this thing and finishing
it off for you guys now guys I don't
know how Chris's build is gonna come out
I'm actually sweating a little bit
because he had a GTX 970 then he got 450
dollars now arguably I did check out the
cooler on that thing and it's like one
of the worst coolers I've seen for a 970
so hopefully the overclocks on this rx
480 which was the gaming X do a lot
better because that thing did overclock
quite well I'll surprised I got that
thing for 75 bucks and it was really
good like it was running cool it was
overclocking well but here's where it
gets a little bit weird I don't even
know how Chris's build has turned out or
how it performs I'm actually gonna head
over to his channel and check out his
video to find out how his build did and
so remember guys in the comments section
below you decide who the winner is we've
got three fields aesthetics and then
we've got performance and price let us
know in the comments section below but
other than that I got to check out of
this hotel and get out of here if you
guys enjoyed this one then you know what
to do smash that like button also if you
want the inside scoop then head over to
Instagram tech yes City where I'm
posting up pictures before these videos
hit YouTube and I just hope you guys
enjoyed this competition regardless of
who win or loses it's just been such a
good time collaborating with Chris he's
such a cool guy really love him he's
also just he helped drive me around
because I didn't have a car while I was
here in Vegas also if you want to land
yourself a cheap legit Windows 10 x64
Pro license key then the links in the
description below thanks to today's
sponsor s cd-keys ba guys I hope you
really enjoyed this one it's been an
absolute blast if you like this kind of
content then you might want to consider
subscribing as well turning on those
