the deep cool assassin - this is a
massive air cooler ladies and gentleman
welcome back to check yes city this is
brian coming to you guys today with not
just any cpu cooler review this is the
flagship air cooler from deep cool which
is just massive we're talking like one
point three kilograms massive so first
of all we'll take a look at what's in
the box
and we'll take a look at the features of
this cooler and then I'll run some
temperature tests for you guys to tell
you how good the unit is so as soon as
you open the box you'll notice that this
unit comes packaged very well you get
two fans pre attached to the unit and
one being a 140 millimeter fan the other
being a 120 millimeter fan now they are
both PWM controlled fans and they also
come in this rubberized material that
means you don't need brackets to attach
them to the heatsink
so you can use them in other
applications if you wish they're also
themed red and black also included is
the mounting kit which will allow you to
mount this CPU cool arm pretty much
every socket dating way back to LGA 775
you've also got the game of stormed fan
header hub there as well which will
allow you to get more connections out of
one four pin or three pin CPU fan header
now the unit itself is made of aluminium
you've also got eight heat pipes there
which split into sixteen extensions over
two different towers now the base of the
unit is a mirror finish you've also got
the dimensions of the base there now the
dimensions I measured for the whole unit
came in at 153 millimeters by a hundred
and forty millimeters by a hundred and
sixty-four millimeters tall and the
weight came in at precisely one point to
75 kilograms with the fans attached this
is just for the unit itself
now with the fans themselves they come
with braided cabling as well as the
game√≠s storm fan hub as well and the
fans I measured them spinning down to
300 rpm which at least speeds I could
not hear them and moving up all the way
to 14 11 rpm they were pretty quiet
still so I'll just give you guys a noise
test for yourselves
and you can hear how the Deadpool
assassin sounds okay so we're just going
to do a noise test now for the assassin
- and I'm sitting probably about an
arm's length away very indicative of
real-world scenario so let's just take a
moment to listen to the noise so now
we'll go right up to the cooler and see
if you guys can hear the noise
now what about the performance this is
the big part you guys have all been
waiting for and I'm pleased to say that
this unit did perform really well in my
Haswell 5820k out of 4.3 gigahertz
overclock at one point to five volt
which is pretty much the max stable for
comparing all the different colors even
though this could go up to 4.4 gigahertz
I had to measure it against other
coolers so we can see here that it got a
max temperature of 76 degrees in a 22
degree cooled ambient room condition
these were consistent across all the
benchmarks so it did score very well
here and even at those speeds it was
pretty quiet as well now the interesting
thing and here is is that when I
measured the surface temperatures with
an IR gun you can see that this thing is
barely getting hot at all so it's doing
a great job of cooling not only 5820k
but now we'll move over to the fourth I
mean the 6600 K where you can see here
that again it just performed really well
I think the max temperature I scored
here was 61 degrees now that's amazing
for a 4.6 gigahertz overclock of 1.35
volt on the skylake architecture you see
there beat out the other two air coolers
however it just lost slightly to the
captain 240 which is the all-in-one
solution so now it's time for me to give
you guys my thoughts and opinions and
close off with a score and honestly when
I picked up this cooler I was just
impressed with pretty much everything
the build quality is great the
installation is a breeze even though
it's tedious due to the actual size of
the cooler everything made sense the
instruction manual was very well laid
out and I'm gonna give kudos to deep
cooled air because I've tried different
coolers in the past and the instruction
manuals have just been confusing this on
the other hand you'll have no problems
installing it though one thing I will
mention on my 5820k system is that the
cooler just barely cleared the graphics
card so my 6600 K in the background here
it's not a problem but it was just
barely clearing that clearing that so
another good thing about this unit is
the fans they're quiet they're
well-constructed you can also pull the
blade off from the module to clean it if
need be so now this leaves me with my
final score of four and a half
out of five I wanted to give this five
stars however I did have some trouble
when I was mounting this in my sky leg
rig I actually had to get a bracket and
bend it a little bit with a pair of
pliers so some people may come into
problems with installation in sky leg
rigs that's something to be careful
though everything else aside this unit
is absolutely amazing the build quality
is great deep cool have thought of
pretty much everything that the end user
may run into great well laid out
instruction manual very easy to install
comes with good thermal paste to boot
and you can also get this unit for
eighty dollars so at least when I
checked on the internet for that price
it's really good considering the
capabilities of this cooler it's a
one-point three kg cooler with two fans
included so I'm very impressed with what
deep cool have done here and I can
highly recommend this unit especially
for high end systems like your
enthusiast line 5820k s or it's just
6700 k's if you just want a massive air
cooler to show off but it'll do a great
job of any scenario just make sure you
have the brew to fit it in there so yeah
