stupidity and beside it is a another cup
of stupidity and I'm sorry guys if you
don't know what I'm talking about I'm
kind of referring to the Virgin Box
medius reason DoubleDown of them
copyright striking to youtubers in
particular so what exactly happened with
the verge and why are they copying so
much backlash and why is it
exponentially worse this time around
well has to do with a few things and as
you guys may have seen in the intro I
did apologize because I thought I made a
mistake and in the Verge's case I think
they just don't know how to apologize
and fix their mistakes and this time
around they clearly didn't learn their
lesson from the first PC build video
which was so misleading that it had the
potential to hurt others the second time
around
it again has the potential to hurt
others those being rich from review tech
USA and Carl from bit wit in the form of
their careers and if they copped two
more of these bogus claims within three
months their careers could have been
finished but oh guys just like the first
video I could take today I'm going to be
going over this article and critiquing
it for all the misinformation it has and
also we're going to be taking a look at
YouTube's copyright system and why it's
currently broken and what YouTube could
do to fix it
let's go through this article that nil a
who I believe is in charge of the verge
wrote in response in light of the
copyright strikes on these two
particular channels and they first of
all said that they pulled the copyright
strikes and I believe they have retraced
them but they said that YouTube agreed
with them that it was crossing the line
of fair use and in fact when we go over
to Carl's Twitter he actually posted the
first few lines of what YouTube sent to
the Vox Media Group and that was that
they were concerned that these were
false copyright strike claims and that
they weren't going anywhere near fair
use so in other words what Carl's saying
on Twitter completely contradicts what
Nili is saying in his article that's the
first contradiction the next one is the
ninety percent they he says that these
videos were using over 90 percent of the
content that they created in the
original PC build video 90 percent I
mean that's pretty like Wow okay if you
were users you're just straight copy
pasting naipes and in that video I would
agree with you nilly and so I quickly
got a hold of Carl's video and scan
through it and he was talking for about
50% of the video which is well under the
90% that you were claiming and same with
rich when I scan through his video it
was well under 90% so I don't know where
you pulled this fact from and if you're
gonna make claims like this at least
please do your research then the next
thing he goes through this article and
says it's pretty racist and gives no
context whatsoever I am not sure which
video you're referring to review check
USA's or Carl's because I watched both
of them I thought there was absolutely
no shred of racism in there whatsoever
and the fact of Kyle I believe his Lyle
character is based off of his
grandfather who is his family member and
I'm not sure how you can be racist
against your own family but the next
thing going through this article there's
these two snippets where Neil a kind of
pretends that he's gonna be the hero
he's saving the day here because his
legal team decided to do something and
he's going to do the right thing and
live
and to all the criticism is copying and
retraced the copyright strikes and I
mean good job I mean you are the
superhero here in LA we should put you
in a Superman costume and call you super
nilly but actually this would be okay I
mean I think you would be a superhero if
your article just wasn't full of bogus
facts again the 90 percent and the
pretty racist comments I just think they
have no ground in context whatsoever
pertaining to the issue that you're
talking about but then going through the
rest of this article they're saying that
they're copying a heap of criticism a
heap of backlash hyper hatred and they
even copying death threats like okay
this is getting pretty serious now like
sure no one likes to get death threats
sent to them but this is the example
it's it's literally referring to your
actual business and good luck staying
alive and they're not even referring to
any particular person they're clearly
referring to your business and the
Internet is not going to forget and what
they mean by that is all the dodgy stuff
you've pulled people will not want to
watch your content anymore and so your
views and your subscribers will go down
which is exactly what is happening
anyway with that article aside I just
really don't get it what is going on at
the verge you guys messed up with the PC
build video and you then play the
deflection card and at least you pulled
the video down but you could have in
hindsight just said sorry guys we made a
mistake a big mistake and you could have
got anyone in from the tech community to
help you build a PC properly and then it
would have all been done and dusted and
in fact you could have rebuilt your
credibility that quickly because sure it
looks like your channel is not an
enthusiast tech orientated channel the
fact that you sort of deflected it and
now you're doubling down on ignorant and
then copyright striking two channels and
essentially copyright striking and
trying to affect their careers on bogus
claims is disgusting and unfortunately
you guys deserve all the critique and
all the hatred coming your way because
you just didn't learn when you make a
mistake you just apologized for it and
even make a follow up rectifying the
situation and the internet usually
forget
about it and moves on but you didn't you
played the ignorant sand deflection card
and now you're playing the ignorance and
deflection card again and because you
didn't learn your lesson the first time
it now makes it exponentially worse as I
said in the intro but furthermore what
makes it even worse this time around is
that what you're accusing Kyle and rich
of is exactly what your channel is built
around you grab other people's content
and critique it and comment on it so why
for the love of God would you even enact
this copyright strike to begin with and
honestly I just don't get what your
train of thought is over at the verge
and Vox Media it just has no rationale
it lacks so much logic and it's full of
ignorance and deflection and when you're
on the internet whether you like it or
not you are always going to be critiqued
no matter what you do
so the verge good luck weathering
through this storm but oh guys the
second part of this video we're actually
going to talk about the YouTube
copyright system and what has gone on in
the last few years and what YouTube's
intentions were with it and why it's
kind of broken now in the sense that
things like this can happen where Carl
and rich get striked for not doing
anything wrong and essentially YouTube's
allowed smaller creators the ability to
copyright strike other people who are
just straight ripping their content and
then making money off it and because
smaller content creators don't have the
legal resources they don't have the
utilities available this system was a
double-edged sword and that you're
seeing the opposite effect of it
happening now where you're getting bogus
claims and people who don't own the
copyright material actually striking
others and so I'll give you guys an
example in my case I recently uploaded a
video as a showcase of the Jules Eon
bill we did Darth Jar Jar and I used
free-to-play music in this it was
royalty free however someone else had
used that royalty free music before me a
snippet of it in one of their videos and
then they were claiming the ads in that
Darth Jar Jar video and when I
researched it more I said this is a
bogus claim and so I'm disputing it at
the moment but it still doesn't help the
fact that this video has
now bindi ranked because of that so this
is my own example of how people are
abusing the copyright system and in the
case of it's not just striking other
channels it's also claiming other
people's ad money and I believe some
channels may be making a living off this
at the moment and it's such a filthy and
scummy living and I just don't know how
you could do that as an individual so
what can you tube do about this system
well I think if the whole video has just
a straight copy-paste of that video then
they should allow other channels to
copyright strike other channels but in
the case of YouTube and the system
that's in place now it's just not
working in that other channels can say
hey there's a snippet of our material in
here
let's copyright strike this and we've
seen keemstar from dramaalert
report on this issue a lot because it
seems to be getting abused a lot lately
and we've even seen other YouTube
channels actually get their channels
deleted because of this but on the other
flip side there is channels that have
been deleted as well because they've
been putting in false accusations and
now whether YouTube is gonna punish Vox
media or The Verge for their bogus
claims is yet to be seen but it is
really worrisome that people's
livelihoods and their jobs and their
careers in the case of rich and also
Kyle can be in jeopardy because of these
bogus claims but no guys let us know in
the comment section below what you think
can be done and how YouTube I guess
could get some feedback on how to
improve their system I feel like it's
just broken at the moment that YouTube's
intentions I guess would not to have it
happen this way they'll sort of giving
the smaller creator a chance to defend
themselves but this ended up happening
and people are abusing this system as it
stands love reading your thoughts and
opinions so let us know in the comment
section below and maybe YouTube can get
some ideas out of this as well but it
goes if you enjoyed this video then be
sure to hit that like button and if you
haven't already be sure to sub with that
Belon because if you didn't see in the
intro in the background there was an
aunt act case that's over 11 years old
and we're doing a pc building a metro
Exodus build it's actually downloading
the game right
now I'm gonna be releasing that sometime
tomorrow so feel that little bell on
you'll see at the moment it drops into
sub box and with that said if you want
to get the inside scoop record it gets
to youtube show to check us out on
Instagram to check yes City and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon
peace out for now but
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
