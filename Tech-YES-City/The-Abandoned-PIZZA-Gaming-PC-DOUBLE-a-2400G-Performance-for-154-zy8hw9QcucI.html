neglected it got abandoned by its
previous owner to the state where it was
the worst jungle sandwich that I have
seen yet however the previous owner
thought that this was a PC that was
similar to the likes of a pizza that had
been left in the microwave for three
days and it was now uneditable but when
I saw this PC I saw a pizza that simply
had no topping on it
all's it needed was a bit of cheese a
bit of garlic and then a bit of
mushrooms and then we got to put it back
in the oven and make ourselves one juicy
meal so let's take you on a journey and
show you how I brought this 154 dollar
PC from trash to treasure which cost
less than a 2400 G the APU on its own
and this is a whole system and we're
going to do it in the one the only
becomes welcome back to tech yes City
and here beside me I have a PC which
features a first gen I five these are a
four core four threaded CPU and you can
overclock them quite well even with the
stock intel core it's also got a seventy
eight seventy which in today's standards
is still a really good graphics card is
actually becoming one of my favorite
used graphics cards because it's so
underrated and the performance is
actually really good and you can still
get really good overclocks out of them
with keeping the temperatures low
there's also an antique 500 watt power
supply a gigabyte p55 UD for motherboard
a deep cool tesseract case a gigabytes
of RAM and also 160 by 5400 rpm Drive
now the great thing about today's build
is I'm only going to be changing around
one part and that's the two sticks of
two gigabytes of memory I'm gonna swap
that for one four gigabytes thick of
memory but anyway with that aside let
the transformation begin
city-car the silhouette on the ocean
after dark over the long years the whole
the red blood
from the dirty black water the shadow
for the phone raised itself
and climbed upon the show
beyond on the blacktop there's a gentle
rain downtown shadow who leaned
underneath
as it follows
ground kiss you and I saw you step into
your eyes I meant to say I love you but
instead

in the city I'm a stranger to myself on
these streets of someone else
my good intentions there's a shadow in
the dark it comes to me infrequently and
breaks your perfect are I don't know I
do it all the jars food is too late
single T and you leave me and the shadow
slips away
so here's the PC here we've booted it up
and it is looking so fresh I mean the
power supply was even around the wrong
way so I've switched that around and
that enabled me to get the 8 pin CPU pin
connector behind the back of the
motherboard and cable managed absolutely
fine however what about these parts
we've got the 7870 which as much as
people hype up the 79 70 in the 79 50
and they're still really good cards to
this date the 7870 in my opinion is one
of the best cards it's really underrated
this thing's scoring around about 7,000
GPU score when we overclock it and it's
up from about 6,200 so we managed to get
about twelve hundred megahertz on the
corn we overclocked it got a little bit
more out of the memory as well and the
temperatures in games are still
absolutely fine the CPU running on the
stock cooler the stock cooler of course
being a limitation but of course we're
not putting any extra money into this
computer we managed to get this from a
two point I think it's two point six
seven gigahertz all the way up to three
point six gigahertz so we saw a 30%
boost in performance on the stock cooler
and in game it's still not doing too bad
this is an an ambient temperature by the
way of around 30 degrees so it is summer
here so this is like a worst case
scenario and the results are phenomenal
at least with the overclocks
so let's get into some games and see how
this thing performs

in the city I'm a stranger to myself on
the streets of someone else
so now we've got this PC behind the
intern is running so well that I'm
really shocked at how much performance
you can get out of a PC that cost you
literally next to nothing if you want to
get into PC gaming and you're on a
budget you can see there the four night
results we're playing 1080p high
settings and we're getting around 60 fps
drop it down to medium we can get more
FPS if we want to pop G 1080p very low
settings we're getting around 70 FPS up
to 80 sometimes really good experience
and then we move over to destiny - it's
the same deal high settings 1080p this
thing can do it at around 70 FPS so all
these three games which are very popular
games are playing extremely well at
1080p which is a great sweet spot for
gaming in my opinion especially if
you're on a budget so what we've got
here one hundred and fifty four US
dollars two hundred Australian dollars
so on this current cryptocurrency
apocalypse you can still get really good
deals and really good gaming performance
by the way it'll play games like csgo
dota 2 absolutely fine if we can run pub
G it'll run practically any competitive
multiplayer title out there overwatch as
well so that's why I usually run pub G
as a baseline benchmark this thing can
definitely do it now the one thing I
would change in this build would be that
hard drive it's like a laptop hard drive
it is very slow did take me a while to
install games and sometimes in the games
they will start a do to that drive so if
there's one thing you had to do if you
had a little bit of extra money would be
to drop in a three and a half inch 7200
rpm hard drive also one game in
particular was pub G that people told me
to take a look at is there was a recent
update that apparently helped with
optimization I didn't really notice a
whole lot of difference between this
update and I've tested i5s the exact
same i5 in the past the FPS was around
the same one thing I did notice however
the new desert map seems to be running a
lot smoother so that's maybe where the
optimizations were applied but again for
what it was worth it really didn't make
a difference in raw performance
increases so now one thing I wanted to
talk about also was the process of
cleaning this PC a lot of people have
been asking me lately to do a guide on
how to clean your PC and I'll be doing
that very shortly because there's a lot
of requests an updated guard on how to
clean your PC in 2018 because I did
recently get a new two
it's the data vac this thing's just
essentially just blows a lot of air out
it's an electric air blower it'll do a
great job of cleaning your PC I recently
compared it against the twenty five
dollar cooler and it did a little bit
better it's a really good tool for
initially getting all that grime out
dirt and then I'll use the brake cleaner
for things like GPU dyes anything that's
sort of real finicky and it needs a good
clean to get a like old thermal paste
off and then of course the wd-40 is the
new-look shine but I'll be going through
a guide on how I use all those in an
upcoming video so stay tuned but what we
got behind me is something as I said in
the intro it's been neglected people
think that they can no longer get any
performance out of it because it might
be throttling due to some old thermal
paste on the GPU die maybe the CPU die
as well that needs a thermal paste
change but once you do all that and you
overclock it because this generation of
computers has so much potential the
first gen high fives and the Zeon's they
got so much potential when it comes to
overclocking if you can extract that
potential then you're just gonna be
getting some really good gaming numbers
on your 1080p monitor but really when it
comes down to a one man's trash can be
another man's treasure I really saw
potential in these builds I see
potential in any use PC parts it just
comes down to how much time you're
willing to spend I mean this would
really not take me that long if I didn't
have to film and record everything but
there is a part of me that's happy with
this PC I mean I can turn around the
flip and make a bit of profit but
there's another part of me that makes me
sad because someone just completely
abandons this PC they go out and buy a
new PC and a lot of the times people
message me in like well my new PC is not
performing anywhere near these use pcs
you're putting together and that's
because some of the parts just aren't as
powerful as some of this old use stuff I
mean the 7870 is practically double the
performance of a 2400 g that's
AMD's latest rise in apu the the best
one they've got they've got two SKUs
they got the 2200 G they've also got the
2400 G this thing is performing a lot
better and this is a grams card that's
going on nearly 6 years old now so you
can see the amount of performance you
can extract out of these old use PC
parts it's absolutely phenomenal
you just got to apply a bit of magic
to it and give us some tack yes lovin
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did - be sure to slap that
like button and let me know in the
comment section below
if you like this pc or if you would
change anything personally love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and
if you got any requests as well let me
sure to bang them out in the comments as
well
there's a lot of requests coming in
lately and I'm gonna be fulfilling them
for you guys so I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
you are probably wondering what is going
on welcome back guys so today guys we
have okay awesome so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna the build also came with
an antique 500 watt power supply a
gigabyte p55 UD for motherboard a deep
cool case that I would like to change
around would be the memory changing
those two for two gigabytes gonna swap
that for one for gigabyte stick of
memory so we can run chill so we can run
a true dual channel memory consistent so
we can run chill</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
