from NVIDIA is their GTX 1660.
And this actually differs
in quite a few more ways
than just your classic CUDA core count
compared to the 1660 Ti.
First of all, they're using GDDR5 memory,
which has significantly less
memory throughput speeds
than the GDL6 that they're
using on the 1660 Ti.
Furthermore, there is quite
a big difference in price.
We're looking at $280
MSRP for the Ti variant,
versus $220 for the 1660.
If you're in Australia,
the cheapest I could find
it for was 365 Aussie.
NVIDIA have also dropped
the CUDA core count
down from 1536 to 1408.
So roughly an 8.4% reduction.
However compared to the 1060 six gigabyte,
it's actually an increase of 10%,
going from 1280 again,
to those 1408 CUDA cores.
However, of course, with
the Turing architecture,
you do get some improvements
like better IPC,
in that it'll process more
for the amount of power it's consuming,
as we saw, the 1660 Ti review.
However, since it is using GDDR5,
this card will show you
the power consumption
results straightaway.
It's using roughly the same
as its big brother variant,
which was kind of a little
bit disappointing to see.
However, more on that later.
Let's roll those gaming benchmarks,
where I'm comparing it against
an RX 570 four gigabyte,
RX 580 eight gigabyte,
GTX 1060 six gigabyte,
and also the 1660 Ti.
Now I did decide to leave out the RX 590
because I feel it at
its current price point,
the 1660 Ti has already slayed it.
But let's roll those numbers for you guys.
(techno music)
So I recorded this outro,
and then I went back
and I looked at the
graphs, 'cause I actually
hadn't manually made the graphs up yet.
And then after I did that, I was like,
&quot;Damn, I need to go back and
rerecord this outro segment
&quot;of what happened with the 1660 here.&quot;
Because when I saw those numbers,
it was clearly outclassing
the GTX 1060 by a long shot,
and it was beating the RX 580 too,
and the RX 570 of course.
That's kind of a different league;
we'll talk about that a little bit later.
But in terms of its main
competitors that it's replacing,
the 1060 and the RX 580,
it's doing a good job
of beating those two cards comfortably.
And this is coming in at $220 MSRP.
So that's what you can get it
for on the shelves right now.
When I looked at Amazon.com or Newegg,
that's what you can pick these up for.
This model here, the
GIGABYTE three-fan OC,
is actually about $20
more, and in Australia
it's about 30 Aussie dollars more
than the cheapest model you can get.
And honestly I really like
what GIGABYTE have done,
but not just this card, but
also the 2000 series in general,
where they're offering just
a simple, clean aesthetic,
and performance.
When we look at this card in
particular, out of the box,
it came with very aggressive overclocking,
going up to 1980 megahertz
in a 26 degree ambient environment.
We managed to boost it past 2.1 gigahertz,
so this thing was soaring ahead.
Now, the GDDR5, I'm
willing to ignore that,
because of the $220 price tag,
and how well it performs
in games in the real world.
Like, Apex Legends, it was
pretty much catching the 1660 Ti.
So, if all's you wanna
do is play Apex Legends,
and get a brand new graphics card,
this is definitely gonna
be the card to get.
I guess NVIDIA, with the
latest driver, 419, has somehow
got that adaptive shading
working better in this game,
because these cards were
definitely kicking it,
as opposed to the GTX 1660, for example,
which lost to the RX 580 in that title.
But going through some
of the other numbers,
when we overclock this thing manually,
it did catch up to the
1660 Ti a lot of the times.
But in the case of the Ti variant,
of course, you can overclock that,
but I do like to throw that in there
for guys who like to get the most
out of their graphics cards.
And this thing here has
no problems whatsoever
staying quiet whilst it was overclocked.
Looking at the temperatures
and also noise,
we had here at 60% fan speeds,
maximum temperature of 61 degrees.
Move over to 80% fan speeds,
the temperatures then
dropped to 58 degrees,
but the noise was creeping
up, but it was still bearable.
And then of course, 100%,
goes over 50 decibels,
and the temperatures
drop down to 54 degrees.
Auto on this card was a little bit weird.
It was coming 5% under 60%,
but it was 4 degrees higher,
so my recommendation would be to
either set a manual fan curve
with the max point of 60%,
or of course just manually
lock in 60% itself,
since it was very quiet on the ears.
Though going through some
of the other features
in relation to this card itself.
You got three 80 mil fans on the back,
you got three display port
outs, as well as a HDMI 2.0.
It weighs in at 675 grams,
is 282 millimeters wide,
is a dual slot in depth,
and also the length is 113 millimeters.
On the side you've got the GIGABYTE logo,
which lights up in RGB.
You can control that via
software if you wish to.
And just beside that, you got
a single eight-pin connector.
Though the backlight is
something of curiosity,
since it is made of
plastic, it's not gonna do
absolutely anything to help with thermals.
But of course, it does
add to the aesthetic,
and it will help combat GPU sag.
But when it all comes
down to it, the GTX 1660
is actually a very solid card.
Despite it having its
limitations with GDDR5,
and that does come out in some titles
versus the GDDR6 variant on the 1660 Ti,
it is very good value for money.
And especially if you wanna
manually overclock these cards,
they are going to perform extremely well
in titles for the dollar.
Something else worth mentioning as well,
is it does have the NV
encoder, the latest update
that's the same as the RTX series cards.
So in other words, if
you're a streamer on budget,
this is definitely gonna be a good option
if you wanna get into streaming,
and still have good FPS,
but not have to fork out
so much on the CPU side
as well as getting so much RAM.
But now here is where we
relay back to the RX 580, 570,
and also the GTX 1060.
Now, the 1060 itself, I think
it's pretty much irrelevant
after the release of this card.
You've got everything
NVIDIA here, but better,
especially on the new market.
In terms of the used market,
I really can't find any of these
up for sale for a decent price.
Though the RX 570, and
in particular, the 570,
that is abundant at the
moment on the used market,
and you can get them for so cheap.
I've been picking up a
lot of them personally,
but of course, that card
is in a different league
compared to the 1660.
The RX 580, I haven't really
found many of them for sale
on the used market, though
in terms of the new market,
you can get them for under 200 USD.
So that's an option if you like AMD cards.
But in terms of new market cards,
this is definitely the best
value out there at the moment.
So, this card impressed me a lot
when I started jotting all
the numbers I wrote down
into graphs, and then seeing
all those bars come out,
I was like, &quot;Damn, this thing
actually is pulling ahead
&quot;by a lot compared to RTX
570, 580, and the 1060.&quot;
