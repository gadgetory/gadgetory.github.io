I bring up videos like these where there
are really good deals not just for
people building a new system but also
for people who may need some new
components
take for instance ddr4 memory a gigabyte
stick posted internationally from Cam
Bona now when you put this in the cart
and you see the price tag you've just
got to make sure that you don't crack a
bone off now for some other really good
deals down under an Aussie which in the
later half of the video we'll be having
a full detail of all the good 20% off
deals on eBay at the moment if you put
in the coupon code happy on checkout you
can get a rise in 526 hundred for just
over 200 Aussie dollars phenomenal value
for money considering this is posted to
your door and then you can also get a
multi border either an X 370 from
gigabyte or a B 350 from azouz for just
over 80 AUD now you do have to be
careful with the 300 series boards they
may need at a bias update so if it's the
only PC that you're building most to go
with a B 450 from MSI for a little bit
over $100 after you use that coupon code
but besides that let's go through the
rest of the deals here and see how much
money we can save
so for international deals with the can
boner aside we've got here some thermal
paste 15 gram tube you guys recommended
this in previous comment sections and
it's going for four dollars and 30 cents
this stuff apparently cools close to MX
four levels and I'm going to be testing
that on the channel very soon
I've ordered myself a tuber that's
already so if you need a massive amount
of thermal paste for doing builds long
into the future then this has you
covered then if you're after a triple
pack of ring fans RGB with the
controller then these I goes they look
really good friend of mine ordered some
of these locally on the Gold Coast
I've ordered myself a three pack as well
gonna see how well they can spice up
especially a high-end build for twenty
five US dollars posted to your door now
the last deal we got up here
International ivali Express is the i7
2600
this is going for sixty two US dollars
posted to your door and now a lot of
people telling me that they'd like to
use I sevens over i5s even if it's a
later gen I 5 a lot of people apparently
prefer an earlier gen I 7 in used builds
so this coming in at $62 is also going
to use less power than the i7 variants
since that has its outdated HD graphics
on there which really isn't gonna do a
whole lot for you anyway for the folks
over in the US of A you can't say the
yes don't love you when you pull up
deals like this the ace of predator
monitor gone for 550 US dollars g-sync
IPS 144 Hertz this is that monitor for
people who want the high refresh rates
but they still want the visual fidelity
and they want to remain competitive this
one does it all and for this price it is
coming a little bit expensive but it's
pretty much one of the best in slot
monitors for gaming next up on eBay is
the 8 core Verizon 1000 series now
usually a lot of times I always
recommend the 2000 series over the 1000
series but the 8 core 1700 X going for a
hundred and 70 US dollars posted to your
door is no joke you know have to worry
about updating a BIOS on a B 350 for
example and it will give you phenomenal
performance especially if you're a video
editor on the budget and especially also
since ddr4 memory is finally starting to
come down
price as well so loving the price tag of
this but also loving some of the prices
of these SSDs $65 for 512 gigabytes of
silicon power storage and then if you're
after a one terabyte solution then
there's a Samsung m2 Evo 860 going for a
hundred and thirty US dollars
now for graphics cards the 10th series
are starting to sell out so the prices
are reasonable but the best deal I could
find on a graph Scott is the rx 580 ARMA
8 gigabyte edition from MSI going for
210 listed price but you can also
apparently get a $20 rebate bringing it
down to 190 USD which is this price it
is a phenomenal mid-range card and it
will serve you well but now it's time
for the grand finale for the Aussies
down under we've got 20% off here on
eBay using the coupon code peppy and the
first deal as we said in the intro the
Rison 5 2600 seriously you guys get on
this for a 208 Aussie I bought a heap of
these there's also the motherboards the
x3 70s and the b3 50s going for really
cheap as well and the b4 50s of course
but moving on with graphics cards now
there's the RX 580 from msi as well this
is the armory gigabyte edition this is
going for cheap in the States but also
going out cheaper Niles as well 300
Ozzie dollars after you use that coupon
code so it's a phenomenal price
considering it's posted to your door
you're paying GST but if you're after an
Nvidia card then unfortunately a lot of
the 10 series cards have sold out so the
prices of them at least what's left on
eBay is overpriced in my opinion except
for maybe the 1063 gigabyte version
they're going for around 250 AUD well so
not a bad price if you're into 1080p
gaming and you can manipulate the
settings to keep the VRAM usage under
three gigabytes which is very easy to do
but the r-tx 2070 definitely gets a
mentioned coming in at around 760 AUD
after you use that coupon code this
beats out a gtx 1080 and i believe in
time it'll get closer to that 1080i than
ever before so it's actually as I said
in my review it's not a bad price
performance card we're not even looking
at the r-tx features which I honestly
place very little weight on them
especially after battlefield 5 and I
played Metro Exodus as well and that was
just tanking performance
but for the royal price performance for
current titles out there it is beating a
1080 it's also pretty powerful and it's
the latest and greatest 2000-series card
but also know for a fact that galaxy do
a good job of whacking a solid cooler on
there that will remain quiet as well but
next up here if you're after a monitor a
really good one for gaming than aoc have
you covered for 476 Ozzy dollars 144
Hertz 27 inch and I'd know for a fact a
OC know what they're doing when it comes
to implementing overdrive and also
getting the input lag right as well but
if you're after something a little bit
cheaper than there's a 24 inch 144 Hertz
monitor going for a 263 Aussie dollars
or after you use that coupon code so not
a bad deal at all now when it comes to
eBay sales I always look for storage
it's one of those things that I pretty
much go to first I couldn't find any one
terabyte or two terabytes of going for
good prices as opposed to the previous
sale where I was getting brand-new one
terabyte hard drives for a thing like 39
AUD which was a bargain but this time
around SSDs are really the only thing
worth getting 32 Aussie dollars for a
Western Digital 120 GB SSD and then also
if you're after a 240 you buy it then
Kingston have them going for 47 Aussie
definitely gonna order some of those
120s as they definitely help when it
comes to not just selling a PC but also
making sure that someone who buys a PC
offer you is very happy as well or if
you're using it for a personal build
you'll definitely want to get an SSD
especially if $30 there's no excuse not
to and now for the last two deals I'm
gonna pull up here for you guys is a
sound system i use the logitech z 906
it's just the best purchase I have had
in a long time and when I do a top 10
list later on this year this is gonna
pretty much get number one this is a 5.1
surround sound system that just goes so
hard and especially for the money which
you can get for around about 320 ozzie
dollars per ceodore it's an absolute
bargain I think I paid more for mine and
I even got that on sale in the past and
now if you don't need the 5.1 set up and
they've got the z6 two three which is
equally as good has a really good
subwoofer but only has two speakers but
it's great for a desktop setup so if you
guys are using headphones all the time I
do recommend getting a speaker set up
for long-term use as it will help
keep your ears intact for years and
years to come had a lot of people who
have been using headphones for years and
years and they tell me that their
hearings actually damaged so it's one of
those things I do caution you guys grab
yourself a good pair of speakers
especially at these prices
but speaking of headphones I don't know
lastly before I get on out of here if I
should recommend a deal like this
there's a headset here going for 10
Aussie dollars and it's not only fact
that there's 10 ru dollars like it's
really cheap if you need to get
something for your kids or whatever it's
really cheap but the problem I have with
it is I don't have any experience with
cheap headsets like these if anyone's
tried them and they can recommend them
them sure I can put the link in the
description below and you guys I'm not
sure about this headset let me know in
the comment section below if I should be
listening things like this loved your
thoughts and opinions as always but also
if you have some really good deals of
your own be sure to drop them in the
comment section as well and I'll update
the description because some of these
deals they go pretty quickly so all the
links will be in the description below
and if you enjoyed this one then be sure
to hit that like button and I'm gonna
get back to this rx 590 benchmarking
it's the Fat Boy Edition so gonna give
you a review on that soon so stay tuned
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
