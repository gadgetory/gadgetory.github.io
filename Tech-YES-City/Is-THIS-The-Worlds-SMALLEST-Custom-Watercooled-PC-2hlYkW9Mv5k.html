am joined by Ethan from tag mods and
we're gonna check out this little custom
build called project Parviz and it's got
a corsair fan at corsair radiate know
it's not even the corsair radiator
welcome to 2018 packs astray i am at the
corsair booth they have a new keyboard
we'll take a look at that later it's
they've got two variants of it but we're
here with project parvis this is Ethan
from tag mods he's going to be doing the
SR to build the legendary rebuild after
pax is finished
so what we got here is tell us straight
away what makes this build so special
okay so this is project parvis it's my
shot at the world record attempt for the
smallest water-cooled PC we stock
hardware so Guinness are checking it out
soon it's currently 6.8 liters in volume
about a litre and a half shorter than
the current record so it should be good
it's wrapping a 2700 X 1080 TI 32 gig of
Corsair Vengeance Ram the SF 600 power
supply for the Corsair as well and your
the ll fan on the front so ll 120
vengeance ddr4 memory 32 gigabytes of
that dual channel so we've got the
orange black and silver theme going on
here with project poppers let us know in
the comment section below what you think
of this little small form back to build
and also let us know if you're hyped to
see Ethan skills in the SR to build here
should be good to dug they know the
theme that they Darth Jar Jar so here we
are the build itself it's got a gtx
980ti
2700 x8 core 16 threaded CPU in such a
small form-factor
weighs in like 10 kilograms I recently
got the Intel NOC but I could only
imagine traveling around with this thing
it's pretty manageable still likes
pretty easy to get around it's pretty
sturdy as well so measures all
reinforced so you shouldn't be out the
idea is to be able to use it as a land
box and just gotta take it anywhere and
everywhere the bottom line is though
with this do you have competitors as
well that are coming in now and trying
to take your thunder
not that
like the current record is from like
2011 so I kind of saw it went I reckon I
can beat that but there we go guys I
hope anything can beat this thing as
well and let's move on now to some
beating of some of these keyboards and
see what they've got thanks for your
time brother but what about new products
coming out in 2018 from corset well on
the showroom floor they had the k70 mark
to low profile these feature low profile
Cherry MX switches both in the red and
the silver form now the low profile
switches already have the benefit of
having a higher actuation point in their
original standard edition brothers and
so what this means you'll get a faster
response time if you're a gamer however
at that note typos may be a little bit
easier so be careful with these key
switches but when we're talking about
this silver itself low profile this
technically has the highest actuation
point possible in other words the
fastest response time so in other words
it eliminates the most input lag from
the user through to the hardware all
other hardware being considered equal so
this is definitely one to jump on if you
want to up your game just ever so
slightly but you're already competitive
and you're ready pretty much at the top
now in terms of pricing you expect this
keyboard to come in around 169 US
dollars if you're in astray at 279 AUD
so it does come in with a premium asking
price however at these prices you can
expect to high build quality individual
backlit RGB keys as well as support for
the IQ software media keys on the top
right of the keyboard as well as
Hardware control backlighting - yeah
guys we're finishing up at the Corsair
booth for 2018 new keyboards are all the
rage and of course project parvis and of
course on top of that with a double or
triple of course the deals here are
there if you're at the event make sure
you come in and cop some of these
peripherals I don't know about this
hoodie I just snaked it and I'm gonna go
get on out of here now before someone
notices and also let us know what you
think about the new low-profile k70 mark
two keyboards in silver and Cherry MX
red love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now place
my truck on track only the best over the
best is more can I raise I check this
but one more the setlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
