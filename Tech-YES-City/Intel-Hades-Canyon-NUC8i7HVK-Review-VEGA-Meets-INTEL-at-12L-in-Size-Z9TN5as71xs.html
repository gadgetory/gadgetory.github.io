literally the size of my hand coming in
with dimensions of 210 mil by 140 by 38
mil deep this is the Intel nook 8i 7 hvk
with Vega M G H graphics on board now
the price tag bare-bones kit is $1,000
us and if you're in Australia 1400
Australian dollars it is unofficially
going to hit the streets in late May
therefore this price you will have to
add in still your own ddr4 sodium memory
and also your own nvme storage however
there is two slots available for both
the ddr4 memory and also two nvme slots
available where you can add in a solder
or a PCIe solution however what makes
this small unit so impressive and I'll
pull up the benchmark here for you guys
is that firestrike 3dmark score where
the GPU is getting over 10,000 points so
just by seeing this figure alone this
thing is so much more powerful than any
small form-factor solution that has come
before it it's even more powerful than a
gtx 1050 TI standalone desktop solution
so today we're going to delve deep into
the details of Intel's latest Hades
Canyon NOC
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
review of Intel's latest and greatest
knock this one here the hvk that's how
I'm gonna refer to it in this review
comes in with the i7 8800 9g CPU for cos
8 threads latest IPC 14 nanometer and it
also turbos up to 3.9 gigahertz on all
cores and of course that Vegas solution
24 compute units however there is the
lower SPECT H&amp;amp;K variant which also comes
in $200 u.s. cheaper or if you're in
Australia comes in with the total price
tag of 1150 ad that carries the i7 8 7 0
5 G CPU from what I can tell 100
megahertz slower on the turbo boost
speeds but also only has 20 compute
units on the GPU side and lowest clock
speeds on those GPU clocks as well so of
course without wasting any more of your
time let's roll up a few more benchmarks
here first of all GTA 5 normal settings
at 1080p this generally stresses the CPU
you can see here that this Vega Ram gh
solution is really kicking it and I've
decided to test it against small
form-factor solutions and we see that
it's beating out of 1050 Ti comfortably
and also the CPU even though it's very
intensive on this game does score pretty
well scoring over 150 average FPS very
impressive moving across the dota 2 this
trend does continue and this is high so
this is actually max settings at 1080p
and this thing is scoring well over a
hundred fps so if you're a competitive
gamer you could turn the graphical
settings down and still get a phenomenal
experience out of the NOC going across
the fortnight one of the most popular
multiplayer titles out there today this
thing scored over a hundred and ninety
average FPS at 1080p low settings of
course you've got the flexibility to up
the graphical details if you so wish and
then moving over to a very popular
competitive title Rainbow six siege this
thing scored over a hundred and forty
average fps so continuing on with csgo I
copied a popular player called scream
his settings we've got four speed MSAA
this unit scored over 200 average FPS in
the benchmarks of course the point 1%
lows were pretty low in this benchmark
but I believe that's got to do with that
for Speed msaa setting and the last
benchmark I'm going to pull up for you
guys
is pub G 1080p and I decided to put this
on high settings this time around we can
see that the NOC is scoring close to 60
FPS so it does make this a playable
experience and the other solutions here
really tanked even a 1050 t I was going
under 50 fps so the nook definitely has
the power when it comes to gaming and
what about VR since this h VK model here
does say on the box it's unlocked
and it's VR capable so I ran it through
a superposition HTC vive optimal test it
was giving me a score of over 6,000
points and saying that this unit is more
than capable of playing VR so if you've
got the latest headset and you're on the
go and you're on the mobile and you want
to get a good experience the NOC will
yet again deliver it don't besides that
small form factor what else does the NOC
offer
well pulling up a Cinebench score here
we've got over eight hundred and twenty
points multi-threaded score and also a
single-threaded performance going over a
hundred and sixty points so it
definitely has the grunt to even do 4k
video editing when I tested it out with
Adobe Premiere Pro with a 4k render 30
minute file by the way 25 megabits per
second this scored under 20 minutes so
it wasn't real-time rendering and it's
not 8700 K overclocked performance but
it is impressive and so if you do need
this for mobile video editing which is
something I would need this for this
thing is going to deliver now of course
you can support up to 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory and sodimm form nvme storage
again two slots so you can use obtained
with this as well if you wish to and of
course the performance on the octane
drives was impressive to boot up times
were less than five seconds which is
very impressive if you're into quick
boot up times and getting into the
action straight away now of course
you're probably thinking well this units
too small with all that power surely it
couldn't cool it down it actually does a
really good job of cooling when I tested
it out 960 for max stress test it was
scoring 91 degrees on the CPU this isn't
a 25 degree ambient environment so the
cooling solution was doing a decent job
of keeping the i7 under wraps I'll let
you guys have a listen however to the
noise on both idle and full load
so quite simply when you're not using
this unit it will remain whisper quiet
since it doesn't use up much power at
all on idle and when I tested it in dota
2 with 1080p high settings it was
scoring just in the 120 watts range
while still giving out a really good
figure in terms of fps so it does have
the power efficiency as well to match
going over the top of the unit there is
this skull logo that lights up it's got
individually controlled RGB on the skull
and the eyes itself and you may notice
that the buttons throughout the beer
halls on the beer I've shown already
does have its own RGB lit controls you
can even change things like the power
button to relate to network activity if
you wish to so the power button can
flash if you're sending packets in and
out so the lighting isn't just available
for the aesthetics it also has a
functional purpose too
now you can't change this in the
included software utility that comes
with your driver package or if you want
to tune up the system itself you can
install the intel extreme tuning utility
which does look very familiar to the
DeeZee 87 motherboard that was the
Haswell motherboard the Intel released
there's also the option to go into the
BIOS if you wish to tune the settings
manually and save them from within the
BIOS or in the utility itself since it's
so easy to use you can change things
like clock speeds on-the-fly
I did manage to turbo it up to 4.2 Giga
on all-cause however the temperatures
and the speeds out of the factory in my
opinion are the best and the most
optimal settings to use so the nokia
does have gaming covered it does have
productivity covered and it's also got a
plethora of input and output to choose
from going over the rear of the unit
you've got four USB 3.0 ports also HDMI
2.0 out you've also got two Nick's
included one gigabit per second
solutions and Intel I - one 9v and also
an Intel I 210 there's two mini display
outs and also two Thunderbolt threes
which can double down as display outs -
with the included front out as well for
the HDMI 2.0 you've got six display outs
in total which will officially support
up to six monitors so if you have a
mobile trader you can use this and get
good results as well moving on with the
rear of the unit there's also the DC
jack in and besides that isn't
to cool out which will support up to 7.1
surround sound so great with a VR
headset move over to the front of the
unit there is a four pin audio out mic
in hybrid port and also a Type C besides
that then there's that HDMI 2.0 as we
mentioned before and 23.1 USB type a
ports one of them being a charging port
as well for lightning fast charging
there's also an SD card reader and
besides that is your power button so
ultimately this little nook here with as
well ventilated honeycomb design is
definitely leaving me in a tricky spot I
mean first of all it's a lone sample so
I do have to return it to Intel which
I'm devastated about but also if you
guys have followed me for a while you
know I'm pretty big on Mini ITX
solutions I'm very enthusiastic about it
I recently built the in wind choppin
which is currently my 4k mobile video
editing solution now that case alone
even though it's got a small footprint
this is even smaller but that case alone
comes in at 2.2 kilograms with its
included power supply that's before you
even add any hardware in this being 1.3
kilograms with its 700 gram adapter
leaves it at 2 kilograms with a small
footprint that you can carry in a
backpack and not even notice it's there
not only that it's got a much more
powerful graphic solution than anything
I'm used to in this small form-factor
so now the only thing left that would
stop you from buying this would be the
price tag a thousand USD for the hvk or
1,400 strain dollars or for the law
respect h NK 800 u.s. or 1150 AUD and in
my opinion with the amount of power this
thing has in it and considering it's got
the motherboard case power supply CPU
GPU built in it's actually a pretty
decent price tag considering there is
nothing like this out in the market at
the moment so I definitely see myself
buying one of these and then installing
32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory and also one
terabyte nvme storage because it is just
that damn good Intel have really blown
me away with the Nok 8i 7 HP case
solution though I'm really keen to test
the H NK and see what that's capable of
if you do give it a bit of a bump in the
clock speeds not only on the CPU but
also on the GPU side I think you could
come close to the
performance of the hvk remains to be
seen anyway guys if you enjoyed today's
review please give it a big thumbs up if
you have any questions about the knock
then be sure to drop a comment in the
comment section below also one thing I
forgot to mention is it does have
included built-in wireless as well 8 to
65 and also a 4.2 Bluetooth connection
as well so I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
