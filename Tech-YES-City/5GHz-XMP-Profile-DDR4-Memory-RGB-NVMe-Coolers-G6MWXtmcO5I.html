2018 and today we've got some ddr4
memory on display we've also got some
other products as well but first of year
five gigahertz XMP profile on ddr4
memory this is already in the wall this
is the spectryx dat RGB memory and it
also comes in around 220 USD for a 16
gigabyte kid but of course you get that
RGB bling but you've also got this
incredibly fast XMP peripheral I'd love
to try this out with a m4 to see how it
performs but it's at one point six volts
so it's really incredibly high for the
voltage but they tell me it can be
sustained Juno at having Samsung beat on
memory now there's also Samsung B die
memory featured in the other RGB memory
on display here they've got the gam ax
d50 and this is a 16 gigabyte kit coming
in around 140 dollars so it is pretty
budget-friendly also got Samsung B die
memory but it's for for people who want
to get that customizable overclock and
they know what they're doing out of the
box you get twenty six sixty six
megahertz 1.2 volt so it's a very low
profile and overclockers note that's
what you want for overclocking now if
you still want RGB but you don't want to
pay as much as the DAT they've got the D
41 and it has a different aesthetic as
well and it's also got a three gigahertz
XMP profile 1.3 5 volt so they're
bringing that into the market at around
190 USD for a 16 gigabyte kit - so
they've got the Samsung video memory
they've got the m4 profiles also the
Intel profiles and they've got different
products to suit different price ranges
especially if you're into overclocking
but let's go check out some other price
you got on display here and have a good
time
mm 18th Computex coverage is brought to
you by gigabyte and Corsair bringing you
the absolute best in PC hardware and in
2018
also RGB bling as well welcome back to
take a sitting beside me I got two
really cool products one which I'm
wearing on my head right now this is the
H 30 and it's essentially a headset and
a stand and a controller a DC DAC
everything included and you can plug off
an additional headset off this actual
DAC itself is the ability to get two USB
extensions off of two volume control
four different preset aid cues and also
mute on the flight your music and your
microphone as well as changing the 7.1
virtual surround which does work really
well I think of 2018 companies are
getting it right in terms of the 7.1
virtual look to really get the gear on
this and see the levels and how good
they are in terms of the ADC and DAC
itself one thing I'd look out for you
guys but for 200 bucks it comes in with
everything you need is a little bit
expensive for a headset but it does
provide what you would want from a
headset I just like to get those extra
numbers which I actually can't test here
on the floor this is already out in the
wild they've also got beside me a storm
to RGB nvme cooler which is 15 bucks
gives your nvme RGB you can add that on
top and it's also got a real small fan I
think this thing is like 15 mil or
something it's ridiculously small little
cute fan on your SSD if you want it too
let's take a look at some of these other
stuff over to the right here and here we
are now with a data and SSDs and we've
got nvme PCIe solutions the SX 8200
already being released in the wall just
recently coming in with a very
competitive price tag already around
about $180 on Amazon for 480 gigabytes
they do have more denser versions as
well with TLC 64 layer NAND flash 2
going up to 1 terabyte and 2 terabytes
as well coming in a little bit more
expensive though with those dents and
memory banks but what we've got here as
well is an sx-70 100 in the works and
that promises really fast speeds to just
a cut-down version the value orientated
option for gamers but if you want the
maximum speeds the SX 8200 will deliver
the 4k random reading rights very
impressive I'm seeing some numbers over
150 megabytes per second on the sx-70
470 100 sorry and the SX 8200 going over
214 megabytes per second incredible
basically with that guys that means your
everyday usage experience is going to be
that much faster than it previously was
the keep in mind this is a one gigabyte
test so I look forward to seeing how
fast these can really perform in the
real world after say 10 or even a
hundred gigabytes of full-on transfers
so now with a data behind me we've got
their mouse and keyboard and also RGB
mouse pad and they're entering the
market with peripherals first off they
have the R 10 that's the mouse and
included with the mouse pad which is the
M 10 I know the namings a little bit
crazy $50 for this combo and the mouse
is actually pretty good I'm gonna send
this thing to rocket jumping in just see
what he thinks of it but so far it's
looking pretty good a Virgo sensor KLH
switches inside and same with the
keyboard they're using kayo Blues inside
this keyboard too it's got seven
hardware mode adjustable led patterns
that you can choose from but not
individually backlit now for this
keyboard they do want 80 USD and this is
out in the wild now so you can get these
products though me personally I do
prefer a soft style mouse pad so I'd
love to see if they could implement that
on a mousepad themselves this is a hard
surface so if you are in a hard surface
mouse pads this is a really good combo
for the money and that's about it for
the a daughter booth here in 2018
Computex except for one thing we now
have in concept a PCIe SSD ad on RGB
cooler so you get the bling you get the
cooling and they promise up to 25% more
efficiency or temperature drops on their
SSD coolers both on the nvme and on the
PCIe solution guys I hope you enjoyed
this video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button if have any
comments or questions for a dollar then
be sure to drop a comment in the comment
section below and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye so now behind me we've got a
dollar with the xgb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
