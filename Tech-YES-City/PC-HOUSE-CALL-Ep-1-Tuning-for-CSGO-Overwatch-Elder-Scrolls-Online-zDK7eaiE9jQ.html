underperforming games one man has come
to fix it all this is PC house car
welcome back guys today I am at a
friend's house his name is James and I'm
going to be tuning his PC he plays games
competitively and he's got a high
refresh rate monitor and he wants to
know what the best FPS you can get out
of his gear can be so today we're going
to be doing just that
we tuning this thing I've had a few
beers but let's see what we can do
what's up guys I'm here with my friend
James known this guy for over 10 years
now yeah easy easy ten years now alright
so today we have to build his cannot
build sorry tune his computer because
he's got a really good monitor got some
decent things I think you've got a sixty
seven hundred K yeah that's right and
you want me to do my magic on this
computer yeah you know I don't have the
expertise so you know you're the expert
so you can get a bit extra out of it for
me very good awesome men so we've got
our you tell me about Elder Scrolls
online you play that a little bit I've
been playing it lately but it's it's a
hard one because it's the engine is
really clunky so to get the best out of
that game is a mission so yeah pretty
much you guys may know elder scrolls
here very a single-core dependence so
especially even on the 6700 K the thing
struggles so I'm going to be upping the
speeds obviously CPU by as much as I can
and then we're going to see how it runs
before and after also you play csgo
overwatch and World of Warcraft a bit
yeah overwatch csgo there will be
playing The Witcher lately yes few
things everyone loves to which a man you
guys love the which I always get told
about The Witcher the Wild Hunt so we're
going to do a bit of a wild hunt today
and see what we can do for you guys
let's get on with it
so looking at the specs here James has a
definer 5 from fractal design he also
has a 6700 K was a thermaltake air
cooler on there and now the good thing
about this whole rig is that Cynthia has
a good case he has a good power supply
he can then upgrade the graphics card at
any time and he's
much going to be getting the best frame
rates possible because the 6700 Kate
still has the same IBC as the 7700 cake
Abby Lake so now he has the GTX 960 in
here and the CPU is way more than
capable of handling this graphics card
so in the future if we get sick and
tired of what the 960 can deliver then
you can put in something like even a
1080p eye and have absolutely amazing
frame rates obviously there was a 1080p
monitor you'd probably want to upgrade
is monitor - if he did this but in the
meantime with really good specs really
good upgrade ability on the computer we
now get into overclocking this thing I
guess we're in the first game here this
is world of warcraft so basically what
i'm going to do is i'm going to test the
games out now with James's settings on
stock well this is how he ran his
computer so he has an overclock yet and
we go to test for games so we get World
of Warcraft up here first we see this
games hovering between 95 and 100 FPS
but after we overclock we're going to
come back revisit the games and see what
FPS we're getting okay so we loaded up
Elder Scrolls online and now we're in a
city called force in iam and we're just
sitting here on a static image we're
going to leave the game and they're
going to boot back in after the
overclocks we're getting about 80 FPS in
this place so basically guys with csgo
we get a pre-roll and we had to cut it
because we didn't know how csgo works
for benchmarking like it was really
bizarre we're in the same area of all
watching the FPS go from like 330 like
you see it now it's gone 320 and it will
go all the way up to 450 now if we're
looking at the same piece of map that
shouldn't be happening so what's going
on with CS goes it's processing
everything on this map that even what
you can't see and so that's actually
affecting your FPS in real time so how
I'm going to do this benchmark is I'm
going to look at this I'm going to start
around and try and not die and then look
at the same piece of map and then when
we finished the round will stop the
benchmark but keep in mind that csgo is
actually a very interesting game and how
to bench market for multiplayer it's
something that I didn't know and I'm
learning this real-time but of course
we're going to overclock the CPU and
then see what extra frames we can get
okay guys we're doing these area
benchmark
we've got like heaps of them loaded up
here in a just an
smash here but the GPU is still getting
max to like 100% here so I don't think
overclocking is going to really make a
difference in this benchmark but of
course we're in the same area we'll try
and get it back in the same area and see
if it makes a difference so guys we are
in the BIOS at the moment and it looks
like James already played around with
the MSI overclocking utility in Windows
and you've got 4.3 Gigot on the CPU core
and 2.3 for seven gig effective on the
memory so let's try and dial in some
settings is see what we can get and see
how well we can overclock both the
memory and the CPU on this motherboard
this is a z1 semi a carbon gaming crow I
think
so we've done a little bit of time on
this the most time we wasted was when
went from four point nine to five and
then the it just bricked and so we had
to try and reset the boss but on the
z170a game gaming Pro carbon there's no
clear CMOS button but there's no clear
CMOS jump off so yeah you had to get a
screwdriver and hold it down on the J
bat jump off for five seconds of don't
laugh hey okay so we are in the bass at
the moment and we've found the sweet
spot overclock for James's computer so
we've got four points in us and of
course these settings here the extra
beam profiles we enable them at three
point two years effective if the problem
was is it the computer wouldn't boot up
even with an SI voltage in 1.2 well
which is usually pretty good for finding
air or water over clocks and so we had
to drop it down here to two point nine
nine two point nine thirty three and so
we did that with one point three
seventy-five voltage on the CPU core and
we've got a pretty damn solid overclock
here so let's boot in and then we'll
test the stability and then we'll move
on to the gaming benchmarks all right
we've been recording this for twenty
nine pretty much half an hour so we've
got four point six years of stable on
the sixty seven hundred K at one point
three six ish volts so pretty decent
overclock versus the amount of day it
could boot into four point nine
gigahertz so I mean I guess this CPU
could go high if we maybe D lit it and
also if we had a better motherboard and
of course we've got overclocked the GPU
just a little bit okay guys so with
overclock the CPU and the GPU and the
frame rates are still the same guys
beers and max FPS 100 settings so we're
an Elder Scrolls online here and James
is like flipping his stuff he's like a
like we're hitting a hundred now before
we I think will like an ad or something
we're hitting the max FPS counter here
in Alva scoffs same settings - so it's
like in remove it all around you know
shake that time
move it all around and it's 100 FPS
layers it's going crazy so overclocking
is legit this is free performance that
James never had before this so crazy
stuff so let's move on now to csgo so we
have just benchmark csgo and we've got
the fraps scores here because I decided
to bench mark the start of the level to
the end since there was that variance
before what we talked about and you see
here after the over cocks we are scoring
indeed quite a bit higher which is to be
expected but of course since it is a
multiplayer benchmark there is going to
be variance and of course I want to
drink some more beer
so I'm not going to be benchmarking all
night anyway with over the next game we
have overclocked this now at the same
settings before we had only 250 FPS now
we're getting like 300 FPS this is
insane so overclocking will definitely
help guys look at it oh my goo move this
is really good
so I'm just sitting there playing this
and the one thing about overwatch we see
this you notice that little frame thing
there the milliseconds look at that this
just shows how well an optimized game
overwatch is so we'll move on to this
next game which is I think I actually
this is the last game in the benchmark
holy okay we're going to move out of
conclusion now so here we are guys we
have finished off James's PC his
overclocked
now on the CPU memory and the GPU and
you saw the legit frame rates right I
was impressed actually
it was impressed guys so crazy anyone
can do this overclocking anyone can do
it like it's it I mean does there is a
learning curve there of course there's a
lot of things
to look out for and whatnot but when you
do overclock the benefits are mad gaming
mad gaming so you a happy gamer oh yeah
actually actually quite impressed
alright so we are going to go cheers to
this we're going to get a pizza on doll
and we're going to go chill out I hope
you guys enjoyed the video will catch in
a non tech video very soon
peace out for now oh yeah if you guys
want to see more things like this then
drop a comment comment section below and
yeah peace out for now bite in something
like this and you'll be ready to go
absolutely killing the game so let's get
into overclocking this thing but the cat
that that was staged guys the cat knew
the cue the next game we got up here is
csgo now I've got the graphical settings
on low shadow details but high graphical
settings so the GB is only getting
utilized at 50% here and we're well okay
guys I'm had a few beers here I'll leave
this like the boss look at my oh I man
look at him
is it okay I even know the FBA budget no
I did nothing a steak it is oh my oh my
god I'm like oh yeah I didn't even like
I killed him and I like I was standing
up I was an area with a dry bun in my
way I'm actually trying like should be
ashamed of yourselves
oh yeah so what are you doing you're on
a pizza right now
Marie's pizza okay Nate love is extra
garlic yeah plenty lovers the Gallic
page there and I go to see fifty so gold
yeah so that's done Gold Coast brothers
