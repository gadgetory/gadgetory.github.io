come back to you guys today with a vlog
about Japanese work hours so I got asked
one of the high school hours like and
sorry it took me a month to see the
comment i just saw it today as i was
looking through the comments on the
video youtube didn't message me like
saying you know someone such and such as
comment on your videos like what the
hell so I got the request to talk about
Japanese work hours and basically the
high school specifically the different
hours compared to Australian High
School's now basically guys Australian
High School's are different in that will
actually I don't know if it's changed in
the last like five years since I've been
there but you know Jay japanese high
schools they've got three they got a
structure that goes in three tiers so
you got primary school or they got it
called shoulder core here which is you
know primary school and that's from year
one to six then they've got to our core
which is one two three like three years
there which is like a middle school and
then they've got high school which is
another three years so it's the same
amount of years as Australia but
basically they're structured in three
different schools now obviously the
difference is is that yeah you've got
only three years in high school in
Australia got yer 82 year 12 see got
five years and now what else is the you
know the others Christmas tree here so
I'm getting ready for Christmas but also
my wife made me take my computer
upstairs it was that she said it was not
good for the baby and I agree it's not
good a little little B Mantha I did
agree to take it up if so I'm up in a
different room now guys this is my new
lab anyway tell me what you think of it
but yeah basically goes on banging on to
the vlog about the high schools and my
high school we start school at nine we
basically starts school at nine o'clock
so the bell rings at nine o'clock and
they're really strict about lateness so
if the kids are a minute late usually
there one minute late it's okay but if
they're like two or three minutes late
bang they're out to get late like a
light thing stamped on their card and
you know if they get too many it's not
good so as a yes starts at nine o'clock
at our school it finishes at 320
so well 315 but usually you know most
homerooms g√∂del 320 so and then
everyone goes home and basically it's
structured bicycles at every high school
is a little bit different lies high
school is a lot different very unique in
that we have three big periods every day
so they're an hour and a half each so we
got first period hour and a half second
period hour and a half 15-minute break
in between and then third period another
hour and a half so it's basically three
long missions and it's completely
different you know I was pretty stumped
when I first saw us really but basically
what they started doing it my school
just started splitting those lessons in
a 45 minute or so i think is good and i
basically start I'm starting to teach
more 45 minute lessons it's really good
something sort of you know you're fresh
kids the new staff bang they're not
falling asleep as much so as much mind
you they still fall asleep so yeah the
big difference is especially compared
Australian what you know the social
level of the kids is that they don't
tolerate bullying at all so at my school
especially bullying is there's got a
zero in traumatic or edgy man god iijima
you know this is zero in gmaps policy
which meant no you can't EG meds it'll
that's why they call it uh school and
you can't believe people otherwise you
get reported and you basically they'll
talk to the person's parents and you
know and it's still i love japan in that
respect is that still you know very
disciplined and now there's not a lot of
our coos people running around and so
you you know my house girls are real
breeze to teach I never get people
giving me crap or you know I never get
people's calling me names it's really
good it's really peaceful to teach at my
school so the difference socially is
that you know kids you know kids will be
kids they you know they do do stupid
things from time to time that can't be
helped they don't generally I
haven't seen much like I probably
haven't seen one fight really and wasn't
really a fighter's has two kids going at
each other reeling and broke it up so in
terms of yeah there's not many there's
not much fighting at all very little
penny
and you know especially it's a really
good really good privilege to teach in
my high school so basically astray in
high school I haven't taught an
Australian High School so I don't really
know what it would be like but you know
obviously being a high school student
ten years ago I did you know have that
experience and I still remember my high
school experience what it was like and
so I can sort of contrast that to me
teaching now to those high school kids
and it's very it's very you know it's
there's similar things and there's a lot
of different things you know obviously
i'd say the hours are a bit longer in a
straight for high school and you know
the sort of the level of my school is
more I don't know it is normal level
that's all right my school's fine
nothing really special you've got good
kids you got your bad kids and you're
gonna get that everywhere so sorry the
last thing I want to talk about with it
is that yeah they basically the teachers
are pretty switched on there's they're
generally not as strict in terms of
people doing illegal things like you
know if someone kids deals they don't
calm down in as hard as they wouldn't
Australian you know if a teacher you
know I'm not gonna actually not going to
talk about I shouldn't talk about I may
talk about it on person person if you
guys come to the YouTube party on the
third of November Tokyo hood so I'm
gonna go yay so awesome anyway but yeah
I yeah so anyway let's talk about the
any other things about the high schools
in you know and there's basically
there's 12 there's high schools
structured in all different parts of
Japan and so there's public and there's
private just like there is in Australia
basically guys their privates are pretty
much my schools of private high school
and the difference is that public
schools are very sort of they're just
the standard level and then basically
private schools either fall into a
little bit lower level or a lot higher
so basically if kids are sort of really
having a struggle have a hard time to
get into a normal school or their
parents have special needs or something
out they usually send them to the that
private school it's a little bit under
or obviously distance if
public schools too far it's just
troublesome to get there and send to the
practical the Masters like basically the
real smart top private schools they're
not as sort of as you know so what I'm
looking for they're not as common as
public schools or the lower level
private schools they're basically very
rare but they at the same time they've
got very high standard and they're
basically for the Brent kids so there
was one in my old town and cashew ax in
the old city there was a like the real
high level high school they took all
people from all sorts of areas and they
all came to that high school basically
another big difference in high school
here is that kids will commute from a
very far way to go to school which is
interesting so the kids will basically
travel you know sometimes we get kids
traveling from an hour and a half away
just to get to our school and back which
i think is ridiculous you know in
australia i think the max commute that I
ever heard it was like probably 25
minutes max like you know by car and
these kids traveling pretty far
distances sometimes although it's not as
common most people would be about half
an hour I guess here but the distances
are definitely kids travel a lot longer
a lot further to get to school then they
otherwise would so yeah guys anyway guys
that's about it all i can think of at
the moment if you've got any pacific
requests and you want me to talk about
them i'll talk about them as always and
i am coming on beer chat with mark and
molly on the twentieth of october so be
sure to check that out on saturday night
1030pm make sure you don't miss it I
can't wait because you know i'll get to

really cool guy marks told me a lot
about him and yeah max find me and
creamy so that is username you guys
should check them out if you don't know
they're really cool it there j vloggers

yeah this is my vlog today and if you
haven't already I've got to give away
for October and i will be getting a
product in soon to give away in november
which i'm going to review but i'm going
to keep it a secret so i'm going to tell
you guys yet anyway guys piss off and
now if you've got any comments let me
know in the comments section below and
i'll reply as soon as I can I hope this
video's kind of enlightened you as
the differences in between the high
schools in Australian Japan Japan
basically another big differences sorry
is that there's two semesters there's
not four terms there's two semesters
usually in every school and also the
generally the buildings are all kids
just go into one big building and do a
whole all their school now is imposed i
know in australia specially we will
basically in Australia we just video put
up yeah Australia we have all space down
you know different buildings different
grades and all that in Japan's birth in
one big block and they all go into the
school so I guess I hope this has
answered a lot of your questions and
