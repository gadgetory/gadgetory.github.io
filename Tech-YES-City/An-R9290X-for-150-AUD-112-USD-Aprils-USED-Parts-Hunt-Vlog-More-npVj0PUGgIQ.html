to be used parts hunting where I'm
jumping on gumtree putting on that bogan
voice and we're going to be seeing what
deals we can get also with that said I
did do some types of trading this month
where I did make a separate video and
I'll put the link up here where I did
get some really good deals from swapping
PC parts which will make off the PC
that's going to hit the channel very
shortly that use price performance PC
but also that will talk about some of
the other things going on behind the
scenes here so let's get on with it we
pulled up a heap of deals here and the
first one we've got is an i-9 290 but
the problem with this one is it's a bit
too far away like I've wasted a lot of
money and gas but I'm pretty sure this
guy would take a hundred and fifty
Australian dollars for this which would
be very cheap for an online 290
especially a direct coup - as well a
direct Cu depends on how you want to
talk about a bit
next one here we've got a desktop PC
monitor keyboard speakers 35 bucks
and really a lot of the hardware in here
we've got a photo here a lot of the
hardware is pretty old-school I mean
this is like a m2 or ddr2 anyway so it's
really old but this case is just so damn
cool looking I mean that is just so
retro so much swag on that case like
I've got to put in a $10 off of it
I might even just call them up because
there is a number there so we'll call
that up later and this is the
motherboard that was on there so you can
see that yes supporting Athlon 64 CVS
and they're just really old-school
now this next year we got up here is 209
290 axes so we've got $200 negotiable
it's not too far of a drive so I'm going
to call them up and see if the guy will
take a hundred and fifty Australian
dollars I think that's a really good
compromise I think you should be wanting
to get rid of it because don't have
those reference coolers but that's not a
problem we can whack on an excel or if
need be and then the next deal will go
up here is for a hundred and sixty
dollars we've got a core i5 it's a four
core I think the 2400 so we can call up
see if we can get this sure there's no
number there so we'll drop in a $100
offer on that and see if they take it
because it comes with a monitor and
stuff that I'm only interested in the
desktop PC here so other deals that are
really good is this one but it's too far
away another 1990 there from the Zeus
really good deal
pretty good deal here is another 780 if
this went too far I would be dropping in
low balls and then this one here was
like really weird a quarter jewel and a
GTX 670 so really weird specs going in
this I'm pretty sure it might not even
be a Core 2 Duo they've just labeled
that wrong and that could actually be a
really good PC for a deal so the last
few months we've kind of been going with
a typical like full-on bogan voice this
month I may try a tough bogan high by
they gone
yeah so yeah Don dumb tree for a $35
desktop p3 for the sorry $35 desktop oh
yeah yeah yeah matter
would you take 10 big ones for it okay
no I don't need the monitor or anything
donated speakers on Rihanna's Ravello
okay cowboy room and all I was going to
do is just break them up and so honest
if you majors down I'll just look look
nice and all filler but with the miss
power pack cinnamon yes the board
separately any other topic which i think
is a better way to do it until the
monitor I go there for one ism yeah are
you it yeah all interesting old Edison
in the case-mate you just want the case
figure yeah yeah I can he be an idle
focus mantle at all this afternoon and
then just ring back and I've got all
business
yeah well the case yeah geez mate legend
alright I'll talk it in I'll say mate
bye alright so they went really well he
didn't want to sell the whole PC for ten
dollars obviously it's really cheap for
all that but I was only interested in
the case and he was willing to put up
the case for sale for ten bucks so
hopefully we can get it for ten bucks so
I just I don't know I've never seen a
case like that before but let's call up
the next deal
see what we can get Isaac sir sir so
he's not picking up his phone we'll drop
in an offer on gumtree for 150 bucks
right now the hizzle a new paths that
have also been sent in this month sighs
a review or build samples and the first
one here's the RX 570 from Oris now I'm
going to be reviewing this against the
RX 470 which is a similar cattle that
have changed it from gigabyte to orous
and also I'm going to be checking the
overclocking Headroom how much extra
performance that gives and also things
like the power consumption and thermals
also behind that we've got the gtx 1060
from msi to the gaming x plus this thing
now has 9 gigabits per second of gddr5
memory those go fast the memory on board
and we'll see how that pans out in games
I want to test this against the RX 580
since I believe they're going to be the
two hottest cards around the midsection
still even with these refresh is going
on now besides that we've got an X 370
there's a gaming Pro carbon very popular
motherboard on the X 370 line so I want
to put that with an r7 1700 and do a
really cool deal for you guys for our
overclock that we put in a decent
graphics card and then here we got some
kami gammy robots I've been meaning to
review these for quite a while I just
really haven't completely forgot about
them so sorry to come again me robots
but I will be checking these out and
seeing if they're any fun so here we've
got some Seagate hard drives they send
these in because they'll really impress
that I went out and bought some
Barracuda drives and they were like look
that's only our entry level for our new
lineup so they've got a completely new
lineup of hard drives
they've got things like sshd nass drives
and so I'm going to be checking the
doubt checking the performance out and
seeing how well they perform and then
laptop I went to an event with Steve
from hardware on box we went down to
Sydney and he went up from Melbourne and
we were at this event where AMD we're
talking about the new rising CPUs so I
managed to get the r5 1600 and also the
1400 because I'm really interested in
the budget options so I'm going to be
putting those in a build for you guys or
in two different bills - stay tuned for
them on the
channel and a little data we're going to
get through that ask them 1700 versus
the 7 700 K and multiplayer Benjamin
stay tuned for that too and we're moving
on to this month bill which is going to
have the Coolermaster silent oh you know
some people like to call it the silent
EO but I like to call the silent o and
then we've got a 500 gigabyte hard drive
that I brought back from Japan this was
like a 10 dollar one and then also with
a lot of these parts I did do a lot of
swaps this month so I actually confused
on how to price up a lot of this gear
because as you guys may know I did a
swap where the laptop was the main point
of the swap and then I just got all this
stuff like these are this Ram this CPU
the 4690k and other components this SSD
for example that was all icing on the
cake with the deal so I don't really
know how to price that up I'm a little
bit confused there though we do have a
GTX 770 in the background but the guy
has gotten back to me and he said he
would accept 450 dollars for a 290x so
since this CPU is going to be very
powerful I'm going to overclock it we're
going to match that up with a 290x just
because we can we've also got a cooler
master 212 to fans on us so that's going
to be really good for this CPU and we've
also got a $10 power supply which I
brought back from Japan as well so we've
got some really good deals this month
it's going to make for a kick-ass build
ok so I got a reply from the guy with
the 290 X's actually two of them but I'm
going to go pick up one of them for a
hundred and fifty AUD which would be
like 110 USD or something like that so
I'm gonna go pick that up now and see
how good it is
so I just got back from picking up this
sapphire 290x we got this for 150
Australian dollars a really good deal it
actually looks like it's in really good
condition too so the guy said it works
perfectly fine
he actually had another one for sale as
well so someone's on the Gold Coast and
they're looking for a really good deal
on a graphics card I'd be hitting that
other one up for 150 AUD men SuperDuper
price and it's going to actually replace
this 770 which is going to get put in
another build since this CPU is going to
be pretty high power especially after I
deal with it and overclock it all I
think there's going to be one hell of a
build also an update on my Huawei phone
here we've got this new screen on I
managed to pick this up for $30 off eBay
30 u.s. and it works perfectly fine so
it's really cool I got this screen
fitted on the crack screen as note as in
the bin and yeah there it is all fixed
up it didn't what did take a while
actually but there's this really good
guide on YouTube that I used to not only
take it apart but to put it back
together again so there it is my phones
working again so now so that we have a
guys today's use pot hunting was really
good that 290x just made it all worth it
that was one really good deal now I know
a lot of you guys like Luke Bryan I want
to see a top five GPUs on the youth
price performance for 2017 and with that
deal that I just got and with seeing a
lot of r9 290 s come up that's probably
going to be number one on that pick
because that is just one really good
deal providing they weren't being used
for Bitcoin mining and left on 24/7 but
other than that guys we've got the used
computer coming that's going to be
absolutely kick off with a 290x and a
4690k in there I still don't know how to
price that up so I have made a thread
over at the forum so check that out
because I love your guys feedback on how
I should price this build up because I'm
obviously it's not going to be free
because I swap parts for it but on the
same time I don't want to make it too
unrealistic so looking forward to your
comments as always and with that I've
also got the new parts backlog it still
builds up but I promised you guys I'm
going to make
be used and the new parts sort of come
out in balance so hope you guys enjoy
what's been coming out of the channel
lately and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon tease out
for now
bye
oh maybe I should put an accelerant to
9tx I'm thinking that's a good idea
