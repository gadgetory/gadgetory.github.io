of a vertically mounted GPU it serves to
show off that beautifully design
graphics card cooler which is usually
custom and in this case a lot of people
want the custom coolers and if you had
it horizontally the most the time you
just get to see a logo on the side who
wants that but with tempered glass and
acrylic side panels now becoming more of
a requirement rather than option and
we're even seeing them being introduced
into budget PC cases that cost next to
nothing we're going to see what you
really need to know however with these
Rises and we're going to couple this
with an RT x20 atti from gigabyte to
really see if we can get any differences
between a riser cable on and rise a
cable off now I will start with a stern
warning
not all PCIe risers are created equally
for example all three of the riser
cables I've used before have not worked
one has come close but started crashing
and giving me weird errors and the other
two well most recently I tried one of
the two failed risers on the core p7 for
the all AMD build video we cut here on
tech yes City and well with the rise of
the system just wouldn't post no matter
what we tried take the riser away and
sure enough it posted straight away with
that being said I'm now using this
Coolermaster vertical GPU mount kid
behind me here because a friend in
Brisbane got it on good old gam tree for
$40.00 and allowed me to use it for this
video and it actually works except for
one thing I don't have a case here where
I can mount it officially to as just yet
so we decided to use this old NZXT s340
and well it can host the vertical mount
fine with a little hacking now squeamish
viewers may want to look away because
the bracket does fit in any case with
seven full height PCI slots and screws
into the original hole though if it
mounts up to any case what's the issue
you might ask well because the GPU is
now sitting this way it can interfere
with the slats on the actual case itself
so I had to give them a tiny snip to
remove the bars that were otherwise
blocking cables for example and for the
Antec case I even had to zip tie it off
usually the Coolermaster bars simply
unscrew
rotate to accommodate themselves in a
Coolermaster case and if you're lucky
you may only need to do minimal
modification but chances are you're
removing all the bars especially since
we are testing this r-tx 20 atti with
triple monitors from the budget Wow PC
I'll put a link for that up here it was
certainly an experience a few mentions
however we must test performance of this
riser to see if we're losing any
bandwidth or FPS by extending the PCIe
runs or if the cable itself is an
earthing performance firstly one
important warning however with most
vertical GPUs mounted this way you will
either lose access to using all but one
PCIe slot unless your motherboard has
some on the top or a full speed lower
PCIe slot or for those cases that do
have a dedicated vertical section you'll
be pushing the graphics card
uncomfortably close to the side panel
possibly even starving it of air flow
however onto that testing so for these
tests I actually decided to test on two
different systems we've got an AMD AM 3
plus system behind us here with an FX
8350 we've also overclocked that
overclocked the memory and we've even
done the tests with both non overclocked
on the GPU and overclocked on the our TX
28 ETI
done the exact same thing with the Intel
rig which features a 7 8 20 X on X 2 9 9
and 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory clocked
to 3200 megahertz
first off here we'll take a look at the
AMD system and with riser vs. no riser
in UniGene heaven
we noticed virtually no difference and
then moving on to x by extreme which is
where we're particularly stressing the
graphics card because it is a very
intense 4k benchmark well yet again it
got virtually no difference between the
two which is all down to pretty much
margin of error and we'll talk about
that soon and then moving on to testing
another benchmark UniGene value we yet
again saw no difference in performance
and we are testing again on 1440p x 3
monitors so that's a massive resolution
here which will be stressing the gravis
card quite a lot moving on to the Intel
system however things were not different
at all again so heaven didn't show much
of the difference at all again within
margin of error
moving over to UniGene valley we saw
virtually no difference yet again
moving on the time spike streamed the 4k
intense benchmark we saw yet again no
difference all down to margin of error
and so now we're moving on to verdict
timer we virtually saw no changes to
performance or within a tight margin of
error which is completely normal what we
actually did too was overclocked this
20/80 TI just to make sure it wasn't
being limited not just by the riser but
also by the CPU itself to ensure that we
didn't have any cpu bottlenecks coming
into play when we were trying to get
these numbers for you guys but what
about some other differences with having
a riser versus not having a riser I mean
in previous runs you could have had the
GPU getting hot because it was mounted
vertically in a case with no air flow
and maybe there's the other way around
where it could actually help air flow
but one thing that's important to note
however the performance numbers could be
affected if we used an inferior PCIe
riser cable as I said before and to
start this video I tried out three
different cables before this kit right
here and I couldn't even get to the post
screen so maybe there's some differences
with cheaper cables that could actually
work but may affect performance either
way however in this case we use the
Coolermaster vertical GPU kit when the
side panel was off on both cases so in
fact we probably even slightly improved
air flow because the air doesn't have to
wind up at such a turbulent angle I mean
very sort of anal retentive stuff but to
say it made a difference would honestly
be placebo and not like that band back
in the 90s they made some good tracks
but not some good facts but more
importantly I will admit one thing it
did make the build look so much better
especially with the cards that have a
more aggressive front cooler like this
gigabyte and the wind force 980 that we
have not only does it look more
aesthetically pleasing but it also
serves to cover up the unused plugs and
capacitors of the motherboard for
example giving that clean look without
even trying and if it's one thing you
guys know when it comes to cable
management sometimes I just like the
clean look to stand out when you can
sort of take the back panel off there
may be some ugly cable management there
but it's all in the name of saving time
however now back to the serious face one
thing that is important to stress is the
quality and hence the price of the riser
cable just like the age-old saying you
get what you pay for it applies to PCIe
Rises - no they will achieve riser
FAC signal quality and possibly speed
that also may not even let your computer
turn on properly at all as we're going
to see now for the third time this is
the only GPU mount I've tried to this
date that has allowed the computer to
boot without some weird BIOS errors and
trust me those errors were frustrating
and it's just wasted me a lot of time in
the past where people in the video when
I did the AMD PC pointed out their
frustrations with failed PCIe Rises as
well but regardless this bill behind me
is now so much more appealing whether
you want to add that to a sale or keep
it on a desk it will definitely make
anyone's eyes shine but with that said I
am going to be looking for a budget
option that you can get off Aliexpress
or ebay that actually works properly so
if you guys know any suggestions be sure
to drop them in the comment section
below and also let us know in the
comment section what do you think of
vertically mounted GPUs have you tried
it yet are you just gonna shy away from
it you think it's one of those crazes
that doesn't need to be touched just
like RGB or are you a fan of RGB and
you're gonna be moving into vertical GPU
mounts love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
the next Tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
