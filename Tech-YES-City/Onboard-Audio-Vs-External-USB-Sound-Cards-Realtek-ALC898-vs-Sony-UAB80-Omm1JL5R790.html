just coming back to you guys today with
a quality tests comparing onboard audio
versus external USB sound cards so
basically guys I've got a real tech alc
8 9 8 onboard audio and I've done the
tests with it basically the output on it
is pretty weak I've got them out putting
volume max to my headphones I can hear
it that you know the quality is good but
it's the amplification is not there and
the input guys the input is pretty damn
bad but there's lots of noise with the
onboard audio so anyway guys let's check
this out real tech versus a cheap
bundled Sony external USB soundcard
thing so if you want to check out what
that Pacifica is you can check out my
microphone view it's $45 and you get a
microphone a USB sound card bundle all
into this package for $45 base is like a
$10 sound card so and that has a lot
better vacations
anyway guys I let I'll let your is do
the deciding and then after the test I
will come back and do some more
commentary on why and you know what's
good about onboard audio what's good
about external USB audio so let's hear
the test guys and one more thing is when
I'm touching the computer its earthing
it to me and when I'm not touching it
it's not asked okay so this is with my
power supply not earthed ok guys enjoy
final pass for this biatch so quiet test
now with no touching with touching now
with touching no touching with touching
okay guys now we've maxed the volume out
so max on both settings back max on both
channels and now this is no touching max
on my razor car-chase razor carcass here
this is from my USB external now we're
going to touch the computer case and see
how much noise is coming through so
touching no touching and as you can tell
there guys
the basically the onboard audio the
microphone input is horrible there is
just so much noise you can hear it even
when I'm earthing my computer to myself
the noise the hissing noise is still
there so if you guys want to do
commentaries or record any
thinking you're serious about it then
you may wish to go with a USB external
sound guard
why would I recommend external because
yeah you know you're not going to suffer
as much noise from inside the case but
you know obviously there's anything is
better than onboard audio in my opinion
onboard audio is kind of like a Ferrari
with a one liter engine you know it's
got the DAX
it's got the converters there it's got
the ADCs there and there real high
quality there 24 bit 192 kilohertz
they're really good quality the signals
are really good except the amplification
sucks you know my headphones max volume
and you know I can it's just normal
normal volumes you know I can't if I
want to hear things you know more in
depth I can't turn the volume up to hear
people better if they've got weak output
on their videos you know for instance
that's just a big thing to me so
basically the output on this Sony you
know $10 thing this $10 the USB XR sound
card is the noise for input is a lot
better
and basically the outputs 50% more and
so that's just a cheap Sony USB sound
guard so basically what is the onboard
audio good for it's good for I guess if
you've got a home surround sound system
like I do and you know I watch blu-rays
I'll plug you know movie off my computer
and then watch it on the blu-ray system
and you know it'll send out a quality
signal and then my blu-ray player amp it
my blu-ray surround sound system will
amp that signal so yeah if you you know
for signals it's really good but for
amplification the thing sucks on board
audio sucks for amplification so that is
my review and that's what I found guys I
did the tests I did lots of tests
extensively I did all these things to
eliminate noise and you know I did a big
thing on how to reduce static and
hissing if you got onboard audio so if
you want to check out the video please
check it out and if you're wondering
what I'm talking on at the moment I'm
talking on a bearing of b1 through an M
audio guys mech preamps so this is
actually a pretty expensive setup it's
$150 but you know if I stop and pause
you can probably hear no noise at all
except my heater or my birds in the
background but then I guess if you've
got any questions please let me know in
the comment section below and of course
if this video helped you or any of my
other videos that help you then please
subscribe it helps me a lot and peace
out for now guys wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
