subscribers asked me for pcs I just said
to them where the barbecue pits in a
minibike combated tag yeah City this is
Bryan coming to you guys today with a
little bit of a different sort of video
where I'm building two pcs at the same
time for subscribers that requested
these builds at cost and now the good
thing about this piece is I get to test
the i7 920 versus the e50 640
head-to-head and see if that node shrink
really does make a difference there's
also some other things I'll be testing
out like ECC memory that's on buffered
and whether you can overclock it or not
so without wasting any more time let's
go over what parts we have here today
and how much they cost and then we'll go
over to the cleanse and then the build
and the benchmarks
you
you
this time on the gigabyte you d3r the
x58 version pretty much the North Bridge
and the South Bridge the thermal paste
there had hardened up but it was a lot
easier to get off than the MSI one so
now we're going to put these two boards
back together with some mx4 so anyway
here's the heatsink here this stuff is
like virtually like glue so I'm gonna
have to put a sanding block to it and
really give it a hammering
okay so there it is nice and shiny and
ready to go back on
okay so I'm just going to quickly test
and see if this BIOS needs to be flashed
or not and if it does and it's a bit of
a pain in the ass on this platform
because they want you to flash from
Windows because I think the bias file is
too big so we'll just hit that power
switch there and just see if our little
e 5640 is being recognized okay this
actually might be the CPU this time
around it looks like it's not turning on
all right so we've put the i7 920 back
in and it looks like that was the
problem
so maybe the motherboard doesn't support
the Xeon CPU and I will find out very
soon so this time around we're going
with something different we're going to
use some ECC memory now this is actually
unbuffered which is quite rare for ECC
memory so it still does have an extra
chip on here in the middle which allows
it to read and write errors if they do
show up however it does add an extra
cycle to the memory though the good
thing about this is we're able to get
more memory for the same money all right
so let's boot this PC up and see if this
stuff works and see if it's being
recognized on boot okay that isn't a
good sign
so looks like this motherboard doesn't
like ECC memory either so I'm just going
to quickly test this motherboard with
the memory from the washe video that was
forged from 10 Nokia 3310
okay so we've booted this thing up and
we can see here and the information
we've got d0 stepping which is actually
a really good thing on the i7 920
because it means we'll be able to
hopefully overclock this thing to 4
gigahertz and we got version 2.6 1 here
so I've just downloaded the latest bios
version and plug it in and see if we can
update the BIOS too because we've tried
to update the BIOS here with the latest
BIOS and it's just not being recognized
at all so if I change that over to here
on the focus we can see that it just
will not find the BIOS to update this is
the official boss remember sized website
since it does say version 8 b5 but on
their website I can't even find that
BIOS now managed to rename the boss to
exactly the boss that it was before
previously so it's giving us the option
to flash so hopefully this works this
time around which will be great yeah so
looks like it's working knock on wood
and once it's done with this BIOS flash
we're going to try the ECC memory again
we're also going to try an e5 56:40 I
tell you this is slow and painful you
just don't want it to stop will crash
anyway during this turn I'm gonna find
out about little monkey well wow wow
what's the work around there we actually
just renamed it to the exact same BIOS
that was on it before the one that was
being recognized and now we can see here
were on the March 19th 2011 so it's a
much more recent BIOS
all right so we just tried the ECC
memory and as you can see here it's
working and I'm kind of a little bit
perplexed because I'm I'm positive that
the memory controller is built onto the
chips with nalem they are the first
generation so what this means is that
the i7s the consumer grade actually
supports ECC memory which is cool so I
guess it's a dormant feature that was I
guess awakened or woken by a BIOS update
very interesting anyway so I'm not as
sure for the exact reason but cheap
memory is working whoo all right so
we're in the bias now we've updated to
version FF through the cue flash I
didn't realize that you could not date
it to the last version because that can
only be updated via Windows I think
because of the fact that the bias flash
chip doesn't recognize the size of the
actual bias so FF was the most recent
one that I could update to and that's
good enough because that now recognizes
the Xeon which has the ECC memory
compatibility on built on the chip in
the memory controller which means that
we can now use the ECC memory all 12
gigabytes of it so we are home and hosed
and we're good to go
Oh
all right so it's finally time to boot
both these computers up and we're gonna
see if they work both at the same time
so let's get it done okay so who is
going to turn on this marvelous a sub
monitor from 2008 CCFL backlit - by the
way they're both working - me see here
both these computers have successfully
booted up one on the HDMI one on the VGA
port because the DVI port on this
monitor doesn't work
you
so there we have it - amazing pcs as you
can see in the benchmarks they both ran
really well the one thing I will point
out is that there was not much of a
difference between the i7 920 and the e
50 640 if anything there was absolutely
no difference at all when it came to
real-world performance most notably
siding here the Cinebench score here
where we got 625 points on the 920 and
then we got only 621 on the e 50 640 now
now this overclock was pretty much
apples to apples with both motherboards
sporting a base clock of 200 megahertz
another thing I will point out and that
you guys probably noticed as well was
the quite weak scores on the GTX 660 and
I noticed that back in the past when I
had my gtx 750ti
overclocked that thing scored more
points than this thing is today so maybe
there is a bit of truth with the Kepler
being nerfed
however I will check that in the future
though for what it's worth I do think
the old-school AMD cards start to offer
a lot better value for money than the
old-school Nvidia cards especially when
it comes down to price performance and
another great thing to take out of this
was that the ECC memory is overclockable
it's great value for money and not only
that when you couple it with that x58
motherboard line and there's a company
nine 20s and also the e 56 40s you can
overclock them to four gigahertz and you
have yourself one of the most amazing
gaming CPUs especially for the money and
the last thing to take out of this video
would be that the old-school intel
heatsink fans are actually pretty good
unlike nowadays anyway that's about it
for me today guys if you enjoyed this
video then be sure to hit that like
button if you have any questions or
comments about today's builds and be
sure to drop a comment in the comment
section below
now these PCs are really good value for
money though they could have been great
value for money if I'd use something
like a HD 7870
or an r9 270 in my opinion anyway I'd
love to hear your thoughts on these pcs
so be sure to hit that comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
