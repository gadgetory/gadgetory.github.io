going to be Maxwell is it going to be
cap well hey YouTube what's up this is
bryan easy just coming back to you guys
today with episode 4 of tech talk so
guys I got us to talk about the new
video 7 series of the gtx 780
pacifically and I'm gonna talk about do
you got to you guys today so guys sorry
I'm I haven't been a like doing a video
in a little while I hurt my back while I
was cleaning snow like cleaning up all
the snow and that's the problem guys
when you work out your upper torso and
you don't work out the rest of your body
just went in there Rambo her and the
back popped out so heard it a lot it's
getting a lot better now but anyway guys
let's get on with the video so and the
lesson learned is work out your whole
body and not just your upper torso so
stupid me anyway i'll let the hard way
you guys shouldn't have to learn the
hard way so let's go on guys
realistically we're looking at a kepler
refresh in my opinion for 2013 I think
this card will come out in March or
April somewhere around there and I think
they will do the same system as the GD x
6 series and that they will release the
780 first then they'll release the 770
then we'll get the 760 TI and 760 so
guys what can we expect okay so this is
about the most realistically realistic
specs I could pull up so we have here
the 28 nanometer fabrication process
still we've got a little bit extra on
the boost clocks and the base clocks so
they're going to be a bit higher the RAM
is going to be the affective memory
clock is going to be clocked higher and
or 50 Hertz I think 50 megahertz bit
higher and we got another gigabyte of
gddr5 ram on there which will help with
those higher resolution the problem that
the GDA 680 suffered was that when you
started going really high 1440p the 7970
started doing a little bit better not
that much but it started doing all the
graph this sort of results started going
in favor of the seven 970 but at 1080p
the gtx 680 was just doing a bit better
than 79 70 so they're pretty close oh
and although neck and neck but I think
the 79 70 did a bit better at those
higher Reza's some of our guys let's
have a look so they may correct that
problem this time I don't know about a
bit boss I'm not too sure on
can't say whether it's going to be 384
or 256 but I think it may be 384 as the
video should be aware of this that you
know people are buying cards for 1440p
but at the same time not many people
play at 1440p i'd say like one percent
of the gaming population probably pays
plays at 1440p as it's you know a it's
expensive to get a 1440p gaming monitor
and be 1080p is really late for a
desktop that's all I need I don't need
any bigger I need a 27 inch monitor I've
got a 24 inch monitor 23 inch monitor it
is absolutely fine for gaming in my
opinion and it's at 120 Hertz to 120
frames per second which is awesome sorry
guys let's have a look we've got the gtx
780 here and this is the most realistic
respects and if these specs are true
then we can expect in my opinion a
fifteen to twenty five percent increase
just like the AMD 8 series so now why
where are we going to get these results
from is we're going to get a little bit
extra yield say ten to fifteen percent
we won't actually know until we get the
cards so remember that guys no one's
going to know for certain what these
cars are going to perform like until we
get a card and benchet but in my opinion
we're gonna get about fifteen to twenty
five percent and I think it's gonna be
the same and let's talk about new videos
strengths okay so basically I put up a
graph here but first off let me just say
guys you know this fanboy talk fifty
five percent faster than a gtx 680 2013
yeah I mean this is just fanboy talk in
my opinion I don't think you're gonna
get fifty five percent okay where are
you going to get that from the yield we
need yield okay yield is the biggest
thing if we want to get graphics in
performance we need yield okay unless we
throw a massive amount of hardware at
the problem which that's just going to
raise the price of the card anyway so
it's going to be stupid so going to
you're looking at price performance
ratio so I think honestly yeah if you
people are talking about fifty five
percent faster I don't think that's just
too much you're not going to get that
out of one generation of graphics cards
so I just think we can ignore that guys
close this window down it's a bit stupid
so but yeah realistically we can expect
a 15 to 25 and now let's talk about what
AMD are going to do and what they're
good at doing now AMD the eighth series
I think we're going to get that fifteen
percent yield and the reason why is is
they're proving it with piledriver
recently with the piledriver
these they showed that they can get that
fifteen percent yield solid increase and
they did that and so I think with the
only eight series is we're definitely
going to get a rise in yield so that's
going to be Andy we're going to get a
fifteen to twenty five percent rise so
they're going to throw a bit more
hardware at the problem and boom that's
going to be good and the gtx 760 AMD are
good at doing the yield they can they
can extract that yield we know that can
do that however AMD they're not good at
throwing hardware and getting results so
in the am d7 series we saw the 87 872
the 7 950 they threw a lot more hardware
at the problem but they didn't get the
results they only got like ten to
fifteen percent increase and people were
scratching the heads like well this 787
950 has so much more hardware than a 78
70 but it doesn't perform that well lake
doesn't perform that much better and so
the reason being is because of the yield
and so Andy when they throw hard work
the problem they don't really get the
results and the video on the other hand
when they throw hard work that the
problem they definitely get the results
as we saw in Fermi so if we look at
Fermi the gtx 580 is still one beast of
a card guys so looking at Skyrim here
for example you pull up a lot more other
benchmarks so gtx 680 on average does
about say it does sometimes it only does
five percent better than GD x 66 65
Eddie Sergio 680 only does five percent
better than gtx 580 sometimes sir a
little crazy surgeon let me rephrase the
gtx 680 sometimes only does like five
percent faster than the gtx 580 however
on other games that can perform up to
forty percent faster and now I think
with the Fermi they proved and approved
with fur me that when they throw massive
amounts of hardware at a problem they
actually get results so they just look
when to meet this month power-hungry
card and they did it with Fermi and they
got the results it was a pretty big card
it was a beast of a cart the gtx 580
however is also based on the power bill
so in the video definitely are capable
of doing this guy's so if nuh vidya this
time around can get the yield right and
then they can throw this extra hardware
at the problem and make a bit of a
monster the gtx
he could indeed be a pretty big cut it
could it may even be thirty percent
faster and you may see that with on like
average game for game it may be about
thirty percent average you could see
that it is a possibility so I think when
the video it's going to be a gamble I
think with AMD it's going to be like a
solid fifteen to twenty five percent
within the video it's going to be more
of a gamble we could see a pretty big
increase or we could see a little
increase so it just depends and I
honestly think it's going to be like a
just a solid 20 to 25 percent because in
the video guys if you didn't know
they're really focusing on Maxwell okay
this is so 2013 is just going to be like
a refresh and they're going to focus all
their effort on Maxwell and the reason
because is because Intel is starting to
enter the tablet market and they're
trying to get into the smartphone market
and because they got the money they're
just a massive company intel a huge and
so what what in the video are wanting to
do is they're teaming up with a RM so
erm if you guys didn't know they make
all those small smartphone chips I think
they make tablet chips too but anyway
the tablet market and the smartphone
market is huge guys it's a lot bigger
than the desktop gaming graphics
marketer gay and the reason is because
brick through everyone has a smartphone
everyone like everyone's getting tablets
and so in the video trying to focus on
Maxwell and get that hybrid chip out and
if they do that and they beat intel
thing at the 20 nanometer out before
until get the 6 thing nanometer out
they're going to go ahead to head with
intel and this is going to be
interesting so the future is going to
have some interesting results and i hope
the video stick it to Intel because i
don't personally i don't want to be in a
monopoly where we're just buying from
one company and getting fleeced so
anyway go into video yeah i'm in the new
video camp so anyway guys that's what I
expect and I think Maxwell is going to
be where they're focusing their efforts
and their rd and so yeah I think it's
seven the Kepler refresh is what we're
gonna get and 2014 is going to be the
year to wait for if you want to wait for
a graphics card guys wait for 2014 if
not my recommendation to you guys is
just get a six series a gtx 660ti cheap
they're dirt cheap they're like in get a
flake ice on for two hundred thirty nine
dollars in one of my budget builds for
six ECT imsi overclock so that is just
great value guys if you're gaming guys I
don't think you
if I'm gaming on a gtx 670 at 1080p and
most my games max settings 120 frames
per second guys it's just it's gaming
euphoria and now another two so another
two years for me guys when those games
get more demanding I'll just throw
another 670 in and I will be able to
play for another two years so i'll be i
got like four years of just gaming
euphoria on my current build so i just
have to throw in another 300 alucard and
i'll be fine so that's why i recommend
when I do my 1k budget builds in my
fifteen hundred dollar budget bills i'm
recommending gaming pcs that will last a
long time and so hope you guys
appreciate anyway ok guys that's about
it from today so my recommendation is
the aim d8 series and the GD x 7 series
they're not going to be that big they're
just going to be refreshes so if you're
holding out from then I mean yeah sure
hold out from do what you want but
personally I'd be picking up one of
those GD x 6 series for cheap they're
going out dirt cheap or if you're an AMD
guy go pick up a 79-54 dirt cheap
they're both great cards and they're
both going to own at 1080p guys
obviously if you're gaming at higher res
illegally so does go burn your money so
I mean ya gotta say anyway that's my
recommendation guys if you especially if
you're holding out I mean sure if you
want to I mean if you want to make a
super awesome rig and you've got like 3
grand and you want to make a new rig
maybe hold out and then you can make
like a YouTube popular rig where you
just got like three gtx 780 s massive
six core processor in there and you can
just get views man that thing will get
views on YouTube it's like a viral vid
sorry guys I hope you enjoyed my
tech-talk today guys if you liked this
episode please give it a thumbs up and
of course if you haven't already please
sub helps me out a lot so I guys lost
let me say I just got to catch my breath
sorry just been talking so fast getting
it all out to you guys but yeah this is
just a mean I've just got partnered
recently with TGN and they're really
good guys I can't like I'm going to do a
review in a few months once I find out
everything about the company but so far
they have been really really good so I
really like a TGN they're really helpful
every time I ask him a question they
replied so quickly so they're very quick
to reply they got good reps
obviously with me I get the partnership
benefits so I got the banner now you may
notice it's really cool I made that in
like 20 minutes sorry it's probably not
the best banner but it does the job
right so that's the main thing I don't
have a lot of time on my hands
especially this month guys sorry I can't
get the videos out as I got the injury
and you know next month I'm going to be
getting out a lot more vids when i get a
lot more time so i still got to do a
book for my work so I'm pretty busy this
month yes I hope you enjoyed it and if
you got any question guys if you've got
any tech help and you need immediate
help please send me a personal message
don't write a comment cuz I don't like
half the time I don't even see comments
youtube doesn't even let me know so
please send me a PM and make it in bold
letters like need your help immediately
because I helped out a lot of people
that way and so yeah guys i'll let you
know straight away and give you thoughts
and especially with builds guys I can't
like a lot of people are requesting like
five hundred dollar budget builds and in
like Europe like 500 euro built like I
don't have time at the moment to do all
these budget bills like they do take
time so maybe just if you want I can PM
you a sort of spec like I can send me a
website so what's the popular computer
place in Europe where do I get parts
from and I'll look on there guys and all
quickly p.m. you will build so that'll
you know that's probably better and
obviously if you're in Canada guys let
me know a website please let me know
website so i do want to do a 1k canada
build two guys for you guys so let me
know what's a good website to get
computer parts in canada too sorry guys
i hope you enjoyed it and I hope you
enjoy my little vlog at the end here so
he has peace out for now brand easy bait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
