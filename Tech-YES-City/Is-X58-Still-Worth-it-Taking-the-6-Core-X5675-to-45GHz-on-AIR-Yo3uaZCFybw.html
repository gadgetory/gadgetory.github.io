and I was watching a bit of hardware
unboxed and I noticed him on the news
corner he said something that I thought
was a little bit off I'll roll it for
you guys hey Liam for example was
released in 2008 and West me in 2010 so
if we're using a CPU from 8 to 10 years
ago it's probably time to update it
anyway so I'm pretty sure some people
would agree with this statement but if
you guys know me you'll know x58 is
practically my favorite platform of all
the time
because it has triple channel memory
because I can get those six quarts well
threaded Zeon's they're so cheap and you
can overclock them sky-high and on that
note that's exactly what we're gonna be
doing here today we've got the x58 from
a Zeus a great motherboard and also want
to test it because actually having tried
one of these for a very long time and
want to see how I can go with an X 56 75
now they have 56 75 apparently it is a
better bin than the X 56 70 also got a
higher multiplier as well so I'm curious
to see how high I can take this thing
now for the cooling we're using the
Baron case from deep cool I've been
meaning to check this out for such a
long time just been backlogged quite a
bit and this is essentially a case that
includes a water cooler fancy tempered
glass - and it doesn't break the bank
so with that aside let's put this thing
together and see what kind of numbers it
can push out
so first things first with x58 if you
haven't used one of these boards in a
while you have to take off this heatsink
here make sure you replace the thermal
paste on the Northbridge heatsink
because it can get quite hot and if it
doesn't have good cooling then it could
be a problem especially when you're
overclocking now it is pretty late at
night so I don't want to be using brake
cleaner as I do want to get into
overclocking straight away but I will
give a quickie with the data vac and
then also change the thermal paste on
this Northbridge heatsink here so I know
some people would be upset but we have
to make do and try and start
overclocking this thing so let's get on
with it so we've got all the components
they're ready to go inside the bearing
case and we're going to be giving this
x58 some brand new loving we've got a
new 1 terabyte drive a new 240 GB SSD
and also a 1080 Ti and a brand new 750
watt power supply and this time I do
have the i/o shield guys so go crazy in
the comments rejoice we have this piece
of metal here which is going to boost
FPS by at least 50%
and the build is now complete and it did
take a while to do this build and simply
because we have to move the power supply
instead of having it in the normal
position over the top or underneath we
had to put it in the back here and then
sort of screw it off to the top and then
put all that back together and also the
motherboard was actually a really tight
fit in this case I actually had a bit of
trouble getting in and initially and of
course the grabs guard actually still
goes into the case that way so overall
though I mean now that it's all finished
it's actually not a bad look it's
actually really tidy and of course we've
got a full sized ATX board in something
that would be the size of a micro ATX ER
size case I guess that's the whole theme
behind the bearing case itself but of
course how good is the included liquid
cooler we're gonna find out right now
fire this thing up and get into some
overclocking and also deep cool I think
these molex connectors they're really
good to go and if you don't want to let
them go then I'm just gonna keep doing
this
so it's pretty late now and Windows is
updating and I'm just gonna leave this
thing updating overnight so we can get
all those latest updates and whatnot but
the build is running and it's looking
really good especially at night when the
RGB can shine through on the top you've
got the ability to change the colors red
green blue yellow white and then like
the same colors but with like blinking
on and off so that's about it you can
just turn it on and off if you wish to
as well I think for some reason the red
which is the default color I just think
that looks the best out of the box you
guys can let us know in the comment
section what you think is the best color
on this thing but surprise it's a tight
little unit and tomorrow I'm after I
sleep I'm gonna overclock this thing
sky-high and see what the temperatures
are like with this included cooler and
then see how plays games with that 1080
GI so here we are back at it again and I
had to update the BIOS before because
there was only two sticks of memory
being utilized but now after the BIOS
update there was three sticks I was also
doing my head in because there was this
weird problem and I've seen this only
once before but I realized it can sort
of have an effect on how your device
boots up especially on older school
motherboards that is Windows for some
reason decided to install the system
reserve file here to the hard drive and
then install the windows itself to the
boot drive and so what I had to do is
figure out that this drive here the hard
drive of the system reserved actually
had to be the first boot device and so
now I think we're ready to overclock
because I couldn't be bothered
reinstalling Windows again and then
we'll install some games and see how
everything goes
so this stage I think it's the
motherboards I've put in another CPU and
it just doesn't want to go like it's
just having these food issues and so I'm
gonna flip the motherboard to another
one and see if it will start working
again okay so at this stage we've tried
another motherboard now we've tried
different memory tried a different side
a cable just tried a lot of different
things and it's still giving out the
same problem where it just kind of
refuses to boot it does boot but then it
goes after that it just will not do
anything and gives out a no signal so
what we're gonna do now we're going to
just mission abort this gonna leave it
all there
take the grams card out and just try and
just set up a test bed set up so I can
overclock some x58 goodness my goodness
okay so we are finally now back up and
running with x58 and everything seems
like it's good to go now got all the
memory recognized and we're running on
the X 56 75 here at 3.3 4 gigahertz out
of the box haven't changed anything
temperatures are really good too so this
is looking promising now and a lot of
people are asking about this cooler here
it's the cooler master ma 620 P so I'm
gonna be doing a project with cooler
master pretty soon this is one of the
coolers I had lying around I wanted to
use it and just see how it went before
of course I do the big video for cooler
master on it and it's really good like
know if it's one thing about it is it is
a bit of a pain to install like its
massive as you can see here but the
installation kit is welds like that
old-school bolt with a tool and it does
take a little while to install so if
you're doing it for one build its gonna
look really good it's got RGB as well on
the fans and it's gonna can sync up to
your motherboard if you're getting the
new latest greatest motherboards but is
a pain to install so for a test bench
it's not suitable but for everything
else in between it is really nice
so I don't know I really don't know so
far what's with the bearing case and
what's causing that issue but everything
looks like it's good to go now so now
we're finally into action with the x58
motherboard and the X 56 75 and I can
confirm that the X 56 75 s at least the
one I got here is a pretty good
overclocker 4.5 gigahertz on air so
we're getting over a thousand points in
Cinebench this is for like a $50 CPU
guys unbelievable performance got the
memory some random blue memory sitting
on there 1800 megahertz in
triple-channel so if you were to compare
that to some brand new dual channel
stuff that's like 20 400 megahertz this
is at a hardware that's almost 10 years
old I'm loving it and you probably like
it's got no USB 3 adding a PCIe cut USB
3 front end got it there doesn't have
nvme PCIe card doesn't have set PCI PCIe
PCIe will solve your life problems
anyway so that was a lot of headaches
that Express gate setting really held me
back a heap of time because I've never
come into that problem before and
there's a Cinebench score there over a
thousand points but we're gonna do a
little bit of fine tuning now with this
take you guys into a tour into the BIOS
with x58 and start overclocking and
talking about some of the settings so
this is a mid-range board it's actually
really nice though because back in the
days of x58 mid-range boards were solid
overclockers so especially on aaron
water now this is a problem I came into
and with x58 you can come into these
weird problems depending on the
motherboard depending on the bias and
depending on the settings I have to
leave this on with my Corsair SSD if I
don't my computer won't boot it's
extremely weird first time I've run into
this problem now another thing with the
gigabyte ud3 are in the past I believe I
ran into a problem with you didn't have
the uncor frequency at a certain ratio
in regards to the CPU ratio
you couldn't boot your PC properly like
you'd get in you'd start stress testing
you think okay the server clocks good
then you go to restart your PC and
everything just cycles and then you set
it to it
I forgot what exactly what the
she was but setup to a ratio that like
three to four I think it is and then it
works the azuz board doesn't have that
problem at least I haven't run into it
yet but we're gonna talk about some of
the settings here in this BIOS so I'm
call frequency you can set this well
below your four or four point four or
four point two gigahertz overclock
doesn't have to be anywhere near four
gigahertz the qpi link rate as well set
this to not slow mode because that will
literally make your computer so slow set
it to the option just above slow mode if
you set it to these other two here
that's close to 8,000 and above 8,000
that will make your computer unstable
and possibly not food as well so there
are a few settings here of course that
can stop you from booting now another
thing is well if it's your first time
overclocking x58 drop your memory down
to even like just 1,000 megahertz you
can deal with that later and you can
overclock memory i've got memory
overclocking tutorials on the channel a
lot of other people have memory over
budget auras but i've got that already
at 1800 megahertz so that's all good i
know it works speedstep technology you
can disable this it's not a big deal I
like to leave on c1e which is enhanced
state so when your computer's not in
action it will quickly throttle down to
a state just below your overclock and
that's how I've always rolled with this
platform generally sometimes you can
leave it on depending on the motherboard
because you may wish to unlock the max
multiply as you can see here it went
from 23 to 25 instantly so that's the
turbo multiply this board enables me to
unlock that without having this setting
enabled which is great but if you need
to have that enabled you may wish to
leave it in able to get that extra
multiply now moving down here to the
DRAM timings there's my custom timings
of course if you're overclocking memory
you will need that but here we go to
voltages okay so this is an important
thing since we've dropped the uncor
voltage and our memory overclock is not
super high as well as our qpi speed we
don't have to go berserk on this setting
here we can leave it at 1.26 IOH voltage
was just input/output hub voltage you
can leave that at like 1.18
and drop your own cord
to around three gigahertz they should be
okay to go now we look here at CPU PLL
if you're going for me like a 4.5
gigahertz overclock this is important to
set pretty high
you may even wish to go higher than 1.9
you may even wish to go to like 2 2.1 if
you're on you know l n2 or whatever the
1.9 seems to be about sweet spot for
this overclock as well as 1.39 3 voltage
now if you're going for four point two
four point four even four point four
might work at around one point three
five four points you might work at one
point three two so just keep in mind I'm
going for like four point five on-air
which is kind of hard to do so I do need
to play around with those settings will
depend on the CPU have this is the X 56
75 so it does seem to like to go to four
point five on-air anyway last setting
here of course load line calibration I
like to leave that enabled especially on
the Zeus motherboards they do get their
load line calibration settings pretty
much right on the money
the spread-spectrum is disabled both of
those I think they're for interference
or whatever and they can be a detriment
to overclock so now we've got all those
settings locked in where you can even
just give it a bit of a buffer just to
make sure because I will be doing stress
testing on this platform and I will be
comparing it to something of a new
generation pretty soon but once we've
done with that we can then save our
overclock profile and you see all these
weird names but anyway just ignore me
we'll put 4.5 stable and then we can
save that first profile and then we can
save exit bang you're good to go guys
and that's about it for over clocking
the x58 platform of course if you have
any questions or comments in relation to
that then drop a comment the comment
section below remember guys overclocking
ten take time I've literally been
overclocking or trying to get this thing
to work properly for I'd say about five
or six hours now
including last night this morning so it
can take a long time to lock in your
over lock every CPU is different of
course you can copy my settings but just
understand how the settings are
correlated to the voltages because
that's a big issue or a big thing
to get these overclocks working properly
with that said let's take a look at that
Cinebench school and see the
temperatures after a stress test and
make sure this thing is okay because
we're in and stole some games and see
how plays with the 1080 TI
so there's the Baron case there I'm not
sure what I'm gonna do with it at the
moment I'll probably put in a smaller
motherboard maybe a H or p55 in this
thing and then test it out with like it
is elan x 34 70 or something cuz I just
think 4 X 58 the board's really big to
begin with so it was a bit of a struggle
to get the board in and of course I had
all these problems and I don't think it
was the Baron it's just putting it all
back together does take a bit of time
and I'm gonna give the x58 board here a
bigger home so it does deserve a bigger
home especially with the size of this
cooler - and the fact that I know this
cool works before you 4.5 gigahertz now
so what I'm gonna do is yeah find a new
home for it and then when we do the
comparison versity 8700 k we're gonna
give this the best chance it's gone
because it deserves it so now I've just
finished benchmarking a few games
installing the rest of the games as well
for the upcoming comparison between the
8700 K but to answer that question of is
X 58 still worth it I think the results
speak for themselves we're getting a
hundred and twenty FPS maxing out Final
Fantasy a 15 at 1080p this is what the
1080p is the high settings step it up to
1440p it looks like the graphics card is
starting to take the burden the CPU can
definitely keep up and this is the
latest and greatest title on PC we look
at dota 2 a little bit of a sneak
preview this thing is getting over 200
FPS and it's still got a lot of headroom
to go so 4.5 gigahertz on this CPU is no
joke now I've looked at the prices on
ebay x58 motherboards are overpriced
they'll go on for like 200 us plus
really when you get an X 58 board you
want to get it on a bargain like about
an hour drive from me there's one up on
gumtree at the moment for a hundred and
ten Australian which would be like a be
something US dollars that's coming with
a gigabytes of ddr3 memory as well and
that's the biggest kicker as the ddr3
memory it's really a lot cheaper than
ddr4 memory so if you're in the market
to pick up some bargains and get that
motherboard get that RAM and even off
I'll Express you can get the CPU which
is the X 56 75 you can pick that off for
sixty US dollars chuck it on this
motherboard and you probably will want
to get some good cooling because you can
use it in the future anyway and you can
overclock this thing sky-high and
perform really well even with one of the
best graphics cards out there today and
you guys hope you enjoyed today's video
if you did then be sure to hit that like
button let us know in the comments
section below have you overclocked in
x58 motherboard and CPU before do you
want to try it definitely can be a lot
trickier I mean there is bugs and
problems that rear their ugly heads but
once you get past that and you get this
thing stable it is definitely a blessing
in disguise for me I do get frustrated
and I do come into these problems with
this platform but once I get through it
and see the performance like I've got
today it does make me feel a lot better
I mean the triple channel memory is
still so relevant in today's games ddr3
is so much cheaper than ddr4 a lot of
people chuck it in with the x58 boards
and so it's just really one big bargain
to be had if you can pick up the deals
I've got a lot of x58 boards around here
already like I think three so I don't
need anymore
but if I did I'd be picking up that deal
hey guys I'll catch you in the next
video very soon which will be the
comparison and then later on I can't
really say too much there will be
another comparison coming for you guys
to stay tuned and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
