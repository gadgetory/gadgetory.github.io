months ago people were like damn I want
to see more of this
so today I've upped the budget to $100
and we're going to put together
something that can hopefully play a lot
of today's games at decent frame rates
especially at 1080p ladies and gentlemen
welcome back to tech ES city this is
Brian coming back to you guys today with
a much popular requested used PC guide
now today we're doing a 100 dollar guide
and I've selected what I feel are some
of the best bang for buck PC parts in
the use section so I'm going to be going
first of all through each individual
part telling you how much I paid for it
and why I bought it
and then I'll also be putting the bill
together and if I incur any problems
with these use parts since some of them
might not work I'll be sure to tell you
guys what I've replaced it with and what
not and then after that we'll be
installing some popular games like csgo
League of Legends and dota 2 and we were
trying to play them at 1080p and see
what kind of frame rates we get
here's the first piece of the puzzle and
the reason why I'm doing this build and
that's because I picked up this whole
junk PC here for like $12 or something
like that was really cheap and initially
it was advertised as having an i3 550 in
it which would have been great but upon
pulling off this heatsink it had no CPU
in there at all but that's not a problem
because especially with these old-school
builds it's actually the motherboard
that will cost a lot of the majority of
the money and the fact that I picked it
up for $12 and got a heatsink with it is
very good
you
okay so we've got the moment of truth
here I'm going to turn this seep
computer on and see if it boots
so let's go ooh that's turning on so
it's working like at least there's power
going into it okay so I mean usually it
takes a few seconds for the signal to
come in from the HDMI usually but yeah
so I just had the cup there because it
was pretty angry anyway we've got no
signal so it means that either we have I
look it looks like a dead motherboard or
a you know I'll try a different HDMI
port but I don't think that's the
problem usually we'll boot off the
motherboard HDMI port so yes looking
like it's either the C CPU or the
motherboard I'm guessing if you're just
getting absolutely nothing out of it
they're generally first to go twos but I
will start diagnosing some things now
I'll switch out the graphics card the
RAM and all and check them on other
computers and I know this power supply
works as well so after I do all that I
will then probably have to go get a new
motherboard so we're going to be adding
costs on to the build as we go okay so
the GPU is working perfectly fine that's
the $30.00 5850 which is actually really
good I'm happy about that and this is on
the $40 PC that I built so for dollar PC
is definitely doing a great job so now
we're going to try and diagnose the
motherboard or the CPU so I'm going to
try and do what I can in the next few
days so just upon taking the CP off and
looking at it really closely I can see
that
like one of these I think it's
transistors just completely like
crumbled off so I'm pretty sure the CPU
is buggered like pretty much got sold
like a brick CPU so at this point I'm
not sure if it's the motherboard as well
which I hope it's not so I might try and
just buy a really cheap CPU and see if
the mother wood works just install the
Seagate hard drive now
and I've just really opened up a SSD and
done a sequential read and write test
there you see there the drive is
perfectly healthy it's got 100 megabytes
per second on the write speeds and a
hundred megabytes per second on the read
speeds so the hard drive is good to go
alright so we've just booted up the NASS
that's my get own ass over there and I
put the - - Giggy bytes ticks in that
just as the ddr3 board and yeah these
are working perfectly fine so so anyway
let's move on to the conclusion of part
one and actually I didn't want to turn
this into a two-part series but I
thought I would since a lot of people
just love seeing me tamper with junk
pieces and use parts and it will
actually take me a while to get another
CPU in and finish the build and even
then I don't know if this motherboard is
actually fully functional or not I do
have a good feeling that it may work
however the good things that came out of
this so far is that this graphics card
is confirmed working there's no lines
going through the screen so it looks
like it's working perfectly especially
after a good bit of DM or what does it
tender loving care TLC and then we've
also got the hard drive that works as
well so this is another good thing hard
drive is working and the memory is
working and the power supply working so
we've got the basis for a very good
budget PC and I'm just hoping that I can
get a refund on the CPU since it was
just a disaster I mean this thing
shouldn't have even been sold in the
first place since it's just yeah the
transistors live literally crumbled off
the CPU and I've never seen that before
so I don't know how that happened but
suffice to say if we get the refund on
this which I kind of don't expect the
guy to do that but if we do then we can
still keep it around $100 which is
awesome and that's if the motherboard
works as well so I've got my hopes up
stay tuned for part two if you liked
this video then please give it a big
thumbs up and of course if you want to
see part two then make sure you
subscribe and I will get back to you as
soon as I can
with another tech video or some more
reviews and used pizza out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
