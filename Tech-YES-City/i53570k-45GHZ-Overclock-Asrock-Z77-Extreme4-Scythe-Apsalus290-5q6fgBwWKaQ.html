balls which channel for for knife
gigahertz here quickly
yep all core 45 go down to offset for me
offset voltage is zero point zero four
five plus and since load line
calibration Auto is level five anyway
we're going to leave it there so this is
what we want yeah let's save it as
Brian's 4.5 a yeah okay too easy
save that and boot yeah okay let's get
this cracking now hey so we got at the
moment idle temps are about 35 degrees
Celsius like Max 36 degrees on one core
we've got speed step enabled so 600
megahertz clock down to one point one
one volt pretty much blend test let's
give this a go so we're running that
okay and I've tested this so it seems
pretty smooth this is about the sweet
spot for my processor now if you watch
my over other videos
my other overclocks 4.2 gigahertz 4.4
you'll notice that these processes have
real like huge diminishing returns hey
like 4.2 I got minus point zero nine
volts so I'm like down to one point one
volt at four point two and I go up to
one point two one and I'm getting four
and a half your guts so yeah it's I mean
it I guess it's yeah it's just it's just
like diminishing returns in the fact
that I'm getting a lot more heat and I'm
basically getting near the danger zone
you know Tom Cruise Top Gun right in to
the danger zone that's where we're gone
so basically after four and a half
gigahertz we are not I'm not going to go
any higher man I'm not like yeah I just
kinda for enough he gets the max I'm
going to do and I'll probably do that in
winter because summer is coming up so
and so I'm just going back to I'm
comfortable 4.2 gigahertz but if you
want to get four and a half kilos it's
easily obtainable it's I mean it is safe
at one point two volt it is safe I'm
actually getting errors so I think sweet
spot will be probably about point zero
five volt offset so I actually have to
up it a little bit more but yeah that's
about right so there you go
if you want to overclock your cpu for
INAF gigahertz pretty easy so alright
guys anyway
if you got any questions leave in the
comments below and of course subscribe
kick brownies gone so that's four and a
half gears overclock</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
