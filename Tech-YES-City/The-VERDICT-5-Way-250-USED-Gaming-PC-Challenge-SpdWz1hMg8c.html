asked me to be the judge for their $250
use gaming PC challenge I was more than
happy to oblige and today I'm going to
be giving you guys the verdict welcome
to tech city this is brian coming to you
guys today with the final scoring on the
$250 use gaming PC challenge now the
five tech tubers that I'm going to be
judging today are nerd on a budget tech
by Matt scatter volt toasty bros and
Ozzy talks hardware now all the links to
their videos and also their channels
will be in the description below so be
sure to check them out but with all that
out of the way the rules are very simple
every builder had a budget of 250
dollars or less to build the best price
performance gaming PC possible and every
dollar over that 250 dollars would count
as $2.00 and based on my metric system
which I developed and I'll explain that
in a second I had to judge the winner
and the following system is as follows
first up is fire strike which I gave a
heavy weighting of 30% to since I found
in the past that this benchmark score is
highly correlated to how a gaming PC
will perform in the real world with
games second we have UniGene heaven
which is another gaming benchmark and I
gave this a 20% weighting third is GTA 5
which I gave a 20% weighting to as well
fourth we have shadows of Mordor which
scored 20% in the weighting - and then
in fifth place we have the Cinebench r15
benchmark which I decided to give a 10%
weight into and only take out the CPU
score I decided not to take into account
the OpenGL test however since I found in
the past that is heavily manipulated by
things like level 3 cache which have no
bearing to real world gaming benchmarks
or at least gaming performance now with
all the explanations out of the way
let's take a look at the winner of the
contest nerd on the budget with a 130
dollar PC he came in with 42 point 6 4
points here and really there wasn't a
lot to critique about this build
everything was on point he got those
deals he got that all in one system
there which had the motherboard the CPU
the fan the hard drive even and even got
some bonus RAM included all for $50 this
is what really made this PC win this
competition in my
opinion also that GTX 660 very good
balance there as we could see in the GTA
5 benchmarks scoring ninety point two
seven frames per second on average
versus the other competitors who had
some much more powerful graphics cards
though they were being limited by the
CPU on that benchmark and then ways kind
of heavily skewed the results towards
nerd on the budget and since this is a
contest with their own settings it is in
the confines to have a good balance here
and nerd on a budget certainly struck a
great balance between CPU and GPU here
though if there was one thing to
critique I would say to take out that 4
gigabytes of RAM and just have the 8
gigabytes there in the set because I
believe that would help your benchmarks
even that much more well just by a
little bit coming in second place was
scattered volt with the 245 dollar GTX
970 beast he scored thirty nine point
one five points so just a little bit shy
of coming in a victory over no dollar
budget however I believe the big letdown
here was the GTA 5 benchmark and I will
say that that's when that I 520 400 just
couldn't live up to the GTX 970
demanding more power to be fed and the
CPU just couldn't provide that however
the fire strike score there unbelievable
on this budget you could also see with
that graphic score that he was heavily
overclocking that gravis card which is
fantastic on this kind of budget though
I will also say the four gigabytes of
RAM I mean this is a competition and he
is playing by the rules very smart
choice but honestly for real-world
gaming applications I would have liked
to send a gigabytes of RAM in there to
make a perfect gaming PC the very well
done scatter vault love what you did
with this build coming in third place
with the tasty burrows with their 190
dollar PC they scored thirty four point
nine three points here and they had a HD
7950 which they got for $90 and if there
anything to critique here I would have
liked to have seen them heavily
overclock that 7950 I'm not too sure
what they managed to get the overclocked
to I couldn't really see much
information on that though I'm sure that
would have made them score a lot better
in this competition however that aside I
think they had a solid PC in general I
couldn't really critique one thing as
being a bad deal I just think that note
on a budget and also scatter vault got
some better deals there and that enabled
them to pull over a higher score than
toast ebro's coming in fourth place is
tech buy a map with these two
and $50 PC he scored thirty three point
zero one points here and he had a GTX
1060 which he picked up for around about
a hundred and seventy dollars and this
is the first thing I'm going to critique
here since all these other deals were
pretty rock-solid I think the GPU let
him down especially when we compare that
to scatter volts GTX 970 which was
scoring a higher graphics score in fire
strike and he overclocked that and then
we've got the hundred and seventy dollar
graphics card which came in at around
twelve thousand points versus the
thirteen thousand two hundred so there's
anything that let Matt down it was going
with that gamble on that new graphics
card which has less cuda cores than the
six gigabyte variant to on the gtx 1060
so that was kind of like the Falla see
in this build though with that being
said i think it was a very solid
contender and i really like what he did
with the case and how he modded it to
fit in all the parts on a budget and
then coming in fifth place Azaz he talks
hardware with his 230 dollar PC he
managed to score twenty point eight two
points here on the scoring system and it
was a very bold move going with gtx four
70s in sli that's the first thing i will
critique about this build going with
legacy dated graphics cards in sli
probably wasn't a good idea and
especially showed on the benchmarks
coming in a well below the other
competitors there though I will give
credit to Ozzy talks hardware for being
the only competitor go with a manual
type build he managed to sources xeon
separately a motherboard separately in a
CPU cooler and also the ram and make
something that was overclockable a bowl
of mars eels buzz eels
buzz Ian's bells
there with Ozzy spending $20.00 on the
CPU cooler and also $30 on the hard
drives I believe that this was money not
well spent I believe he could have put
more of that money into the gratis card
and gone with something like a 250
gigabyte used hard drive and also gone
with one of those big fat stock intel
heat sinks from back in the day which
actually surprisingly do a very good job
of overclocking and you can get between
around 3.8 gigahertz to 4 gigahertz
depending on the ambient temperatures
with that CPU sorry guys I had an
absolute blast watching all these videos
and also collabing with the five
different youtubers who are again put
the links in the description below for
their channels and their videos I think
it's absolutely awesome that the tech
community is thriving especially in the
used part scene where everyone
especially like myself likes to get in
there for the thrill of the hunt you can
also help people out in the process and
also save a lot of people money if you
want to sell them that computer and save
them from buying something like an
alienware anyway that's it from me I'm
going to go get on my wolf 'mobile and
get on out of here so if you like this
video then please give it a big thumbs
up and I will catch you guys in another
tech video very soon which is going to
be my own used build and it's going to
be awesome so stay tuned for that and
also I'm looking for hot used setups
that's going to be a new series that I'm
going to be bringing to the channel then
the emails in the link below so submit
all the pictures you can to my email
brian at tech city TV and we're going to
have an awesome new series coming for
you guys so stay tuned and peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
