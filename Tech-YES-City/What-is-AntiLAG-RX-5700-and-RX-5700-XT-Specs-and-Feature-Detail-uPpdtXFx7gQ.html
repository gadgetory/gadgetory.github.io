am covering the AMD next gaming Horizon
event and today they've announced two
new graphics cards and that is the RX
5700 and the RX 5700 X T now spec wise
these are both 7 nanometer GPUs and
they've got 40 compute units and 36
compute units between the both of them
they also use a gigabytes of gddr5 4 in
vega 56 has been cut down dramatically
spec wise i'll pull these specs up for
you guys where they also talk about
their new rDNA architecture and how its
radically changed versus the GCN
architecture now both these graphics
cards will be released sometime in July
they haven't given a civic date yet and
as I'm doing this video they actually
haven't given a exact price now that
will be later today I believe but I will
update the description with the pricing
for you guys but on that note they have
poised both these cards 250 750 700 XT
versus the RT X 2060 and RT X 2070 now
later today I am told there is a demo
that I can go and check out where
they're gonna be comparing the RT X 2060
versus the 5700 but without a side
Microsoft also made a huge announcement
with their next upcoming console which
is going to be released in 2020 and
they're gonna be using the new Zen 2
CPUs as well as this same architecture
that's going into this PC desktop now
that was a really cool announcement but
I will say that I thought it wasn't as
cool as Keanu Reeves coming out on the
stage now besides these new GPUs coming
to market and bringing some competition
they've also announced some new
technologies one of which is called an T
lag now B being a person who loves a
snappy experience a responsive PC and
lowest input lag possible I'm going to
checking out this technology and getting
to the bottom of it and telling you guys
what it's all about
so that aside let's get into the video
all right so what we have is a demo of
anti leg it's a live demo and we're
showing you that your click to response
time with radion can be substantially
lower than with the competition so anti
leg is a software optimization what
we're doing is we're making sure that
the CPU work where your input is
registered doesn't really get too far
ahead of the GPU work or you're drawing
the frame so that you don't have too
much lag between when you click Mouse
when you press the key and when you get
the response out on the screen right
that's the idea and what we're showing
here is we've got an Arduino based
latency testing setup this acts as a
keyboard and it has a photo sensor on it
and we have a little bit of software
that responds to the keyboard input by
changing the color of square that's on
the screen that the photo sensor reads
so it's basically looking at the input
to response loop and on the competing
card at about 60 frames per second we've
got an input response loop of about 55
milliseconds whereas over here with
Radeon anti-lag turned on same basic
frame rate we're at 39 milliseconds of
lag so that's the saving of 15
milliseconds almost a full frame at
60fps right 16.7 milliseconds per frame
so that's basically what anti-lag can
get you there's a whole chain of latency
from your mouse to your display but the
bit of it we can control we're able to
reduce quite a bit with the anti lag and
what if we went up to say 200m yes
with it put it come the difference
coming down a little bit well radio an
anti leg is a GPU limited performance
scenario benefit right so whenever you
have a GPU limitation that's when you
get the most benefit from it so if
you're at 2:00 in the frames per second
you may be CPU limited more than GPU
limited the thing is even in those cases
you may run into a spot where your GPU
limited and so that benefit can come
back when you're most needed so this is
a look at Radeon image sharpening versus
D LSS in battlefield 5 what we're doing
here is we're comparing both image
quality and performance as you know with
DL SS they sort of you set it to 4k in
the game but you turn that on and they
render the lower resolution and do some
work edge anti-aliasing upscaling and
then then you get the result what we've
done over here is we've set the game to
run at 2560 by 1440 and we're upscaling
with the GPU upscaler as you would any
time you run a game and lower resolution
than your display and then we've done
the Radeon image sharpening to sort of
draw out the contrast in the images
sharpening happens and then up sampling
afterwards that's actually the correct
order so what you should see is you see
crisper images here than here because I
think we're probably rendering it Chris
like maybe a higher resolution or a
similar resolution plus were sharpening
you should she not lots of nice detail
but at the same time we have less
performance overhead and DL SS has its
own performance overhead that's pretty
substantial in this case though they've
now limited battlefield 5 so you have to
have r-tx on as well and so there's even
more performance hit right so you get
from 40 frames per second to 93 frames
per second but I think that you'll see
in terms of image quality this is
probably a nicer option and in terms of
performance I don't think there's any
question so here we are now we're
running the RCX
2060 in Far Cry 5 I think it is vs. the
RX 5700 this is a 1440p high settings so
we're going to quickly go over now to
the results when this Ben
Mark's finished and see how they compare
but I'm also going to quickly change it
down to 1080p and see how those results
scale so we can see the difference
between 1080p and 1440p scaling quickly
for you guys on these two GPUs
alright brother what do you think of the
5700 X 250 780 has some promising and
assuming I am these presentations
accurate some promising reduction in
power requirement I'm a little saddened
that the loss of some of the
overclocking features for extreme
overclocking I'll talk about that more
later but the BIOS is locked
waiting for information on the power
stages but the GPU itself sounds like it
should be shouldn't be promising
compared to Vega especially because
you're looking at 40 C use versus 64 and
they saw a performance increase in a
power reduction so I'd say that's that's
looking promising 700 XT okay me if
they're going at a different direction
the architecture looks interesting I
have to play with one I don't know it's
interesting how much emphasis they put
on how different it is from GCN like
they went out of their way to make sure
that we understood that this is
something that a lot of work has gone
into and it's not GCN
it looks like it's gonna be well I mean
everything depends on pricing which we
don't know so it looks like it's a cool
product but everything depends on
pricing in terms of like will they sell
a million or ten million are you gonna
free a little I probably will just to
test it but you should don't pray for
her are you gonna pre-order the 5700 XT
no I think so far we've got to see
reviews but it's looking really good
it's gonna some people are gonna be not
you know twenty atti but what's gonna
make it as price performance I think is
pretty damn good looking like a twenty
seven competitor 2060 they're pitching
it there if that all matches up and the
price is right and PCIA four with Rison
it's like the whole package it's the
whole package and you know it's it's a
good looking good I mean III overall
it's like what can you say you can't you
can't be disappointed unless it's too
expensive
you never pre-order until you see
reviews you always have to worry for
reviews but you know it's I'm pleasantly
I'm confident I mean that the power
looks pretty pretty good you know you
always kind of wish you were the most
badass card in the world but hey you
realistically these are the parts of
people wise so yeah I think so so we'll
see all right oh yeah thanks busy world
let go so this is something we saw at
Computex with the PCIe Gen 4 and that's
essentially just a band with a lot
highest so in this case they're doing a
a K Pro res demo and it essentially
won't stutter on the pci h n4 bus but
when you put it on the pci gen3 because
it's just such a huge resolution it will
then start up on PCIe gen3
obviously having more bandwidth on PCIe
Gen 4 is always a good thing if you're
an 8k video editor so now we're on to
the next demo on this one is the
fidelity FX filter and what this
essentially does is this is a 1440p
monitor and it'll grab an image at 1080p
and then upscale it to 1440p but also in
the process apply sharpening so you
won't get the natural 1440p image but
you will get better than standard 1080p
upscaling
but also getting the performance and
frame rates of 1080p now I am trying
this demo out and it of course doesn't
look as good as 1440p but it doesn't
look bad either so it is a good
compromise if for instance a new game
comes out and you don't want to play it
at a particular fps setting and you want
to get more frames how do you GPU then
you can do that but of course take a
little bit of a quality hit but not much
of a quality hit as opposed to jumping
up to 1440p if that makes any sense and
there's the Radeon 5700 XT in this
actual system right now powering this
so here's the next technology that AMD
has with the Navi GPUs and it's called
DSC or display stream compression and
now I'm gonna move over to Michael who's
going to explain this technology a
little bit better yeah so the monitor
that we have on the left here is running
chroma subsampling in order to achieve
120 Hertz
basically DisplayPort doesn't handle
anything over about 95 Hertz without
going into chroma subsampling which
basically preserves luminance but it
messes up the color so with displaced
stream compression DSC which is what we
have on the right we can go up to 144
Hertz and we can still maintain good
color quality and that's what we're
demonstrating here is basically that now
with the new Navi board we support
display stream compression so it's able
to handle up to 144 Hertz or indeed even
higher and still have it be supporting
10-bit color all the while whereas on
the left here we've got you know 8-bit
color essentially you know as it's going
into chroma subsampling well it's
exclusive to the new knobby for us it is
for right you know Verizon or scuse me
for Radeon and there it all is with the
rx 5700 and the XT now the card itself
got to look at that and it felt like it
was pretty good quality I mean the
reference blower design is there but I
must say in the last few years a lot of
companies have been making the reference
design coolers a lot quieter and in this
case the fan does look a little bit
bigger than usual so you can expect this
thing to be pretty quiet and I saw it in
the test rigs and they even though
they'll prototype models they were
looking pretty good but of course we're
going to wait on the pricing with these
cards that is everything and as I said
before when we're doing some of those
interviews were making jokes about
pre-ordering but basically guys don't
pre-order until these things are on our
test bed and we can give you guys a
proper analysis on how well they perform
not just in price performance but the
overall experience as well some other
important details with the 5700 - and
also the xt is that there won't be on
day one initially cost
AIB partner board cards they will have
the reference design out but they won't
have those custom models until a little
bit later and as gamers Nexus said
before the interviews the V bias is
locked and how this is going to affect
overclocking especially on the cheaper
variant the 5700 we don't know yet until
we're actually able to test these things
I hope it doesn't limit overclocking too
much especially on that cheaper variant
where a lot of people are going to want
to get that simply for a value for money
play and one more thing they did talk
about was rate racing as well they're
gonna have a hardware based rate racing
acceleration but when I heard that and
then I heard that coupled with three
years I sort of kind of shut off so it's
sort of like seems like it's more of a
pipeline thing at the moment that's
going to come later so I wouldn't really
be buying the fifty seven hundred or the
XT for its rate racing abilities just
quite yet
though it is good to see that AMD is not
just focusing on CPUs which I will have
a video coming out a little bit later
about the whole CPU thing especially the
sixteen core that being announced and
it's coming in two months after the
twelve core and all the rest of the SKUs
that are up there so that's a little bit
interesting I think no one expected a
two-month delay I was looking at more of
a six-month delay but of course with
rumors and leaks nothing's ever certain
until it's out of the horse's mouth with
that said we're still getting video and
they're gonna go hard with their
announcement at e3 I mean I think after
AMD stole the short computex
I think it's gonna be a case of at e3
Jensen versus Lisa sue so that's going
to be pretty interesting to see but one
thing regardless of all this and that is
competition as we've always set around
here at IKEA City is a good thing and at
the end of the day we the consumers end
up winning when competition is abound
and without said I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did you know what to
do hit that like button for us also let
us know in the comment section below are
you looking forward to the navi GPUs or
you're looking forward to more the CPUs
from AMD love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and let us know what
you think of the anti lag thing I
actually thought it was pretty cool
gamers could definitely use more
responsiveness in games and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now
by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
