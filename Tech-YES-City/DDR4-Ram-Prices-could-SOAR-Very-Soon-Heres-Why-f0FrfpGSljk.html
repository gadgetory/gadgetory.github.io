bought one in the last few years then
you may be aware of ddr4 Ram prices
being quite literally all over the place
we're at the start of 2017 we started to
see price increases that reached a peak
in January 2018 to that of the likes of
ridiculously overpriced and since then
that we have seen prices come down to
that of historical lows where last week
I've made a video letting you guys know
that if you wanted to get on Zen - and
you're going to buy a new CPU a
motherboard that I thought it was the
best time to get your RAM SSD and power
supplies because after that launch
demand would have increased for a whole
new system build and with that you'd
probably see price increases but since
then something else has happened in
something even worse and that is there's
an event between Japan and South Korea
that could see the material cost for
South Korea Ram manufacturers increase
and that in turn would mean that the end
consumer will unfortunately be paying
more for ddr4 memory but let's take a
look in today's video at what exactly is
going on and more importantly what you
can do about this situation if you're
looking to build a new PC or you need to
buy ddr4 memory
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with
unfortunately one of those videos that
isn't going to be that positive in its
outlook and the thing is with ddr4 and
then even ddr3 RAM pricing and even back
in the day ddr2 RAM pricing these
companies that manufacture this stuff
have been found guilty of colluding to
artificially increase prices and in 2005
Samsung and SK Hynix
were fined massive sums of money because
they were found guilty of doing just
that and fast forward to 2018 the
Chinese government has stated that they
have massive amounts of evidence to
support the claim that this happened
again in recent times especially the
2017 to the start of 2018 era though one
unfolded in the last week is a little
bit different to these previous two
events and also notified of this because
I have a supplier who told me that my
ddr3 ram prices that I bought off them
were really good and that I was lucky
and I got this message a couple of days
ago out of the blue and I was scratching
my head because I said to him okay
what's going on they said Ram prices
have increased massively and there's an
article on WCC F Tech where they stated
that a 16 gigabyte stick of ddr4 memory
in South Korea has gone from $55 to $85
marking a 55% increase that is already
feeling the effects to the ink and shuma
but what exactly happened here was that
the both upper and lower courts in South
Korea ruled in favor for compensation
for wartime victims of Japan back in the
past and so this means that they were
seeking compensation from Japanese
companies and Japan responded by saying
in 1965 they already settled all these
previous debts by making a deal where
they gave South Korea 300 million
dollars in grants and also 200 million
dollars in loans over a preceding
10-year period so in their eyes
they've already settled all the debts
and they don't wish to hear anything
else about this but South Korea has it
that they feel that their victims should
be further compensated so just like a
typical disagreement that gets heated up
Japan has decided to enforce actions on
South Korea
where they're essentially taking them
off the whitelist for their exports and
that is some of these components that
they export to South Korea are used in
the manufacturing of ddr4 memory most
notably fluoride polymide and also
hydrogen fluoride which count for Japan
making roughly 90 and 70% of the global
distribution of exports for these
materials and now they are used in the
manufacturing of ddr3 and ddr4 memory
and so when these prices increased due
to tariffs being implemented from Japan
to South Korea that means that South
Korea will then pass on those cost
increases to guys like me and Australia
people in the US and the UK who want to
buy some ddr3 or ddr4 memory though some
may think that Japan is overreacting to
South Korea's decision but when I spoke
to some of my local friends in Japan the
news outlets are reporting that it's not
only this disagreement apparently of
recent times South Korea has had some
anti sentiment towards Japan and it
seems like Japan has had enough of it
and they're going to respond in the form
of economic penalties though citing the
article from WCC F Tech they state that
some of these ram manufacturers in south
korea should still have stock on hand
for one to two months of production and
so price increases shouldn't flow
through immediately but my thinking is
this is kind of similar to gas prices or
interest rate petrol prices where if you
guys have seen the price of oil hike
suddenly at the bowser will end up
paying the same increase in the
percentage that the oil prices increased
even though that gasoline in that stand
is not the gasoline that was bought on
the free market at those higher prices
and it seems to be the other way around
in favor of the gasoline companies -
when the prices of oil goes down they
don't flow through immediately to the
bowser so in other words companies like
the ram manufacturers and also the
petrol companies like to make money when
they can and they use these things as an
opportunity to get a little bit more
profit in the back pocket and to make
things worse in this regard
currently South Korea account for over
70 percent of the global distribution of
DRAM chips and so what this means is
that yes if this indeed increases the
prices of the manufacturing process in
South Korea
then that will be passed on to all us
folks in the world though what can you
do about it if you want to build a new
system all you need to upgrade more
memory in your system whether it be from
16 gigabytes to 32 gigabytes or you want
to build that new rig with 16 gigabytes
of dual channel memory well my advice to
you guys would be to simply go out and
try and find a deal locally on some ddr3
or ddr4 memory if you can because most
likely people who are selling locally
especially if they're used modules won't
be aware of this news just yet
furthermore you can check out Amazon
sellers or whether you're locally buying
off eBay or whatever marketplace you
usually buy off you can check the prices
there quickly and if they haven't
adjusted yet then I would recommend
buying some of this RAM up right now
before the retailers and the people are
aware of these price increases and then
they will adjust accordingly again
speaking of that gasoline effect but
also when it comes to getting deals a
lot of you guys ask me how I always
constantly get good prices on my stuff
that's because I'm always buying up in
bulk stuff that is cheap at that current
time for instance if power supplies are
really cheap at a given time I'll buy
more than I need because I've know in
the future that I will need more than
one power supply same goes for ddr3
memory ddr4 memory SSDs hard drives and
even cases if you know something is a
good price then and there then
definitely stock up at least if you're
going to be building a new system in the
near future and so the easy way to check
if a price is good is just check its
historical pricing and if you can see
like the ddr4 Ram prices at least as of
a week ago they were pretty much
historical lows hence why I made that
Zen Tube video for you guys encouraging
you to go out and get your gear then and
there except the CPU and motherboard
because I knew there'd be price
increases from demand but what I didn't
know is that there would be price
increases coming from a dispute between
Japan and South Korea
anyway guys with that aside I hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button for us also
let us know in the comments section
below what you think of this whole
situation do you think these DRAM price
increases are going to stay in effect
for a while do you think they're going
to be solved quickly love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always me
personally I don't know I'm not a
fortune
tella but i think due to the way this is
it's a country versus a country these
things take a long time to solve so
unfortunately we could see some price
increases that are prolonged in the D
Ram market but without a side if you
guys are enjoying the content enough and
you want to see at the moment of drops
sub button ring the bell it's down there
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
