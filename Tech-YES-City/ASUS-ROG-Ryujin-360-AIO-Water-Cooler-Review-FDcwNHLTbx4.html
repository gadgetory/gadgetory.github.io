- Welcome back to today's review of
the ROG Ryujin 360 all-in-one
liquid CPU cooler from ASUS.
Or ah-zoos, for the
old-school people out there.
And, straightaway, this is
the best CPU all-in-one cooler
that I've had on the bench here,
but at the same time,
I'm conflicted as well,
because it's also the most
expensive by a long shot!
Currently in America,
this thing costs $320.
If you're in Australia, it costs $399!
So basically 400 Aussie dollars.
So it is very expensive.
But with that said, let's take a look
at the cooling performance, the features,
and also how well
it can cool an Intel i9
9900K at 5 Gigahertz,
which in its own right
puts out 200 watts of heat!
(techno music)
Welcome back to Tech Yes City
and right here, we have the flagship
of the three new-released
CPU coolers from ASUS,
and that is the Ryujin 360.
We've also got the Ryujin
240 and the Rio 240,
which we actually took a
look at, at PAX Australia.
If you guys haven't seen that,
I'll put the video up here for you.
But what it's got now is an OLED screen,
at least on the Ryujin models,
where you can customize that with a JPEG,
or if you've got an ASUS motherboard,
you can then have it read out things
like temperatures,
duty, and also voltages.
So it does serve a
purpose for practicality
and not just bling.
But on the note of features and bling,
we'll talk a little bit about that later
because the most important thing
with a CPU cooler is the performance,
and I am glad to say that this thing
does perform very well.
It did beat out all the
other liquid coolers
that we have here on the test bench,
at least tested with the 9900K.
The H115i Platinum was
my previous favorite,
but when we tested this at
the same ambient temperatures
on the same settings, 25
degree ambient temperature,
this scored, out of the
box, 93 degrees maximum
after 10 minutes of AIDA64,
and then on the maximum fan settings,
it scored 91 degrees.
So out of the box, this thing is tuned
to give you, in my opinion,
the best performance,
as well as the best noise levels.
So I was surprised to see that
it was pretty quiet on load,
but it was scoring some very
impressive temperatures.
When we also put the
thermal imaging camera
up to the radiator itself,
the temperatures going in were
a little bit over 30 degrees,
temperatures coming out were very cool.
So the radiator itself is doing a good job
with those three Noctua fans
of definitely cooling down that water
as it comes in and then goes
back out to the CPU cooler.
Also, looking at the block itself,
it comes pre-applied with thermal paste.
I did change this over to Gelid GC Extreme
and noticed only a 1 degree
drop in temperatures,
so the pre-applied thermal
paste is actually very good
out of the box; you
won't have any hassles.
It also comes included
with installation kits
for both Intel and AMD CPUs,
both on the AM4 and Threadripper lines,
as well as the Z390 and X299 lines.
So it's got all those
high-performing CPU models covered,
also with the hoses on the side,
they're actually quite
thick, they're braided,
and they won't interfere
with RAM clearance as well,
since they do come out
at a 90 degree angle
out of the block.
But I will say that the block
itself is quite massive,
especially when you put
the included magnetic cover
over the top.
So in this case, ASUS are
mounting the Asetek pump
in the block itself,
and then you've got that OLED screen
as well as the RGB bling.
Moving onto the software, in
order to configure things,
they come included with the LiveDash,
all the ASUS AI suite.
If you've got an ASUS motherboard,
you can install the ASUS AI
suite and get the extra features
like the temperature and voltage readouts.
If you're using another motherboard,
then unfortunately you can't
get access to those readouts.
So I would like to see
ASUS change that around
instead of locking it to the ecosystem.
But you can use the LiveDash features
with other motherboards,
and that will enable you
to put a custom logo in,
as well as change the RGB lighting
to a variety of different effects,
my favorite being the cycling,
just slowly cycling through
all the different colors.
Also if you are mounting
this cooler upside-down,
you have the option to
rotate the image 180 degrees
as well as if you don't
like RGB or images at all,
you can turn the OLED
screen off individually
as well as the RGB lighting.
So with the Ryujin 360, it
does have the performance,
however, it does have a hefty price tag,
so if you're a potential buyer,
that's something you've gotta weigh up.
Do you want the best out of an all-in-one?
I mean, for some of this money,
I'm sure you could probably put together
a custom water loop as well.
So it is getting into that territory
of being quite expensive,
and there may be custom options
you may wish to consider,
but at the same time,
it does look very neat,
and it does perform very well,
so ASUS do have that going for them,
as well as the software being
pretty simple and easy to use too,
So you shouldn't have any
problems setting this thing up.
Also, one thing I will critique
is that the noise levels
on this cooler were a little audible
as opposed to, for instance,
the H115i Platinum,
both out of the box and on load,
that was just whisper-quiet,
I couldn't hear that pretty much at all.
The Ryujin is slightly audible
both on load and idle out of
the box with the auto settings.
So, in this case, both the H155i Platinum
and the Ryujin 360, for example,
have a SATA connector for
additional power to the pump,
as well as providing power to the fans
with three PWM controllers
that come included.
So if your motherboard doesn't
have enough fan headers,
and you want those out-of-the-box, stock,
low-noise fan profiles,
you can just use the included
connectors and call it a day,
which in the case of the
9990K at 5 Gigahertz,
this cooler did a very good job.
Anyway guys, that's about
it for today's review
with the Ryujin 360.
If you enjoyed it, then be
sure to hit that like button.
But in a nutshell, very good performance,
comes with a three year warranty,
but does have a very hefty price tag.
And I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.
