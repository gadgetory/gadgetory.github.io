you
welcome back to Tokyo City this is brian
coming to you guys today with a review
of the velocity fire vm 90 mechanical
gaming RGB backlit keyboard i know
that's a lot to get through but let's
get on with the review this keyboard
features an aluminium backplate there
with Koh blue switches which have a
slightly higher actuation point than the
Cherry MX switches so they're not all
that bad even though people tend to
think of them as a cheaper variant and
they actually are cheaper to produce
that higher actuation point will
translate into a bass dick better of a
response time then Terrier mixes would
provide also looking at the RGB LED
lights themselves it looks like they've
gone with a pretty strong LED light here
when I compared that to my as your RGB
keyboard that was slightly brighter and
they also bled a little bit better due
to that gray and silver backplate even
though I will talk about the theme a
little bit now with that black and
silver look it felt as if it had a
champagne gold tinge to it though I must
say I'm not a big fan of the champagne
gold look I would have much preferred
them to have gone with a silver all
silver and black look or an all black
look or even gunmetal grey with the
black there there moving on to the
bottom of the keyboard you've got a big
velocity fire logo with the magnetically
detachable wrist rest there which also
as another logo on the middle of the
keyboard I must say I would have
preferred them to only include one logo
on the keyboard and gone away with that
logo on the magnetically detachable
wrist rest there moving on to the
customization of this keyboard the LED
lights can be programmed either via
hardware or via software it is your
choice I prefer to just program this
thing via Hardware even though the
software allows you to unlock a little
bit more things like response times and
polling rates which I found didn't make
a difference when I was testing it
pretty critically in gaming and also on
the desktop
I also found when I did the custom
colors in the software they really
differentiated a lot from what I was
seeing on camera and you guys can take a
look for yourselves and be the judge but
I thought yeah the software wasn't
really worth having especially after it
crashed after a few minutes of using it
so that wasn't a great sign as well
earlier the side of this keyboard
they've got a USB 2 out there and also a
very thick one point 8 meter braided
cable which extends into two different
USB prongs there which you can use to
power up the keyboard and data
transmission on one and then also
another one there for an additional
power
source say for instance if you're using
this with a laptop with weak USB power
outs looking under the rear of the
keyboard there it's got the specs and
the model of the keyboard it's also got
four rubberized feet in all corners
which stick to the desk or any surface
that you put it on really well and also
besides that you've got an elevation
there another layer of adjustment if you
want to have this keyboard flat or a
little bit elevated off the surface so
now we've got the specs out of the way
let's take a look at my subjective
opinion on this keyboard is it worth the
money now when I initially did this
review I was going to give it a not
recommended buy because it was $120
though then I meant I messaged the
manufacturer and I said look this review
is going to be pretty much negative they
then emailed me straight away back and
they said we've dropped it down to $80
and I just said Wow okay I've got to go
recut my video now because that $80
I think this keyboard is a very good buy
especially when you've got keyboards
that are over twice the price and they
provide only a little bit more a lot
more on the software all beard but a
little bit more on the hardware level so
is that worth twice the price that is up
to you guys to decide though I will say
in essence I like this keyboard the
build quality was solid those college
blues are absolutely fine though I will
say that they were a little bit quieter
and softer than the azo RGB keyboard
that I had here which uses also KLH
switches as well I'll let you guys have
a listen
so I'm not exactly sure why there's a
big difference in sound and the feel of
the keys maybe they used a cheaper and
lighter key cap on the velocity file
than they did on the Ezio also maybe the
base of the PCB is a little bit thinner
as compared to the Azio so I will say
that I do prefer typing on the a zero
slightly better than I do prefer typing
on this though in essence it doesn't
make a whole lot of a difference they're
both great keyboards with backlighting
that you will enjoy if you've got the
money so even though I prefer those
things on the Ozzie I will say that the
RGB lighting I thought was much brighter
and the or effect or the bleed effect on
this keyboard was much better than the a
0 so that is kudos to the philosopher
for getting that right some last-minute
things that I will touch on you also get
a orange key caps there for your wah sad
and also your function key and that
function key does look eerily similar to
a logo from another tech tuber that I
know of so I'm not entirely sure if they
copied that or not but you guys be the
judge of that one we've also got a key
cap puller included there which is
standard on a mechanical keyboard and
you've also got the ABS plastic on the
key caps as opposed to that expensive
PBT and honestly you can't expect them
to include expensive key caps on an
$80.00 keyboard that being said though
after using this keyboard for about a
month now I have found that the keys
aren't wearing as much as other
keyboards that I've used in the past so
they don't get that real glossy shine to
them very quick though to sum it all up
over $100 I can't recommend this
keyboard under $100 I can and coming in
to $80 it is very competitive at this
price even though I didn't like a few
little things on it overall it is a
pretty good keyboard so if you guys want
to get this keyboard I'll put the Amazon
affiliate link in the description below
it's $80 at the moment friggin great
price you'll also be supporting the
