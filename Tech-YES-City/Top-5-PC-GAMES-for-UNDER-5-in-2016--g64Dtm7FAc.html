released lately that are just simply
overpriced I thought I'd give you guys
some games from the past that I love and
that can be had for under five dollars
in 2016
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with my
top five games that can be had under
five dollars now if you're a pc gamer
you're going to appreciate these games
or if you haven't played these games
then i highly recommend that you buy
them and have a lot of fun with them
with that being said let's get on with
it
coming in at number five is fallout 3
this game can be had for a couple of
dollars and it offers a great experience
not to mention there are a shit ton of
mods out there at the moment that'll
make this game look better and it'll
give you one hell of a gameplay
experience especially for two dollars
coming in at number four is swim rate
and then you can pick this up for just
under five dollars and it offers a very
fun experience with a good storyline
that keeps you engaged in the whole way
through the game it also is sort of like
a toggle between first-person and
third-person so you can play both genres
if you like one or the other and if you
enjoy the original then you can go out
and get the sequel which has been
recently released on PC as well I mean
at number three is the Elder Scrolls
Skyrim you can currently pick this game
up for around about $3 and honestly at
this price it is a bargain if you
haven't played it already it offers a
lot of gameplay and a very in-depth
storyline as well as having a lot of
mods which you can use to make the game
either look better or play better coming
to number two is Metro 2033 Redux
edition which is kind of like the
director's cut and honestly if you like
FPS games you'll absolutely love this
game it has a very interesting story
that engages you right from the start as
well as having a survival kind of feel
to the game so it's not just your
typical run-and-gun FPS it's actually
requires a lot of strategy and the best
thing this game can be had for as little
as three dollars and it also has an
accompanying expansion last light for
another three dolls so if you enjoy the
original you can get the sequel for very
cheap as well coming in at number one is
Wolfenstein the new order this is the
remake of the old Wolfenstein series
however it is a lot better this time
around and really goes in-depth with a
great storyline that really captured me
from the get-go now for under $5 this
game is an absolute steal and you will
love it if you haven't played it already
it kind of goes back in history and sort
of changes
and gives you a what-if scenario that is
a real eye-opener in my opinion and the
best thing is is if you like the new
order then you can actually go out and
get the prequel which came after the
original release of the new order for
about six dollars and that'll give you a
lot more gameplay and another enjoyable
storyline as well so that's my top five
games for under five dollars now I know
there's gonna be a lot more good games
out there on the PC that are very cheap
so if you know of these good games can
be sure to share them in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can and if you like this
video please give it a big fat thumbs up

get these games then just click on those
links and you'll be also helping me in
the process anyway that's it for me
