opportunities that other people get say
in Australia practically I just found
out now that everyone finishes working
like 4:00 4:30 at that you'll see the
common trait among these four business
is exactly what I'm doing here today and
that's sharing these PCs giving back
they wanted to share these days
it's been a long time since I started
this giveaway initiation where I wanted
to give back five pieces that I built up
to five underprivileged kids and since
then there has been a lot of Hoops and
hurdles to go through I visited so many
different schools and they just didn't
want to accept my Pacey's and finally
one teacher from a school here on the
Gold Coast reached out to me and said
look I'd love to accept these pcs and
make sure they go into a good home and
then they can help people out who are
underprivileged and I said to myself
sure thing and at this time we built up
five random pcs some of them were
entry-level some of them were mid-range
but I've decided since then since things
have changed quite a bit and I've been
hustling some really good deals that I
would upgrade each and every one of
these pcs 2rx 570s they're also getting
fourth gen AI fives brand new hard
drives brand new power supplies and also
thanks to Coolermaster they've supplied
five cases here with RGB bling so big
thanks to Coolermaster for supporting
this as well because when I spoke to the
rep here Josh in Australia he said look
we've got to get in on this I'm just so
happy because people my local community
are going to be happy once they get
these pcs without a slab we've got a lot
of PC building to do right here because
I've got to actually present these
tomorrow but in a nutshell there was so
many people that entered for these
giveaway pcs and I had to select four
winners out of 14 people that were the
finalists and on top of that I'm also
giving away an additional PC to the
school so everyone can use that at that
school if they want to do other stuff
than just play games I'm guessing since
it'll be at the school it'll probably
have no games installed whatsoever but
out of the 14 winners selecting the top
four it was really tough and what I
ended up deciding on was not really who
needed the PC the most out of the 14
people but I looked at who was going to
use that PC no need to help themselves
but also help other people and so the
four finalists really stood out in that
they wanted to share the PC and also use
that
to say help their little brother or also
help out other things or other people in
the community so that's basically how I
selected the winners but with that said
let's build these pcs up over a time
lapse since it's gonna take a while and
then tomorrow I'm gonna be delivering
these to the school and I didn't even
know how this is going to go down but by
the time you guys see this video it
would have already gone down so let's do
this
and here we are now with all the five
pcs completed on the desk and they're
all looking pretty schmick but we still
have to install windows and I still have
to do stress tests each and every one of
these pcs to make sure that they're
running okay so when the kids get them
they're gonna have a big smile on their
face and you'll be ready to start
playing games will do whatever they want
to do on these pcs it's now the next day
we've got the five pcs all ready to go
all stress tested now one of the pieces
did have a problem and I had to then
swap it out I'm putting an X 58 and a
six cozy on in there twelve gigabytes of
RAM so let's say I'm giving it a bit of
an upgrade without a side we got about
half an hour to pack these things into
the car and get on out of here but I've
also got to thank someone as well for
helping out doing these giveaways and
you guys may have seen him in a vlog
before SH and for the fam that's his
nickname and yeah it's just been a big
hand
building these pcs and also he's lending
us his car today because I've got a very
small sports car that won't fit in five
pcs but that aside to show him some love
in the comments guys this also came in
yesterday I 720 608 P system we'll talk
about that in another video
here is the stage are going to do some
public speaking which shouldn't be a
problem and then after that so basically
what's going on here is that we're gonna
draw the winners out and they don't even
know they're being drawn out so there's
that element of surprise that is gonna
come into this giveaway here today so
it's gonna be pretty exciting but after
we announce the winners will then go
backstage and talk to them about how
they feel about winning a gaming PC so
this is all going down very soon super
exciting let's get this done
so we've now got these four pcs and then
the one over there we're gonna be given
that way that's the schools now and
we're just a quick interview with the
students and see how they feel about
winning these pcs oh yeah it's great I
love it there's great pcs thank you very
much Brian
I really appreciate it's gonna be great
for my business thank you so much for
the feces and can't wait to get home and
start gaming thanks for PC um I'm gonna
build a like a house and I'm going to
use a program to help designer yeah I
never felt so a motivated that get these
pcs you know I'm gonna start my youtube
channel gardening there hope to pull and
I'm gonna do other sort of things like
hey gaming farming doing other stuff
like walking down the street back in
like a gulag and music and oh hello over
there how's your day is the day and I
actually a bit like Deadpool and some of
my series I plan on something really big
how much money I can get and yeah that's
it so I can subscribe don't subscribe to
teach to eat subscribe to PewDiePie so
there's the pcs they're all given away
and I was just super exciting saying
these for students just get really
excited about winning these species
though like that was shocked and they
were just really excited and just kept
talking as well it's just so good really
good to give back to the community that
I grew up in that's the beautiful Gold
Coast but she's gonna be head back to
the studio now and then sort of conclude
this whole giveaway
and here we are now guys concluding this
giveaway and I'm gonna say it was just
an awesome journey that honestly took a
lot longer than I expected but I'm kind
of glad in hindsight that it did happen
this way because now that I think about
it the original pieces that I built up
they were all different and when I saw
the looks on the students faces today
they all got the same PC so I was glad I
did that same pcs with the same specs so
there was no bickering and sort of you
know picking or favoritism or anything
like that so the next giveaway I do will
sort of be the same structure I think in
that I'll just help my local community
the Gold Coast and keep giving back to
the beautiful city that I grew up in and
I absolutely love this place and when I
did the speech in the assembly I just
pretty much mentioned the same thing
home is home and I'm sure a lot of you
guys around the world will agree on this
and lastly before I get on out of here
thank you guys so much for all the
support you've given tech yes City the
channel itself this is just my way to
give back thank you guys so much each
and every one here for your generosity
also your watch time and without you
guys this channel wouldn't exist and
these in turn these giveaways wouldn't
exist so this is just a great thing
where I'm sort of passing on the love
and you guys have shown me and also big
thanks to Coolermaster and I mean that
bling especially for students they're
going to absolutely love that I'm sure
of it so I think the PCs we've put
together here we're absolute winners the
rest of the parts did come out of my own
back pocket but like I said in the
previous vlogs leading up to this final
giveaway the channel has been going very
well especially in the last year and so
once I started realizing that things my
hard work was paying off I started to
want to give that back to my local
community though now it's time for me to
get back to what I do best and that's
making tech yes videos for you guys if
you enjoyed this one then be sure to hit
that like button also let us know in the
comments section below did you enjoy the
series and also if you've got some
stories of your own about giving back to
your local communities because this way
the best thing as I said before about
these giveaways is I know that a hundred
percent of the proceeds are going to
people in need that's what I wanted to
make sure and I've just been really
satisfied with how this is all turned
out and with us said
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
