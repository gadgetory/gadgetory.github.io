from the creative booth here in Las
Vegas Nevada and the first of the
technology on display here at creators
lab is their x5 headphone technology
this essentially goes all the way from
mono up to 7.1 and it's a new form of
digital signal processing and it will
really bring your headphones to life
like I tried the demo they had going on
here which had two forms of customizing
a profile for you first of all you can
snap a picture of your ears and then
snap a picture of your face and then
through the Android app it'll then
profile the sound for you but they've
also got another level above that which
will then do a full sweep from all
different angles and then customize
another profiles which I managed to do
luckily get two profiles and I tried
them both out and they were phenomenal
it really did sound like you're in a
room with natural surround sound it was
that good so for those who love the
old-school cmss
technology this will definitely be a
level above that sounding extremely good
and just bringing everything to life
even mono sounds on some music or
interviews it just really brought the
music to life I was blown away by what
this could do now in terms of using this
with different headphones headsets its
supports pretty much anything you're not
locked into creatives own lineup of
headsets whether it be the h6 or other
headphones they had on display you can
plug in whatever brand you want you can
also use it with different consoles
Nintendo switch ps4 and Xbox one x for
example as well as the main point being
that it's focused for PC users so for
instance if you're playing World of
Warcraft and you just want to bring
things to life this little amp will
definitely do that though what else is
on display here at this booth let's go
through and take a look
well thank you take your city and right
beside me here is a new sound card that
is going to be released in March this
year and it's the a9 if you guys
remember back in the past I did a review
on the a5 and I thought it was really
good this is a step above that though
you've got replaceable OPM so you've got
a signal noise ratio of 129 decibels out
input as well has a hundred and thirty
decibel signal noise ratio so it's very
impressive
this also has an external unit that does
more than just be an external unit that
you used too it's got an XLR input with
48 volt power as well so to support XLR
mics condenser microphones so it's
really designed to not just be the next
level for people who want awesome sound
coming out of their computer but also
for people who are streaming and need to
get a good input as well in terms of
input now but you got RCA as well as
manual input output and optical in and
optical out as well as a mini HDMI a cm
link to your external unit inside the
case that finally fixed the power
connector instead of using an old dirty
molex connector they're now using a PCIe
connector which if you're using a
graphics card with two PCIe eight pins
or one is a six pin you can then splice
that off to the sound card like they've
done in the example here which does look
pretty sleek so this is gonna come in at
around $299 and of course you can
customize it the way you want and it's
got the ESS saber nine zero three eight
DAC built-in so it's deafening to please
people with 32 bits 384 kilohertz
support next up here for you I've got
under $100 and you want a good sound bar
they've got the stage 2.1 which has just
been released this has HDMI support as
well from the TV if it's got a HDMI out
you can plug in it does go pretty loud
these sub sounds pretty good is coming
in a $79 and it's just a real solid
solution for the money
it also has plug-and-play for the USB
mp3 sounds so you just plug that in and
get some mp3 tracks banging on your
soundstage bar though if you're even on
more of a budget and you want to save
some money but you want something that's
portable then they've got the stage air
which is coming in a 39 box it's a just
a 2.0 solution it's portable has up to 6
hours battery life it doesn't have the
HDMI support however but
smaller lighter and it is pretty
impressive for 39 bucks and the last
option we've got here for people who
love speakers is the pebble plus and
this is going to be released roughly in
June it's a 2.1 solution it's going to
improve on the original pebble which has
had a price dropped from $29 to $19 and
this is going to be released at $29 over
that and it just sounds really good as
well as looking stylish for a modern
desktop I guess that's the theme going
on here so if you're on a budget and you
want something that sounds good with 2.1
a little bit of bass as well as having
speakers that are closer to your ears
with the design then these will
definitely deliver that it's also USB
powered as well so you won't get any
clutter you can take it with you on the
road if you need us portable 2.1
solution and it's got an auxilary in for
those who just like the old-school
method of just plugging audio in and
getting some beats cracking so that
about wraps it up here for the creative
booth at CES 2019 the amp as I said
before it was phenomenal blew me away
and they're actually in development for
making this Wireless at the moment with
a deck that will support up to four
headsets in a wireless sort of
configuration that's a pre-configured
set in terms of release dates and
pricing and specs they haven't really
announced that it's all in concept but
the amp is available right now 150 bucks
that's definitely my favorite take out
of today as well as that stage sound bar
which sound impressive to my ears the 89
that's a sound card if you guys are
interested in that and you're going into
streaming now with a phantom powered
microphone then that's definitely
something to consider if you just want
the absolute best quality hopefully I
can take a look at that for you guys in
March when it's released and give you
guys more in depth specifications with
obviously frequency response and all the
other jazz that you come to expect from
a tech yes city review and we guys hope
you enjoyed today's video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
us know in the comments section below
what was your favorite part of today's
booth love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always don't catch on
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
