back to the channel of tech yes City
this time around we have docked into USA
Los Angeles and I'm gonna be doing the
first parts hunt here this is the first
part of the series but it's going to be
a lot different than what you used to
we've got the Camaro here we even picked
this up for a deal for a $30 a day we do
we turn a lot of different places in the
u.s. here so make sure you sub with
notifications on and we're gonna be
vlogging hopefully meeting up with a lot
of different tech tubers as well because
CES is around the corner with that all
side let's jump in the Camaro and go
hunt some deals kind of reminds me of
that scene from Robocop
so first things first with LA we're
gonna want to put together a PC that is
phenomenal value for money the only way
we're gonna be able to do this is to get
deals now I'm actually told that it's
pretty hard to get deals in LA there's a
lot of different hustles around here so
we're gonna be looking for sort of like
the obscure bargains and then putting
them all together and seeing if we can
make something that we can flip and make
for a profit on the road at least in LA
and then when we move on to Vegas we'll
try and do the same there make another
PC flip that and then when we go to
Texas do the exact same thing so looks
are going to be doing six different
videos for you guys based around used
pots but with that said let's take a
look on the market and see what is
available
so straightaway coming up with some of
the deals here we've found a gtx 10:50
TI and we've messaged a guy and he's
willing to take a hundred cash pickup
now with any buyer and seller if you're
a seller you know how easy it is to get
cash pickup you don't have to do
anything the person's gonna come to you
they're gonna give you cash it's the
best way of buying something as well
because it's going to be the least
amount of hassle for the sell however in
this case he is about an hour away from
me so if I'm going up that way in the
next two days I want to get value out of
going up there so what I told him was
I'll put down a $20 deposit so he can
take it off the market place and then
I'll come pick it up and pay the
remainder cash so I gave him already a
$20 deposit through PayPal and so he's
agreed to that and he's also giving me
he's address so he's not gonna hose me
because he's giving me his exact address
guys sounds like as well he's a normal
person he's not looking to host someone
so always I scope this out with the
language scammers will usually speak a
different code plus on the Facebook
marketplace they'll usually have
negative ratings so next how to do we're
looking here is for a del ASA or either
a Lenovo om one that will definitely
support a gtx 1050 TI now in this case
we'll have to replace the case and the
power supply since they're usually
inefficient and also on top of that we
may have to add an SSD but if we pick up
one of these for around 100 to 150
depending on the specs and more already
be in a really good spot however from
here on in we're still gonna find a deal
I have messaged a few people they're
still gonna get back to me but we're
gonna do since I'm staying actually
close to micro centers I'm gonna go
there right now check out what deals
they got on power supplies and also
cases
so we just finished up now in micro
Center ended up getting a 500 watt
cooler master power supply for about
thirty five US dollars and so that's got
two PCIe eight pins there was a lot of
extra garbage in there like a lot of
power supplies that are devoid or ones
that were just too overpriced for the
budget that we're going on but they also
had a a 120 GB SSD for twenty dollars
and we picked that up as well but the
cases I couldn't find any hustle
specials in there so we're looking for
something with RGB bling comes pretty
cheap but the cheapest they had was the
cooler master five and that will had RGB
fans obviously but it'll 65 bucks which
is definitely gonna pick up our budget a
lot however some good news is right now
is that there is a 1070 Ti going for 250
bucks pickup and it's not far from here
so when you jump in the Robocop special
and we're gonna head there and pick it
up
also on other thing I've quickly got to
do since I don't have my tools on hands
I've got to go to a dollar store pick up
a screwdriver and also a USB charger for
my phone because I forgot to charge it
and we're on the road
so we just finished up with 1070 TI and
it was amazing we got that for 250 cash
but while I was there I also asked if he
had anything else around and sure enough
he had an old I 5 760 with a gigabytes
of RAM 1 terabyte hard drive and a power
supply that wasn't too bad as a power
man housefly with two 12-volt 16 amp
lines so this power supply should be
good to run a 1050 TI for example in it
now if you didn't mind the case in the
power supply this thing would be in
total one hundred and fifty five dollars
for a full-fledged gaming PC but after
that we'll try and give it some bling as
well LEDs and all that stuff and then
see what we can make out of this but I'm
a little bit parched and also hungry so
I'm gonna head in for a quick feed
thrown my way back to the hotel but a
deal for a case just pulled up this is a
half with red LED fans 20 bucks so
that's an absolute bargain considering
the prices of cases here actually pretty
expensive at the moment but we've also
stopped off quickly now at a die so so
queerly going to run in and see if we
can get some cheap alcohol wipes because
that's definitely gonna help anything
used when we come into it and if it's
dirty
we completely give it a just a phase one
tear gas lovin
whoa so we just got back into the hotel
and it was a crazy day for hustling
parts this is only day one first day in
LA and the amount of deals we picked up
was just crazy so first of all we got
that half the last deal and this is a
guy named Peter and he was staying
really close to where we were so we
picked up the case for $20 and then I
asked him when he was bringing the case
out I was like dude I need some thermal
paste you have any spare thermal paste
and he just went back inside his house
and then he came out with a cooler
master a 50 air cooler and also some
thermal paste and I just said thanks a
lot so he just gave us that on top of
the case for 20 bucks and the good thing
about that cases it's got another red
LED fan on top of the one already
included so this is gonna be some real
good bling on top of the price
performance so that deal was just
incredible also going through the other
list of deals we got before that we got
a 1070 TI for two hundred and fifty
dollars a I 5 PC which we got for $55 at
the same place so that brought the total
to 305 from Brad and then tracking back
before that we were at Micro Center and
we've got a power supply and SSD for 35
and twenty bucks respectively and that's
really gonna add value if we get a sort
of more higher-end parts with that 1070
and put it in the case and then of
course we've got the screwdriver and
alcohol wipes for $2 50 so the total of
this left is to three hundred and eighty
two dollars 50 so absolutely crazy price
performance that we've got so far but
the thing is we don't really have the
components to make a really good bill
just yet because tomorrow I've booked up
some awesome deals one of them which
I'll put a deposit on that's a 1050 Ti
and then another which we have organized
so I'm not sure like they said they're
definitely gonna take my offer which is
$180 for an i-5 6400 a gigabytes of ddr4
memory motherboard cooler and two
terabyte hard drive and if we get that
deal we're gonna put that with the 1070
I and so they're going to meet us at 6
p.m. tomorrow night now this would
that way and then that hopefully will be
another deal on the bag with the
temperature T I'm ready to start after
that putting together two custom gaming
pcs so not just one since the price
performance here is phenomenal we're
gonna be putting together two of these
things so that's just how it goes sort
of like I'm the day one I'm picking up
all these pieces and they're just really
good bargains and then day two we're
gonna pick up the other two pieces and
then let's make really good builds on
two ends of the spectrum that's the
middle range and also the budget range
and then we'll be able to flip those and
hopefully make a bit of profit too and
I'll document the process in that but
this is pretty much the end of day one
in LA it's been a really cool day I went
clothes shopping as well when to some
other places did a few things I just
really enjoying myself here I also went
and took a look at Fry's Electronics and
a Best Buy as well Fry's was a bit of a
bust I didn't really have anything there
that micro Center didn't have a better
value and then Best Buy actually had
some really good deals going on
peripherals I mean I do have to double
check the prices my phone was pretty low
on battery but I went there at nighttime
but there are also uh yeah
sporting some pretty good deals on
peripherals if you needed like a headset
or a new Mouse for example they weren't
too bad anyway that wraps up day one of
today's vlog in LA this is the first
part of the USA tour have been so far
la is looking like it's got some really
good deals for the people out there
saying la was really difficult to hustle
it's I've only been here for a day and
well half a day really have anything
just jumped on my phone this morning and
we're just going through it just getting
some really really awesome deals better
than that that I'd get in Oz on some of
these parts and make sure you stay tuned
for day two as well where we're going to
be getting those two promised deals on
the 1050 Ti and also the whole life 5
6400 system and on top of that I'm gonna
be on the road looking for more always
looking for more hungry for it we'll
check it out today mainly the deals came
from Facebook marketplace I did check
out Craigslist did have some ok things

cracking for a lot of these ones that I
got
