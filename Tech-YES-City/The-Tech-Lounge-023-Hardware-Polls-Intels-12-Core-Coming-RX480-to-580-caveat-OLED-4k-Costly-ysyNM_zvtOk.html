lounge I hope y'all doing mighty fine
out there and i'm joined by kev from tax
showdown how you doing man then great
brian i just been getting through a lot
of my rising 5 testing my delayed rising
5 testing because it took so long for us
here in New Zealand to get them and be
doing some my rx 570 testing also what
about you bro yeah just been getting
through heaps of videos the backlog is
almost finished so i'm going to sydney
on wednesday to meet up for the AMD
event and also steve from harbor and box
will be there so that'll be pretty cool
so if anyone's in sydney and they're
into tech just send us a message on
Twitter and probably meet up afterwards
for some beers and whatnot a few guys
are in sydney and new tech enthusiasts
so looking forward to that and then
after that we'll go to the use pc build
for the month i can't wait for that
there's going to be a lot of other
different videos coming so really cool
what's coming up and also just got part
two done of the r7 700 k vs are seven
1700 also going to be doing the
multiplayer benchmarks i'm probably
going to spend a bit more time after
that because i want to go more in-depth
even more in-depth like i was going
pretty in debt films doing some
real-world testing but i want to go more
in-depth than that because i was playing
a bit of Han last night and um this is a
game that I played religiously like you
know back when it was first released and
of course back in 2011-2012 wells I went
pretty high on the MMR rating and I was
playing with some really top guys on on
those servers and dude the the all 77
it's certainly no no the 1800 x it like
the frame rates are just pretty low like
I remember my frame rates always being
over a hundred FPS in that game and that
was on the four core of course it's a
single threaded game whatnot but this
was on like a the six core ivy bridge
cpu
and I remember having just really high
frame rates all the time on that game
and now I'm like getting like 80 FPS and
stuff like that and it's kind of like
hmm so I might be going back and doing
some yes I might be going back and doing
some testing with like maybe do some
different testing like turn off branch
prediction and stuff like that and see
how it affects games because i don't
think the branch prediction which is
being used especially in productivity
tasks i don't think it's really helping
the gaming a whole lot especially
multiplayer games which is where i know
a lot of people are playing multiplayer
games i'd say majority of people
actually play games we play games online
you look at csgo dota 2 and all these
other games and yeah you see is risin is
that it's like Kelly's heel could that
be its weak point is competitive online
gaming so that's something to look into
part through a probably the most eye
opening of the whole comparison but yea
RS 570 I got one in and just haven't
even looked at it yet I've actually got
a ride I've actually got it like right
here so here it is thats the gigabyte
horas they don't really it's a minor
tiger yeah they're doing a pretty good
job man they're doing a pretty good job
little solid card and of course we'll be
talking about the RX 570 and 580 today a
little bit as we go along but do you
have any other use I've been talking too
much no it's just done i'll be bringing
out a video talking about the
overclocking difference of the RX 570
compared to the 470 so both of them and
quite interesting um they're the most
interesting thing without giving too
much way of the video already is um the
stock power is so much higher on the RX
570 um you I mean the TDP went up by 30
watts even more bizarre is the fact that
gigabyte that recommended psu actually
went down by 50 watts so I don't know
what's going on there um but yeah if you
actually look a bit deeper you can see
that it's actually in terms of
millivolts in its highest state the 470
would usually sit at about
thousand raised the 570 sitting at 1150
so definitely with these extra clock
speeds they have up the power which is
something you need to keep in mind but
all these ones that non-reference you
won't have the power issues we had with
the reference one because if you guys
remember back that was the it we had a
six pin power connector which gives you
75 and they needed a drawer 75 through
the slot and it was actually drawing
more than it should have but all these
non-reference ones are all eight pens
now so it's not really a problem with
that on 150 watt TDP a lot of people
forgot about that issue back when the
480 first launched and we were all
testing your mouth well we was we'll get
into this topic straight away then since
we're already talking about and this is
the flashing of our X 480 s25 80s and
some people have been recommending and
some people like be careful my advice
would be straight I haven't tried it yet
but my advice would be to be very
careful especially if you haven't
flashed a graphics card before of course
there's if you've got another graphics
card on hand you have two PCIe 16 speeds
lots of whatever and you've got you've
got an onboard graphics on your cpu you
don't really have to fear too much like
if you just keep your original v bios so
if you flash it and it breaks just flash
it back and you'll be okay but of course
it raises the question of course i think
the RX 5 series is going to be a better
bin especially on the 580 line i'm
seeing clock speeds going into 1.4
gigahertz now my rx 480 never went even
close i think got to like 1300 and 60
megahertz so if i try to flash it man i
know the results already the thing would
just not boot up it would just not work
so again if you've got a RX 480 that can
clock pretty high then the bios update
may be beneficial because it'll also
make the timings more tighter on the
memory and stuff like that so there will
be things that you can benefit from an
upgrade but again if you're like a guy
who lay mu has a pretty bad r x 480 in
terms of overclocking then I probably
wouldn't recommend it as you just have a
bit of panic of course you can of course
when you're editing the boss you can
down
clock the clocks and you can yeah it's
so that it's good a bit of but on that
note again just be careful I might you
know maybe if you guys want to see a
guide I can do that and maybe because
I've got a bad are X 480 it'd probably
be a good guide and that a lot of people
would be low-key if he's got one of the
worst rs4 80s out there then we can
follow his guidance or to have success
so hmm but on that they don't know
that's interesting yeah it's no I just
want to say that I i personally wouldn't
I mean you can if you want but I'm
tested the 570 and the 470 the exact
same models from gigabyte and there's
literally like two frames in it on
average two or three so it's not really
the only thing good i would say about
the 570 from what i've seen so far is
the fact that with that extra power it
gives you extra overclocking Headroom um
but it's bad from now so bubbly sorry
you say a few frames what are we talking
percentage-wise like I haven't done it
in terms of percentage i just knew
through all my benchmarks i ran the
average frame difference for all the
games and synthetics and otherwise our
it worked out to be about two or three
because the clock speeds there on the
two gigabyte ones it's only a I believe
14 megahertz from memory different on
the core and 400 megahertz on the memory
so the memory actually is a decent jump
up from 6600 to 7,000 megahertz but
nothing much you know that's not much so
that would only give you 2 or 3 FPS on
average at 1080p um yeah it's it's just
one of those things that i don't know i
mean you can definitely do it but i
think even in the article they say
there's probably not going to be worth
it for the vast majority of people
you're just probably better off
overclocking the year for 80 or 470 as
high as you possibly can I look through
guides you do need to tune man
annually the voltages on them I'm just
using that power slider you'll be very
limited you actually need to go and
raise it up to like 1,100 millivolts um
across all states is a good way that's
what I did I mean your power consumption
will be kind of crazy but you know if
you're wanting to get maximum
performance you won't care about that
and then you can really harness a lot of
power out of it start getting up to sort
of 13 50 megahertz type area may be
higher if you get a really good one so
that's what I would recommend doing
instead that's where you'll get the most
out of well one thing I've noticed about
the RX for 70s especially compared to
the 4 80's is that they always clock
lower this is in what I've found as well
I've had a heap of four 70s come through
and they just don't go anywhere near the
clocks of the 480 and this is on pretty
much a bad for 80 so I'm wondering this
time around as well I forgot where I
pulled up the article I think it's this
one here so we got the RX 570 s5 series
I sku x2 from h-i us or his or her and I
wish they'd just call it her that'd be
pretty cool it's like yeah 570 her 580
his big brother little sister but um
we've got here the boost clocks here are
lower on the 570 like significantly
lower right and then of course they got
their 5 80's roaring soaring roaring up
to fourteen hundred and thirty mega
hertz so this again it looks like the 5
80's even compared to the 57 teaser
again that possibly that better been of
model and i had a lot of people telling
me like look dude if you can get a 480
it's only an extra twenty bucks even if
it's the four gigabyte model over the
470 and I kind of after seeing a lot of
these different results and the way
these card manufacturers are bringing
out these 5 70 s and 5 80's I'd probably
have to agree maybe if you guys are
looking and you're seriously looking and
you're looking at pulling the trigger on
that one hundred and sixty dollar RX 470
maybe have a look at the time what the
cheapest are X 480 is going for or and
in this case if you've got a 570 versus
of 580 and they got the same amount of
vram maybe think about getting the 58
that entry level one because it looks
like it's going to overclock better it
looks like it's going to actually be a
better bin so yeah exactly one thing
they say in this article which I do
agree with which is perplexing is why do
they raise the core speeds up so high
like 1430 in this case but then they
leave the memory hat stock you'd think
that they would if i remember back to
the 290s in the three 90s for that
matter um and 390 X's and 290 X's they
would the non reference models a lot of
them would have up to memory as well so
it was sort of like they would up the
core by 50 megahertz whatever over
reference and then the up the memory
like 200 400 600 megahertz as well it
just seems strange a that they'll bring
their core boost speed up so much but
then leave the memory alone and when we
know this Headroom to go higher it's not
like these are fully stretch they can't
go we know that they can go higher so I
think I might know the answer let me put
on my thinking glasses here away wow
these are legit glasses holy okay the
answer is they're using cheap memory and
no one really looks at memory speeds so
there you go you've got to save some
money somehow dude so put in some cheap
memory bank don't put in the you know
the expensive stuff putting the cheap
stuff and then just put it at standard a
key bits per second Booya yeah ok so it
next topic we wanted to talk about here
is the hardware pole so you pull this up
you got a hard way Paul now I did
actually really this is coincidence till
I did a poll on Twitter so I beat you
guys they did this 10 hours ago I did
mine maybe 36 hours ago so I did the I
just said which would you buy given the
chance the i7 7700 k or the r7 1700 is
I'm doing the comparison right now I
just want to know what heaps of people
think so if you guys want it well the
votes finished now but if you guys want
to vote on these polls you can head over
to twitter twit twit ear
to a Twitter do twitter.com / taxi DPC
and I did this survey and we I just said
you know which would you buy given the
chance and is I was surprised a lot like
still a lot of people would still buy
the 7700 a forty-one percent versus
fifty-nine percent on the r7 1700 so uh
yeah i mean i thought i thought the r7
1700 would have gained a lot more
momentum going into this survey and now
people can say it's only six hundred and
seven votes but at the same time a lot
of my audience they're very open minded
I know a lot of these guys are very open
minded so they like price performance
wise as well so very orientated towards
price performance and they would
probably you know 41 sound still go with
an i7 7700 k despite it having half the
cause and half the thread count of
course it overclocks how it's got the
better IPC and whatnot but that's just
yeah what do you what do you take out of
those results I just think it's because
they're you you're sort of looking at it
from the same way I suppose I might look
at it or someone like Steve might look
at it um or I saw a chris from tick
tablets who's really nice guy that's a
great journal go check that he replied
as well um saying he went for the 1700
but it's because we're all creators who
gain so we need the cause for the
productivity and stuff is of course we
will one hundred percent trend towards
the 1700 but the people out there that
don't do any of that stuff at all and
just care about gaming they will go for
that 7700 k higher clock speed speed or
IPC that's what the games want so or
benefit from so they will go for that
and only in very specific scenarios and
i love these rice and cpus and i would
i'm sort of voids in the back of my mind
thinking about going over getting an
xray 17 going towards the horizon 1700
um but there's very few games that i've
seen with the 1700 or any of the rice
and sevens will beat the 7700 k and just
straight up average frames um
the cabling CPUs are still very very
powerful and very good and gaming
however when we go to productivity then
that's a different story those Rosa
Simmons just smoked but that's the thing
that's basically but that's what I'm
going to put out they don't like for
what I do editing yeah I use the
premiere pro suite for a lot of my
productivity so that's where I guess if
my results come out they're all in a
similar league my 6th Corps the broad
well II six core the eight core i7 1700
even the r5 1600 and then the 7700 k
they're all in the same league like as
opposed to when I first went to the six
core 12-3 that I was using a fork or for
doing all my video editing and stuff
like that you know when i went from that
fork or to the 6th scores 12 threads man
was it a world of difference i remember
doing that back in what 2014 or
something so that was a world of
difference that was huge that was a big
upgrade i noticed it not only everything
was way better at productivity but also
i had more room when I was doing
productivity I had the extra calls and
threads and I could go do other things
without my computer choking but nowadays
like the 7700 k of course if you're
doing a final render than the other
options all the other options i tested
will be better because the 77 re ok just
gets maxed out when it's doing its final
render time so you can't do anything
else unless you want you know a really
sluggish performance but the austin 700
you can still browse the web and do
other things and create a thumbnail why
your video is rendering which is really
good and saying but I could still do
that on the six core the 6800 k so
there's not like there's not a huge
world of difference of course the 70s
are seven 1700 is much better value than
a 6800 k but still like I'm finding I
guess a lot of people when we talk about
smoke like you said before when it
smokes it in productivity again what
productivity are you doing that's kind
of like oh yeah I'm meaning main like
render times number crunching stuff
because in my testing the 7700 non k
takes about five minutes
seconds to render a 13-minute 1080p
video in 1080p and where the 1700 will
do it in three and a half minutes or
less so you know there's a pretty and
straight up you are correct in straight
up render times those rise in sevens but
it makes sense you've got a quad core
eight thread against a eight core 16
thread of course it should be but of
course it's not exactly half but um yeah
I I think it's that's that might have
been part of why it is I do I think that
key be like CPU is good value for money
no that wasn't the point I was trying to
make um it's just that I can understand
where those people that are just purely
doing gaming just that's all they're
doing might still trend towards that
maybe if they just don't care about the
value for money thing they just got
money to burn they just want a really
good gaming CPU they could still be a
place there but the article the wccftech
hardware survey that they've been doing
you can go through and there's obviously
I think there's quite a few this is we
just enthusiasts I imagine would be
filling this out most of these have
about 2,000 votes the most interesting
ones for me there are how much people
are willing to spin and for the GPU and
the CPU it seems like the majority only
by tiny like one percent on the GPU will
spend three to four hundred dollars then
the next lot are looking it's been six
hundred dollars plus so that's quite an
interesting also and a lot of people out
there will want to spend quite a bit on
a GPU and it's a sort of similar fair
when you go down to the how much people
would spend for a cpu but bit more in
favor but and nowhere near as high
people were third of people would spend
between 300 and 400 dollars whereas only
a quarter will spend between two and
three hundred dollars basically all that
tells me is that people are more willing
to spend higher amounts like four
hundred dollar
Plus which should say three hundred
dollars to say seven hundred dollars on
a GPU whereas a lot less people are
willing to spend over four hundred
dollars on a cpu and that's pretty good
thinking for the most part you do
obviously I want to be spending more on
the GPU a lot of people say use the
fifty percent rule so whatever your CPU
costs yet another fifty percent I don't
know from my case or under 6900 k you
have to buy like like the tiny XP or
something but there but that's it's kind
of a good idea you definitely want to
use the majority of your budget on this
is for gamers people doing product to
the stuff is obviously different but the
game is you want to be using the
majority of your budget on the GPU that
should be the most expensive thing you
buy in your build and that's basically
what's being told here is the bwood
surveying will be spinning the most as
most of them will only spend wanting to
spend half of people 100 to 200 dollars
on the motherboard and 300 or 400 or
less on her cpu but people are willing
to spend four hundred dollars and up on
a GPU like half of people so that's a
big discrepancy there and that's what I
think was interesting about this survey
in there and the fact that maybe we will
start seeing these GP prices just keep
going up and up as people does seem like
yeah well I willington hafer well
there's a few things yeah I didn't see
the r6i i quickly banged in Samantha's
but our five 1600 I sorry I didn't see
you before the i7 17 hundred I voted the
l7 1700 over the r5 1601 it's clearly a
mistake now but how much would you again
how much would you pay for a good cpu we
see the results I kind of they're pretty
like they're all around there so like
they're all around there there's not one
real I guess three hundred four hundred
dollars is taking the crown there but
again same with the GPUs the the money's
sort of the money shot is scattered all
around there so I guess people there's
all different people with all different
budgets out there and I think that's
where these companies have to see this
data because I guess the money stuff
there's going to be no bias there that's
pretty much just people okay voting this
is what i would want with my money and
this is how much I've do spend so i
think this is the most interesting part
is how much would you pay for a good
graphics card how much would you pay for
a cpu and so companies would want to
look at this like intel and AMD and they
want to offer all different SKUs for
that so there are people who would spend
like me I'd spend 500 600 dollars on a
really good graphics card if it gave me
really good performance and I think that
it's already represented though what if
you think about a prime because think
what the Intel let's say the 7700 k new
zealand sells five hundred and fifty
dollars and that's like the top one if
you want to go for a gaming cpu but then
let's think of a gaming GPU for example
in new zealand if you're wanting to get
it 1080 you'll be done running double
that or a 1080 TI you'll be running
double there plus and few hundred
dollars more see you're paying 550 for
the Intel's top gaming CPU but you'll be
paying about a thousand to 1100 for a
very high-end nvidia GPU nervously vegam
may change that but that sort of shows
that the markets are reflecting that but
the other thing i found interesting
which it might be a little bit of bias
here but it was what went down the
bottom and which was what or in the
middle i should say which ad in board
vendor do you trust the most and it was
a zhuzh by thirty percent which is that
kind of surprised me then ms I were
twenty one percent then sapphire was
sixteen percent and then gigabytes
thirteen percent this is for greatest
cards I mean for motherboards I'm
actually with asrock there yeah poor
galax didn't even make it on the phone
on the list yeah mrs. still have a big
big following same with MSI that both a
lot of their cards are selling a lot of
their motherboards are selling really
well this is something that we're seeing
a lot of this it's it's funny because I
you know
I just thought about would have been
like my graphics cards have been very
good to me actually over the fire I yes
I would have thought gigabyte would have
been quite high up there because out of
that if I to pick the ones I trust the
most out of that list i would say for
AMD cards sapphire I've had quite a few
set by cards they build a very good
graphics card I really do like safe I
think they do a very good job yeah but
with just cards in general you know both
sides of the fence the gigabyte cards
have been really really solid for some
reason I get this on my videos all the
time people see all but gigabyte cards
have coil wine issues I don't know weird
that started but I've tested like
probably a hundred graphics cards now
since I've done the channel all
different models and everything so it's
probably more than most people own in
their lifetime and it's been all the
different brands and I haven't noticed I
even gone to put gigabyte cards in and
then you know every time it's been
horrendous coil one because I would
start to take note of that I seem to see
that coil wine it's just card dependent
I can have three models of gigabyte card
and one will have bad coil 1 the other
two might not and then i'll check in a
zoo scarred and that'll have even worse
for one I think it's very specific on
the card but as I've told you guys
plenty of times so many people allow all
the card cool ones like crazy and
playing CS go because you like your FPS
is like 300 something and it's just
screaming so just put an FPS cap on
there I know your heart refrigerate I
don't do that on CS go and you can't put
us here you can't put a cap on csgo
that's one game where you don't put an
FPS cap on there you actually thought I
was a benefit of running 300 FPS FC I'm
just assuming you're running say a 60
Hertz 1080p monitor because that's what
the majority of people run it's about
worries about all Jack drawing the
fastest frame as soon as possible like
CS goes a really competitive game so it
comes down to sometimes a few
milliseconds so you know if you're if
you're playing for freaking big money
which csgo does have big money is the
same with dota 2 or any other
competitive game you want no fee Singh
because that you don't want Regency yeah
a friend is
I'll even even regards to what's coming
out of your monitor you ask any pro
gamer would they have screen tearing and
low input lag or no screen tearing and
input late they'll see the first option
no input lag it's all about getting the
frames as fast as you're drawing the
data up to your screen as fast as
possible if your approach us every
millisecond counts and this is the thing
like people say like there'll be people
out there that would be like it doesn't
matter it doesn't matter it's like dude
are you have you played a game
competitively on the pro level because
if you have and that's such a scrub
statement like you have to get the
fastest you have to get the basically
the best setup you can if you are
getting to that level obviously if
you're if you're like a you know
mediocre player and you're going out and
spending all this money on gear it's not
going to make you a better player you
have to have the skill there to begin
with yeah but my house yeah if you have
the skills and you are on top of your
game then you know drawing the friend
having high FPS and stuff like that it's
just it's a tool that helps you bet it
then helps you win yeah yeah I get that
so maybe it was a bad analogy on my part
but you would agree with me in the sense
if you're playing in non-competitive
yeah like that you wouldn't want that
high FPS because that will give you that
horrendous coil wine which is the main
problem a lot of people who have is just
from that but no I haven't noticed it
with fear by cards any worse than any of
the other ones it just seems like but if
you buy same jokes as well yeah yeah
it's the high-end cards usually
generally this isn't this isn't always
the case but the ones with upgraded
components on their flagship models in
theory there should be less likelihood
of you having that problem but people
still get I tested the flagship extreme
edition gigabyte natt I and I still
heard a little bit and I heard someone
the MSI to net ETO as well and they had
upgraded components yes I think it's um
that's quite interesting the reference
card think is a pretty interesting as
well that people only by that's a way we
should expect them you know people
buying the
the non reference models most people
don't buy a reference model unless it's
a very good version of it the RAM thing
was interesting to 16 gigs or under is
the most popular well that kind of falls
into it they have better cooling
solutions that falls into they have
better build quality that's what I'd
call that um you know what what can be
taken out of this survey is majority
people love the custom graphics cards
they wait for them vrs dead and majority
people don't own a VR headset so I think
it's too expensive the barrier to entry
right now for that but the CPU
configuration those last thing I wanted
to talk about with this the that's
interesting because this asking what
people have right now the third of them
have four core four threads and
thirty-one percent have four core eight
threads so already you know sixty four
percent of the market is running those
quad cores with or without
hyper-threading only see fourteen
percent there with the ache or sixteen
threads which I would assume a lot of
them would be people on Intel's extreme
platform with things like 6800 case or
on has relieved but and there would be
rice and chips in there for sure rice
and sevens but yeah and of course as I
said before just under that 1080p 60fps
60 Hertz I should say um or know that
saying minimum standards minimum frame
rate yes so they would want 1080p60 that
makes sense the vast majority people are
still gaming at 1080p sings like hurts
it's I'm not dead going into this
comment I was going to scroll down more
but I'm not going into the wccftech
comment section we're not doing that to
you guys yeah it's pretty good okay so
the next article you pulled up here from
wccftech again is a it's the sky oh cabi
lake x and sky like x chips so they're
rumored to be pushed forward to copy tax
which is kind of what we've been hearing
about that it's also some bizarre things
going on so now we're looking at what
we've got a 12-core
coming out of the mix as well and
something that I wanted to talk about
straightaways like okay we're seeing now
that I guess the majority of end users
don't like especially from the testing
I've recently done is that 16 threads
will be you won't really want any more
than 16 threads if you are you know
whatever simple office home office Soho
or whatever it is and you got your
workstation and your game on it I think
16 threads is currently the best point
to be at if you can afford it for
someone who's just working at home or
whatever working in studio and they got
their workstation I think that's the
best option but of course we're seeing
12 cores 24 threads and of course
Intel's going to charge for that you
know what one can we know sexy here tell
me guys what comments what do you think
of the single costs I'm guessing two
grand straight up yeah Australian or not
legal us I think two grand us is a
football yeah 12 cause through the
upping the core count again you saw the
price increase from eight to ten was
huge so 10 to 12 it goes without saying
it might even be exponential you might
pay three grand who knows it I I think
rice and I don't think they'll go for
increased price in this timer I think
it'd be decrease I think it'll come in
it two and a half grand newzealand
depends on how well that ten course old
though that depends on how well that ten
course old remember until there's that
data we don't know that data how well
did that tent or sell if it's all pretty
well then they're going to again they'll
pull it off but again that pricing of
that 12 call though will give you the
answers you need to know if it is a high
price then that means that the 10 core
sold pretty well if it isn't a gret more
aggressive for us and that tank or
didn't sell it well at all so that all
proof is always in the pudding guys it's
always in the numbers they let you know
a lot more than you think they do when
you analyze them but here we got this is
a weird article here a little bit
because it's saying the cabbie like X
will have a total of forty lanes and
then we scroll down and it's got 16
lanes there and then of course in this
bottom graph here it's saying there's
got 46 lanes
um so I guess one thing is sky like X
and cabbie like X I'm kind of confused
about what exactly is going to happen
here Nexus it's a year all the liver
bazaar where we're seeing so much
conflicting things in this one article
but the the market share will be i mean
the the chipset upgrade text 299 that
might be worth it we'll just have to see
otherwise Skylit x looks like what we
would expect aside from the 12 core
you'll get a teen corps and a core and
six core ah the kb like x quad cores
that's an interesting step um yeah i'm
not entirely sure where that guy fits in
but if Intel is going to be releasing it
then they must have done some you know
research into it and see they think
there's a gap there I'm for the kb like
x trips to get on maybe i'm just going
to chuck this out there maybe the
chipset upgrades of x 2 99 will be so
good / z 270 that some people might go
to it just for that and they just
throwing the quad core in there just so
people can put a cheap with that she she
pissed i should say cpu on that platform
but i don't know it's going to be
interesting the most interesting thing
for me though with this once it come i
mean this has been brought forward a lot
we were hearing like August before so
obviously Intel's feeling pressured to
bring this forward but the pricing
that's as I've said in my videos when I
did the rise in seven showdown Singh its
broad well II i run Broadwell II and
I'll admit it's dead right now I
wouldn't recommend to anybody to buy a
Broadway lead ship Oh verizon seven
right now because just strong pura value
for money standpoint the rice and sevens
are so much better so that's why I'm
hoping that the price will be up quite a
lot lower with sky like x over broad
well II I don't know if that's possible
for Intel we don't know what the margins
are
I would imagine they had pretty hefty
margins on there if I'm gonna be cheeky
and put that out there I because the
margins were pretty big between those
different you can see you you really
know they are I mean you look at the g14
look at G 45-60 penny emits the same
core hardware that's in a 7700 k look at
the mark-up once huge that's a huge
markup if they're still making profit of
a G 45-60 what does that tell you about
7,700 k yeah exactly so this they have
the room there to move down and they
just going to have to there should be I
would hope that the 7900 k which I guess
it will be caught maybe that'll be the
10 core this time but whatever the the a
course skylight xcp you should be at the
same price point that something like an
1800 x it has to be the in New Zealand
that would be I think I'm talking my
mind that's like the 800 new zealand
dollar price point that's where it has
to be which means that that pricing
would be the same as what the entry
level 6 core was on Broadway Lee the
6800 k so that's um yeah they've really
going to need to bring down their
pricing there I'm sure those
motherboards the X 2 99 are going to be
massively expensive so that'll probably
offset it to some degree but um yeah I
think they're and also moving forward as
well move we got these 16-core rising
ships apparently which is an april cpu
kind of coming i will say that X through
99 it's funny that X 370 AMD would did a
smart move with that numbering of their
motherboards because if in jail does
release X 2 99 and AMD have X 370 out
there an X 3 99 or whatever they're
going to call it I mean there are any
one leg ahead of Intel so smart naming
scheme there I mean maybe Intel might
want to think about going to it like a
1000 series numbering scheme that would
probably be just to differentiate it
that aimed he did pull a slow move with
it with their naming scheme I think they
really did
so anyway yeah the I mean the 16 cause
again guys like the 12 cores or this
even the 16 core AMD's like I'm really
not I mean I will talk about it but I'm
really not going to be too pleased about
again after doing a lot of testing I'm
not really interested in anything over a
course 16 threads whether it's intel or
AMD it's I don't think it's like for the
average guy was especially for my
audience I don't think it really
pertains to anyone's interests except
for hey look what I can do with whatever
SQL or something like that it's it's
really not much about it and not sure
interest as we saw even ashes NSYNC oh I
don't know what's going on with voice he
at jaja what you do to me so we've got
here like you saw in that dx12 ashes
singularity for example a game that was
meant to be the best for dx12 was meant
to be DX twelves poster child yet we
only saw 16 threads max being utilized
and I confirmed this because i went back
and disabled hyper-threading on the dual
xeons and what that did was we've now
got two CPUs but they're only 16 threats
at 16 course 16 threats and all and lo
and behold it was all 16 threads will
being utilized now so the extra in 16
threads which is dead and that's going
to happen on a lot of games for the next
few years so I guess you know the eight
core 16 thread is where it's at in terms
of max for the average consumer or the
guy doing work station staff for it
depends on of course without you without
going too overboard depends on the
application that you're using you know
obviously if you're using a specific
application that's going to use 32
threads then you're going to know what
you need and then you'll go out and buy
that if you really need the extra speed
but for the average guy just looking to
buy something at the moment aight course
these thing threads is kinda like the
max that i'm going to be looking at
personally so that yeah i mean that's
that there will be a place for them um
not not so much i would say with the
average user but there'll be commercial
uses i'm sure but then there'll be
there'll be a place that they these
companies have done their research i
don't think they would release something
that
they thought no one would end up buying
um so there will be a place somewhere
for them but you are right in the sense
that yet the majority of users ecor 16
threads is going to be really really
solid as we've seen with those rows and
five 1600s they're extremely good value
for money if you want to build like a
cheap workstation / gaming rig um oi man
can you build one sheet now that's
that's for sure so that's really good it
was good next article invidious Volta
reportedly poised for just reportedly
anticipated poised for epic other this
toddler just confused me ok so it's
poised for an early quarter 3 2017
launch so what we're looking at here is
in video apparently they're having more
success on a 12 nanometer fabric yeah so
they're looking to launch this early I
mean it doesn't matter I mean for a
company like in video they're going to
launch these products whenever sales
start dropping for their previous
generation I mean I think they've
already got poulter in the works they've
already got it ready and so they're
going to release it as soon as possible
and so I'd really be looking forward to
a gtx 1180 i want to see what this
architecture brings because nvidia have
and i give them credit for that they
have consistently year-on-year given us
gains whether it be through just you
know sheer offering heap more cuda cores
or Maxwell or Pascal optimizations
however they've done it we've still when
we do the benchmarking we've still got a
heap more FPS out of their flagship
cards over year-on-year kind of thing so
I have been pretty impressed with what
they've been doing and so I am looking
forward to voltar personally of course
Vega man because it just has to get out
there it's I you know AMD's really have
to launch that soon otherwise if voltar
comes up is really that's why I'm hoping
for I mean that's the rumor they're
launching it at computex but shouldn't
we be hearing a lot more about the leaks
like you know maybe just keep me out
really really silent or it's only a
month away and we just usually there's
more leaks there's more sort of juicy
details coming
but there's really not a lot on Vega at
this point in time it can't be later
then that I think it may be maybe if it
could I just don't know this will be
interesting though they're saying the
reason is that there as you rightly
pointed out the they had very not very
good sales in the start of the Sierra
basically in 2017 nvidia sales haven't
been what they really want um what they
wanted so yeah it's going to be called
apparently it's going to be called the
20 geforce twink 2000 series so it'll be
the 20 80 and they also say it will be
using GDD are six won't be ready so it's
going to either be hbm to or GD gddr5 x
memory on there if it's hbm to that sort
of i think what it's looking at right
now and that would be very very cool and
on the 12 nanometer process see ya this
could be very interesting if you guys
don't know q3 is what does that July to
September right the top of my head yeah
be around yeah so so it'll be in that
time period will step to loan me some
more September made it BTW yeah you're
looking at usually when they say these
quarter figures and they're rushing a
launch if they are it's going to be
towards the end of the quarter so
september-october actually would be
accurate if they are going to look for
that launched before christmas ramp it
up that'd be very interesting to see I
mean of course a video of just been
making gains as this article points out
their revenues just been gone off the
charts so yeah I mean whatever they're
doing is working and some but of course
like we saw the rise and CPUs how much
competition they brought to the market
we're all hoping Vega brinks competition
in the market and of course like I've
said vague is really good i'll be
changing over like I've got no problems
in using the best hardware for me at the
best price point and then recommending
it to my viewers as well that's
something you know hey look you get come
near you get it straight down the line
there's no like
company logo ah let's just go get that
magic because the company logo none of
that's going to happen brothers and so
we're going to see what's what's
installed but again like they send this
article the you know they pulled off a
Hail Mary with the rise in cbus they did
do it they did do a really good job
bryson CPUs are really good they are
behind you know their architecture at
the moment gcn is behind in videos in
terms of arm the price performance per
watt you know that's a big key factor of
course going in power performance what's
going on man I gave his name professor
wants down and performance per watt is a
huge indicator man it's so underrated
but it is a massive indicator of where
our company's at in terms of their
architecture performance per watt so in
other words for GPUs would be like IPC
kind of thing if you were to take it
from CPUs two GPUs that gives you an
idea where the company is at now with
NVIDIA they are ahead with pascal over
gcn and volta is only going to is only
going to get better with Volta so I am a
little bit worried in AMD if they can't
release vega and it doesn't hit as hard
like rising hit with the cpu lineup then
that could be a really bad thing for
them so yeah yeah and this thing as well
that this will be there going to be
increasing the price as it can um so
yeah guys at bought you know when pascal
came out and everyone was going oh look
the prices increased again on the
founders edition and everything ah yeah
the UH it's going to be going up again
so you're really going to be paying for
all this extra power I suppose but Vega
will be powerful we know it's going to
have 4096 stream processors which have
you imagined Apple RCP with that many
like well and this is going to be grunty
so let's just hope that as I said I
don't think it'll be the 1080 ti I just
don't see it but
the I think it will slot in between the
1080 or the 1080 TI bi or beat the 1080
only by a little bit but coming at a
significantly lower price but probably
will be using a lot more power I'd
imagine something like children Tiffany
five if that does come out of the if
that does come out and then voltar comes
out then I mean there's just I'm worried
about Andy and the GPU department
hopefully they can do it with viggo acai
should've been is quicker that's the
thing it's taken too long they had a
good gap if it had come out and
something like februari I mean that
would have been a good time um even
January but was possible that's what we
were hearing last year and it's just
being pushed back and to the point now
that they're only going to have the
market to themselves in terms of before
volte comes out for like three months or
something and then thinking it Walter
will come out which will probably maybe
undercut it so yeah um it should have
been a lot quicker but what I there I
keV cheer up man I got some really good
news for you okay no good cheer okay
nexon here Crytek closing down they
haven't paid the rent I say Crytek in
shanghai i believe it is just haven't
paid the rent so guys there's no more
crisis coming out in a more Crytek so
crisis for you i think we can forget
about that one that's sad so yeah end of
an era i suppose but that's what it's
weird because i thought like you know
China and Shanghai at the moment off the
chain I thought money was just getting
flown around everywhere and these poor
guys can't even pay the rent jeez yeah
well I guess this stuff up there I don't
don't worry Crytek youtube's the same
scenario at the moment man like
Armstrong struggling to pay the rent
[Laughter]
YouTube's Sammy to revenues down views
down interactions down all this jazz
it's all down yeah it's been pretty
pretty rough lately especially on our
small guys and we'll fill in a Franco
you say watch this video I said that
emerging is only going to get worse
before it gets better yeah I didn't like
that I like oh ok he's actually if he
had to say something he spoke to someone
and he's like giving a hint on what's
going on out there so yeah it's Crytek's
not the only one going through some
financial stress guys so yeah and the
salaries to damn I feel sorry for the
salaries man like that's sad you know
people like people just work in jobs and
then they get like block salaries man
that's that's harsh so we need to go
fund me page for the crud take people
who didn't get paid this salary Crytek
helped now with the wages mix up we've
got call of duty world war two confirmed
so you like you say they go on full
circle here they gone full circle back
to the original formula call it Judy air
do I'm really looking forward to this as
much as I'm not looking forward to the
lazy game engine optimization updates
that call the duty do i do like the cod
formula and you know i know people are
gonna go at me in the comments like how
dare you like cod um you know but hey
can't help what I like you know what I
mean so I like a chicken cheese avocado
had some last night beautiful food you
know but some people vegetarians don't
like that so you know call of duty it
does it is a good game like I like just
jumping into cod and you're in a game
instantly and then you just fray it's a
great game to pick up and play for 20
minutes I've always said that about
caught really cool thing I like about of
course the game engine optimizations are
hard you know a lot of the times
especially the last was black ops 2 was
the last one that I really enjoyed for
pc I thought they do a pretty good job
like it was it ran really smooth and
then of course they brought out the you
know advanced warfare and stuff and it
was just like wow it was just that ghost
was terrible they never actually fixed
that there's just a starter fest and
yeah just like I hope I hope they get it
right with this one
but obviously I lost you didn't say that
for the last few I hope they get it
right guys I hope they get it right
because i like my cot no I and that's
the mean the optimist inside me says
that they will but then of course we've
been let down like pretty much three
times previously after black ops 2 been
let down so is this going to be another
letdown you know and then they decided
to make a new game studio to sort of
pass the buck around you know there's
not then the guys who made Ghost amen
were branching off a new team now they
sort of yeah don't worry it was it was
their fault but these guys are making
the next one so don't worry it's just a
cycle I mean hopefully like you know I'm
going to say this if what a war two if
this one's if ya call of duty world war
two is bad then I'm officially given up
on cod if it's not if it's unoptimized
and it's trash I'm given up and I'm not
coming back to cod does think that's
wondering what they're doing it because
the infinite warfare didn't do very well
so they've got to go back to their roots
to get it right I suppose so hopefully
um it's about the Gateway it's about not
about the gameplay really it's about
them having these crappy options in
there like Max and I dfps and stuff like
this is just absolute crap it's like
guys you get paid a crap ton of money to
make these games people buy them like
freaking he'll make the game better but
then again I guess it's like me suckers
like me keep buying the game because we
love the original plague especially
black ops 2 i love that i liked black
ops 1 and world of war was when world of
war came out that was like pretty good
at the time um their campaign anyways I
really enjoyed that so call of duty call
of duty suckers we're taking your money
edition that's I mean hopefully it's not
always that wolf it yeah well I mean
it's just like yeah like it's not it's
not about the actual gameplay running on
walls and stuff I can get used to that
and have a bit of fun it's just when you
got capsule like 90 FPS and all this
crap going on and it's like it stutters
on really good hardware to
it's kind of like what is going on it
should shouldn't even start on mediocre
hardware that's the thing it should be
running well on all types of hardware so
people can play it and enjoy the game so
yeah ranch over that I'm hoping they get
it right I'm going to officially call it
from me anyway I'm this is it this is it
for God if it does well then I'll give
them another chance if it doesn't do
well see if it does well this time I'll
give them another three strikes but this
is it third strike I'm out my fourth
strike in this case s'okay next next
article here we got biostar launches to
mini-itx aim for motherboards now people
have been going crazy over this people
want a mini-itx motherboard people like
damn I want to make a mini ATX AMD
reisen build and so it looks like
biostar delivering though on that note
the vrm does I mean you can't even see
the MOSFET co a 14 pen cpu connect up
you know the i think these things draw a
115 watts power / 4 pin so you may be
limited with this overclocking guys I
mean you've got 22 dimm slots they're
just just saying you might not be able
to make the risin mini-itx pc of your
dreams you know when i'm thinking rising
mini-itx i'm thinking kickass water
cooler kind of like that z 270 mini-itx
from asrock that are reviewed that thing
was just absolute bangers man that thing
was huge for a mini-itx board of course
you only had two dimm slots again
limited options on mini ITX due to the
space restraints but again that single
4-pin man that's worrying me so what
happens you know cuz risin my mind mind
uses up 140 watts when I'm stress
testing so if the power draw is limited
to like 115 what's maybe I mean
unofficially officially it might be a
bit bit officially 115 what's unofficial
it might be of course it might be higher
but it's a little bit worrying i mean
the vrm does look pretty mediocre
already just by looking at it so i know
a lot of people when they think x 370
they're thinking overclocking they're
thinking enthusiasts this
a little bit little bit skeptical just
sorry guys gotta cheer up jaja yo cheer
me up bro now this is Phyllis gave me a
kiss I'm all chewed up man ya know I
think I think you're yeah what you're
saying is right but I think a lot of
people will still really like these um I
think they'll go right man for people at
least oh you know it'll it's a good
start I definitely like the price point
129 for the x3 see ya 109 for the be 350
bit it looks like we've got both models
up here and there doesn't look like
there's any difference on the vrm on
both models so no it's just looking at
that yeah so I mean like I can
understand on the be 350 but the x3 70
when people pay in that extra 20 bucks
or whatever it is they want that it
looks like they're just paying for the
license in this case so even though
there shouldn't be any SLI on now I'd
want wonder how that works a on the X
370 because is the SLA license baked
into the X 370 chipset license anyway
questions questions questions I don't
have the answers to sorry about that but
yeah it looks like the be 350 in this
regard get it with an r5 1600 stock
rising cooler and you should be maybe
three-point-eight gigahertz at a sweet
spot overclock calling it for you guys
there it is Booya you have any think
that on that no you said it on but
thanks bro alright so good gtx 1080 TI
game rock so this is from palais i
supposed to Steve on how to pronounce
this he said it was palette is always
pronounced it I like Palais but when
they're be PA el AE doesn't matter men
like when you're using these fancy
French words like cafe you just say kaif
i am going to the cave to have a coffee
I suppose you want to come to the cave
with us is it actually a French company
I don't know man I just it to me it
sounds like Palais when I'm I've see
I've started to read these words he
started getting to the site the word cat
okay well there you go same
sorry not the same thing I was gonna say
same three the same thing different name
made up overseas yeah so yeah we'll go
to the cave and we'll go get will bring
up palette graphics card to the cave and
then have a coffee what have you how
does that sound sounds fantastic right
cool why why why I brought up this model
was it's got four fans so even though
it's got two fans it's got underneath
that another two fans so it's kind of
like you got some jet engine stuff going
on here do you think their final do you
think this thing when you put it in your
computer do you honestly think this
graphics card will start it'll start
pushing that much air that'll take off
from the PCIe slot and blow out of your
cart and then fly around like a balloon
I I don't actually know if this is a
good idea I mean I can see where they're
going with it but I I mean like I know
how jet engines worked at turbines bangs
that doesn't really seem but I mean hey
would have to see once once it gets
tested but there is an interesting
approach I mean usually you would have
the first fan that's just the intake and
the second one's the compressor but that
doesn't really make sense because if you
compress the air it'll get hot so oh
yeah it I think this is just like they
thought how can we make it really
different yet and they said well put
four fans on it will say it improves
temps and then let's just see if it does
but yeah people start testing it and pay
the temps are really really good then
great but I don't really see it right
now um how can we do this thing I know I
know stick some ugly game rock text on
there oh man like that yeah it's not an
extremely appealing car deserve it
actually that's good except this text on
the lower left corner here like someone
went to you know dafont.com download
it's typed in rock and then been like
hey guys I made up the text it took me a
whole day than they did it like five
it's here game rock yeah that looks good
let's stick that on the bottom left hand
corner here like I i don't know i don't
like it man the baby blue across the top
and then this like navy blue across the
middle and i think i think it looks
different i think i could really stand
out in a particular build but i just
think this gay in a particular one but
for the average consumer i don't know
why they don't just make them color
neutral and then just add the RGB LED so
people can change them to make them eat
them that's good yeah and that's this
very valid but yeah this game rock tax
man I don't know what it is yeah it is
it's yeah hopefully that's just printed
on so you can get like an eraser or
something and just like rub it off yeah
yeah it should be interesting these
these speeds is coming with our
interesting the saying what 50 on the
premium model 1594 i'm guessing its
meaning the boost speed and it's so see
mode which isn't particularly high
compared to other ones now the msi and I
think the Auris is well do better so
yeah they're all the way there in 1600
something so are you and the memory 70
loads something oh yeah yes weird
whatever okay well that's it I just
wanted to look at the for fans that's
all I thought it was pretty cool how do
you pc you know your graphics card will
now be able to take off outside your
case why are you gaming yes so guys if
you're playing games on this graphics
card and your screen just suddenly goes
black and then you hear a big crashing
noise in the background you know what
happened okay yeah interesting it's just
that it's a two it'll be an interesting
thing that'll be sure i'll be interested
in now when people start reviewing it
okay so we got here we've got here the
dell 30 inch or OLED is finally released
they released it and you know the good
news is three and a half thousand bucks
three and off-grid
and yet it's still like it they were
going to with 120 Hertz refresh rate now
if they did put that 120 Hertz refresh
rate and I'd be like look guys charge 10
grand for it because it's the only thing
out at the moment you'll probably get a
few people who want to buy it but it's
only 60 Hertz like it's you know people
want for me especially if i'm buying one
of these monitors I want after using CF
791 oh yeah hundred Hertz baby but you
want there's higher refresh rates if I'm
guessing if you're paying like a three
and half gram per se because I know okay
but then there's going to be people out
there like look dude productivity yeah
this is going to be for pretty much
people who want productivity but then
again don't those people already have
like two grand srgb calibrated monitors
and whatnot I mean OLED is a technology
that's beautiful it looks so gorgeous
late the blacks are so deep you know the
contrast is amazing oh I haven't seen
anything as good as OLED at the moment
and that's the honest opinion oh that
looks phenomenal but you know isn't
there a market there that gamers would
want to buy this or people you know but
yeah I guess gamers would want to buy
this and so I think they should have
tried to get the refresh rate up at any
costs even if it was 90 hurts or 80
hurts i think that would have been a
much better selling point for this
monitor because when i look at this I'm
like oh yeah awesome OLED finally in a
monitor for K and then you've got 60
Hertz oh it's kind of like it's kind of
like you're waiting for your favorite
basketball player to take a shot and
it's like the game winning point any
Chuck's enable yeah exactly i mean we
have we have steve here and the comments
saying uh yeah do you have a hundred
hurt samsung monitor Brian ah yes Steve
I have a CF 791 dude and it's the best
monitor I've used for a piece ultra-wide
01 by nine a kiedy LED display meant
absolutely phenomenal I'll put the link
in the description below for your
brother okay okay Steve now still if
Steve it's got a fight it's got pretty
fast respect response times two
input lag and I kept us in our God like
calves like get on with the show Ryan um
how many times that we talked about that
samsung monitor okay now i agree with
what you were saying with this dell one
though it's like why 4k hi refresh rate
is gonna be the next big thing monitors
to me i think but um you know I mean
it's going to be kind of ridiculous at
the same time but that's a huge price
tag for will it look awesome yeah
probably but I mean damn from a
value-for-money point of view could you
really ever warrant paint three and a
half grand for a 30-30 in chocolate not
60 Hertz though that's the thing not 60s
like as I said if it had the higher
refresh rates in there if they try to
push it too nitey hurts even I could see
people buying this like game is buying
this I think it's 60 Hertz kind of like
yeah I'll see you next week i was gonna
if you guys want i can deal with this
live 4690 cows just looking at this cpu
and then I was looking at this D lid kit
here and I was like why don't do a deal
it live they'd be pretty cool I didn't
even know of it going off topic here
completely but okay Oh LED monitor I'm I
was loving it until I saw 60 Hertz so
now then we got up here next up
starcraft or remastered coming this
summer you know I was going through also
oh my god this is so awesome so awesome
and then I just saw like they basically
just open the resolution and it looks
like that with that they're upping the
actual scale of the game too so you get
more screen space with that so yes this
will be more CPU intensive than the
original based on that observation but
it's the 1998 game with 1998 graphics
still that's kind of what like made me
disappointed I thought they were going
to go back and properly remaster at all
like we're going to get sort of like SC
two graphics in here or something like
that that would be so cool because i
love broodwar man it was one of my it is
probably my favorite one of my favorite
holders get to as well favorite pc games
of all time and
love this game especially the
competitive play it was so balanced this
is yes again that got me into pc gaming
especially competitive play and i was at
one stage number one in Australia at it
ova nice women in Austin those wcg
tournaments when there was no money in
there there was no money in gaming pro
gaming was dead back in late two
thousand one unless you were like
slayers boxer or who was the other guy
fatality yeah those two of those two
were raking it in everyone else was on
like Mac and salaries and I know some of
these boys some of my friends back in
the day they took their like Brian man
i'm going to career they packed their
bags went to korea came back years later
lost a lot of hair by the looks of it
and and they'll though and they'll broke
so back then it wasn't you know really
profitable at all but nowadays if you're
young and you're talented and you're
good at games go all the way man you can
make some serious box out of it if you
get to the top level but again it's
still very but at that time it's way
more competitive now oh it'd be much
more competitive now because of how big
pc gaming is itself so yeah remastered
it yeah what do you said just looks like
the same the same game just with
graphics updated and I mean the thing is
if you play it now it feels very cramped
in its original form so it would be good
with the ability to play at higher
resolutions you it won't feel so cramped
yeah I woulda liked it as well plead
redone all the cinematics as well um
cutscenes in that and made it a full
remaster in every way that would have
been cool a lot of people might not have
liked that if it changed the control but
in some ways it was very limited because
you could only select like what was a 16
units at one time I can't remember back
it's been a long time I played I ever
play you couldn't just select the whole
army like you can yeah yeah in starcraft
2 and then just hop here to one key or
something like that if you want to do
the produce death ball or something but
i'm there that was an issue a lot of
people had i mean it did mean
you're yet to a PM way more um because
you to move your armies around the stuff
they did have to be every mastering the
music though and the that's going to be
also and the dialogue as well hopefully
they gathered i thought the dialogue was
epic m brood war the voices the voice
acting was incredible the music was
really damn good too so i liked what
they did sound wise so they're
remastering that they've got a pretty
high bar to jump over so yeah I'm sorry
too I've been cutting you off a little
bit this this week no I happy fine man
no I was just green I don't have
anything else that I said we got
battlefront 2 trailer release date and
everything else we need to know so
battlefront 2 it's going to have some
new heroes in there it looks actually i
watch the trailer it looks really good
looks like they're bringing in a
campaign this time too I'm not going to
play the trailers I don't get like dmca
takedown or something but i'll put that
in the description below for you guys
the battlefront 2 what do you think so
far umm ayman read too much about it
armor the original was quite good um but
yeah hopefully I mean there seems to be
a lot of hype around it so let's hope it
lives up to us well this time around
they're focusing on the campaign I mean
last time that's released it with no
campaign they're like oh sheesh we
better do something and then they
brought back some sin but they brought
some single-player element to the game
which was really good i mean they needed
that but they need that from the get-go
it looks like this time around they're
actually they're like okay we bet
actually focus on a single player
campaign or something little likes of
that so they're going to bring i think
that's going to be a big focus of the
game so i'm looking forward to seeing
what they do obviously i really want
more of that instead of having those
massive area gun battles and stuff i
want like the lightsaber jewels I want
like the option where you're going like
4 verse 4 or something and you just like
everyone's holding lightsabers like the
old I think was the old republic one of
those games back in like early 2000s man
that was the multiplayer was so much fun
eh and you're just like force pulling
and force pushing and you had like sis
lightning and stuff it was such an
awesome game to play multiplayer so
yeah let me know what you guys think in
the comments are you are you dying for
battlefront two are you pre-ordering are
you being like EA take my money or are
you being like no I'm going to wait for
it and if it has a single player some of
you guys even going to do the no no
you're going to go and pirate it anyway
you guys we're going to move over to Q&amp;amp;A
now so if you've got if you have
questions and you want to answer you
just jump out w WX EDTV / forums sign up
and you can jump in the threads here and
ask some questions so every week we go
to the threads and answer the questions
obviously don't all come at once because
yet we don't have been here on a live
answering questions for like two hours
but if you've got a really hot question
you need answered then short shoot here
um nice when you're done when you did
your be 350 overclock how hot did your
VR and MOSFETs get I was that with the
azuz board when I was doing that
overclock ah yes here's the thing i just
i think i got the ir gone on it and i
had the fan on there actively cooling it
so it didn't get too hot yeah if you
guys have if you guys are overclocking
then you always want some sort of
cooling on your vrm now the easiest way
to get by that and this is why people
buy a more expensive cases is because
they've got that airflow going through
and that will that will help with your
vrm that will legitimately help with
your vrm cooling because you just got
fresh air blowing it away if it's good
cooling solution so that's why I do like
especially the air 740 I've got here and
the air 540 people who own those cases I
don't think you'll say one person who
will complain about the airflow in those
cases phenomenal you just got the air
coming in the front blowing it straight
out the back phenomenal so have you got
if you're getting into overclocking I
would invest in a decent case just like
a decent power supply I would recommend
starting if you're into overclocking
starting to invest in a decent case to
with decent cooling or of course just
get a cheap case whack a heap of fans in
the front so you've got good airflow
that's the easiest way to get around it
of course you can also drop like what I
did just you know ghetto hack some fan
on there
and have it blowing air straight onto
the V RMS so the vrm not prm's one of
them again this week guys don't hate me
so yeah that's sort of like the
recommendations were going with there is
you should have a vrm with some sort of
cooling at the very least I think maybe
his question was the more like how hot
is too hot but English is like what 125
is it that so that's not that is like in
ways that's a thermal trip like that's
when your mother will switch off you
don't want to go near that you know you
want your various running 10 hundred to
ya you want your VRMs ideally running
under a hundred degrees so and that's
pretty easy to achieve it's not that I
can get away with over a hundred though
but ideally but you never want them over
say 120 for example would that be fair
to say well yeah um it depends on the
make and model but most VRMs yeah 125s
like that spot where things really don't
sit well or bode well so depend some
have a t-junction thermal trip of 150
135 125 it just depends on the make and
model of the MOSFETs so venue yet you
always want to make sure that they're
pretty cool especially for long
longevity or long activity I really want
to make sure that they're cool you know
all your gear should be running sweet
and cooling is a big part of that so
yeah and they will like nice question or
they get warm a lot yeah and they will
get one because you've got less phases
so you got more uptime which depends on
the switching frequency as well but got
more uptime on those MOSFETs so you want
to get them cooled and the easiest way
that if you're a lazy man get one with a
heat sink on it get a case and just have
good air flow and you should be fine for
the majority of like overclocks even
like you know 4 gigahertz on risin you
should be okay so anyway yeah he was
saying gets up 212 C with this stuff
yeah and that's all I'd have to ask a
counter question to dragon Kurt what
sort of cooling have you got at the
moment you have to let us know more what
cooling solutions have
got and exactly what motherboard do you
have so let us know the model would let
us know the overclocks and let us know
the case and the fans set up that you've
got going on then we can talk more about
it and what you can do to get those
temperatures down personally I wouldn't
want my VRMs running at 112 degrees with
it where's that measured from as well as
that measured from software or is that
measured yeah I wouldn't be with an IR
gun because that would be thermal that a
really thermal trip when it comes to
bargain hunting builds if the systems
are not overclockable what would that be
a deal breaker to you even if it was a
good price to win this is last week's
episode this is this week's tip me get
this question last week or if I got my
crystal bowl out April 13 yeah wait yeah
this is yeah would ya 22 this week um
wait up mmm wait didn't I post up
episode oh my my goodness I may have
screwed up here because I'm pretty sure
I really answer that question last week
yeah fish from April 13 Oh we'll get new
questions on here anyway we'll scroll
down to April okay so and Gary's like
okay there's okay so what's it will go
down this question I'm sorry I realized
my question was incomplete since the r5
1600 has this major difference from the
are 1700 in its lower or call boosts
thereby potentially limiting manual
overclocking on some chips to 30 600
megahertz do you still recommend it as
the best favor for money I matter if
you're manually overclocking you should
only be limited on risin to what you're
either your mother bought or your CPU
can reach the CPUs are unlocked they'll
go above 30 600 megahertz if you want
them to the Alpha 1600 yes I think it's
the best value out of them all because
you can get them to 4 gigahertz you get
in 3.9 even like 3.85 even on a stock
rise and cooler in like 20 what I test
that
25 degree ambience so manually over
clocking you should be able to get these
chips exactly where the are seven
seventeen hundreds are if not better so
depends okay so okay so we got here
April sixteenth what if we answered that
oh okay i don't know i'm going crazy
this week sorry guys this questions now
there was a big question down by a
demagogue i'ma go get game okay hey
everyone ances as answer as many
questions you like leftovers will be
carried over and asked another time
first question series i look through
your video history and before asking
these questions owners that you do not
cover water cooling as much or it's not
obviously labeled as such what form of
water cooling would you recommend to
someone who has never done it before
that'd be easy i mean all-in-ones if
you've never done it before and the
reason yeah i don't focus on water
cooling as much because i don't have a
lot of time like if you're making custom
loops man they take time like even yeah
even get of doing that fifty dollar I'm
ever doing that fifty dollar water loop
it took me a lot of time to make sure
you have to make sure if you're doing a
custom loop you have to make sure
there's no leaks everything's running
perfect because that's massive potential
to damage a lot of gear and I'd you know
don't say that like usually man look at
me like I mess around like I'm washing
computer parts sometimes you know like I
mess around a lot and water cooling is
not one of those things you'll want to
mess around with at all no you need to
know what you're doing if he's meaning
non all-in-one and like he wants to do
custom work type stuff I would say just
buy a kit could you usually buy kit
which comes with everything that you
need rather than maybe buying stuff
individually if you buy the kit then you
know how I've got everything here I need
they'll have come with instructions on
how to do everything and you can go from
there but yeah it is something that you
drag your right you don't want to do it
I mean yeah well we have to learn some
way but um yeah it's definitely do your
research and studying first so which way
of water cooling your system is the most
cost-effective bang for your buck well
that would be all in ones that
all in one easy again that's a lot of
the reason why another reason is I don't
do custom water loops is because the
price performance is pretty it's pretty
bad I think it looks good but a paper
exactly and the price performance really
isn't there with water cooling a lot of
the time because you're not going to get
much more over an all-in-one or a decent
air cooler and you know of course you
get lower temps but it doesn't exactly
mean especially in the Wolfram above
water that doesn't mean much higher
overclocks at all so would you recommend
pre-built coolers dedicated cpu
water-cooled hybrid that attaches over
the cpu with a hybrid GPU cool there may
be someone sells pre-built coolers for
other parts that attach to the same
radiator for ram and motherboard okay so
you want to do essentially a custom loop
I don't know anyone that does a kit
that'll go like CPU and GPU all from the
same radiator that would be way like
daisy chain them together yeah I mean
that would be way too complicated
because of distances and different case
setups so when you go with custom water
cooling you have to decide what case you
are using what motherboard the spacing
where you're putting your graphics cards
where your radiators going and then
you've got it obviously make the custom
tubing for that build so again yeah I
don't imagine anyone would make a
prebuilt either because it would just it
be a fail and if you tell a first-timer
to use those plastic tubes as opposed to
glass or whatever material they are made
of two costly meaning soft or hard you
don't want to go soft tubing if you do
first time I would recommend go with ya
a soft tubing soft yeah easy just to get
the hang of things yeah of course when
you want it when you're used to water
cooling and you've got your head around
at all then you co can go with ptg
tubing get the fire out there and spin
it and cast and Bend all the tubes yeah
of course that's something I've still
got to do as well I haven't actually
done a petg tubing build yet so it's
something I really want to do it's just
I got to find the time to do it so they
I really want to do on my own full
custom rig for the channel
and then personally I'm trying to leave
air-cooling behind because air
temperatures are not reliable or what I
have in store for IPC echoing should be
very reliable get a good case get a good
air cooler and they should be very
reliable I don't yeah unless you live
somewhere where the temperatures all
over the place if you have a good case
good fans good Big Eight sinks on like a
not to a cool or something yeah it
should be pretty good second question do
you don't you think we need more
protection as consumers I'm guessing
you're in America if that's the case
that would be your consumer laws in
Australia we actually have pretty good
really good career New Zealand chest
name yeah pretty good particularly good
like you buy something you can return it
no questions asked a lot of the time
yeah even if you don't like the product
it's crazy if the consumer protection is
trey is it's really good of course some
people abuse it I don't know what it's
like in the States but yeah I mean
that's one I can't really answer that
because if you're I'm guessing you're
from America because I think people in
Australia wouldn't complain about a
consumer protection in place it's
actually really good at the moment I
think there's like a minimum of even
sometimes a minimum of two year warranty
over the one year so a lot of these
companies that sell tech products
they'll give a one-year warranty to
people at the US but they'll give it to
you one or two to people in Australia so
we're actually give you pretty good like
we get it pretty good in terms of that
in those yep what additional details
about a product would you find useful to
have a boxing store online before
purchasing arm I mean it depends about
if you're doing about consumer of
products in enthusiast tech then you
should be like there's a heap of
information out there if you want to buy
a product there's a heap of reviews on
it go check out the reviews so I think
in terms of what's on the box I'm not
really going to argue with that and then
the next question have you met an honest
lawyer because I haven't that's that's
out of the blue but that's a really
weird question you know I don't know
what it is why does this come on April
23rd because the other week I was out
out on the town was at the casino with
my friend and before that if you had
asked this question a week ago I would
have said to you know but then we were
out on the town the other way this is a
crazy story we're out having a few
drinks
and you know we're talking to some girls
as you do Cheryl yeah and then this
there was this guy this this guy just
came in he's like hey man these guys are
probably under something good here I
just started chatting to him and um he
was a loyal and he was honest like
really honest I talked to him about my
personal situation because I had it you
know had a few things actually wanted to
go see a lawyer about ah he gave me such
honest answers the first thing he said
was I don't see a loyal if you can avoid
a solicitor or a lawyer or costs because
you just gonna lose your money and I
haven't heard that yet any other lawyer
that I've seen or even met or even heard
of in the past so yeah I have met an
honest lawyer if you want to know me
really but this guy was really honest I
was like wow okay gave me some really
good advice and before that I would have
said no but after the other last weekend
doubts just weird how that question
comes up now because I would have said
no that after the last week and i have
met an honest loyal so it depends
because it's such a big thing as well i
mean most guys are probably just
thinking all criminal defense lawyers or
or things like that but there's heaps of
people that do different things
especially you know ones that are more
focused on business and stuff like that
um yeah I've met plenty the thing it's a
kind of funny stereotype that the whole
lot get it even though there certainly
are bad ones but they're well dishonest
ones but the yeah it depends which sort
of heart of the law they cover that's
basically where you need to look more I
think yeah the YouTube coverage of
rising has generally generally been
abysmal with so much misinformation
that's that's not true i think a lot of
the channels on that's really harsh
that's pretty harsh man Wow total lack
of quality journalism i think a lot of
especially the people i know we've
tested reisen and we've tested it very
well and done i think everyone speed
variations fear i think at the start you
could have maybe said that but it was
played as new for us too yeah there were
problems we didn't know Andy hit to come
out and clear things up there was a lot
of course is going to be a bit of mr.
mation because we all didn't know was
new to release information yes Miss
informations about term to use missing
for me yeah that's info it was just yep
people we just didn't know and we were
using our intuition or experience to
talk about things even the real top dogs
like Wendell and stuff um we're all just
trying to figure that we I didn't miss
him I haven't misinformed anyone once
about horizon I my day one diffusion was
accurate for the time my day 1 review
for example that was accurate at the
time of what you could expect if you
were to buy risin yeah yeah how exactly
no not at all yeah I know I think it's a
wet we getting a bit mixed up in the
words my point that I was trying to make
was that at the start there was a lot of
things we didn't know her and so all of
us were trying to figure out what what
it was about why we were getting some of
the results we did I think that's yeah
quite harsh um maybe you know there's
obviously going to be people out there
that are going to be diving a lot deeper
they have a lot more experience against
someone like Wendell huge knowledge and
like Jay summed it up though well
Wendell's got a lot of knowledge in
servers and virtual machines in stuff
like that like something that I don't
practice at all so how can people
excited I'm not knowledgeable in that
whole be honest with you guys straight
up and rise and melia I'm really good
like Wendell seems to really love it in
that regard so yeah easy his expertise
yeah yeah so I'm not gonna come to this
that makes sense yeah yeah I actually
have pushed a lot of people's over to
Wendell's channel I've said if you want
to know about that stuff go to Wendell
he's very knowledgeable in those areas
so any such an sky answer that yeah that
that's the thing I think it's this
different tiers of that the YouTube
channels and to the tick YouTube
channels in terms of what content
they're trying to provide to the people
and that's not being mean because I
would count my channel as
or entertainment focused than many
others you see the differences between
them but that's just how people want to
do it and this obviously you have to
balance it as well if you make your
video is very very technical the average
consumer or average pc enthusiasts maybe
you would say would just be completely
lost the hardcore guys will understand
it but other people point so it's always
kind of a little bit of a balanced I try
to think of making it sort of casual
might be the wrong word but casual
enough that a lot of not what average
consumers can understand what you're
trying to say or talk about but make it
technical enough for the enthusiast also
sort of enjoy it and that's the thing i
don't think many guys know that a lot of
us do kind of have to wait a little bit
other tech youtubers people like steve
and stuff will probably know i mean i've
talked to steve about this as well but i
think that is that's very very harsh
wording wording to use for for us when
people are just trying to do the best
with the knowledge and the information
they have available to them and to say
that they're you know if you just miss
one thing I did to jump it so I think
that's a bit harsh well my my reply to
that would be what are you referring to
anger you can't just say well generally
it's been at what has been give us
examples of where there's a lack of
quality journalism give us an example of
where there's misinformation I need to
know because I thought a lot of my
content straight down the line no holds
barred this is how the testing ended up
and then I report on that that's what
it's always going to be like in my
channel so I don't think I've
misinformed anyone correct me if I'm
wrong yeah I think I think part of that
um when I talked to Jim from a dog TV me
and Jim get along really good um now
that so that's that's been good um but
yeah Jim points out a lot of things on
his channel and that that is good that
he's it that he's doing that but we're a
lot of us were just reporting the
numbers and stuff like me I'll just do
the tests get
the numbers then interpret those numbers
for you guys in my own way but I often
tell you guys hate this is just my
personal opinion let me know in the
comments what your opinion is and so we
can just go with those numbers and then
have a discussion about them and I think
that's what like what Brian does as well
a lot of the times too and that's the
way you can't can't really call it
misinformation or anything cuz all
they're doing is getting numbers and
then telling you guys about them or you
know interpreting them so yeah so let's
do it all right guys well that's a one
day of the show for this week I've also
got my patron set up thank you guys so
