water-cooling loop video I actually
failed in that the temperatures were
just too bad where the CPU was
overheating this time around however I'm
going to vlog the whole process of what
I've done to fix this water cooling loop
and also tell you guys the temperatures
this time around
so last time the water loop failed the
$50 water loop however this time around
I am going to be sanding this back until
it's pretty much as flat as it can get
and then I'm gonna be measuring out the
sockets on this motherboard and also
this GPU and then making up some custom
brackets for it so we're going to give
this round to and let's give it a shot
all right so we're just going to pause
right here and we can see by looking at
this how just convex shaped these
coolers really are now convex is pretty
much a terrible thing because the center
is going to be the furthest away from
the actual heat spreader so we're going
to keep sanding this until the whole
thing shiny and that means it will be
relatively flat
so now we're going to cut out the
brackets for the water blocks
check out my demo diem offs
so I've marked out the blocks now for
drilling and I've also got these three
mil screws from the hardware store and
they can see here they fit perfectly so
that's really good so we're all good to
go now with brown phase two of this all
right so we're just going to empty the
loop now because I need to measure up
the blocks so I can cut it through the
brackets so let's get that done okay so
looking inside this block here you can
see that there's like no fins really
there's just these little bumps and I
mean that's pretty terrible for the
performance but we'll do our best to get
this thing working
okay so we've measured out the blocks
now and we're going to start drilling
all right so I was filling up the water
loop and it's just leaking at two points
and that being the points where this
crap eBay clear tubing is connected so
I'm going to change that for the engine
hose stuff and then we're going to get
back to it
so rather than emptying the loop out I'm
just tipping it upside down now since it
was the bottom point as you can see
there the water is cleared out of this
pipe so I'll be able to hopefully hot
change it though I seriously do not
recommend doing this but you know I just
want to save some time because I'm tired
I'm on your master bed so let's do it
so our loop is now pretty much full I'm
just going to close it off and then
shake the case around to get any air
bubbles out and we hopefully should be
good to go all this time women have been
keeping us out of the loop on how to use
a hair dryer
so there we have it the $50 water
cooling loop is now officially working
though the amount of time I spent to get
this thing working just simply was not
worth it and I couldn't recommend this
to anyone still because those
temperatures are still a little bit high
especially for water cooling I mean the
GPU was going up to around 55 to 60
degrees depending on the ambience and
then the CPU was around that as well
they keep in mind though a good air
cooler something like a $30 and a max T
40 would do just as well as this CPU
core water cooling loop and when I check
the radiator temperatures as opposed to
the CPU temperatures for instance we
were still getting radiator temperature
of about 35 degrees which is really good
for a radiator and then contrast that to
the actual CPU core temps we can see
that the blocks still weren't efficient
enough and they still weren't picking up
enough heat now it's probably due to the
design I mean when I got a close glimpse
in there I can see that it was pretty
much just these little bumps and that's
pretty much pathetic for a water cooling
block so anyway the water cooling box
they do connect properly now to the GPU
die and the CPU it's just that the temps
are still a little bit low I also have
to pretty much call this a $60.00 loop
now because I had to spend some extra
money on materials like bolts and would
play and sandpaper and whatnot so there
it is guys the concept does work though
honestly for what it's worth I
yeah I guess it was just a lot of fun
and a big learning process but what I'm
trying to say is when it comes to water
cooling you just can't skimp on some of
those parts unless you want really
mediocre performance even for the money
and so that's what we had this time
around the CPU blocks even though I
sanded them back there's still garbage
that pump is still a little bit weak and
also things like that clear tubing that
you get off eBay be very careful with
that stuff I mean some of the stuff that
I got was just straight-up junk
however the radiator the reservoir and
the you know car hosing was pretty good
and I can recommend that stuff so stay
tuned for the upgraded
addition of this water loop where I will
be spending a budget of around 100 to
150 still haven't decided yet but
hopefully I'll get much better results
next time around so I look forward to
giving you guys that video also as
opposed to the build I will be doing a
showcase of that build very soon even
though it will be pretty much the worst
price performance use build I've done on
the channel it doesn't matter I've got
to show the negatives just like I show
the positives I guess that's something
that is the theme around here I don't
want to just be like hey guys we're
winning all the time know this was a big
loss and it was just one of those builds
that you kind of just want to put in the
closet and just forget about it
forget you ever made it and don't tell
anyone about it even though I'm telling
you guys about it probably wondering
about the overclocks on this platform
and they weren't that high and that was
due to another reason to do with the
actual memory that I used and it took me
a long time to figure this out but
essentially I got hosed from an eBay
seller selling 800 megahertz memory as
667 megahertz and on this platform it's
crucial to have that 800 megahertz
memory if you want to overclock the LGA
771 Zeon's the GPU however that was just
bound by the silicon lottery I did
manage to get around a 10% overclock on
that and even then it was running really
well with temps going around about max
260 degrees which is pretty good and I
was happy with that sort of guys that's
about it for me today if you like this
video then please give it a big thumbs
up if you have any questions or comments
about today's video then be sure to drop
a comment in the comment section below
and I'll get back to you as soon as I
can
and yeah if you haven't already
subscribed attack your city bro because
there's gonna be more of this stuff
coming every day
truth be careful of what you buy on eBay
I bought some 800 megahertz memory and
it was only 667 megahertz and that
caused me a lot of frustration when it
came to overclocking this platform a lot
of frustration
that wasted time it's not coming back
it's gone forever but I did learn a
lesson dude like seriously don't sing
again Brella hey you're watching the
bloopers I didn't force you to watch
this section is only the beginning but
I've already gone and lost my mind
I feel I'm making daisy chains and day
and night and seek did you hear that bit
the paint you playin Oh God
this is a tech video that's right this
is a tech video more bloopers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
