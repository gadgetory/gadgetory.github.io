he just coming back to you guys today
with a sort of like a how-to on how to
fix static on your computer or on your
recordings so basically guys I had a
long adventure and over the last few
days and I try to you know someone
commented in my videos I you got you
know some bad static and I was like I
listened to I was like yeah that is
pretty bad so I set it on on this epic
journey to figure out why this static
was causing you know what why was this
static coming and what what's causing it
and all these sort of questions I did
all this research Google went through
everything tried everything and I'm
finally coming out to you guys today
with a little guide I guess so if you've
got static problems and you want to get
the most out of your onboard sound and
your headset then this guide is for you
guys so let's get into it anyway first
first things first guys recording okay
so look here I've disabled and devices
you go to go to your devices and I've
disabled every device that I'm not using
I even unplugged the front audio ports
off the motherboard okay so then that's
the first thing I did all those are
disabled even the speakers the realtek
digital output is disabled as I'm not
using it at the moment
now let's go in that's that's the first
step disconnect all the stuff you're not
using and disable it next thing I did
guys go into properties and we're going
to go to levels and now we're going to
turn this all the way down to 15
that's right 15 guys because you know
you can edit and I guess not edit but
you know this will give you the nicest
sort of true voice expressions and all
that without sort of giving you too much
noise so I do this is the settings I've
found worked the best and as you can see
here you've got 15 and plus 30 decibels
so that'll give you you know that'll
make you Mick haribol so people can hear
you more audible and here we go to
enhancements disable all effects guys
bang disabled so I don't want any of
these effects I don't want no noise
suppression does work good but I found
it made my voice I couldn't express any
words or I couldn't express you couldn't
hear any emphasis in my voice so I
didn't like that setting and that's this
is why I'm set out to do all this you
know reduce static thing
so disable all sound effects I don't
like them and here I've got my default
format to channel 16-bit 48 kilohertz
and now I'm on a a LC 8 9 8 guys the the
audio codec on my z77 extreme 4
motherboard is an ALC 8 9 8 now I don't
know for some reason I it says it's sort
24-bit I can't see that I noticed if I
switch the drivers to Intel
high-definition drivers than it does
display 24-bit but I'd rather use the
real Tech High Definition drivers that's
that's something else for another day
but anyway that's this first setting
I've done the levels guys bang that was
and that's the second step I've done now
the third step is actually probably an
interesting one you guys might be a
little bit surprised by this but I did
find it made a difference if we go to
speakers here guys we will notice that
I've dropped it all the way down to 1 1%
yes all the way from 100 to 1 now what
this does is guys it basically I guess
if you drop it I found if I dropped it
all the way to 0 it'll actually cut my
whole sound card off and I don't want to
do that while I'm recording right so
that I guess what I did was I dropped
that down to 1 and I noticed that gave
me less noise so it kind of did a pretty
good job there now let's get on to the
next part which is the yes so that's
that part done I drop that down to 1 now
obviously guys if you're doing
commentaries this is probably not going
to be a problem for you and if you are
doing but if you are doing live streams
and you're playing video games while
you're recording you will want that
audio so you may wish to plug the front
speaker port in and use that front
speaker port whilst you're using the
rear Mick in or microphone input or mic
input for your microphone so that was
that guys so that was an interesting one
that I noticed did make a little bit of
a difference so drop that down to one
and I'm guessing because of this headset
this cord here if you can see here this
cord has both the mic and the speaker
wire integrated into the same cord
inside so if you know if we've got the
amp boost up
they're coming into the speaker's
probably going to cause noise to the
microphone inputs and such thin wires
that's just my theory anyway I don't
know if it's true but it did make it a
little bit of a difference so I'm going
to teach you guys anyway the next step
guys is here 704 picture 704 that I just
got off my did you can I move this is
for a hardware thing so I'm just going
to quickly show you on the desktop what
I did I took my graphics card which is a
GTX 670 and as you can see here this is
where the onboard audio is I'm pretty
sure and it's located right next to
where my graphics card used to be so
this is a full sized ATX motherboard
guys and I drop this down from here to
here to the other PCI Express three part
and basically they're both 16 speed
ports so it doesn't make a difference at
all and obviously if you're on a micro
ATX board you cannot do this basically a
micro ATX board is a board with only one
of these slots graphic slots so if you
have a full form ATX motherboard then
please by all means do this as well and
it may help so that's the fourth step I
did fifth step this was actually an
interesting one I took my computer off
the ground and put it on a little table
for some reason it may make a difference
but yeah it gets all the static on the
carpet is not going to interfere at all
with any of my audio anymore and I found
this made a little difference as well
all these little things make these
little differences that all add to the
final difference they all add to the
final you know overall end product sort
of thing so the end result so that's
those two things that I did guys and now
the last part is going to be obviously a
quick I'm going to show you guys I
grounded my power supply unit which I
didn't do before because in Japan I've
got a good excuse you know because in
Japan if you see here this is the
basically the power plug that goes into
your power supply unit and as you can
see is there's got two prongs and it's
got this little annoying earth
you've got to manually screw it down to
something and it's so short that you
can't you know you've got no distance so
what I did was actually had to make a
long cable and ground it to my window
frame seal which is steel and hopefully
that gives me you know it gives me a
decent grounding effect but you know I'd
love to have an extra prong which we do
I'm Australian so in Australia
they have the extra prong which is the
grounding prong which is great but
anyway that's unfortunate about the
Japanese earthing prong so that was you
know
and lastly obviously is the mini jacks I
grounded them as well so I took them out
of my computer and whack them on the
metal steel frame and I actually put
them on the car you know just to ground
them I wanted to get rid of them get rid
of all the grounding of me get a little
static inside so grounded those and see
as you can see here they're mini jacks
so their eighth of an inch big on both
ends so they're just this you know
basically the smallest ones you can get
you got the stereo jack mini jack and
you got the XLR so this is my razor car
case I think that's how you pronounce it
yeah this is my headphones guys and they
got the mini jacks I don't know if USB
makes a difference I haven't tried it
yet some people say USB makes a
night-and-day difference in terms of
noise I don't know but you know all
these things that I've done have made a
difference so anyway if you guys have
found your way to this video and you are
basically wanting to reduce your static
then you can try all these things and
let me know how you go and the last
thing that I did guys was I know typing
in caps updated my audio drivers so
updated my real tech drivers for my
onboard sound and that was the last
thing I did so anyway guys if you've got
any questions please let me know guys
and I'll get back to you as soon as I
can so please leave a comment in the
comment section below and of course
subscribe this has helped you as I do
like to help people and you know save
you guys time you know because I
couldn't find a whole guide out there
like this so I figured I'd just wise
will make one and next month I'm going
to be giving away a little desktop
youtube microphone sets the Sony
microphone set and I'm going to review
it I haven't actually got it yet but
hopefully gets here soon so I want to
get it done for my December giveaway so
you guys ah peace out for now brain easy
