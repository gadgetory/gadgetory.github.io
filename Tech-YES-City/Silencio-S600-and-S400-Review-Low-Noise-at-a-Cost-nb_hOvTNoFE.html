have released their new
Silencio series of cases this year.
This one being the S600 and
this one being the S400.
Now they sent then over to me and said
Tech Yes can you take a look at these
and tell us if they're the best.
And I said sure thing.
We'll get a couple of
builds going through them, but as always
with a case review,
I'm going to be putting these things
under the temperature test.
We're going to be putting
a 32 core thread ripper
inside with a 2080 TI
in this one, the S600,
which comes in at about
100 U.S., or in Australia
139 AUD. The micro ATX
version, we're going
to be shoving a 780 TI build in that too,
and putting this under the stress test
to see if this one can handle the heat.
Now this one comes a little bit cheaper.
In the U.S., it's 10 dollars cheaper,
and then in Australia, it's about 20 AUD
cheaper.
Now, these cased do
have the option to mount
a tempered glass side
panel on both of them, and
in Australia, I think
it's like 10 more dollars
to get the tempered glass option,
but basically earlier in the year,
they released the NR400
and NR600 and Cooler Master
told me these differ from
the NR series in that
they've got sound dampening inside,
and they've also got FP120 fans.
And these are essentially
designed to be quieter
and use less power.
The one thing I will
critique straight out of the
get go, is there's not
two mounted at the front.
So, there's one mounted at the front,
one mounted at the rear,
so you get two included
fans with these cases,
both of them, the S400
and the S600, but I
would like to see these
kitted out with additional
fans to fill the
slots, especially when
you're approaching that
100 USD price tag, but
anyway with that aside, let's
build up these two PCs,
and I can tell you guys
all the things I liked
and disliked about these
new S series cases.
(rock music)
So first things first with
this case, if you want
to even try, even not, not an extended ATX
motherboard, but even
some of those motherboards
that just come out that
little bit extra, then
it won't fit in this case.
It's max standard ATX.
Also, we had a bit of problems with
this power supply here.
It didn't fit,
uh, so I think the
maximum supported power supply length is
160 ml long.
(rock music)
So we finished up the second
build here in the S600
and the rave ripper. That
is a pretty big cooler
and it just fits. So you've
got to about 167 ml in
CPU clearance for an air cooler.
In terms of radiator
spot, you can fit up to a
120 ml fan and rad at the
back, 240 ml at the top,
and a 280 at the front.
Though if you do wish to
install a 280 or a 240 at
the front, then you will
have to remove the optical disk drive.
Now in terms of dust filters,
you get one at the front
that is detachable.
You can clean that
easily. You've also go the
option at the top to change
this from a mesh filter
to a hard enclosed panel.
Though keep in mind,
you will restrict air flow
if you do this, though
I will be testing
temperatures very soon. Then,
lastly at the bottom,
you get very shallow feet
to give a very sort of low profile look,
and there is a dust
filer underneath the case
as well.
As for the S400, that is
not just a smaller case in
terms of micro ATX, but
it's also not as long.
So you can only fit up to a 390 millimeter
graphics card, but I
shouldn't say only, but I
did say that in contrast to
the S600 where you can fit
up to a 398 ml long GPU.
Though on the front you
can only fit up to a 240
ml rad ves versus a 280
on the S600, but again
you will have to remove
that optical disk drive
if you want to install
those bigger radiators
or fans in both the front
and the top.
Now with all that out
of the way, it's finally
time to do some temperature
tests, and also some
noise level tests, and
then come back to you guys,
and give you the
conclusion on the Silencio.
(upbeat music)
So we just finished up
the temperature test
on the S400 with the GTX
780 TI, and I'll throw
up some graphs for you guys
where this combination,
surprisingly, was putting
out over 300 watts.
Actually right about 350
watts, so the 780 TI can
definitely dump a lot of heat.
And what we saw here with
100% fan speeds to keep
things consistent, was that
having both the tempered
glass side panel on and
also having the standard
sound dampening side
panel on, both raised the
temperatures quite
substantially, over that of just
having no side panel
on. So we saw 78 degrees
and 52 degrees on the
CPU, and then with the
sound dampening on, we
had 80 degrees and at
52 degrees again on the CPU. But having no
side panel on, we saw
the temperature drop down
to 67 degrees, and then on
the CPU, 40 degrees flat.
So we had noise at 54
decibels with no side
panel on, and mesh filter on the top.
But then when we put
the side panel on, both
tempered glass and the
silent panel scored in at 50
decibels. And then when
we put the hard cover
on the top in replacement
of the mesh filter,
we then dropped down to 49 decibels.
One thing I will say
about the side panel with
the sound dampening on
was, though, even though
the sound meter wasn't
picking it up, it was
definitely dropping down the higher pitch
frequencies, making it the quietest of the
bunch. But the last two temperature tests
we did was changing
that mesh cover over to
the hard cover, and we
saw temperatures raised
from 78 degrees to 81 degrees on the GPU,
and 52 to 53 on the CPU,
but having the front
open in terms of testing the air flow
in terms of its restrictiveness saw the
temperatures drop on the GPU with the
mesh filter on, down
to 76 degrees and then
48 degrees on the CPU side.
So ultimately with the
S400, sound dampening
does come at a cost of
raising temperatures.
But let's test out now
the S600 with the 32 core
and also the 2080 TI.
(upbeat music)
So, the S600 did show some
better sound dampening,
at least with the noise
meter, than the S400
did, and that's what we
were talking about just
before with S400 was
different noises to my
ears sound louder and don't sound as loud
to the noise meter perhaps.
And so, what we saw with
the S600 was basically
some louder noises at the
frequency that the noise
meter was picking up, and
that panel was blocking that out.
(upbeat music)
It's a cozy 23 degrees in
here. Like yeah that's what
I thought. Like I'm
sitting at the camera and
I'm tired.
So we've now added in an
LED fan and also an LED
strip. Gives it a bit
more bling, but also the
temperatures did substantially
drop on the GPU with
the 780 TI. We went from
78 degrees to 72 degrees
and then on the CPU
side of things, we went
all the way down to 43 degrees.
So this is why in the intro,
I kind of critique the case for not
having enough fans from the get go.
They do make a big
difference. Even something
like this in the background,
which is about a three
dollar LED fan from
Ebay, can make such a big
difference for temperatures.
Especially when
you're then putting two
intake fans at the front,
bringing in that cool air and having that
outtake fan bringing it out the back.
But with that aside,
let's move over now to a
conclusion on the S400 and S600.
So basically when it
comes down to the Silencio
series, you're getting
a case that looks good,
has the sound dampening,
which will reduce noise,
but at the same time, it
will cost you temperatures.
And so I think it's geared
up toward someone who
wants to put in low powered components,
or make something that's
enthusiast, but not
over clock it. As we
saw here today, I didn't
even over clock the 780
TI, and the 32 core build
with the 2080 TI, that
was a little bit too much
for this case to handle.
But on the same token,
it did have phenomenal
build quality. I did
like the fact that it had
all the standoffs pre-installed
for a standard ATX
board on the S600 and then
for an S400, a standard
micro ATX fit. There's
some other touches that
I did like on the case
was the cushioning for
the power supply at the
bottom. The actually put a ring
inside as to stop any
vibrations coming out
in the form of noise if
you mount a power supply
with a high RPM fan. It's also nice to see
them include a standard
SD card reader, though
I will critique this in
only having USB2 support.
I'd like to see them
upgrade that to USB3, since
you will cap out on
memory transfers at USB2
speed. So, I guess it's fine for 1080p
video editing, but I'm
guessing the Silencio series
is geared up towards that
professional that wants
very clean aesthetic, wants
to keep noise down, but
still have good components
inside for doing
4k video editing for example.
So, ultimately, with the
Silencio series bringing
it down to you guys with
the concise verdict, if
you want to go with this
model, I'd only go with it
for the sound dampening.
With that, I wouldn't go
with the tempered glass
model. I'd just go with
the standard side panel
with that dampening inside
over the tempered glass
model, which costs more
money. And even then, you
can go with the NR series
tempered glass if you
want that look and save
some money versus this S400
and S600 Silencio series.
With that aside, I hope
you enjoyed today's video.
If you did, then be sure to
hit that like button for us.
Also, let us know, in the
comments section, below,
what you think of Cooler
Master's new cases coming out
in 2019. Do you think they're
going in the right direction
with that clean look, or do you think they
need to do something else entirely?
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions, as always.
And I'll catch you guys
on another tech video
very soon.
Peace out for now.
Bye.
