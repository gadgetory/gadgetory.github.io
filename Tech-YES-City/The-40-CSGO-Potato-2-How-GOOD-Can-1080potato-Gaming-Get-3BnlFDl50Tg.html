all that time ago people would argue
that that's what made tech yes city what
it is today and to that I agree we did
indeed build this channel up on potatoes
and today I have the second installment
here right beside me where we've picked
up a bargain PC for 30 Australian
dollars and of course we're gonna give
it some real budget upgrades and see
what we can get out of this thing and of
course see our performs in csgo
welcome back to tech yesterday this is
brand coming to you guys today were the
second installment of the Cisco potato
so the original one we built that it was
awesome value for money and besides the
potato theme which I thought it would
perform pretty badly it performed really
well today we're hoping to beat those
scores with this PC that we picked up
here for $30.00 when I saw this thing I
knew exactly what I had to do with it we
picked it up in a used PC parts hunt
which I do here every month on the
channel and so I was amazed that the
value for money this thing was offering
on paper and of course when I got a home
it did indeed boot up but we do have to
give it some upgrades it didn't come
with a hard drive it's got a dual core
as well which is really old and dated
and it's got a crappy cooler and a
crappy power supply so we've got here a
Core 2 quad which is a 4 core potato but
at least we're getting double the potato
that we're originally getting with the
CPU that's in there we've got this and
the cooler out of a dumpster PC that we
got and this hard drive here 160
gigabyte Seagate hard drive also got
this out of a dumpster now the power
supply is a Power Man 400 watt power
supply pick this up in a used PC part
hunt a couple of months ago got it in a
$100 system so I'm technically gonna
price it up at around 10 dollars because
that's what you would expect to pay for
something like this so this brings the
whole total of this PC to around forty
or strain dollars which would be around
32 US dollars so very cheap coming in
even cheaper than the last csgo potato
but with that said we've got one filthy
PC here and some potatoes on it so we're
gonna take the potatoes away and we'll
put them back on later for the b-roll
but we're gonna give this thing a proper
tech yeah City cleanse and see what we
can make do
so now we're pulled apart the last of
the pieces before we start cleansing and
this is a GTX 275 but you can see here
the thermal pads basically like news so
I believe someone has already opened
this card up even recently perhaps and
given it a cleanse because the thermal
paste is still pretty wet and also the
screws have indications of threading on
them it looks as if someone has used the
wrong screwdriver when they previously
attempted to open this graphics card up
but that aside we've got this whole
dirty PC here and we're gonna cleanse it
down of course with alcohol wipes and
brake cleaner
so now it's time for that moment of
truth we are gonna try and boot it up
and see if we can get a signal okay
there we go just had to turn the power
on to the back
oh yeah
okay so now we've got this at three
point three six Giga it's pretty odd
number but the FSB numbers actually
quite a magical number 420 and the
temperatures in here about 25 degrees
ambient at the moment and you can see
the temperatures there even after just
five minutes of testing it's about
seventy hitting 77 degrees so generally
you don't want to take these over the
torture quads
over about 80 degrees so I'm pretty
comfortable with this overclock now I
think this is going to be the overclock
that we shall run the games with but
let's quickly run a Cinebench score and
see how good this Q 8400 gets
so we've just finished overclocking the
graphics card and that is running really
well the CPUs running really well too so
that benchmark looks pretty good and
I'll quickly show you guys the settings
so you'll have something to match that
to as well as the Cinebench score so if
you do have a potato that's of similar
spec and it's not running as well then
you know you have to maybe reinstall
windows or tune-up windows or do
something else to get some more
performance at a PC but there is one
problem and that is this two sticks of
memory it is indeed three gigabytes so I
thought it was four in my vlog I swear I
saw four gigabytes for some reason but
we can see on one side of this the
memory stick the right one
there's no banks on that stick so it is
indeed a three gigabyte configuration so
we'll see if that does indeed run csgo
okay and if it does and we might try
some other games but you probably hear
the fan noise is really loud too because
I've overclocked the gravis card and
then max the fan speeds so it doesn't
overheat but let's get on with the show
so here I was trying to record the most
Pro csgo footage you've ever seen in
your life and it's just yeah I got it on
camera it completely dropped out so it
looked like it needs more memory so
we've got an extra two look I think it's
three gigabytes of memory here we're
gonna try and install this and see if we
can get it working if this doesn't work
then I don't know maybe we can only play
csgo with a few players on the map okay
so we now have 5 gigabytes of memory
very odd configuration but let's see if
that csgo de dust2 works
so there it is the results are in and
this computer place CS go a little bit
better than the last csgo potato that we
did so we're getting around an extra 10
to 20 FPS in that title with the exact
same video graphical settings however
one thing to note with csgo is that they
did improve the game they updated the
game since the last time I did that last
PC so I'm not too sure if that makes it
more graphically intensive or if it's
more optimized for the CPU but it was
running a little bit better on this
potato than it was on the last potato
that we built and the good thing to come
out of this is that if you're on a
budget and you want to get into PC
gaming games like csgo and even dota 2
which I tested on this rig by the way
and it played 60fps at 1080p on medium
settings at a hundred percent screen
resolution setting so it was really good
gaming experience for the money I mean
we paid thirty dollars for the PC added
some extra components and of course we
needed that extra memory but I think if
you want to get into some of these
titles that are very popular multiplayer
titles and you'll need at least four
gigabytes of ddr2 memory on this PC as
we saw with the three gigabytes csgo
started just chopping out it was an
unplayable experience and I didn't even
want to try the other games with that
three gigabytes but after we added in
that memory it was smooth sailing the
game was playing extremely well and I
guess that's the purpose of this video
all jokes aside is that you can get in
to PC gaming on an extreme budget for
instance if you're a teenager and you've
got no job and your parents don't want
to give you much money for a PC then you
can put together some pieces and put
together something that'll still play
games reasonably well and give you an
enjoyable experience and then after your
parents see how addicted you are to
video games
they'll perhaps think about purchasing
you a better PC you could also be that
guy with a bigger budget but you don't
want to spend much money on PC game apps
you only like one particular game on the
PC well in that case you might only want
to spend a real little bit of money save
your money for other things in life and
this is what it's all about hit with
this ears ago potato it is just one PC
they can get up and play the game and
dota 2 but I know you're probably
thinking what about a more modern title
can something like this play for
instance
whatnot and let's check it out
so I'll be damned if this thing could
get up and play for tonight with over 60
FPS at a lot of the times it was
actually a smooth experience keep in
mind when we first did the automatic
recommended settings it was a pretty bad
experience getting around 20 FPS but
when we put on the lowest settings it
got up to over 60 fps a lot of times I
think I even saw it get up to 90 at one
stage which was incredible considering
this is like a $30.00 PC plus a few
extra dollars on some other components
and I really didn't expect it to play
for night but it did and it was to the
point where I could still get some frags
still have a good experience and I
haven't played this game in a few months
either and I'm pretty bad at it so and
also another cool thing that I noticed
while doing this video was if you have
an unattended in exclusive full screen
it'll get rid of that message so you can
play games on a non activated Windows 10
copy and you'll be having a good time
and lastly of course the PC itself we
cleaned it up with brake cleaner that's
something I've been using for a while
you can make sure it's non-chlorinated
if you don't want to damage any parts
but I've never had a problem with either
we use wd-40 to give it that new look
shine and compared to what it originally
was I think it looks a lot better and of
course we overclock the CPU put in those
bits and potatoes and even a potato hard
drive for example and just a few little
components and we made something that
runs really well the synergy was
actually pretty good if you saw in the
games you had the CPU at high percentage
usage you had the graphics card a high
percentage usage as well so that was a
really good combo for a budget so I was
pretty impressed with this PC but I want
to hear you guys in the comments tell me
what you think of this PC if you liked
it and be sure to hit that like button
and let me know if you didn't like
something about the video too and I'll
try and work on that for another video
in the future and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
some would say have a break bird cut
that thing off come on
okay test Mic Check Mic Check Mic Check
1 2 testing one two okay some would say
you
also some cool things about the original
video that I'm still using in this video
is that $10 tripod that I used all that
time ago and of course this same t-shirt
as that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
