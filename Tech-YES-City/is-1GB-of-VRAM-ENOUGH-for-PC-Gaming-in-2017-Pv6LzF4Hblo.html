managed to pick up a HD 69 54 around
about 30 US dollars however it had one
problem and that is it only had one
gigabyte of VRAM on board and I know you
guys are wondering is this enough for
today titled at 1080p well let's find
out welcome back to tokyo city is brand
coming to you guys today with that video
that you may or may not have wanted to
see I don't know I'm not too sure but
this is the HD 69 50 which was the
graphic style that was released by AMD
in 2010 in the month of December the one
gigabyte variant came in with an MSRP of
259 US dollars and the 2 gigabyte
variant came in with an MSRP of $299 the
guide itself features fourteen hundred
and eight stream processors 88 texture
mapping units and also 32 rasterization
output unit and is built on a 40
nanometer fabrication process which was
later succeeded by the infamous GCN
architecture which was fabricated on 28
nanometer so with that aside how does
this graphics card perform in 2017 well
there's good news and bad news and we'll
get off with the good news first and
that is if you're a CS go player or a
dota 2 player then this graphics card
did ample fine at 1080p 100% resolution
scale on low settings dota 2 was getting
up near 200 FPS and csgo was flying past
200 FPS so if all you're after is a
gratis card to play games competitively
in other dota 2 or csgo then the HD 69
50 for around about 30 USD is actually a
pretty good buy however as I started
moving through the list of games I found
that overwatch the frame rates was
starting to get lower and lower
1080p low settings with 100% resolution
scale which looked at okay was getting
around 60 to 90 FPS however when we
moved into the infamous pub G this is
where things got really nasty 1080p I
just could not play this game at all at
very low settings it was the worst
experience I've had in pub G yet scoring
really low frame rates but not only that
getting some of the most ugliest
stuttering I've seen in this game to
date so 1080p on very low settings on
the 6950 in players unknown
battlegrounds was a complete
failure though what about dropping it
down to 720p and this is where I had
high hopes I mean coming into the game
720p very low settings I was flying in
and the frame rates were pretty smooth I
thought I could get away with a playable
experience but it was until I landed
that things got really bad yet again and
it was just a really terrible experience
you couldn't enjoy this game on this
graphics card unfortunately so three out
of four games were okay so far for the
69 50 however decided to test one more
game and this was Mass Effect Andromeda
which was released this year and this
game high blocked the graphics card to
720p else quite surprised and when I
dropped the settings down to very low I
was actually surprised this graphics
card could play this game on 720p low
settings with a pretty desirable
experience from 60 FPS all the way up to
90 fps constantly so there you have it
one gigabyte of VRAM is kind of okay in
2017 but it really depends on the games
and of course the settings if you are
just a competitive player that wants to
get into overwatch csgo or dota 2 on a
budget and something like this for cheap
can get you very far
however if you want to play pub G
competitively then I'd recommend at
least getting a graphics card with 2
gigabytes of vram onboard in the case of
the 660ti which I picked up for around
about 45 US dollars that did a
phenomenal job of playing pub G 1080p
settings very low with good frame rates
so if you want to step up your game for
pub G then the minimum recommendation
would be something like a 660ti or a HD
7870 and another thing to remember if
you're getting an old card like this you
also may have to change over the thermal
paste this card here when I first
installed it the temperatures were all
over the place they are ridiculously
high for idle temperatures - which is a
good indication that the cooler is not
making proper contact with the GPU so I
said about taking the cooler off and
taking all the thermal paste off which
was really crusty it actually took me a
good five minutes to replace the thermal
paste and of course after that we'll
back up and running with really good
temperatures and oh guys hope you
enjoyed today's video and if you did
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comments section
below would you bother with something
like a 69 50 love reading your comments
as always and I'll catch you in another
tech
videos very soon peas now for now bye
Oh so this guide was designed in 2010
and it's got four display ports two DVI
ports and no HDMI port which is really
bizarre
