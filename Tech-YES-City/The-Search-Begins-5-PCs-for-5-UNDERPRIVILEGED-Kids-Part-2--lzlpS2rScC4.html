intention is to give them away to five
underprivileged kids in my local
community here on the Gold Coast and
today we're going to go around and see
if we can find those five kids or at
least find some contacts where we can
get in touch to give these pcs away to
five underprivileged kids so what are we
waiting for let's get on
so we're just now at the first school
but it is past 4:00 p.m. and
unfortunately in Australia practically I
just found out now that everyone
finishes work at like 4:00 or 4:30 at
the state or public schools now a state
in a public school is essentially a
school in Australia that's free to go to
you don't have to pay any money the
services are provided by the government
and this is where we're going to come
back tomorrow as a starting ground to
find these five kids and yes that is
kangaroos in the background at this very
particular school it's pretty awesome
being in Australia sometimes so it's now
after lunch and I've just dropped into
the first school this is actually where
I grew up as a kid this school is very
special to me and I just handed him a
business card and they're gonna ask
around the whole school and see if they
can get back to me with some
underprivileged kids but err with that
aside let's go around to a couple more
schools and see if we can spread the
good word so now I just finished up at
the second school and they're gonna pass
an email on to the guidance counselor
this is looking really good hopefully
the news will spread around and we can
get some of these kids those gaming PC's
but there's still a third school just
down the road as well we're gonna drop
into the one yesterday and the intro I'm
gonna see if they know anyone that needs
a gaming PC so now we just got back from
the 3rd school and they were really nice
to me I met the deputy principal also
met the librarian who helped me out a
lot and they had their own little show
that they were filming for the school
and they essentially asked me if I
wanted to help them do YouTube and help
them make some videos and teach them
some of the stuff that I've learned here
with the channel I said absolutely ok
and it's just really opening up my mind
how I can just in one day go around in
three different places get email
contacts and just start trying to make a
difference locally because that's the
whole point of this giveaway is that I
want to show people that instead of
giving their PC parts to me they can try
and do what I do and then I give back to
the local communities where they are and
help build up the local community and
make it a better place and so this will
be an ongoing series it'll definitely
take longer than I thought it would and
I do need to go get a blue card as well
to apparently be anywhere to school or
work anywhere with children's so I will
be getting one of those as well so stay
tuned these children will be getting
these PCs and I do want to document it
and just show how much of a difference
just doing something like giving away a
gaming PC can change someone's life and
now I know
Edie from Texas did do a video where he
did a full set up refresh but I think
with Edie he should have seen that the
person he was doing this for lived in a
mansion already I mean that would have
been a ringing alarm bells for me
personally but anyway I'm gonna be
working with these schools and hopefully
we can get this done the sooner the
better so I hope to get the next episode
out sometime next month I will keep you
guys updated and of course with the PCs
themselves the specs I'll put them in
the description below if you guys want
to see what pcs I'm giving away I
probably will upgrade these as well make
them even better as I see the kids and
their reactions and them wanting to get
these gaming pcs it's probably gonna be
a crazy event I've never done this
before and I sort of wanted to branch
out and start helping the city that I
love and that's the Gold Coast I grew up
here it's home to me and yeah I just I
love the Gold Coast so much you guys I
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
if you have anything you just want to
add or any feedback then drop it in the
comments section below
I love reading you guys's comments all
the time as I said before this project I
think it will take a lot longer than I
expected because there are a few
loopholes to jump through we do have to
find the right can
dates but people are just so positive if
you show a bit of positivity first and
it's a great thing I want to spread the
message sort of especially the PC tech
scene especially the user price
performance scene if we can help out
people then exactly what we're going to
be doing so I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
