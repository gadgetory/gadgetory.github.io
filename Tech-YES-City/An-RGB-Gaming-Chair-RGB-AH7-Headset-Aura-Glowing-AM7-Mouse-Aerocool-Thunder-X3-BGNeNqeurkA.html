Brian and I'm live here at the arrow
cool and fun directory gaming booth here
in Computex 2017 in Taiwan and Erika and
collaborated with x3 they're the same
companies doing different kind of brands
but they're making some really cool
products here in 2017 I think they're
going to hit the market in August to
October somewhere in between then and
they're actually hitting with some
really cool air coolers that are going
to integrate RGB and also water cooling
as well and then they've got some really
nice cases here behind me and of course
they're hitting in hard with and the
chair with sort of like RGB lighting I
don't know how that's going to work
entirely 2017 Computex coverage for tech
yes city was voted by MSI and course
there for a limited time only you can
get a free copy of Ghost Recon wildlands
Lux division with any purchase of an MSI
product click the link in description
below to find out more closely moving
into the era cool booth they had some
awesome RGB water coolers and air
coolers on display which utilize either
error calls owned hardware based
controllers or can utilize third-party
software syncing something like mystic
lightning from MSI so guys I'm here with
my favorite two cases of this lineup
this is the quartz acrylic so erekle
essentially if said look a lot of people
don't like tempered glass or can't
afford a tempered glass case so what
they've done in this situation is
they're putting acrylic panels on here
but they kind of look like tempered
glass so really cool design if it hits
the market at the right price and now
another case on display is the quartz
for this thing is tempered glass and of
course it's a little bit larger than the
quartz acrylic so if you have the extra
money you want the extra room and of
course want the tempered glass then this
is going to be the case for you both
these cases do look pretty cool and
pretty sleek as we're finishing up on
the booth filming for the era cool
section we were enjoying a seat on the
project 7 gaming chair when suddenly a
wild and rabid I 5 fanboy popped out of
nowhere so joke society science Studios
Greg Salazar was an awesome guy to meet
in person and was very easy to get along
with they laughter he kicked us off his
chair with
fully integrated RGB lighting we got
back to business I was told this chair
was working off lithium batteries and
the lighting was very subtle so it
wasn't too bright in the dark part of
the room it only lit up slightly so it
wasn't bright enough to be a distraction
anyways it was a good first attempt for
miracle though how practical having RGB
lighting on your chair is as well anyone
guess but the chair was very comfortable
to say the least with the comforts you
would want from adjustable heights to
having 180-degree lay it also featured
leatherette style material through the
front and back and had super comfy
cushioning which did make for a good
break anyone now they've got a KitKat
for the yes-man Erica also had a lounge
section of the booth where they were
sporting their comfy beanbag and couches
these are really comfortable space out
and relax to the mariokart being played
on display with my good friend mr.
Walton from Hardware unboxed however
when we were asked about details on
release dates or pricing there was no
information to be had and there are
really early concepts so I'm not sure
when these designs will hit the market
or if they will even be released so let
us know if you think it's a cool design
in the comment section
as for the RGB chair there was no
pricing or availability yet but Eric
will do inform us that this may hit the
market in October this year then moving
on to the next booth we have the Thunder
x3 section where they have the under x3
headset which was adjustable to fit
those small and large head and had an
aura type RGB lighting coming out both
sides of the cans the sound quality was
surprisingly very good there was no
attached mic to test out though besides
the RGB lighting there is a 50 mm into
included drivers in both sides moving on
with the peripherals we have the am7
gaming mouse just designed for a right
or left-handed gamers so it is
ambidextrous and it will fit
configurations find with textures even
being symmetrical too on both the sides
the new am7 thunder x3 mount is also
supported by the hex software which
allows gamers to customize the mouse at
the core of all this is the Pixar EMW
3360 Center which is one of the very
most popular centers out there
supporting up to 12,000 dpi the buttons
utilized on
switches around for at least 20 million
clicks they also have their rm5 mouse
which is designed for right-handed
gamers and is suited for pom or
corporate users here erekle is using the
pmw 3325 center and this has support for
up to 5,000 DPM along with of course
online gaming switches the clicks
themselves felt very smooth and were too
hard on any of the mice used as for
availability though I'm told that these
will hit the shelves in October but no
official word on pricing just yet
finally the last Thunder x3 product on
display was this slim mechanical gaming
keyboard called the a k7 which I'm told
is inspired by supercar aerodynamic
vents which if that's something to go by
then this will also increase your FPS on
your gaming machine quite substantially
though as for the styling I love the
aluminium base and also the pronounced
key caps in addition to the RGB keys
there is also an RGB LED strip that runs
across the top and bottom of the
keyboard
much like the mouse mea k7 also features
a detachable wrist rest and has
dedicated macro keys that can work with
the same Mac software as the mouse you
know guys that's it for our coverage of
the Thunder X and error cooled booths
the 2017 I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video and if you did and be sure to hit
that like button and let us know in the
comments section below if you enjoyed
any of these products and if so what and
why love reading your comments as always
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon please now for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
