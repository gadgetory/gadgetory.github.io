you coming back I'm just gonna compare
today fraps first Camtasia Studio 8 so I
was looking for a comparison and I could
not find any comparisons out there so I
thought I'd do one myself and show you
guys so this is dota 2 guys first off we
have fraps at 30 frames per second so
this I noticed there was no input lag
it's it's very smooth and yeah guys as
you can see if yourself it's you know
perhaps is very good it does make really
large file sizes though okay
and so that's fraps that's 30 frames per
second now let's look at it's probably
you know big competitor camtasia studio
8 so i know contagious studio has a big
following now a lot of people like the
program so I thought I'd test it myself
and let's look at the exact same
settings 30 frames per second I've got
the you know the image quality thing
rounding to 4 so it's the best quality I
got the audio turned off and the webcam
turned off as well so as you can see
there there's a little bit of lag and a
little bit of micro stutter from time to
time but overall is doing a fantastic
job considering the extra features that
can't age' Studio 8 offers so it does
compress the files smaller you know and
it does allow you to record your webcam
at the same time and it does you know
but it does have to render an additional
time so that's something to remember
remember you have to render an
additional one once on the additional
time so I'll so anyway guys let's look
at fraps at 60 frames per second so I
frappe but at the same time fraps allows
you to go up to 120 frames per second so
that's something that fraps can do that
candidate of studio 8 counts you know up
to you ultimately as you can see here is
just looks really good it's so
ridiculously good so ultimately guys
it's up to you what you want to do with
your software you know both will take
care of you both are fine but they're
going to give you a good video quality
if you know if you want the best video
quality then I'd go for fraps if you
want sort of small file sizes and better
flexibility and
of recording your webcam and stuff then
probably go for Camtasia Studio 8 yeah
guys i just thought i'd show you the
difference between the two and you know
my computer is the specs are just right
here so you can see i'm running a pretty
beast computer also guys this helps you
out please subscribe and also if you got
any questions please ask in the comment
section below here i guess that's it
peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
