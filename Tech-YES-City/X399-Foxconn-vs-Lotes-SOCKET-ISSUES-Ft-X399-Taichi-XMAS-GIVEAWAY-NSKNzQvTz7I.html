and in that time we've seen the flagship
1950 x16 core CPU go down to as little
as $800 on sale where it currently
resides now at $900 as of the time of
this video an incredible CPU if you can
utilize all the power that it has though
one tough sell to customers has been the
high average price of X 399 motherboards
at this time the cheapest x3 nano
motherboard on Amazon is that board that
we have here today the X 399 taiji as
well as an international giveaway
involving these two motherboards right
beside me to the left here they're more
on that later a big part of why this
motherboard cost so much compared to
other boards is quite simply the insane
amount of hardware needed to go into
this board not just in the form of high
amount of traces stronger vrm more PCB
layers more solder on USB ports etc but
also a much larger socket and by much
larger it is indeed huge the tr4 socket
measures in a whopping seventy eight mil
by a hundred and twenty millimeters that
is over four times larger than the am
for socket which measures in it roughly
50 millimeters by 45 millimetres though
a tricky dilemma that has been faced
with enthusiasts buying X 399
motherboards and also verizon thread
Ripper CPUs has been an odd dilemma with
the socket itself when installing the
CPU there has been many reports of the
Foxconn sockets simply not being able to
thread the bolts when trying to screw
down the socket cover and I indeed did
manage to replicate this problem when
screwing down the CPU in the closing
order of one two and three and this
happened especially when I was screwing
the first screw down all the way first
before threading the other screws they
did manage to thread but they needed an
immense amount of pressure and amount
which I'm sure most people are not
comfortable doing I did however find a
workaround for the Foxconn socket and
that was to just initially thread all
one two and three screws and then
tighten them down after threading them
this seemed to be the least amount of
hassle and saved the most time though
what about the other socket choice the
loath socket which is a different
company from Foxconn altogether so
essentially a different make for the TR
for 399 socket and I had no
problems with the Lodz version doing
both methods of the first thread tighten
down fully or threading one two and
three lightly and then tightening them
down so the Lodz version is more builder
friendly and this is where it gets
tricky because apparently motherboard
manufacturers used both interchangeably
and the board we have here today the XS
three nine nine Tai Chi from asrock uses
the load socket though other samples
sold in the world can use the Foxconn
socket and it really comes down to
whether or not this is a problem for you
personally
I honestly think for the price that the
boards cost this should be a problem
that doesn't exist there with the sheer
size and dimensions of the thread Ripper
socket it is easy to see that the four
thousand and ninety four pins worth of
CPU coverage does require a very stable
and firm locking mechanism as even a pin
loose at a micro level could mean the
difference between smoke and whistles so
really it can be an annoying problem but
one that shouldn't be too hard to
overcome if you do have a Foxconn socket
as I said before just lightly thread the
screws firstly and then tighten them all
down to wrist level tied in terms of pin
thickness I didn't notice the difference
between the two sockets and the biggest
difference however was with the three
screws themselves the load screws Worth
dinner and the Foxconn screws with
thicker though nothing I wanted to talk
to you guys about today was this
motherboard to the left of me the x3 99
Tai Chi and asrock are going to be
giving away this and also a fatality
professional gaming so that's 2 X 399
motherboards international giveaway
it'll begin today so the link is in the
description below all you have to do is
click that link gain some entries and
also it's completely free as well no
strings attached and I will be
announcing the winners on a live stream
so you know there's no funny buggers and
then announcing them on Twitter after
that if you can't catch the live stream
this will be happening on Christmas Eve
so good luck to you guys and I hope you
win it'll be a great Christmas for
someone out there so make sure also as
well there's more giveaways coming this
month so stay subscribed with
notifications turned on because the
season of giving is now becoming this
season of yes and with that said let's
take a look at the x3 990 motherboard
and what you're getting here is an
extremely well-constructed motherboard
now I've already tested out various
external motherboards in a detailed
comparison which I'll put the link for
in the video in the description below
though the fatality did very well in
that comparison managing to get my 1950
x2 4 gigahertz on all 16 cores with a H
100 Corsair cooler as we cool as though
one thing I will point out is that you
may want to buy a cooler specifically
designed for X 399 I know Animax
designed that to our fourth series that
has a much bigger block to cover the
massive heat spreader implemented in the
thread Ripper design though if I can get
4 gigahertz on an H 100 which was never
designed for a CPU this big imagine what
you could do with a bigger cooler since
the 1950s is the top 5% of chips that is
an V Binns the best of the best with
these CPUs go back to the asrock board
11 phase V RM with a true phase is
dedicated to the CPU and three for the
system-on-chip voltage the board
features 60 amp IR 355 MOSFETs 60 amp
chokes and PopCap tantalum capacitors
basically this VR M is the real deal and
will be good for sustaining solid
overclocks
on water or air as for audio crosstalk
is extremely low amperage is good
they'll be careful with raising the
volume level above 90 at 91 there is a
bizarre leaking of crosstalk but seems
to happen on every motherboard that I've
had come through here in the later half
of 2017 from all four different
motherboard manufacturers as for
aesthetics it has a different heatsink
and a slightly different aesthetic on
the board itself though mainly for what
it's worth it looks very similar and
performs identical to the gaming
professional x3 99 motherboard the only
difference being that the professional
has a 10 gigabits per second additional
nicht solution offered which does raise
the price exactly a hundred retail so I
would say that most people getting x3
na9 would use it for professional
workstation purposes or at least I would
think so and ultimately asrock offer a
very solid option with their Tai Chi
lineup and this board comes in at 340 us
currently or if you're in Australia you
can get it for 442 Australian dollars
which in terms of exchange rates it's
actually a pretty good deal down under
then when it comes down to it with the
Taiji X 3 9 our motherboard versus the
professional gaming it's really about
that tanking of its Ethernet solution
whether you need that for a hundred
dollar premium
is up to you though keep in mind for
that hundred dollar premium it actually
is worth it when you consider the prices
of stand-alone NICs that are added in by
PCI solution this is integrated onto the
motherboard and it does a fantastic job
without slowing down after extremely
long transfers now my personal opinion
with the asrock taiichi lineup is that
it's very solid whether it's X 3 9 9 X 2
9 9 X 370 or Z 370 it is usually my
go-to board for recommendations if you
want to overclock and another benefit
with having such a solid vrm is also
slightly higher overclock than
competitors boards or at least the
competitors boards that aren't
implementing a V RMS good and of course
with the X ray nice solution here you
get a lot of connectivity 3.1 USB a and
c as well 3m 2 slots 5 PCI Express slots
with 2 16 X slots 2 8 X slots and 1 1 X
slot and you guys hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
slap that like button and let me know in
the comment section below what you think
of the whole Foxconn vs. loads argument
and have you had any problems on either
socket me personally I haven't had any
problems that's at least led to loss of
sleep for example but in the past I have
heard of some overclockers at least
extreme overclockers having problems on
either socket me personally I'm one of
those guys are just over clocks on
either air or water and I think if
you're just looking for sweet spot over
clocks on water or air then you should
be fine on both sockets also don't
forget to check out the link in the
description below
completely free international giveaway
2x 399 motherboards courtesy of asrock
and with that said I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
