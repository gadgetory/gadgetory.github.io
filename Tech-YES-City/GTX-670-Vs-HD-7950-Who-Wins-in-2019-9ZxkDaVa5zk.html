crack-a-lackin' what is Papa lop and
we've got two graphics cards right here
that were both released in 2012 this one
here is the HD 7950 it came in at 399
USD MSRP when it was first released had
three gigabytes of vram and was released
on the 31st of January and has the GCN
architecture the one above it is the GTX
670 which came into the same MSRP of 399
but had a 2 gigabyte via Ram buffer and
was released three months later on April
29th however I do believe you could get
a 4 gigabyte variant of it however
today's tests are going to be really
interesting at least for me personally
because I'm gonna be putting seven years
later both these graphics cards through
the latest titles and seeing if the 7950
really has aged better than the GTX 670
because a lot of people are saying that
AMD's fine wine technology if you bought
this back in the day it was gonna
perform better in the future
and 2012 at least off the top of my
memory both these cars were performing
in a similar ballpark
however you may notice that both these
Ram scouts are looking a little bit
dirty so we're gonna give them some tech
yes loving that's where we clean them up
so they can have the best chance of
performing the best they can on the test
bench and also with that said I picked
up both these graphics cards for 40
Ozzie dollars each which is about 28 USD
so that's under 10% of what they were
going for 7 years ago so talk about a
bargain but let's get this comparison on
the road but before we do give these two
graphics cards some tech yes loving
today's video is brought to you by raid
Shadow legends if you guys are out and
about with your smartphones and need a
game that is completely free to download
and play then this brand new RPG title
is it it's got a really good storyline
awesome 3d graphics raid boss by its PvP
battles and also hundreds of champions
to collect and customize and also on top
of that the player base and the raids
are getting really big really quickly
and they've got a special launch
tournament with crazy prizes up for
grabs so they're told is this game is
completely free and if you're a techie a
city viewer and use my link in the
description below you'll get a free
50,000 silver immediately and a free
epic champion so what are you guys
waiting for links in the description
below let
get back to that tech yes love
so all the gaming benchmarks are
finished and this one was very
interesting because I actually looked
around my studio and I had a GTX 670 4
gigabyte edition as well so we threw
that into the benchmarks now with the
overclocks the to 670 s our reference
models but when I overclocked this time
I decided to put the fan speeds on all
three cards at 100% that's gonna weed
out the differences between this
gigabyte edition for example being a pre
OSI model and being able to perform
higher and so the overclocked versus
overclocked versus overclocks figures
are going to be pretty accurate in this
case but we'll pull up the first result
here apex legends where I'm testing just
outside of water treatment and I'm
running across a bridge and we see here
that the 7950 it was a clear victory
both out of the box and when it was
overclocked it just smoked the 670
solutions here the 4 gigabyte edition
really didn't make a difference here
even though when we put the 4 gigabyte
in it's going over that cap of 2
gigabytes usage for the vram so it looks
like Nvidia is doing something at a
driver level to mitigate any potential
vram bottlenecks in games but looking at
the next title now Tom Clancy's the
division 2 we had another victory for
the 7950 scoring 36 and 40 3 FPS
respectively versus the 670 s which
performed in a similar ballpark there
wasn't too much of the difference here
but moving over to a newer title
generation 0 I don't know if this is a
mainstream title or it's considered an
indie title but this is where they
performed in a similar ballpark between
the 7950 and also the 670 but we will
have to give the victory here to the
7950 as it did score higher results
ultimately I've been moving on now that
outward which is a newer title as well
and here's where the 670 actually scored
a victory but again there wasn't really
much of a difference at all between the
two you bite and for gigabyte variant
here for v rams so nothing much gained
if you purchased that extra 2 gigabytes
back in the day but one title where it
did make a difference was a dirt rally
2.0 and here the 17
50 scored out the victory overall but we
can see here that the four gigabyte
edition did get better one percent and
point one percent lows so if it's
anything we need about three gigabytes
of vram to play on high settings for
dirt rally 2.0 and have it be a smooth
experience but the last time we're
looking at here is anthem 1080p high
settings and this one that was a victory
for the 7950 yet again wasn't a massive
victory but a victory nonetheless and
the two gigabyte in full year out
variants really didn't make a difference
here on the side of the six 70s but
moving over two times by just the
standard edition not the Extreme Edition
we saw these 7950 scoring about 300
points both out of the box and also when
it was overclocked and then the last
figure we're looking at is power
consumption where these 7950 didn't use
up about 30 watts more if I had to
average things out so 670 is a bit more
efficient by the 7950 is giving you more
performance and if we look at titles
like apex legends especially that 30
watts is well worth it
so there we have it with the Radeon HD
7950 versus the GTX 670 both these
graphics cards back in the day were very
popular in fact I'd say they are one of
the most biggest changes for both AMD
and NVIDIA we're on AMD side they went
from 40 nanometer to 28 nanometer and
changed the architecture all in one go
and NVIDIA also did the same thing went
to 28 nanometer and change to Kepler so
we saw massive increases in efficiency
and also performance - so these graphics
cards did mark a big error for PC gamers
and at the time even though the 670
performs similar the 7950 it's looking
like nowadays the difference is in favor
of the 7950 but how much of that is due
to driver optimization truly continuing
for the 670 remains to be seen I mean
outward being sort of like an outlier
here did show the 670 beating the 7950
so I'm guessing in all the other titles
AMD have optimized the drivers for the
7950 quite well as opposed say for
instance on the 670 Nvidia might have
just simply even though they say they
support the latest title
they're sort of optimizing for Kepler
maybe they're just leaving Kepler behind
who knows guys let us know in the
comment section below what you think is
going on between these two cards but if
you're in the market to buy either of
these and they're the same price I would
definitely be going for the 7950 over
the 670 now also before I get on out of
here some interesting things to point
out during this comparison was the two
gigabytes of extra VRAM really didn't
make a difference at all on that 670 and
that's mainly because the card itself is
limited by its main stream processors
power and that we don't really have
enough raw GPU power for the extra two
gigabytes of vram to make a difference
and in case of the 7950 another odd
behavior I saw was out of the box it
sort of struggled to get to a thousand
megahertz it sort of jumped between nine
hundred and a thousand and actually
recorded this live on the capture card
for you guys to see but when we
overclocked it it just stuck at that
eleven hundred and twenty megahertz
score all day everyday so that
definitely did give the favor to the
7950 especially when it was overclocked
and was good to see that's actually more
of a stable card when you overclock it
so the irony there is quite funny
overclock your graphics cards for
stability but guys let us know in the
comment section below which of these two
cards would you pick I mean if this one
had a better cooler on it yes it's the
reference cooler yes it was back in the
day when these reference coolers were
obnoxiously loud once the graphics card
had any strain on it but to be fair I
put it up to a hundred percent fan
speeds for the overclock and that did
bring the temperatures under 70 degrees
so it was fine to handle over clocks
when you put that fan speed at 100% even
though it's unbearable this card right
here is definitely when gigabyte we're
on top of things that wind force coolers
are good the over clocks are actually
really good this is one of my favorite
generations of gravis card for AMD it's
just when they got everything right in
my opinion the cards overclocked well
the coolers were good out of the factory
the performance was great but of course
I need to know what you guys think let
us know in the comment section below
with that said I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video if you did and be sure to
hit that like button and also if you're
out and about and need a game to play on
your smart phone completely free and
check out today's video sponsor of rage
chatter legends link is in the
description
hello and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye so
one of the three wind force fans on that
HD 7950 actually like lifted up while I
was had the data vac on it and it cut my
finger but I was like now I'm just gonna
keep going so apparently the data vac
can fix your wounds
