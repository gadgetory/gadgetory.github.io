and also a good friend of
mine Rocket Jump Ninja,
who reviews mice, was
looking for a comparison
between the GTX 1080 Ti
and also the RTX 2080 Ti.
And he was looking around and
he found some generic videos
but he said to me Brian can
you just make a comparison
between these two graphics cards
and give it to me straight?
And that's exactly what we're
gonna do here today you guys.
I'm gonna be taking both
these graphics cards
overclocking them and then
telling you what the dealo is.
And also speaking of the 1080 Ti,
I also got asked in the comments
about the RTX 2060 versus the GTS 1080 Ti
and some people have seen these going
for a similar price used
as one of these brand new
and I'm gonna stop here straight here
before we even start the benchmarks
and say if you can find
one of these for 350 US
and it's in good working condition
or in Australia 500 Aussie dollars
which is what a RTX 2060 goes for
then that's an absolute no-brainer.
This card right here is in another league
compared to the RTX 2060.
But with that said let's get
this comparagone underway.
That's Italian for comparison.
(upbeat techno music)
(dramatic techno music)
So with those results we can
see a few different things
and I did decide to throw in
a few extra graphics cards
for you guys but I did
highlight the 1080 Ti
and the 2080 Ti.
Now within this own comparison
we've kind of got two comparisons going on
and that's because Zy loaned
me his GTX 1080 Ti Strix OC
and what we saw out of the box
this card is aggressively overclocked.
And so when we went to
manually overclock it
we didn't get a whole lot of
extra performance out of it
as opposed to the GALAX 2080 Ti
which, when we overclocked that,
it went a lot higher since
it's not overclocked out of the factory.
Now before we look at the
numbers and the percentages,
basically if you guys
aren't into overclocking
then cards like the Strix OC,
that have that OC in the title,
are going to be very good if
you don't want to overclock
as they're gonna give you extra
performance out of the box
as compared to a standard
1080 Ti for example.
But in terms of a raw and pure comparison,
in this case I think
the overclocked numbers
are actually more accurate
in comparing a 1080 Ti
to a 2080 Ti, overall.
And stepping into the first
benchmark here Anthem,
I decided to put the RTX 2060
in red because as you can see
it's more of the mid-range
graphics card league
as opposed to the 1080 Ti and 2080 Ti
which are going into the high-end.
And in the case of the 2080 Ti,
it's pretty much the best card
you can get in terms of performance
although its price is significantly higher
and we'll get onto that later.
But Anthem, straight up 4K settings here.
We saw out of the box the 2080 Ti
was getting around 14% extra
performance in this game
but when we overclocked it
it was getting around 23% extra frames.
So again with that Strix OC
definitely giving some extra
performance out of the box
but then losing it once we overclocked
that 2080 Ti from GALAX.
Now the next game we've got
up here is Apex Legends.
This game is unfortunately
capped at 144 frames
and even on pretty much
of 1440p max settings
we've got a 23% boost
and then the 28% boost
once we overclocked it.
And funnily enough, to quickly interlude
between these two behemoths,
the Radeon 7 did very well in Apex Legends
so if you wanted to play Apex Legends
and that's all you're interested in,
and getting the best frame rates for it,
especially with new graphics cards,
then the Radion 7 may be the
card that you wish to consider.
But moving onto Outward.
This saw a 14% boost at 1440p
max settings out of the box
and then once we overclocked it
we were getting around 26%
extra frames on the 2080 Ti.
Moving over to Dirt Rally 2.0.
34% boost and then OC versus
OC there was a 43% difference.
So this was a huge difference,
it was the biggest in
the games we tested here
so Dirt Rally 2.0 being
a latest release title
definitely shows what the 2080 Ti can do
when the games are optimized
for that architecture
since we are using two
different architectures here
between the 1080 Ti and the 2080 Ti.
We got Pascal on the 1080 Ti
and we got Turing on the 2080 Ti.
Now the next game is
another new release title,
Generation Zero.
14% boost out of the box,
versus out of the box, and then 20% boost
once we overclocked this
at 1440p max settings.
And then the last benchmark
we're gonna pull up here
is Time Spy Extreme for you guys.
40% difference and then once
overclocked a 50% difference.
So I guess this showcases
the max potential
between these two cards
but on the flip side when we
look at most of these games
we're scoring about a 15 to 30% difference
depending on the title.
And I guess that's the main focus
of these two graphics card,
with the 1080 Ti versus the 2080 Ti,
is which game are you going to play.
If you're only gonna play
one game in particular
then definitely check out that performance
before you go buy one
of these graphics cards.
And see if that extra
money you're gonna spend
on a 2080 Ti is going to be
worth it versus the 1080 Ti.
But in terms of getting the
absolute best performance
and is that worth it,
that all depends on how much money
you wanna invest in PC gaming.
Some people out there earn
ridiculous amounts of money
so for them, if PC gaming's
their passion and their hobby,
they don't mind spending
that premium on the 2080 Ti.
But I guess for most of us, me included,
that difference is obviously
not gonna be worth it
in a lot of cases.
Now some other quick differences
between both these cards.
One has GDDR5X, that's the 1080 Ti
versus the 2080 which has GDDR6.
It's a little bit more power efficient
a little bit more faster
but in terms of the actual memory on board
they both have 11 gigabytes
and then the 2080 Ti has 12
nanometer plus from Nvidia
versus 16 nanometer on the 1080 Ti.
Which does make it a little
bit more power efficient
but since it's the bigger piece of silicon
and it does push out more performance
it actually ends up
using more power overall,
both out of the box and overclocked.
And keeping in mind this
is the GALAX edition
which is very power efficient.
And then of course the last thing
to go over is ray tracing support
and DLSS on the new RTX cards
but a lot of gamers, myself included,
really aren't looking
at that at the moment.
It's not really wowing anyone over
and I certainly wouldn't give
it hardly any weight at all
when it came to making
a purchasing decision
between these two graphics cards.
Anyway guys to quickly sum things up
before I get on out of here
the GTX 1080 Ti is still
a very capable card.
If you were looking to upgrade
from this card to a 2080 Ti
I'd seriously have to question you
and ask you do you really want to upgrade
for that performance?
It is a big premium,
especially if you sell one
of those on a used market and then go out
and pay 1200 USD or in Australia
I think the cheapest you can
get 'em for is around 1700 AUD
for one of these cards.
I mean the 1080 Ti still performs
phenomenally well in a lot of titles,
it's still a high-end card
and it's still gonna kick a lot of butt.
Especially when you overclock it too.
It's an absolutely amazing graphics card
and you're probably wondering
why I'm holding the MSI DUKE,
it's because someone traded it in
so it's the only 1080 Ti
I've got here at the moment.
But of course that 2080 Ti
does have that king status.
It is the best card out there
for gaming at the moment
but hopefully that
answers all your questions
and if you can find a GTX 1080 Ti
for the same price as a 2060
then why are you even
watching this video still?
Just click pause, go get the 1080 Ti,
then come back and watch the
last 20 seconds of this outro.
With that said I hope
you enjoyed this one.
