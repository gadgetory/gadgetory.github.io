good deals that come up that are just
too hard to pass up so if you're in
Australia and you have a little bit of
money and you want to get some really
good deals then this might be the video
for you welcome back to tech city and
when I was on eBay I noticed they had a
heap of different deals going on at the
moment for Mother's Day so this sale
lasts until May 8th and you have to use
the coupon codes see mum 20 and you get
20% off so naturally I went to the tech
section and I found some surprisingly
really good deals but before we get to
them I noticed people in the states that
watched and if you guys are on Amazon at
the moment you can get a gtx 1070 from
EVGA for 336 USD which is a really damn
good deal there's also the zotac mini
gtx 1070 go on for three hundred and
forty dollars now these cards will play
games at 1440p really well they'll also
be really quiet and they won't use a
whole lot of power so the first deal we
got for you guys in Australia is the r5
1600 this thing is pretty much the best
value for money at the moment on the CPU
lineup of things you get 6 cores 12
threads you can overclock the CPU and it
even comes with a cooler now you can get
this for 284 Ozzie after you put in that
20% off coupon and for you guys in the
rest of the world wondering how much an
Australian dollar is worth it's
currently worth 75 US cents so this
actually makes this CPU in relative
terms cheaper than what it would be for
sale in America so this CPU will do
gaming really well it'll even do video
editing in productivity extremely well -
and the best part is you can couple it
with a very inexpensive motherboard and
we've got up here the MSI be 350 and
this is going for 128 ozzie after you
take that 20% off really good
motherboard for the money you can put 16
gigabytes of RAM in there and have a
great 1080p gaming rig and also video
editing for 1080p though it doesn't stop
there if you're after a really high-end
graphics card - even couple with the r5
1600 processor that you can get the GTX
1080 from gigabyte currently for 650 -
Australian dollars and even though this
has pretty much what they call a
reference cooler onboard the GTX 1080
surprisingly doesn't
use a whole lot of power so even a
cooler like this will do a fine job of
cooling a graphics card like this and
the 1080 is pretty much really good for
even 1440p ultra wide at a hundred Hertz
and I'll even do 4k gaming on high
settings so really powerful graphics
card and especially for 652 Aussie we're
getting it cheaper than a lot of those
guys get it in America so if you don't
have money for a GTX 1080 then you can
definitely get a GTX 1060 which will do
a great job at 1080p and for 268 dollars
the exuse custom model here is going to
do a great job of giving you guys good
frames while also remaining cool and
quiet I would have loved to have
recommended an Rx for 70 X 480 or even
575 80 but none of those are on sale at
the moment on eBay unfortunately and
with that said the next deal we've got
up here is a Toshiba 120 gigabyte SSD
going for $69 very special number and
definitely good value for money if you
need something to boot up your computer
on a budget and you don't want to expend
more money on a more expensive drives
you can couple this with a one terabyte
hard drive and have a really snappy
machine on a budget now next deal I have
up here is really damn cool because it's
eight hundred and forty dollars and it's
a sony 4k TV 49 inches with HDR
so really damn good for the money this
is with free postage as well to your
doorstep so eight hundred and forty
dollars man if you guys need something
in your living room that looks awesome
and it's relatively inexpensive then
this one's a no-brainer in my opinion
though some other options for storage
you can get a Samsung 960m to nvme Drive
currently going for two hundred and
ninety six dollars this thing will be
incredibly fast great for video editing
if you need it as a scratch drive or if
you just want to get the best speeds
when you're booting up your games then
this Drive will definitely serve you so
if you want to step things up in terms
of storage space but you don't want to
pay a whole lot more money than the
crucial MX 300 one terabyte version this
is a little bit slower than the nvme -
960 from Samsung but it does get double
the storage this thing's going for 360
for Aussie so pretty damn good deal
there - and you've got lastly a 500
gigabyte 850
though going for 220 dollars and of
course the last deal which is one of my
favorites is the r7 1700 from AMD this
is an a core 16 threaded Beast it's
going for $400 after you apply that
coupon code so again we're getting it
cheaper than what the folks in America
could get this thing for anyway guys
hope you enjoyed today's video and some
of those deals that are really damn good
especially if you want to upgrade your
current PC or if you want to get some
new components to put towards the new
build and that 4k TV that was really
good for the money too but with that
said let me know in the comments section
below what was your favorite deal of
today love reading your comments as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
