welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
review of the epic gear defiant
mechanical keyboard now this has
interesting switches which were designed
in-house from epic gear themselves and
for those of you who don't know who epic
gear are they're actually an extension
from the company called Gil which is
very popular for making certain types of
memory on the PC platform especially for
enthusiast tech heads like myself so
getting straight into the build quality
and features of this keyboard you can
get it in three different variants which
you can get the purple switch which is
essentially like a cherry MX blue and
that's got two levels of feedback the
next option they have is the orange
switch which essentially works like a
Cherry MX brown with one layer of
feedback and then the last which you've
got there is the gray which acts like a
red and then it's just a linear switch
with no feedback at all and on that
notice switches they come with a rating
of 70 million strokes and they've also
got the white LED backlighting on this
model called a define though you can get
their little crystals that allow you to
change the colors to five different
colors that's two different layers of
paint two different layers of green or
green and teal and also yellow though I
defined the crystals a little bit
cumbersome when it came to switching
those colors around actually had to pull
out the whole switch just to change that
little crystal in there which I would
like to see it come out from the front
and even on that note I would have liked
to have seen RGB lighting implemented on
this keyboard the one thing that sets
the define apart from other keyboards is
that they can use a modular matrix
structure type key switch as they call
where you can completely remove the key
from the keyboard and then change it
with a different color so for instance
I'm using purples on my main key here
and then if I want to play csgo for
example I can then switch it to the
grays and have no linear on those keys
that I use for that game and it makes it
so I'm able to customize my keyboard for
different games if I'm playing a lot of
dota 2 for example and I really like
those orange sort of brown type one
layer of feedback switches I can then
switch it to that color and then I'm
good to go though another thing that I
really liked about this keyboard was
those elevated switches and they're very
simple and they're very easy to type on
so I'll let you guys listen to what it
sounds like the type on this keyboard
now besides those switches the best
thing that I like about this keyboard is
simply the build quality it is
phenomenal and it's up there in the
likes of Corsair who make really strong
keyboards as well when I picked this
thing up out of the box it weighted
about 1 kilo so it wasn't too heavy
though that's still back plating which
comes in a satin black really set this
keyboard apart from the others moving on
to the LED lighting it comes with the
default white LED lighting setting that
just happens to go with my black and
white theme in the background here
though you can't get it in other LED
colors you can get those crystals as I
mentioned before looking at the topper
out of the keyboard it gear have gone
with that simplistic styling on not only
the whole keyboard but the num lock caps
lock and scroll or keys themselves just
having a simple red lighting and to the
right of that you've got the volume knob
which is made of steel and if you press
it down you can mute the keyboard as
well looking at the top of the keyboard
you've got this epic gear logo in some
kind of squishy plasticky foamy type
stuff it actually feels really cool and
then from there you've got the one point
8 meter braided cable which extends out
to a gold plated USB tip looking at the
wrist rest which is actually not
included with the keyboard though it is
an optional accessory which comes in
around $10 I think that has the epic
gear logo and it's again that squishy
plastic II soft type feel it does feel
really good though if I had to critique
one thing about it I would like to
extend it extend it out more as I like
big fat wrist rest when I'm typing now
taking a look at this software this is
actually another impressive feature of
the define it's got a simple layout with
the software easy to download you can
also update the firmware on this
keyboard which is another cool feature
and it's got three tabs there the
support the macros and also the key
management tabs you've also got the
option of choosing between four
different profiles and polling rates
which go from 125 to 250 to 500 to 1000
now making a macro was also very easy on
this keyboard and you can actually
insert the delays to save a lot of time
when you're editing the macro and then
you can assign it to any single key on
the keyboard which is another awesome
feature of the defiant another thing you
can do with this keyboard is change the
brightness with three different settings
of brightness they're low medium and
high and also off so I guess that's four
settings in total you can also change
this from the software and
the software is the ability for the afk
mode to set this keyboard in a ripple
effect so now we've got through the gist
of this keyboard it costs 90 USD and
that's what I saw it for on Amazon and
honestly at this price it is a killer
keyboard just simply the build quality
and the feature set that you can do with
this keyboard this makes it stand out
from other keyboards I simply put it on
my desk and I fell in love with it
instantly that satin black sealed back
plating really sets this keyboard apart
it's just simple it works really well
and then you've got the option to change
the keys there which I thought was
really cool even though that's an
optional accessory and I saw that up
there for $15 it's actually very
reasonably priced to get different
switches on your keyboard other
accessories that you can get with this
keyboard include the side mounting there
to elevate the keyboard even higher than
that elevation on the back of the
keyboard though as I said before I don't
see myself needing these as I love a
flat keyboard on the desk as low as
possible another accessory you can get
is the colored light bars which you can
change the colors of the keys if you
remove the clear cap and then you can
put in the colors that you like there's
five different colors those again as I
said before I would have loved to have
seen this keyboard in RGB which would
have eliminated the need for that
accessory altogether and then the last
accessory I'm going to talk about is the
carry patch which you probably saw in
the intro this thing is just built
really well I really love it it's a cool
accessory especially if you're going to
land parties a lot or you want to carry
your keyboard around with you really
loved it really well Wade and then the
last thing that I really liked about
this keyboard was the ability to change
the switches to the other different
colors if you're playing csgo dota 2
whatever those games are playing and you
want to change up the feel of your
keyboard you can do it and you can do it
for actually really cheap so that's a
really cool feature that I loved about
this keyboard as well so in conclusion
at 90 USD the defiant keyboard is an
absolute hit out of the park I
absolutely fell in love with the bill
cordless keyboard so the first things
first here that build quality phenomenal
ninety dollar keyboard I was like wow
this thing's coming in at $90 steel
backplate Absolut's simple and rugged
finish there you're gonna love it if you
want a keyboard that's going to last the
distance anyway that's about it for me
today guys if you enjoyed this review
then please give it a big thumbs up if
you have any questions or comments about
the defiant from epic gear then be sure
to drop a comma in the conversation
below and I'll get back to you
soon as I can also put some links in the
description where you can check it out
if you want to buy it I'll see I will
say that the epic gear title there is
not just the name they are making some
real epic gear so way to make a bang in
the peripheral market epic year looking
forward to seeing what else they're
going to do in the market and I hope to
see you guys in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye big gear and
what a way to enter the enthusiast tech
market for a full month but I guess
people never test out wrist rest to see
how well of a slapping power they've got
that's pretty ask us and by dinner let's
say this one wins in the slapping power
department</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
