mice are created equally well
unfortunately they're not let's find out
why welcome back to tech yes it is brian
coming back to you guys today with a
video on mice and input lag and is a
gaming mouse beneficial for you if
you're a competitive gamer so in order
to test this and the reason for testing
this was when I first got the
SteelSeries color version 1 &amp;amp; 2 in
before Christmas this was like three
months ago I was going to do a review on
this mouse and after using it for a
couple of weeks the review was going to
be pretty negative however before I came
out with that review I wanted to have
some evidence as the save as to why this
why I didn't like this particular Mouse
so at Christmas time I bought a 1000 FPS
camera and this enabled me to test this
particular Mouse for input lag total
system input lag and I pitted it against
the Logitech G 302 in logic G's 400 and
I also threw in a $1 special in there
and so what I decided to do is I decided
to do 10 runs in Call of Duty advanced
warfare single-player whilst looking at
the floor so I eliminated as much
variance as possible so anyway let's get
on with the results in order to do this
testing I have to test it 1000 fps and
this is also a simple way of me
analyzing the results because one frame
will essentially equal one millisecond
so I can then tally up the total frames
it took from when I press the mouse
button to when I actually will win
something when the pixels shift on my
monitor and that will tell me the total
input lag in milliseconds another thing
as well is there's also one thing to
note as well as that my clique that I'm
using is pretty fast as well here it is
in real time so as you can see there
it's a really quick click I measured it
from when the fingers stopped moving as
well so if anything this will be faster
then it will be in the real world also
let's get on with the contenders anyway
so the first Mouse here we have is a
steel series Kanna this came in with
software on at 52.1 milliseconds total
input lag
over 10 runs without software on it came
in at 51.6 milliseconds so it's a good
thing to note that the software for the
SteelSeries Connor does not make
virtually no difference in the real
world in terms of input lag
basically the software doesn't add any
input lag to the mouse let's look at the
Logitech G 302 next with the software on
it scored 44 milliseconds with the
software off it's scored a total average
time of forty three point eight
milliseconds so the software for the
Logitech G 302 didn't make a difference
however it's important to note with the
G 302 I was using the onboard memory not
the actual software itself because I
wanted to save that for the G 400 so as
you can see there's virtually no
difference so Logitech's onboard
implementation of their profile features
works really well and it doesn't add any
input lag to the total for the mouse so
next up we have the G 400 this was a
curious contender because it doesn't
have the onboard memory that the G 302
does and there's been a rumor going
around that the G 400 when you use it
with the Logitech software it adds a
slight delay or as I guess it adds a
little bit extra input lag and to those
people who thought that you were correct
your assumptions were right so with the
software on the G 400 scored a total
time of 52 milliseconds flat without the
software on it scored 42 point 2
milliseconds so it came in with the best
time
so that's kudos to the G 400 it's a
great Mouse especially with the software
off very fast Mouse let's move on now to
the last contender so the last contender
is just a $1.00 mouse I picked up from
the junkyard this thing was just you
know I just wanted to test it as a
baseline for someone especially people
who are getting into computer gaming and
they're just going to use a really cheap
Mouse so the cheap $1.00 Mouse came in
with 61 point 4 milliseconds on average
so it scored the worst out of all these
Mouse
today and as it should I mean it's a
crap Mouse it's not even intended for
gaming and something to note about this
Mouse man this thing was having problems
like the left
click on the right click were kind of
entangled so whenever I click the right
click over to perform a left click as
well whenever I click the left click
would perform a right click so something
crazy going on there but anyway it's
called the worst anyway let's move on
now to a conclusion with all these
results so looking at these results we
can see that the Logitech mice are kind
of a step ahead of this SteelSeries
Connor and the one-dollar Mouse as well
I mean the Logitech mouse mice came in
about 8 to 10 milliseconds faster than
this steel series Connor which is
supposedly a gaming mouse as well now I
know there's someone out there what
about the SteelSeries sensei and if
still servers are watching this then
please go ahead send me a mouse I'll
test it and then I'll give it away to my
audience same goes for razor or Zoe or
any other gaming mouse manufacturer out
there but as it stands logitech
definitely have proved their weight with
this 1,000 FPS testing and also with
this mouse the SteelSeries Connor I was
going to release a negative review a few
months ago however I didn't want to do
that without evidence because I know
there would have been people like oh man
it's all in your head but no it's not
only my head and so basically you know
eight or 10 milliseconds is actually
quite a big deal if you're a competitive
gamer especially if you're a competitive
gamer if you're someone who just plays
games casually and doesn't care at all
that's fine but if you're someone who's
a competitive gamer and you're like
let's just eight or ten milliseconds it
doesn't make a difference well then
clearly you're not a good competitive
gamer so go get good dude because you
know eight or ten millions at a pro
level or at a competitive level does
make a difference any pro gamer will
tell you that so anyway in conclusion
what can we say that all mice aren't
created equally though it was good to
note that the SteelSeries mouse was
still ahead of the one-dollar Gaming
Mouse so it was in a different it was a
step up from that which is a good thing
as well it's just it wasn't as good as
the Logitech mice and since you are
paying $50 or so for a mouse like this
you do expect it to perform as good as
the competitors I think so this was kind
of lacking a little bit behind the
Logitech mice and so yeah that's about
it but also another thing the software
so the software for the SteelSeries mice
it doesn't introduce any input delay
which was a good thing
others
software for the Logitech G 400 was
introducing input lag so that was a very
interesting thing so those people were
right about that anyway this is the
beginning of the input lag arc that I've
I told you guys I'd take on at Christmas
so I was going to do this I told you
guys at Christmas on my life that I was
gonna embark on this input lag arc and
now I'm embarking on it so if you enjoy
this and you love those loved
competitive gaming then please give this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon and if you
have any questions or comments then go
at it in the comments I'll take a look
I'll reply as soon as I can and I look
forward to seeing you guys in another
video bye sorry one more thing I forgot
to mention in the video as well this was
done on a sixty Hertz monitor I would
like to get a 144 Hertz monitor in the
future for more definitive results
though these results are still accurate
for what they are because I did a number
of runs tend to be exact on each Mouse
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
