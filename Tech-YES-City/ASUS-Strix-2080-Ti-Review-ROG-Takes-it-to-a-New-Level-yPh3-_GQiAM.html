ups and downs though this card right
here the asus strix rog 2080 TI is
definitely one of the uppers when it
comes to this line of Turing graphics
cards booting straight into the details
over clocks this thing was a solid
overclock and gaining about a hundred
and forty mega Hertz on the core and
memory close to that of two hundred
megahertz this enabled as I'll put up on
the graph here a max core clock of
nineteen hundred and sixty five
megahertz out of the box and when
overclocked it hit an absolute
mind-boggling 2115 megahertz on the core
and the best thing was it still managed
to do so whilst remaining relatively
quiet though more on that later
this enabled this card right here to
pull anywhere from thirty to fifty
percent ahead in the benchmarks as we'll
see later when compared to that of the
custom gigabyte r-tx twenty eighty
overclock we have here and also the gtx
ten ATT IOC that is also here in the
tech yes studio so strap on in ladies
and gentlemen because this one is about
to get hot pretty and downright ugly
that weird analogy of course relates to
the inner struggle between you and your
wallet because make no doubt about it
the twenty atti is an expensive car
the Asus 2080 TIR og Strix weighs in at
about 1.4 7 kilograms is triple slot in
my eyes though Asus officially call it
2.7 times it has RGB LED lighting on the
rear sides and underneath of the card
that is controllable via software and
can connect to or a sync on your
motherboard and other components there
are 380 mil axial fans that feature an
all-round better design than previous
models that are IP 5x dust resistant to
something I'll test in due time with the
data back of course Asus are also
implementing Auto extreme technology
which has to do with soldiering of the
components on the card itself it's
automated and it's all done in one pass
heading to the fact that it would be
more reliable product which will go the
longer distance it also in my opinion
has one of the best aesthetics of any
gravis card to date though of course how
does it perform it both 1440p ultra wide
and 4k might you ask well pulling up the
first graph here for you guys far cry 5
1440p showing that there's a small boost
at this ultra wide setting at this stage
it was only taking the lead here by
roughly 20% but 4k results were soon to
show that this was more of a CPU
limitation at 1440p ultra wide and
honestly a cpu limitation on a demanding
title like far cry 5 on maximum settings
at 21 by 9 1440p is no small feat might
add I'm running these tests on a 78 20 X
at 4.5 gigahertz - and ddr4 memory is
running at 3200 megahertz moving on with
scum the results showed anywhere near a
30 to 35 percent gain in 1440p ultra
wide and then moving on to 4k showed a
similar trend continuing though pub G
was soon to show what the rog r-tx 28 ET
i was really capable of gaining roughly
a 40 to 50 percent boost over the other
cards here I honestly had to go back and
double-check these numbers to make sure
but sure enough 1440p and 4k showed some
massive gains allowing the overclock on
this graphics card itself to flex over
even its default clocks moving on with
destiny just a PG friendly benchmark of
me playing some soccer at the farm and
1440p showed an average framerate
pulling ahead by again roughly 45 to 51
percent compared to the 1080
a4k continued a similar trend managed to
cap an impressive 52% overclocked first
overclocks though I could have received
a golden sample here well maybe that's
just a Zeus's claims of implementing the
best style of air cooler in the biz are
showing some truth there was pretty
eye-opening to see how aggressive the
results were when and looking at the
overclocked numbers they're looking at
our simulator twenty-eight ATP World of
Warcraft benchmark this is over double
the pixels of 4k by the way things came
back down a bit here to reality and our
simulated results only showed a 24 to 27
percent increase over the 1080 Ti and
the r-tx 2080 then around a 30 percent
difference overclocked versus
overclocked next up we had the infamous
Crysis 3 and that question that didn't
get answered in the RT X 2080 review if
you haven't seen it I'll put it up here
was can it run Crysis at 4k and we were
honestly so close to that magical 4k
60fps number it was disheartening it got
almost there 58 fps when it was
overclocked and we're using very high
settings which is pretty much the max
settings you can use with two times MSAA
and here it's scored overclocked verse
overclocked around about a 38 to 49%
lead over the other two top dogs in the
race and non OSI 30 and 40 percent over
the 20 80 and 1080 Ti respectively
though 1440p was roughly the same as 4k
so the cpu limitations were not present
in either benchmarks the Final Fantasy
15 benchmark they do say it does have DL
SS enabled this netted some massive
gains for the 2080 ti not just over that
of the 1080 ti interestingly enough but
also its little brother the 2080 it was
nearly a 33 and 36 percent gain
overclocked versus overclocked first the
boys and nonno seesaw at 27 and 30
percent increase respectively and moving
on with some other simulated benchmarks
and these are pretty important because
unfortunately I don't have any other 20
atti cards here to compare the ROG card
to so it's going to give you the viewer
a rough estimate of how well this card
can perform at both stock and at
overclocked settings and the overclocked
settings indeed show nearly a 10% boost
in performance over the stock settings
which is massive especially on a
flagship card but at all
showed how well the card could pull
ahead of both itself and the 1080 TI
scoring about 48% more points and
roughly 40% more than the r-tx 2080 from
gigabyte though fire strikes showed a
mere 23% increase over the 1080 TI and
roughly 30% over the r TX 2080 guess it
needs more magical eye candy for a
really to pull ahead of course at this
stage it is important to mention that
I'm still yet to come into any real
world applications that utilize tensor
cause and ray tracing the star
reflections demo is capped at 24 fps and
it's just not really a good benchmark to
get any really solid indicator of
performance with these graphics cards
especially since there's no gameplay
involved in it though back to the Strix
itself power consumption was quite big
both stock and overclocked coming in
well ahead of that of both the 2080 and
1080 TI stock total system power
consumption is up nearly 31 percent
compared to that of the 2080 and 15%
compared to the 1080 ti overclocking
sees the consumption balloon out to 47%
and 30% respectively of course with a
lot more CUDA cores of 4352 then both
the 2080s 2944 and 1080 is 3584 it is
bound to use a bit more power it also
features the faster GD dr6 memory same
as the 2080 and has 11 gigabytes of it
versus 8 gigabytes on the 2080 and 11
gigabytes of gddr5 X on the 1080 Ti it
also just like the 1080 TI features a
mind-boggling 352 bit wide memory boss
bigger than that of the 28 is 256 bit
though fan speeds are noise this is
where azusa's implementation of their
cooler proved that the 20 80 TI rogue
Strix showed they could easily keep the
heat under control and the sweet spot
here was 60% fan speeds in my opinion
though people who hate noise will be
glad to see that I actually had to
physically stop the CPU cooling fans to
get an accurate reading of 39 dB when it
was on auto so yes the temperatures went
up to 75 degrees on auto but the noise
was ridiculously low for a flagship card
and the fans only spun up to 35% I mean
it could just be that this Strix here is
indeed the best Strix of them all
the max call clocks as we mentioned
before showed that this card pulled well
ahead in the overclocking department so
it seems azusa's claims to having the
best implementation of a cooler a coming
to fruition beating that of gigabytes
low power consuming twenty eighty by
roughly five percent
lastly finishing off on the features the
card features a three year warranty as
an additional button to turn RGB LED
lighting off instantly and when this
card is set to auto that's the out of
the box settings it has a silent fan
feature when the idle on the desktop the
fans will just simply stop spinning it
also has a fatter PCB at eleven and a
half centimeters at least compared to
the standard design of the r-tx 2080 we
have here it also has two eight pin
connectors USB type-c at the back and
two display ports and two HDMI 2.0 outs
which I do prefer is a lot of people
that I build pcs for do tell me they
like having a HDMI for their basic
monitor and one for VR so it fits the
bill nicely it also has a clean back
plate with the ROG I RGB shining through
and finally there is a brace going
through the side of the card to help
prevent GPU sag quite a nice idea since
the card is very heavy and bulky so when
it all comes down to what this card
right here is a beast out of all the
graphics cards I have tried in the past
I like this thing the most only ever so
slightly over the hall-of-fame design
however I did really like that too
but I'm honestly not liking the price
tag it is very expensive for a gaming
graphics card make no mistake I actually
don't know the official MSRP in
Australia but going by previous years of
ROG Strix cards will most likely command
a slight premium over the reference MSRP
at the moment in videos 1199 USD
founders card
Oran oz 1899 is to slot has a massive
amount of unnecessary metal on it
that doesn't help to cool the card and
doesn't look anywhere near as good as
this card right here in my opinion so if
it's anything to go by the premium is
going to be easily worth it for
basically a card that has had everything
beefed up on it from the PCB to the vrm
to the cooler which will enable you to
overclock to higher levels of
performance or have extremely low levels
of noise which on a flagship is dare I
say
highly desirable yes it's expensive and
no you're not going to get the best
frames per dollar but I can't help but
actually like the 20 atti
a lot more than the 20 80 especially as
it actually gives us something new and
that is higher performance over the
existing flagship but if you are in the
market for this card then you're going
to know that you either want it or you
don't and if you are that person who
wants a 20 80 TI and you want the best
of the best then this is certainly going
to deliver that and if premium is what
you are prepared to pay then this thing
will definitely give you a premium
experience anyway guys hope you enjoyed
today's review if you did then be sure
to overclock that like button let me
know in the description below have you
ever used a republic of gamers card if
so what was your experience like with it
if not do you want one love rating your
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in the next Tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
just buy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
