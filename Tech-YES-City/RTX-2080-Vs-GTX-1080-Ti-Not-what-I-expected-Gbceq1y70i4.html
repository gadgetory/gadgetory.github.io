2080 review and this GPU is coming in
800 US dollars and in Australia 1200 AUD
MSRP currently you can pick up a 1080 TI
cheaper than this and this is going to
play a pretty important role in today's
review though what Nvidia have done with
this architecture named Li chirring is
added tensor and ray-tracing cores and
added new specs to the r-tx 2000 series
they've also promised ray tracing and
also deep learning super sampling in
real world games and unfortunately both
of these new tech have not made their
way into any real-world benchmarks of
games that I have here in the inventory
and when I saw this I scratched my head
and I checked two of the titles that
were promised DL s s that is pub G and
scum and I couldn't find the options
anyway then I also checked with other
bench markers like Steve from hardware
on box and he also confirmed the options
are just not there
though Nvidia did provide two
demonstrations where the ray-tracing was
working but it wasn't working near the
six times upto performance they noted as
well as the fact that I couldn't even
benchmark the Star Wars demo properly I
actually just had to take a scene and
guess work with my eyes then after that
I had a Final Fantasy 15 demo with DL SS
enabled a 4k benchmark and this really
didn't show any improvement over the
10th series card in tandem two other
benchmarks here though let's get on with
those other benchmarks and tell you guys
all about the RT X 2080 from gigabyte
much-loved from gigabyte
welcome back to tech yesterday and first
off here we have far cry 5 now I tested
in 1440p ultra white and also 4k as this
is where these cards are really intended
to be pushed in my opinion 1440p ultra
wide the r-tx 28 he scored a little loss
and a 4k it ultimately balanced out with
the 1080 TI though keep in mind that
both these cards are pre factory OC
models and we will have to talk about
overclocks a little later we also have
the 1070 TI in the mix because now we
have a range of gddr5 first 5x burst GD
r 6 which is new vram on the RT x mm
though the 2080 does have a 256-bit
memory bus verse the 1080 t is
mind-boggling 352 bit memory bus now
moving on to pop G this is where the RT
X 2080 spread its legs a little and
scored a victory both at 1440 p21 by 9
and also for K we did use the same
driver which was yet to be released
driver on all three cards as well so pub
G a victory for the 2080
but things took a sudden turn when we
moved over to the mysterious and video
card demanding scum which saw the 10 a
DCI score a victory at 1440p ultra wide
and also another thing to note with all
these benchmarks - especially scum I did
keep them as apples-to-apples as
possible using the high preset in this
particular benchmark move over to 4k
then saw the gap closed ever so slightly
but the 1080 TI was still letting out a
roar of confidence at this point however
that confidence was soon to be
short-lived when we switched over to an
old but gold title Crysis 3 and 1440p
ultra wide saw a victory for the 2080
but not by a whole lot though that
question still lingered out there of
can√≠t run Crysis at 4k maximum settings
and while the answer for the RT X 2080
unfortunately is no though this is
maximum settings keep in mind maybe the
20 atti can do it and knowing my luck
the review sample that is in the mail
will probably get here sometime next
year though moving on to the latest
expansion on world of warcraft Battle of
Azeroth some interesting things coming
out here the first battle scene is very
intense
lots of NPCs lots of effects so I
decided to benchmark here and with
complete maximum settings eight times
MSAA
saw the cpu still being limited at 1440p
ultra wide across all three cards and
DirectX 12 did not change this one bit
completely useless implementation of the
API in this game though I usually find
it's useless in practically every game
I've tried with the x12 though I really
wanted to stress these graphics cards so
we stepped it up to a simulated 28 ATP
ultra wide never heard of this setting
before but it was great to stress the
GPUs which is a ridiculous amount of
pixels we now have at our disposal near
20 million we saw the GPUs finally being
maxed at a hundred percent and here we
got some interesting results and that is
virtually a tie or a TI between the 2080
and the 1080 Ti and this result with
world of warcraft really pretty much
sums up the two cards going against each
other in a nutshell they're pretty much
neck-and-neck at different resolutions
and in different games destiny saw the
trend continued however with 1440p being
virtually the same but at 4k giving an
ever so slight edge to the 2080 and the
last of the performance benchmarks we
had was 3d mark firestrike the GPU score
the 1080 TI pulled ahead here both on
default and overclocked settings power
consumption was in favor of the 2080
though I think the 2080 TI will juice
more than the 1080 TI just the gut
feeling however it wasn't as efficient
as what we are used to seeing in the
past especially with regards to the 980
TI verse the 1080 though that about sums
up the results in a nutshell I'm pretty
much calling it a draw they traded blows
and the power consumption is a little
better on the RT x 2080 though again as
I said in the intro pretty disappointed
that I didn't get to see any of these
new effects in real world gaming and I
think perhaps the launch should have
been delayed as ultimately I can really
only test what's in front of me here
today and base my recommendations off
that and basically what we have here is
a card that costs a little bit more is a
little bit more efficient has less vram
even though it's faster vram gr 6 versus
5x we've got a gigabytes here on this
card and 11 gigabytes on the 1080 Ti and
that's about it really
two years in the making I mean I really
hope we see the ray-tracing and also the
tentacles being utilized and really soon
as
that is I think where the value is going
to come out of these cards but again
I've only seen this in demonstrations
and it really hasn't impressed me one
bit whatsoever so what about the
gigabyte card itself this is honestly
one of their nicest looking cards they
have released to date it's a 2.5 slot
cooler so if you want to get two of them
you will seriously have to consider some
extra space on your motherboard and
inside your case this card takes 8 plus
6 pin PCI connections and has 382 MILF
fans that do a phenomenal job of cooling
looking at the noise verse fan speed
levels however we can see that 60% is
the sweet spot for this card also the
over clocks work quite low I could only
get an extra 74 megahertz on the core
with afterburner and also about 200
megahertz on the memory itself though
this does stayed on the box that it is a
pre OSI model I have nothing to compare
it to here so I guess I'll just take
gigabytes word for it there is a
backplate that is simple in nature and
on the rear of that card you'll be
created by three display ports one HDMI
2.0 and one USB type-c out the graphics
card itself also supports envy link
which is a replacement for SLI and a new
bridging connection type which is
located in the same area of the card
itself there is also an RGB controllable
gigabyte logo on the side of the card
and that can be changed via a software
and in Australia gigabyte offer an
impressive four year warranty with their
card so they have really stepped up
their game especially compared to the
previous generation of cards which were
quite let's face it ugly and that's
about it really when it comes to the
r-tx 2000 series at least currently stay
tuned because I will be having some more
benchmarks coming in the next few weeks
especially with the 2080 Ti
so stay tuned for that but really in a
nutshell with the conclusion I will say
that in terms of raw value for money and
raw performance increases we haven't
quite got what we got in the past
especially when it came to the 1080
versus the 980ti that was more power
efficient and we got a sizable increase
in performance over the 980ti
but keep in mind the 20 atti I'm sure
will perform much faster than the 1080
Ti but that will also cost a lot more
money at least from the pre-order
figures that I've seen so far but if you
enjoyed this video then be sure to
that like button and let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
the new r-tx series gravis cards love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch in the next Tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
