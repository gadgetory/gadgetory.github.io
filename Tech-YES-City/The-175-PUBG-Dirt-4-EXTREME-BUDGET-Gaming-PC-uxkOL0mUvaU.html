wanted to see an old used
price-performance PFD so over the last
couple of months I've been picking up
bugs here and there and today is going
to combine all those bargains to make
one kick off TC they can play even the
latest titles at 1080p
and welcome back to tech yes City this
is brian coming to you guys today with a
175 dollar pc or if you're in australia
was about two hundred and thirty
australian dollars now there are some
really good bargains in this pc that
makes frame rates at 1080p perfectly
playable on even games like pub g which
is the latest players on known
battlegrounds and even a game like dirt
four but before we get onto the
benchmarks we've got to build this thing
and of course give it a tech yes city
cleanse however before we do that we'll
also check out the prices of the pots
and which parts were the best and what
made up this build to get such a good
deal
so now this is the part where a lot of
people ask me how do I get such good
performance out of my hardware all the
time and this is where overclocking
plays a huge role if all my parts are
allowed to be overclocked then you can
bet your bottom dollar that the yes-man
going to be overclocking that and in
this case the CPU out of the factory
comes at two point six six gigahertz and
I managed to get this thing up to four
point one gigahertz stable it did go to
four point two but it was unstable and
even at four point one gigahertz the
temperatures were really high even for
this CPU line up they went into the 80
degree mark which on this lineup of CPUs
was a little bit dangerous it's kind of
like the maximum range you want to go on
the CPU though as opposed to later
generations you've got an extra 10
degrees Headroom now it's for the GPU
the overclocks on this thing we're
really terrible I could only get an
extra 50 megahertz on the core though
not to say that it's a bad overclock
it's just that this graphics card the
EVGA gtx 770 is aggressively overclocked
out of the factory and then the memory I
could only get an extra 200 megahertz
out of the memory to
do we have a guy's the benchmarks are in
and this pc did a really good job dirt
for high settings over 60fps csgo we're
on this latest and greatest map I was on
a boat I didn't know what I was doing so
my first time playing the map and the
minimums were still over a hundred FPS
and a lot of times it was going into 200
FPS pray that did pretty well in that
game if you want to play that at 1080p
high then this PC can certainly do it
and then on to a next game like
Battlefield 1 and this is where some
problems occurred because the FPS was
okay at 1080p I mean I had to drop it to
medium and it was in like the 70s PS
soon but the problem was there's just no
one on these servers I like tried for
like a good half an hour to find a game
with players in it and I couldn't find
anything so I'm just wondering is
battlefield one dead at the moment I'm
not too sure so a little bit worried but
the FPS is still good in this game if
you want to play a bit of single-player
battlefield one and then of course the
last game we took a look at was players
unknown battlegrounds very popular game
at the moment and this PC did a pretty
good job of running it not as good as
some of the other pieces I have but for
the money definitely a really damn good
job I was surprised we're going around
60 FPS on medium settings and that was
with the view distance set to ultra
which is what a lot of people want that
view distance setting out there wonders
of other things with this build the open
air case take it how you will but
performance for the dollar here is
really good there was no side panels
included with this case and I personally
don't mind as the deal that I got there
was really good and also the deal on the
motherboard extremely good and also the
deal on that ex 3450 which you get off
Aliexpress is really good too so just
all came together with a lot of really
good here and there and it just made one
kick-ass gaming machine the temperatures
were really controlled obviously it's
like an open-air
now with just the airflow from the
outside ambient temperatures are cooling
this pc down the gtx 770 did really well
- i was surprised the cooling on that
thing is awesome
after you change the thermal paste
because the thermal paste did dry up on
that GPU it also dried off on the
motherboards platform chipset hub as
well but i replace that and what we got
was all these clean parts now working in
tandem to give one kick-ass experience
don't know you guys that's about it for
today's gaming pc that's all used
price-performance if i had to change one
thing out i'd probably spend a little
bit more money and get a new hard drive
as I think the old-school hard drive was
just really slow it took me a long time
to do the benchmarks it was holding this
thing back even something like a new 500
gigabyte or even one terabyte hard drive
would make a big difference there was
for the other parts they just really
kicked off that 3dmark fire strikes core
says it all 10k on the physics 9k on the
GPU you guys have something to
cross-reference it with with your own
rigs as well with that fire strike store
so let me know in the comment section
below if you like the build and also
what your scores are on fire strike we'd
love to hear that too and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
