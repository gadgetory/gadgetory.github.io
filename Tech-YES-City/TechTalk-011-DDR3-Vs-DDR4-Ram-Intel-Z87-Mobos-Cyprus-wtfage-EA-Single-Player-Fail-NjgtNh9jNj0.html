is brian is he coming back to you guys
today with episode 11 of tech talk and
sorry has been delayed I had to do my
ram thing and I've been sick lately but
let's get on with it the first news
you've probably heard a lot about it but
the Intel 8 series motherboards are
going to be coming out probably the next
two months some I'm guessing and
I'm paying particular attention to as
rock so they are going to release the
showcase the h87 pro for which I don't
really care about the z87 extreme6 and
easy 87 / 04 so basically we get we're
definitely going to see the extreme six
and we're definitely going to see the
pro 4 which is good news I would like to
see the extreme for however this time
around it depends on what they're going
to do with Haswell so these are the
specs / has well if discuss to perform
it's going to be basically a faster
version of ivy bridge on the same 22
nanometer infrastructure it's gonna have
a better idea p you as well and it's
also that's the biggest thing i think is
going to have the igpu is going to be
increased like almost threefold from
what I hear and also it's gonna be more
efficient going to have more yield and
this was the problem with ivy bridge is
that basically they didn't sold off the
joint and so they instead use paste so
when going from Sandy to ivy you
couldn't have a overclocked IV as much
as sandy and so this was a big problem
and it annoyed a lot of people that
annoyed me as well because i bought Ivy
Bridge and hopefully this time around
they're going to use soul during again
because they've intel apparently are
going to offer more overclocking
flexibility so in order to do this
they're either going to be sold during
or hopefully using some real decent
thermal paste so as long as they do this
then I will probably be buying the
extreme 6 motherboard so that way the
extreme sticks will offer a bit more
overclocking Headroom than the extreme
fall because the heat sinks are
generally a little bit better etc etc so
let's move on so that's has well guys
I'm going to be upgrading to has well so
a lot of people have been like Brian can
you upgrade it as well can you do an
overclocking tutorial can you I'm going
to do an over going to torial for as
well i'm going to give you guys the
I'm going to do some gaming benchmarks
with it I'm also going to be inspecting
the igpu because I want to buy my wife a
new laptop and if it's if the igpu is
really good then I'll be getting her and
as well nope notebook so that's what I'm
keen to check out with the ayah sorry
has well instead of IV and yeah I mean
it'll only be like I don't know maybe
150 doll or upgrades so because I'll
sell my Ivy Bridge stuff but let's get
on to the next part ddr4 ddr3 to ddr4
also have been asked a little bit about
this lately and basically the biggest
difference is this so i looked at this
this website here is really good it
basically brings up the most important
thing first and that is the voltage ok
so from ddr3 to ddr4 the voltage is
going down from 1.5 volt to 1.2 volts
and what this means is essentially is
going to reduce the power consumption
it's also going to run cooler so for the
server for the server industry it's
going to be a really good thing so it's
really good in that respect we're not
going to see like the speeds this time
around are not going to be a humongous
increase as we're seeing with ddr3
basically is that even at 1,600 speed
the average user is not having any ram
bottleneck issues so i think the speed
now on ddr3 is sort of way ahead of the
CPU sort of and the GPU and all that so
the RAM demand is not so big and so I
think it's a good thing also we're going
to see bigger sticks two gigabyte being
the minimum as opposed to 512 which is a
good thing so you know more banks and
yeah it's going to be good and a faster
burst access as well so it's going to be
better Ram obviously it's nothing to go
crazy about but it's just going to be
better so it's good I'm keen to see ddr4
now crucial demonstrated there so there
are people there are Samsung I think
designed the first model of ddr4 and
however jadek yet to approve it I think
so once jada can prove it then it'll be
main story will be going mainstream so
expect to see ddr4 in 2014 and it will
be not there won't be that big of a deal
so but yeah so and this is this so this
is a good article here I'll link this
I'll link all these articles in the
description below the ddr4 memory and
you shouldn't really care because the
speeds are already at 1,600 ddr3 is
absolute
enough for the average person at the
moment so I mean obviously people in the
rendering industry and stuff like that
video encoding whatever they will
probably benefit from a bit as for the
average user they're not really gonna
benefit from it so ddr3 ddr4 who cares
but yeah are going to be good it's going
to save a bit of power little like a
little bit for the home user just maybe
a dollar I don't know who guess this is
now the next by the news I don't usually
report on financial news guys but I've
been writing you know I read financial
news because i love finance but this is
the most up news I've ever read
like for a while on financial news
Cyprus is like they're just going the
government's and the banks have got
together and they're going to lublu look
let's just give people a tax on their
savings so if you've got money in the
bank they're just going to tax you take
ten percent of your money I think it is
so they're looking to take if you're
under if your own less than a hundred
thousand euros you will pay I think six
point seven five percent and if you own
over that amount i think it's you're
going to be ten percent so they'd
haven't decided that the numbers yet but
it is just the stupidest thing
I've ever heard like is amazingly stupid
instead of the government this is how
this just shows you how stupid
governments are in some parts of the
world instead of just saying look we'll
take one percent or something really low
and see how it works out they're just
going to charge a ten percent like it
and people are just open arms and
they're taking their money out of the
banks as you would take Druitt
withdrawing all their cash because they
don't want to lose money I mean they're
ready people have already paid tax on
their money they've worked their asses
off they've saved hard they've paid
taxes to the government and then they've
got the government's going to charge
them again for having savings I mean
come on what that's just absolutely
ridiculous and i agree Russian President
Vladimir Putin he's really angry as well
because a lot of Russians have parked
their money and Cyprus now it's just
it's huge man like they don't they
haven't actually decided on the numbers
yet but this is just a mass its massive
news because if governments can pass
laws to take money from your bank
accounts what's going to happen in the
future when all these government debts
and all the problems come to free
what are we going to do I'm just scared
because like hey and I mean it probably
it definitely won't happen in America or
Japan but I mean if Cyprus are kind of
setting the example hey let's just take
people more people's money out of the
bank accounts then I don't know what's
going to happen in the future like this
is just the worst financial news I've
ever read in a while so it's really big
deal it's huge news and I just think
it's wrong so i usually don't report on
financial news but i have to report on
it so let's move on now smartphones it
asks do i use a smartphone so guys do i
personally use a smartphone and the
answer to that question is no I used to
use a smartphone but I don't anymore and
the reason being is because it just
consumed too much of my time I would
just be glued to it and the problem was
is that sometimes I would wake up in the
morning and I'd forget to charge my
phone then I wouldn't have a phone for
the rest of the day so I reverted back
to a just a crap phone that i can mail
and text and call people and that's all
i use now this thing so it's cheap as
well it's ten dollars a month my
smartphone just got me a hundred dollars
a month and so this i read a few
articles about it you know smartphones
silly uses but i don't agree for some
people of course smartphones are going
to be so efficient they're going to be
so convenient to have a smartphone like
if you use it for navigation i mean i
have a navigation system in my car so i
don't really need a smart phone for
navigation purpose for music I have a
little iPod you know not an ipod a co
one s nine so i can just direct copy
paste this music from my computer to the
unit but smartphones I don't know you
know personally I bought my wife a
galaxy s3 and i love it i think it's a
beautiful phone but i just can't use a
smartphone it they're addictive and I've
already been addicted i had an iphone 3
and I chucked it in the bin after a year
because I'd litter I didn't even riso I
chucked it in the bin because
smartphones I just believe there I mean
that they're really good that's the
problem there too convenient and I think
the problem I had was I was using it too
much and another problem i had with
smartphones is that this it take me like
an hour to do something on my smartphone
i could do that on in like a minute on
my computer so that was annoying me as
well so it was
at the same time I was addicted I was
frustrated so it was the frustrated
addiction so if there's an analogy I'd
have to do it now with the smartphone's
like hey I gotta check check the news
check the news scroll Scroll scroll I
freezing slow and so crazily stupid so
that was a bad analogy sorry but I mean
I'm sick I have an excuse I can't think
properly this week so anyway let's move
on now I'm gonna move on to EA and their
epic failure SimCity now you guys
probably heard about this but I want to
ask you guys do you think single player
games should require you to connect to
the internet every single time you wish
to play a single player game I think
it's absolutely wrong with sim city
because sim city has traditionally been
a single player game and I when I by
SimCity I don't want to play it online I
just want to play it in solace man I
just want peace and quiet I want to
build my city and that's it I don't want
to interact with any other city this is
my city so I think the problem is EA
have really stuffed up and have there
been stuffing up a lot in the past I
think their CEO recently got out but
that's really bad because he's just been
you know EA have done some good things
but they've also done a lot of bad
things and I think SimCity was a bad
thing this time around look at the
reviews here I mean one half one point
three stars is pretty funny so a lot of
people had problems connecting and they
couldn't play the game and so I mean
Maxis admitted that you know the SimCity
servers aren't even necessary so this is
just horrible news it's bad publicity
for EA I think personally they stuffed
up the red alert series as well I I
think EA have done some hit and miss
things and I really i mean i'm not
buying SimCity because of the not
because of this server issue but because
of the people who have reviewed it said
it's more like sim town and so I love
them sort of macro aspect of SimCity and
so I'm gonna give it a Miss until you
know becomes like dirt cheap so I'm not
going to buy it if it's symptom you know
I don't want to play a game that like
that but let's move on to us starcraft 2
and the link stuffed up so harder the
swarm blizzard have done an epic job
with this game and this is I mean I
we purchased heart of the swarm we're
gonna do a six Sunday's episode on it I
love it it's amazing okay this game is
the the multiplayer I've just gotten to
it a little bit I mean there's still a
lot of things that need I think tweaking
and balancing but the whole multiplayer
is amazing and the best thing about
starcraft 2 is in my opinion is the
campaign is so much fun it's like you're
watching a movie there's so much story
there is so much depth in the story and
i love it i think starcraft brood wars i
only played multiplayer I pretty much
cheated my way just skipped all the
cheats to see the cinematics but this
time I'm actually playing the single
player and I love it and the best thing
that Blizzard are finally doing now is
that they're giving global pricing and
then pretty much averaging it out so
like balancing the pricing out so i paid
forty five dollars Australian for the
expansion which is very fair and instead
of paying like sixty dollars in
Americans pay forty dollars it's I think
it's very good that they're pricing it
all equal now I think it's really good
aspect blizzard of finally getting on to
it I don't have to go to some dodgy CD
key site and buy my CD can just log on
to Blizzard credit card bang by out of
the swarm it's so easy and I finally
like the blizzard at being fair with the
pricing and it's great that they're
doing this so if you guys are thinking
about getting harder the swamp I highly
recommend it it's a very fun game it's
very good upgrade blizzard I think they
stuffed up with diablo 3 I thought
diablo 3 was atrocious but starcraft two
harlots swarm is a really good game and
so i'm actually one game i'm keen to see
in final closure came to see arma 3 and
i've been hearing a lot of good news
about it i mean look at this this is
just a screenshot but i mean this just
shows you how damn good this game looks
I mean this just looks so realistic so
I'm really keen to try this out and
marry a lot of good news about it so
people were saying like it's amazing
already so yeah that's about it guess so
also guys in closing I will say I've
been sick sorry I'm still am sick I
bronchitis luckily I haven't coughed
throughout this episode but yeah I'm
gonna give you guys a tech talk next
week as well and let me know what you
want me to talk about two guys so give
me some topics in the comments if you
guys have any tech tech hot talk a
little hot tech top topics hot tech
topics that you want me to talk about
please put them in the comment section
below and I'll get on to them as soon as
I can
and yes so sorry this one's a little bit
rushed I've just sick so I really i'm
still you probably heard in my voice so
but i want to get you guys a vid i want
to get you as a content and in closing I
will say that bang that's it so ddr4 not
really nothing to worry about haswell's
going to be pretty good in my opinion
I'm going to be upgrading do you guys
think I should go with the i7 4770k or
the 467 TK I'm thinking since i render a
lot of videos and i do a lot of non
gaming stuff now that i actually might
go with the i7 this time around but
either way i'm going to be giving you
guys overclock tutorials going to be
giving you guys sweet spots i'm going to
be giving you guys the igpu benchmarks
and stuff like that bench marks compared
IV so to be really good so i can't wait
to do it and give you guys advice and
share it with you guys so be cool and if
