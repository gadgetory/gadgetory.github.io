creatives x7 daca and pamba as well as
the accompanying speaker set which goes
with this unit and they are the xm7
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
check yet city this is brian coming back
to you guys today with an interesting
review of the creative x7 flagship
decamp combo now creative also decided
to send me their accompanying speaker
set the XM sevens as well
so if you wish to just see the speakers
and I'll put the link in the description
below so if you wish to skip ahead to
that you can do so but before we get
onto the speakers let's take a look at
this big bad boy the x7 so the creative
x7 is an interesting piece of hardware
it's pretty much an all-in-one solution
where it's got a DAC and combo and an
ADC built on board it's also even got a
mic on board the actual unit so if you
don't have a microphone you'll still be
able to use this thing now an
interesting thing about this product is
it is NFC compatible that's near-field
communication so if you have another one
of these units or you have a device that
can support NFC you can pretty much have
an intercom going on at your house so
that's the first thing that I like about
this product the next thing I like about
this product is the design it's kind of
like some Star Wars futuristic design
here and I actually really think they've
hit the mark with the design it's a
heavy solid built unit but also as that
it's got all the connections you can ask
for from a unit looking at the front of
the unit here we see the creative logo
standing out there with the mech port
and the volume knob though one thing I
will critique from the get-go is that I
wish there was a volume indicator since
this product has so many different uses
and features it would be interesting to
see a volume knob though if you connect
it to your PC then it will show the
volume on the desktop itself looking
below that you've got the power button
there which you can power from a
standard AC adapter which is included
with this combo below that you've got a
standard mic in port as well which can
work as a line in and besides that
you've got a quarter inch Jack port
there for headphones and then besides
that you've got a three-and-a-half
millimeter jack for standard headphone
input as well output so all in all you
can power two separate sets of
headphones from this unit at the same
time as well it will allow for that also
below above that you've got the SPX
button there which will allow you to
turn on and off SPX effects at your will
so it's a really good feature there and
also if you download the soft
where you can take advantage and tune
the SPX settings to your own liking but
we'll get onto that a little bit later
when we look at the software suite
looking at the sides of the unit you've
got the aggressive sound blaster
straightedge styling there as well as
the logo printed on there below that
you've got a USB host port as well
that's on the left side of the device on
the right side you've got pretty much
the same styling there though no USB
host on this side so looking at the
bottom of the unit got four rubber feet
in each of the corners there this will
allow this unit not to slip on your desk
which is a great thing taking off this
plastic cover reveals opm's which are
interchangeable so you can mix and match
the sound to the way you like though I
will say out of the box this thing
sounds fantastic looking at the rear of
the unit this is where all the magic
happens you've got four analog outs
there which will power two speakers at 8
ohms at 27 watts per channel if you
switch that down to 4 ohms you'll then
have 38 at what's available to each
channel and you've also got besides that
the power in there the 24 volt power in
and if you decide to buy creatives
optional power supply then it can put
out more power though I will critique
that and I kind of wonder why they
didn't include this power supply with
the x7 since it is an expensive unit but
looking below that we've got the line
out RCA s there which have the right and
left you've also got the rear and the
sub out 3.5 millimeter jacks which will
allow you to hook up a 2.1 sound system
with this unit you've also got a line in
there for RCA as well as an optical out
and an optical in and the USB which will
allow you to get sound from your
computer via the USB and one good thing
about this unit and we'll start talking
about the benchmarks is that the balance
of this unit was pretty much perfect so
there was no color in this unit I was
happy to report that over both the
optical and the USB line in there so
this thing performed extremely well on
the benchmarks and then we look at those
crosstalk figures and Wow
this is the lowest I've pretty much ever
seen you can just see there this thing
is not moving at all so very impressive
figures coming out of the x7 with
however that should be expected when
you're paying top dollar for a product
like this but it was glad to at least
know that this product was a premium
product that not only looked good it
performed really good as well
on the benchmarks so with that being
said we'll quickly take a look at the
software that's included then I'll do a
mic in test for you and I'll also test
the onboard mic included with the x7 so
a dual mic in test for you guys whilst
we take a look at the creative
soundblaster x7 software suite now for
this test I'm using my V mode of boom
Pro microphone plugged directly into the
x7 unit with a setting of 70% with the
microphone boost turned on and also echo
cancellation turned on though let's take
a look at the first tab here SPX pro
studio if you turn this on you'll notice
the light will come on and you'll also
be able to access cool settings like
surround which will emulate a surround
effect for your speakers and your
headphones I find this great for certain
types of video games like MMOs or RPGs
when I want to get that little bit of
extra immersion though for competitive
games I do tend to turn it off crystal
eyes are a great setting for bringing
out a bit of extra edge in your music I
do like to listen to this with certain
types of rock for instance to cipher
down when I listen to that I turn this
setting on bass though I tend to leave
this setting off at all times as it adds
a lot more quantity of bass but at the
expense of quality so if you're at a
house party or something and you need
some extra bass then I could see this
setting maybe coming in handy below that
we've got the smart volume and dialog +
settings which will allow you to cap
some of those loud noises in movies and
bring out the voices more sort of
normalize the volume great if you're
watching a movie at nighttime and you've
got loud guns going off and you just
want to hear the voices a little bit
easier and not annoy your neighbors or
bring them as my own as least annoyance
as possible though their setting here
we've got crystal voice and this allows
you to change your microphone settings
you can see here I've got it actually at
69% with the mic boost setting turned on
below that we've got crystal voice which
allows you to actually add a lot of cool
different effects in if you want to
change it to alien brute or if you want
to change it from a boy to a girl you
can do that and vice-versa if your boy
if you're a girl and you want to change
it to a male voice you can do that with
this setting you've got a lot of
different settings there it actually
doesn't work while I'm recording on the
desktop for some reason
but it does work in games people can
hear my voice change smart volume
I won't click that setting as a little
semi recording crazy but it will help
cap the wisp cap the shouting and help
boost the whispers below that you've got
noise reduction which will essentially
take away the noise out of your
microphone if you've got a noisy
microphone plugged in or if you've just
got your settings smashed to the max and
you're amping your microphone through an
actual preamp as well so that can help
with that below that acoustic echo
cancellation will help cancel out
echoing focus will help narrow down the
microphone or it'll help open the area
up depending it I find this works pretty
well with the actual onboard array
microphone
below that we've got a mic EQ there
which will allow you to add some more
warmth into your voice if you wish to
though for me personally I like my
microphone to do most of the job for
that and I like to have the settings or
the components as good as possible so I
don't have to play around with the mic
EQ though I could imagine this having
some good values in other certain types
of applications let's move on now to
scout mode where if you turn this on
you'll be able to hear footsteps that
much easier in FPS games for instance if
I'm playing advanced warfare and I want
to hear voices a lot or hear footsteps a
lot easier then I can just quickly turn
this setting on but keep in mind that
this is nothing that you can't do with a
good EQ program though it's just great
that creative have included this with
just a click of a button so if you're
playing FBF games and you want to hear
those footsteps easier then that's a
great setting to have speakers here
we've got polarity the first setting
here which allows you to reverse the
polarity of your speakers if you wish to
personally for me I don't bother with
this setting though some people claim it
can make a difference so you've got that
there on the actual tab the next tab
here is calibration which I really like
that they've included this with the
setup as this can actually run you up a
lot of money if you get a professional
to do this that's calibrating the
Seekers so all the sound hits your ear
at the same time by either delaying the
sound output or actually increasing the
volume levels as well so this will help
you get a perfect sound experience also
below to the next you've got settings
for your speakers which will allow you
to put your speakers
a direct mode if you wish for an
uncoloured sound though as I said before
my XM sevens I do believe they have a
v-shaped output so I'd like to add
warmth in there so I select the warm
settings for those XM sevens below that
we've got headphone mode you can put
this into rack mode as well that'll give
you that uncolored sound and on this
unit as you saw before that graph this
thing is a really mutual output which is
really good you've also got the high
gain setting there which will power
those hard to power headphones like
those also dynamic headphones that you
see going around so I've got mine set at
normal gains since I'm just using some
low ohm or easy to drive headphones
we've got here cinematic below that
Dolby Digital I'd like to leave this on
full I love 5.1 surround sound with
Dolby Digital you can put this on full
maximum and it will just give you a
awesome experience when you're watching
movies below that you've got the mixer
panel there for both playback and
recording so you can change settings on
the fly and then below that you've got
the EQ settings if you wish to EQ in
some extra bass for example if I was on
onboard audio I would have this dialed
in but since this unit doesn't suffer
from bass roll-off or it suffers very
little I don't have to turn up the bass
that much and you'll find that this will
give you strong sub bass and it'll also
give you good bass from the unit now if
I'm on my on board audio as I said
before I would do something like that
you can also add some also there's also
other presets in there like flat country
and dance and all those other jazz sorts
of types of EQ if you wish to put them
in below that we've got the profile
setting there which will allow you to
save all these previous settings into an
easy nice custom setup here as you see
I've got actually a few custom setups
going and so you're able to save a
profile on the fly very easily as well
as choose from some other profiles here
just by clicking a button and then below
that you've got your settings here for
speaker and headphone which will
essentially change the volumes on the
fly so that's about it for the software
suite let's move on now to a quick test
with the onboard
array microphone and then we'll move on
to a conclusion for you guys
okay so we're just going to quickly test
the beam microphone on
this unit now I don't know if you guys
would be able to hear me properly but as
closer when I get closer to the unit it
should sound really good however if you
move far away from the unit then it kind
of does not sound as good as a dedicated
microphone like a boom mic that'll be
directly to your mouth then without
being said let's move on now to the
conclusion so the x7 is you can see it
performed extremely well on the
benchmarks this thing is pretty much
worthy of being a flagship product
though with that being said we'll
quickly take a look at the accompanying
speaker set then I'll round it all up
for a big conclusion for you guys so
let's quickly take a look at the XM 7s
these are the accompanying speakers that
come with the x7 if you wish to purchase
them now they're 60 watt speakers per
unit and also you get a 30 mil tweeter
with it as well as a 105 millimeter
speaker now I was happy to report that
the bass was very tight on these units
and it was pretty strong considering the
speaker was only 105 millimeter now also
with this unit you get a very big design
our surprise is actually quite big
measuring in at 295 millimetres by 230
millimeters by 173 millimeters with the
covers on you can also take the covers
off very easy if you wish to go for that
look and then the speaker connections on
the back are very easy to use that comes
included with speaker wire which is also
pre-cut as well which allow you to screw
it in and you're pretty much good to go
the one thing I will say is that off the
mark these things were very clear and
crisp but the bass was tight the highs
were very clear the one thing I will say
is that it is kind of like a v-shaped
sound output coming out of these so one
thing that I will say that's good about
it though is that in the creative SBS
studio was there was three presets as
soon as you open up the software that
allows you to choose which sound set you
liked which profile you're late for your
speakers so I street a immediately
selected warm and I was proud to report
that these things sounded really good so
let's quickly take a look at the design
and the weight of these speakers they're
way a little bit over three kilograms
per speaker and also they're designed of
like this nice subtle black wood it's
very solid design on these units and I
am pleased to report that it does feel
like a quality unit though it is a
little bit pricey and I would like to
see a 2.1 dedicated system as opposed to
a 2.0 now let's talk about the loudness
of the speakers because anyone buying
speakers wants to know how loud they go
with the accompany Act seven these
things went really loud for a solar room
it's about as loud as I would want
maximum volume in my room however that
being said they did not go any louder
than that so if you wanted these things
for passe for powering a party or the
you know barbecue and you want music
going on from inside I'd say you'd need
more powerful of a system to do that so
if you're just in a room and you want
really loud audio for instance watching
movies and stuff this unit will perform
and do the job perfectly fine and then
some so we conclusion the x7 this is
this bad boy here this thing really
impressed me a lot it has the hardware
to go in and you've got like a 127
decibel signal-to-noise ratio there
you've got volume there you've got
options there you've got a great
software suite you've got a fantastic
mic input and you've got a decent mic
built onto the unit itself everything on
this unit feels really good as well as
so much connectivity there and I will
say I'm happy to report this time around
with the x7 that the USB line is usable
it's fine you do bring no distortion or
no poor sound into the unit as opposed
with the e5 I thought the USB was a bit
lackluster compared to the optical in
there that is not the case with the x7
it performs extremely well and I was
happy to report that very flat neutral
line when I was using it in direct mode
which really pleased me as well then
we're going to move on to the software
suite I really like what creative have
done with this software suite it's fully
featured packed with unit I mean packed
with features I mean the list goes on so
this unit as you saw in the software
suite you can change it can EQ things
you can even change your voice you can
also set all the volume levels you even
got the options to set smart volume in
there so I was very pleased with this
unit all in all the x7 gets a big
recommendation from me even though it is
pricey so keep that in mind though if
you're looking for a unit that's got it
all and you're a gamer as well and you
appreciate low input lag from your sound
this will definitely give you that
option it I was happy to report as well
in games that I noticed no delay over my
onboard sound which was a great thing as
opposed to other USB DAC amp combos have
used in the past which do introduce
the delay from time to time so lhasa
let's look at the accompanying xm7 these
things were great speakers though very
clear and crisp and I was happy to
report that they did perform really well
they were very loud for a room though if
you were wanted to step it up to a party
setup now if you're having barbecues and
you need really loud music these things
would not do the job that well I'd say
you'd want to spend a bit more money and
get something even more powerful so if
you're into just watching movies in your
room or playing games from desktop
speakers these things will do an
excellent job so that being said they
are very big for your desk and this is
one thing I kind of don't know what I'm
gonna do now because I've got two
massive speakers where I don't know
where they're gonna fit as opposed to
the x7 which can pretty much just fit on
top of my computer like that so
ergonomics I don't know what I'm gonna
do around here but these speakers I'll
probably figure something out though
this is where I kind of wish they were a
two point one setup where I could have
two smaller speakers on my desk and then
a sub underneath my desk though with all
that being said very good unit very well
made and they do have two really high
quality speakers on each unit and they
can go the mile so that's about it for
today guys the x7 that gets a big
recommendation from me even though it is
a bit pricey however it is worthy of
being called a flagship product and it
comes with all the bells and whistles
and then some that you could want from
it DAC amp and a DC combo now the
accompanying XM seven speakers they are
a little bit big so if you know this
setback and you do have room to fit them
on your desk and you're not - you don't
care too much about base then they will
make a great accompanying partner to the
x7 so I can recommend eight recommend
them if you do know these limitations so
that's about it guys if you like this
video then you please give it a big
thumbs up and if you have any questions
or comments about the x7 all the XM
sevens then drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can and if you
haven't already subscribe to tech guess
City and I'll catch you guys in another
you very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
