the latest cases they've released the
speck Omega RGB and it comes in a white
and black aesthetic which is the one
that I've got here on the desk also
comes in a black on black
it's got tempered glass at the front
tempered glass of the side features an
RGB fan 120ml at the front and also the
rear and has course as node pro
controller unit which allows you to sync
this case with the likes of your RGB
Mouse RGB keyboard or even your RGB LED
strips all in one sync unit so at a
hundred and fifty dollars us however is
it worth your hard-earned or if you're
in a straight-up 208 UD let's find out
welcome back to tech yesterday you can
see here that the spec Omega is actually
Omega in pieces the front panel is
detachable the top panel comes off with
two screws and at the top you can fit a
tube 40 mil rad if you wish to at the
front a 360 mil rad and at the rear of
course a 120 mil rad there's also a
power supply covered down here and at
the rear of the unit there are three SSD
trays in the ability to fit two 3.5 inch
hard drives there's also the cable
management grommets three of them
available and the folks of Corsair
promised an easy and seamless
installation of your hardware and cable
management however we won't be able to
put that to the test until we actually
put a build in this PC so what we've got
here is an asrock x4 70 taiji really
good solid VRM I've also got a cool
master tough 750 watt power spike we're
gonna see just how tough this thing is
because we've got a 1080 Ti going in
tandem with a Verizon 7 2700 we're gonna
be overclocking these two pieces here
also a Galax 240 GB SSD 2 terabyte hard
drive for backup storage 16 gigabytes of
Galax RGB memory I know I haven't seen
this stuff in action either and a
newcomer to the cooling market ID
cooling I actually have never used their
coolers before this is the snow edition
so it's an all white 240 ml rad cooler
which we're going to be mounting to the
top of the unit so what are we waiting
for
let's put this thing together and see
what we can come up with
so now we've completed this built I can
finally talk about what I like and what
I don't like about the spec Omega RGB
first things first the aesthetic course
they generally do a good job of getting
their aesthetics right I think with the
spec Omega they've done a good job in
getting this right as well the power
splay cover that's really nice
considering you can still fit a 360 mil
rad at the front of the case but in this
case I decided to fit the 240 mil rad at
the front with the fans and now it's
sort of blowing it out of the case
rather than in taking because I wanted
to see that effect on this cooler
especially with the side paddle off and
also on one thing I will critique
however I couldn't fit this 240ml rad up
the top of the case like I said in the
manual when I tried to do that the RAM
and also the motherboard were
interfering with installing that flush
so if you are installing 240ml right at
the top you may come into some problems
but that would have been perfect because
the top of the case has so much
breathable mesh area and that would
really help cooling I believe but with
the cooling itself in this configuration
here now with the side panel off it was
a few degrees better than it was with it
on however keep in mind this time around
is not an ideal configuration for
cooling your CPU I just sort of went hey
I'm gonna try this out because the 240ml
rad wouldn't fit up the top and of
course I had to remove that existing
120mm fan at the front also if possible
I would like to see instead of having a
fan going on the outtake at the back I'd
like to see them put that to the front
of the case and also install an
additional RGB fan so you've got three
RGB fans at the front of the case I
think for $150 you should definitely get
one more fan included that would really
seal the deal with the spec of mega RGB
in my opinion but also when it came to
cable management there was some limited
space at the back I mean I came from the
570 X that was a little bit limited
because I'm used to working with the air
series cases and this felt like it was a
little bit more limited than the 570 X
so cable management is very tight
considering it does come with that node
Pro and the extra commander install at
the back and that does add to the amount
of cables and you've got those three SSD
bays as well although it's a tight fit
it is a small case in general it's
actually surprisingly small and the fact
that I could fit in a high-end build in
this PC is that
share credit of course it's not a bad
case if you do want to get around with a
mid-range build I'd say ideally you
probably want to drop in something like
a gtx 1075 8400 and you'd have a really
nice bling worthy case but ultimately
when it comes down to it this case does
have good build quality all the screws
line up everything makes sense when
you're also detaching and attaching
things but I do still prefer my air 540
even over something like the spec Omega
RGB even though the air series is not
RGB I'm hoping Corsair will refresh that
line up and do something special with it
but if you like this aesthetic then it's
definitely got it going on
150 us for the RGB version they've also
got the white and red versions which
come in significantly cheaper at around
90 USD so it is a decent case if this is
what you're after and also the good news
is if you're an Aussie the pricing in
Australia is 199 AUD sorts pretty much
the same as the US pricing in terms of
the dollar strength to the US dollar but
the last thing we'll talk about here are
some of the parts inside the ID cooling
to 40 mil rad I've never tried this
before it does look really nice and
especially with those white tubes is
something I really haven't seen out on
the market and it does come in at 100
Australian dollars if you are in the US
it will cost you around a hundred u.s.
so it is a little bit more expensive in
the only place I could find it from was
Aliexpress leather cooling itself when I
found it on I'll express it made sense
because it does perform similar to a 240
milk color that I've purchased off
Aliexpress in the past doesn't perform
anywhere near as good as Corsair
all-in-ones
so the performance was kind of
lackluster 4.1 gigahertz that was the
most I could get this CPU to on the rise
in 2700 even with the side panel off it
was going around 90 degrees in a CPU
Hardware so I'm used to lower temps even
at 4.2 Giga it's on a H 110 for example
I hate 100 with Corsairs all-in-one so
it's okay though if it's the aesthetics
you're after then it definitely does
deliver and also in total this whole
build does cost a little over 2,000 us
if you want to build it in around 2800
Australian dollars I will put all the
links in the description below but it is
unfortunate that you can't really get
this Galax ddr4 memory
it does look really good I managed to
get up to 29 33 megahertz and also the
Galax SSD the white as the steel that
looks really cool as well so everything
came in together here to make a nice
white and black thing build so if you
enjoyed today's video then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know
what you think of the spec of mega RGB
and also let me know if you haven't
built in one yet have you built in a
Corsair case before love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
it's okay if it's the aesthetic you're
after I'm reviewing the spec amiga RGB
and I don't even have my specs on so if
you enjoyed today's video then don't
forget to hit that like button also if
you have any questions or comments about
the spec of mega RGB and be sure to drop
my don't know what's going on with me
today man I'm I'm gone skis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
