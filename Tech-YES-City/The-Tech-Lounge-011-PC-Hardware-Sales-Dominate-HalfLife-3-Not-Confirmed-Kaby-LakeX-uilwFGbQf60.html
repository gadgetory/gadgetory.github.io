a tech yes city and this is kev from
text showdown joining you guys for
episode 11 of the tech lounge how you
don't give I'm doing pretty good bro I'm
just man it's been a hectic week last
week but it's all over now so I'll be
able to focus on doing lots of tech
videos this week how about yourself yeah
same here man it sold last week was just
off the chain i was busy busy busy i
actually did another build as well so
you've got to build in the background
somewhere so there's a thermaltake view
27 i did a build with that and sort of i
decided to change things up a little bit
do a high FPS game a kind of thing
because a lot of the times like its
legit though a lot of the times a lot of
people tell me they like to game on low
or even medium settings and get really
high FPS in certain games like csgo or
two or whatever the game is so they're
not too focused on the graphical
settings as opposed to getting those
high FPS is for the frames and even then
they make a good point is that when you
drop the graphic settings you don't get
the distractions like all the fancy you
know things flying around and whatnot so
it helps them focus on keeping you
fragging better or whatnot so i was
really impressed with that like that was
actually um a good build to do because
it was legit like I started playing CS
go and I started getting like better
frags like I got some footage of me
killing four dudes in one round no not
like come on yeah so I actually showed
that I'll just like Pat myself on the
back of the yay I've pretty good so I
got that done yeah and just other than
that just a lot of hardware is coming
through because like I want to get
started on the juicy stuff like you know
these engineering samples and stuff like
that but I've got a heap a backlog
because went on holidays and then I'll
sick and that that sickness took me out
for ages so there was a huge backlog of
parts to get through and so hopefully
this week by the end of this week I
should be on to all that juicy stuff
that people really want to see as well
so you know like can you overclock the
cabbie lake and stuff like that I'll do
my best to see if we can so
I did that in the engineering sample and
stuff like that and there's some other
cool stuff coming but yeah I want to
keep it a little bit of a secret some of
it so how about yourself them and I'm
done done talking haha so good yeah we
know be started I started on the key be
like stuff last week and yeah it's
pretty fun got the 7700 k it could have
it could do 4.9 but it didn't seem
entirely happy ah but it was very happy
at 4.8 there's 76 that this is a retail
one by the way there 7600 k however that
went 25 gigahertz and it was pretty
stable not one hundred percent but about
80% stable but if I brought it back a
little bit it was fine what speeds oh
duh I mean to Sado what speeds doh what
would I what do you mean what speeds did
you have this at ah well they got up to
five gigahertz I and I said it at the
voltage ways it was 1.43 I think it was
one 1.44 i think i cant what were you
getting out of my opinions well i got
see it was redic it still is
ridiculously hot I mean I'm getting like
you know I was getting five gigahertz at
one point three nine five or something
and then the 7700 k it just wouldn't go
to five gigahertz even if i gave at one
point four or five yeah that's stage I
was like now I'm not going to take it
too much higher than that but that got
interesting enough I got one a 4.9 at
1.32 so it was really good like it was
actually a really good chip it's just
obviously just capped out a 4.9 so arm I
couldn't you know get any higher yeah so
interestingly enough I just thought well
here it is that's that's all it can do
so I wonder how many other people out
there are getting five gigahertz 5.1
I've heard of people getting even 5.2 so
I I don't think it's as many as a lot of
people initially thought yeah um after
asking around you're definitely going to
get 4.84 point not well
definitely is a bit strong but but you
should be getting at least four point
eight yeah which is good because a lot
of the sky like CPUs it could quite a
few of them could get up that high but
many of them seem to like just set at
about 4.6 yeah I be Shilo minimums are
the sky legs the sky lakes were like 4.5
even sometimes they yeah 4.5 4.6 so it's
still a big bit of a jump up there but
uh yeah I think a lot of people buying
you know going into a thing I oh I'll
get five gigahertz guaranteed it's like
not not exactly no it depends I think
honestly I think you have to deal it if
you want to get five yards stiff all day
every day like because i was getting
90-something degrees like I tell you
that's okay for a cinebench run but if
you're loading up a game for half an
hour that is not gonna hold not at 90
you have to delayed that thing you have
to get those temps down if you want to
run it yeah so I actually did the 144
hurts pc and I clock the 7600 Kate of
four point eight gig oats now this was
only like 30-something degree
temperatures but it was running the
game's fine I mean the temperatures were
going up to whatever 80 degrees or
something in games which is okay but you
have to deal it to get those temp down I
definitely like if you want to get those
high overclocks like five even 5.1 24-7
you're going to have to deal it or at
least live in antarctica so it's your
choice yeah yeah but here's this is
interesting to as well look at that
we've got there that's the sky lakes I
don't know if you can see it on the
webcam but we got the sky like
engineering sample and then we've got
the cabbie lake cpu you probably see
that the the PCB is a three-layer I
believe versus a two layer so that was
interesting to find that out I was like
wow okay so they send the engineering as
samples out with thicker PCB or at least
stronger PCB then the retail samples so
I don't know what's going on but I'd
like to see a thicker PCB because I
actually want to deal it one of these
chips I really do and I want to see the
temperature difference and I want to see
if in gaming if you leave a game on for
two hours
is one overclock going to be better than
the other and I think of course it will
be because you know temperatures do
affect overclock so dear letting is one
of those things you'd want to do to get
those extra couple hundred megahertz
stable out of your CPU so yeah that's
that that's it was interesting to me
anyways that I the motherboard is the
that I was testing Kubelik on was the
Auris which is gigabyte gaming x5 I
believe and the when I was reading their
guide because just wanted to see what
they reckon they hadn't part of the guy
debelle t letting but I thought was
pretty crazy from you know actual
company I always thought it was sort of
this some you know more shadowy think
not got shadowy but but you know like an
actual big company wouldn't talk about
it type thing yeah um but know that had
it right in the guide it was like oh if
you you know experiencing bad
temperatures you can always pretty much
deal it it and this was like posting
their results which were pretty good
from what i remember it was about a 10
degree difference yeah i'm so you drop
about 10 degrees which was pretty
impressive so yeah there's it's
interesting to see now but i mean this
just it shouldn't need to come to this i
feel we got over this with devil's
canyon but i'll know until we got to go
back here again well that's the name
that's another factor that might propel
zen right to yeah yeah i mean if zens
not cutting any corners like this i
think a lot of people rally behind it so
all's it's got to do is have good
performance that's all yeah and good and
of course bring that value the money to
the table but i think a lot of people
going to rally behind that another thing
too is in some of my videos especially
the one upcoming as well some of the
footage I did figure out the problem
people like I'll you know your cabbie
Lake video there was a bit of stuttering
that was actually the capture card on
the storage you know it was going over
USB 3 and the storage I fixed it up
anyway so yeah some of the footage had a
bit of sliding it wasn't the CPU i will
say that it wasn't the cpu except and i
will talk about this though I you know I
have to maybe if you guys in the
audience want me to go on a witch hunt I
might but those minimums in crysis 3
were
jit like they were legit those that
difference you know cuz steve from
hardware and box he pulled me over on
the Delos like dude like your results
men like you know that looks a bit weird
man I'm like what which one and he's
like Oh your arm your crisis three
benchmark you know twenty percent lower
minimums on the cab you leik g 45-60 the
pen Ian first is the i3 6109 I just said
to him dude that's legit like I tested
apples to apples exact same patch of
turf there you know what I mean and
that's what the results were and so now
crysis 3 is a game that's really cool i
love crysis 3 especially even for
benchmarking till this day why because
even as much as it stresses the GPU like
to the max it stresses your CPU to the
max given the right settings and yet
it's it chooses it more than some
pre-made benchmarks and now what this
means is if you have a program that's
bench that's it's juicing a lot of cpu
power what that means is it's utilizing
the cash more than other benchmarks more
than other games because we all know
that you know a shot at cpu if it's
being used it's burning up a lot of
power hence why the x 99 cpus burn up a
lot more power than their fork or
variance or that brothers the forecourse
because they have way more level 3 cash
now that case you guys up a lot of power
and so the difference between the 45 60
and the i3 6100 is that one's got smart
cash now i don't know if that will
contribute towards the differences in
minimums but i would guess that's the
biggest factor because the 200 megahertz
difference is not going to make up for
twenty percent difference in lower
minimums yes so pretty interesting what
are they doing with that small case it
might be legit yeah now it's a very good
point you've raced yeah that's really
interesting yeah so I found that out I
was like well I could go and test it and
go on a witch hunt but at the end of the
day I guess a lot of game has already
know the more you have the more
horsepower you have the better it's
going to be I just I guess that if you
know if you were to put it apples to
apples Smart Case would be better than
on smart cache on the Intel side of
things and what exactly is smart case i
don't really know I guess it's just the
way it's been programmed the way that
you know and whatever yeah this is I I
read about it while you but I can't
remember off the top of my head I
remember reading because I wanted to
know but I've forgotten now but yeah
there is better um what should be in
life is better guys it's better for the
people in the states it's pronounced
cash I know don't have to hit me in the
comments i already know guys I already
know yeah so bizarre New Zealand in New
Zealand it's like everyone in the
industry says it both ways you be like
Oh talking about the cash and then some
will say cash and then they say cash
it's like people just use both all the
time let have some people use one way a
half of you use the other they don't
just say one okay most of most of them
say cash I've actually I remember asking
one goes like wait occasion he's like
because when I say cash all the
customers get confused and I was like oh
really a nice yeah so he's a case
instead it's exactly how you pronounce
in your country it's how you pronounce a
cache of weapons or whatever you know I
mean now the military or drop in America
they pronounce your hash so that's fair
enough that's how they pronounce this so
however you pronounce that word because
that's what it is it's a storage close
to the CPU that's a it's a cash or cash
it is so however you however your
country pronounces that said would that
sounds going to be pronounced for the
CPU side of things too so anyway English
English 101 on on a taquito you yeah
okay so we're gonna move on to the first
topic year people like actually it's
funny because no one's actually told us
to move on to topics yet that's how cool
is that it's been like the first maybe
maybe the personal chat is pretty
interesting this week cool sorry so
first up you keep we've got microsoft
acquires simply gone so it plans to
accelerate 3d for everyone yeah so
apparently they've yeah they've taken
over this company microsoft's just got
all that money in the bank and it's got
here the microsoft symbol plus the
simplygon sequel equals love now what
exactly this is love going to entail I'm
pretty confused because in the past
we've known that Microsoft can get
things like dx12 and I'd say in a way
yet make a mess of them yeah I think
this is interesting so they said it was
used by car manufacturers to be
visualized products in VR at full scale
and so they made themselves they said
that made a name within the CAD based
work ad means computer-aided design yeah
I visualization platform so that's great
cool and this will be what they say they
also integrated it into applications
such as unreal engine 4 yeah see this is
an interesting move by Microsoft um yeah
I think uh well you'd hope only good
things come from it but yeah it's quite
quite an interesting thing for them to
do you better hope guys you better put
your hands together alright it'll tie
end with the creator's update as well so
maybe but it's death on me get on your
knees and pray that they don't sort of a
monopolize this in any sort of way shape
or form but knowing that I'd say what's
the real well okay and there's my phone
and what we got here so essentially this
is that they're just threw me off you
know like I was just those folks I
forgot what I was going to say now the
fastest the windows 10 creators update
this should be available for everybody
on it hopefully something like this some
sort of 3d design thing for people to
use which would be quite cool but we'll
have to see closer to the time if that's
going to be the cap of the case or not
this way I'm powering this off their
hair you like that person interrupt me
in the CEO no more interruptions
midstream okay so yeah they're
integrating this into apparently like in
Unreal Engine 4 and so they want to
integrate it into their newest
reiteration of windows and they've got
to focus on 3ds well I mean v ours I'd
say arguably it's going to be the future
i mean i'd say it's going to take a lot
longer to adopt than people think I've
refuted the issues surrounding it but I
think that's where they envision
this acquisition going is we're simply
gone okay Microsoft we can integrate it
into Windows Windows Store VR experience
I think that's where they envision this
going so I I think you're exactly I
think what will happen in the future
from my point of view once the VR
technology and the headsets themselves
are sophisticated enough as people will
not run a monitor anymore their desk
will be they'll sit down they already
run this as a lot of your applications
you can get for this and you put on your
VR hits it and then you go into what's
called the virtual desktop yeah and
people can do that because you'll think
well what if I all the stuff right in my
face know what it is you're in the VR
you're sitting at a desk with whatever
monitor you want and the application and
all that stuff so that will be maybe it
sounds kind of bizarre to wear a headset
just to look at a screen in the BR yeah
but um I can see that starting to take
off right now it seems a bit crazy but
in the future that may be the case I may
be completely off but I think something
like that might start getting more
people's attention I I think see there
they're going to have a hard time
contending with people with jewel 27
more inch monitors like myself or people
with the wide 34 inch monitors I mean
let's be honest it doesn't get much
better than this guys come on yeah you
got your mouse your keyboard mechanical
switches awesome mouse then you've got
your amazing monitors and your amazing
hardware it's like it doesn't get much
better than this except one person did
make a good point VR porn I mean that
could be a huge industry so yeah that
like I see there's a billion reason I
legitimately think that could be a real
thing sigh oh well it already is it
sorry keV I got to put myself on d and
be like so I guess someone's on the
stream they're like okay like I don't
know why people won't have the need to
be smart asses midstream okay anyway
back to the articles
okay by myself on dnd now so maybe
people can have perhaps yeah stop trying
to interrupt the stream now okay next
article so we're done with that one a
microsoft acquired simply gone now we're
moving over to i-77 thousand skylake x +
kv lake acts so we actually we talked
about this a couple of months ago and
the bottom line was cabby lake ex was
being launched besides skylake x and
they had a fork or a thread variant now
the problem with this is that cabbie
league's been released and it's
virtually the same thing as sky like a
ska lake yeah so yeah i would i would
argue that they're not even going to
release sky like x they're just going to
call the whole thing kobe like x because
that's an easy way for them to catch up
play catch up on x 99 they've got their
new generation of four cause it makes
perfect sense for Intel from a business
standpoint finally cable a gas can catch
up to cabby lake it might do what
they're saying right now is it's going
to be a combination of both they're both
going to be coming out at similar times
but you'll have three skews which will
be the sky like x you'll get the usual
tink or eight core and six core and then
kb lake will be coming out with a fork
or a thread which I'll be interested to
see what they do with that now I don't
think many people are going to be that
hyped for these new CPUs considering
that when we went from has really too
broad well II it was that was a bit more
exciting because we went from the 59 60
X being the top dog which was a core 16
thread to a 69 50 x which is tink or 23
we're not seeing that same sort of
difference this time I would imagine
it's going to be you know the 7950 X
will probably be very similar except
with higher clock speeds and if maybe
change around with the cash and a few
other things all the pci lanes and that
will be no more a net so looks like you
get four more pci you later
every leg active aliensix morbid um it's
got a new socket so you're moving from
LGA 2011 three of version 3 to LGA 2066
now the biggest problem i have here is
that you know i don't think they're
going to sell that well on this time
around because people already have 58 20
keys some people went out and bought the
6800 k knowing like myself knowing that
it's a pretty much inferior in that it
doesn't clock as high as the 5820 a so
it's virtually the same thing and then
people want to get numbers on cab you
like X is that going to clock higher I
think that's the only way they're going
to sell LGA 2066 if those six call
variants because that's I'd say that's
arguably the most popular CPU on the x
99 platform is the 5820 candy 6800 k but
if they can't get the clock speeds right
I just see a lot of people forgetting
about it because you've got to go out
and buy a whole new motherboard this
time around as well so who wants to go
do that I me in particular not really I
in hindsight I regret upgrading to the
6800 k it was a waste of time and effort
the 58 20k was perfectly fine so you
know a lot of people out there on the 58
20k it's been it's actually a really
damn good cpu especially when next 99
platform was first released it had
everything it could clock pretty high
for a 6-core it had the price tag
associated with it and the next night I
wasn't too expensive if you got those
cookie cutter motherboards so exactly
yeah I don't see this selling
particularly well there'll be certain
people out there that I don't think
it'll sell well from the perspective of
people like us going from broad well II
to say sky like X or key belleek x I'm
however things end up I think it would
just be the usual people which are those
who are going from say the core series
and then jumping up like I did before
when i went from my 4770k and then now I
run the 6900 k which is very similar to
the 59 60 x yes so um that would be uh
what I think some of the sales are
becoming from but all of this just boats
even bitter for rising because just it
just so many people
even people I know that are big fans of
Intel um do feel let down the shower ja
ja Rule Chester that he's let down he's
been let down as well he knows how it
feels man he's back in team AMD guys
don't worry and this right now just adds
to it because nothing I've seen from
this I mean there's some little cool
things with X 2 99 you know the saying
ddr4 2067 a native support which okay
you know a few other things you know as
you said with the pci lanes but really
there's nothing that jumps out to me as
really that big I mean it's like cool
the people going on about the native
support of USB 3.1 with kb lake you know
how many people actually kid going from
ski like you know true I don't know yep
it's not so uh yeah this is going to put
really well but again yeah we'll just
have to see if it's true that the IPC
are rising is similar to broad well then
and their pricing is as aggressive as
we're hoping it's going to be yet from
AMD then I think Intel's going to need
to change their pricing around a lot and
it will be going after these top ones as
well that a core 16 thread rise and cpu
that's going to start to cause trouble I
think in this high end the gaming
productivity end well I was looking
through the so-called arm so-called
layout for zen and the one that
interests me the most surprisingly is
the six core six thread that really
interests yeah yeah yeahs me form the
date on my eyes on by okay coming around
two hundred and twenty dollars or
something like that that looks like the
CPU to get because you know the eight
core 16 threads going to be apparently
six hundred dollars or whatnot so for
gamers I mean damn six core six threads
is where it's at that's a tough CPU you
know that is like it going to the gym
every day and working out but not having
to go to the gym and spend the time you
know will ya I think it's going to kill
the i5 if it's if it lives up to that
well they're going to have to change the
pricing around mass
because you know but I think it'll be
very interesting when we both get them
and start testing Rosen yep in the
future is they'll have the fork or a
thread reisenthel so after six core six
thread yeah and that's something that's
actually quite interesting too yeah will
that will the six physical cores and be
good or will people you know having six
straight or there be a full grey thread
yeah well that that'll be a year down
yeah hmm that'll be a good show down for
a particular channel called tech
showdown yeah well I'll definitely do
that stuff but yeah I think I'm what
you're seeing with the eight core 16
thread that high price tag obviously
that isn't so much aimed at the gaming
market that thing is going to be aimed
at the productivity market I'm going
straight after these enthusiast series
so I still see a lot of people just
buying it anyway because they want the
best that andy has to offer so and as
well you know that's six score six
threat it's going to empower keyboard
worries all across the internet you're
gonna see some flame wars going on i
can't wait i'm gonna get my popcorn
ready it's going to be pretty awesome so
yeah have you had by the way have you
heard anything that you can make public
about racing in terms of release dates
anything if you have this under I by I'm
not even under NDA so I can't even okay
Ivan I haven't heard anything I asked
around it I if it's dame diez keeping
this really tight yeah it is I'm e sure
it'll be before march though that's all
I've sort of the only leeway I've sort
of had it's really sure to be just after
march from what i hear so okay yeah yeah
and depends this time around is you know
like Australia got the g 45-60 before
the states that was really weird is
going to be sort of like a different
countries it gets rolled out at
different times that song yeah you know
that's something that I'm waiting for I
mean newzealand looks like you guys get
it a month later anyway by default so we
get about two weeks after you you get
them and I'll see who a week and a half
after you guys get them because all the
Aussie distributors keep everything for
themselves yeah so well move on to the
next topic anyway so yeah some gaming
news here Gabe Newell he got a name a
and on reddit i think it was and he said
the number theory must not be said
because people are asking people like
want to know about half life 3 when's it
coming out now he did admit that the
customer support needs a bit of work on
steam and whatnot but hey and i think
any company's customer sport could
always use some work but considering how
many customers steam actually has that's
pretty a generic thing to say but half
life 3 is kind of disappointed with the
response you know it's just like a joke
it's like haha shits and giggles again
uh shits and giggles and it's like okay
it's 2017 body like is it coming out or
not just lay it to rest you know don't
do a Prometheus honest and leave us like
asking so many questions at the end of
this thing that it does I head in are we
getting off like three or not are we
getting a sort of different
run-of-the-mill game that's going to be
related to half life 3 that will
possibly tie into the story like
prometheus or you know so yeah he's done
a whole Prometheus on us you know so
that's how I was a bit I did like
Prometheus the movie that I've got to
admit I thought it was pretty awesome
but it can't wait for the next
installment but yeah it's kind of like
it's 2017 so what's going on with
half-life 3 that's the thing that I want
to know what is going on with this game
when's it coming out is it not coming
out just this year too much right now
yeah there's like it's just so much hype
that it could never live up to it now so
yes maybe he just they're just not going
to do it but um the fact that they also
he also said that their wool that valve
is working on a single player game right
now that's quite cool and the fact that
hopefully there'll be a left 4 dead 3
sometime in the future yeah that would
be cool as well so yeah in the half-life
and portal movie collaborations um very
interesting to see with er with a whole
new half-life 3 you get a whole new
counter strike as well which would be so
awesome so they'd be movable but I mean
Sears go I don't see that going anywhere
it'd be subtle upgrades you know you'd
have an updated engine maybe in a few
years time once everyone
hardware's upgraded because I think the
whole appeal of cs go especially is that
it runs on potatoes so yeah yeah that's
that I mean I was just yeah I was hoping
Gabe would have delivered a yes or no
half-life 3 is not coming he's never
gonna do that epica can't get teased in
it so yeah we got here you want to talk
about this actually the Zeus debuts the
zenbook you x 4 30 and you x 5 30
slimline laptops now you actually own
Anna Zeus and book don't you yeah it's
but that's the old ones back there
somewhere but uh yeah I've justed these
a lot and all the videos are did on them
got quite good views but I I do like the
zim books quite a bit um try to have
that their fair share of problems with
the hinges I've heard over the years
although the 1i have is it's still final
load as being a little bit funny and but
yeah these ones are just new ones look
summer there have been quite good with
keeping a lot of the ports in but the
graphics cards and these look pretty
ancient although they're coming with kb
like CPU so that's good rabbit GTI oh
it's just the advertising on this
website it's insane it's like it's like
a Christmas tree popping off late now's
good I'm just looking at it like I'm not
even reading the article i'm just
watching msi zeus flashing all on the
screen what the hell yeah yes that's
okay this is advertising taken too far
guys where you can't even read the
article because it's so distracting and
then there's people with adblock it's
like that have we got to support each
other at blow you guys you put on
everyone puts on add blog we'd be out of
business I wouldn't be Davenant I
wouldn't have a channel I couldn't do
near exactly that but yeah so they're
putting on the the USB type-c port as
well which will be interesting and also
some new colors and stuff but these are
aces have been doing this for a while
the zenbook range has been very reliable
for them in terms of sales and i think
they're very scared to do anything too
drastic to it so each time i just a new
one it's just a very incremental upgrade
over the previous one and been a great
great little laptops in terms of battery
life but um visibility at least at the
start
literally works for 30 does interest me
it looks very thin it looks like it's
got some good specs I mean that's a
great food truck did not need for a
gaming per se you can game on them but
that's not the market they're aimed at
so people that complain about the
graphics cards on them it's not what
it's entirely aimed at and but they can
do it quite well but yeah you'll be
playing more basic games like what you
were saying before yeah csgo and things
that will run on a potato and will run
on that but there was actually runs it
to say sir yeah yeah it does all right
hey definitely you probably wouldn't
have to run on the very minimum but
being born I'm gonna be going too crazy
yeah well so that's that topic done and
dusted zenbook go get yourself one if
you want one with a our data grabbers
guard and good good specs cavy like cpu
and they're pretty good specs regardless
pc gummy a garmin okay pc gaming
hardware market now worth over 30
billion for the first time huge news
yeah and this is what we talked about
earlier didn't we are a few a few months
ago the fact that there's been such a
big um up taking people just buying pc
hardware in general especially on the
GPU front they were posting very good
sales so what's the end of 2016 so
that's that's really good but what's
interesting and that graph is the fact
that it's looking like it's more
dominated by the hind but i don't so
much I mean do you agree with this I
mean this is what they've done from
their research but I would have believed
it would have been the mid-range or well
there's right how are they doing okay if
you've got the sails out I don't know
what exactly low sorry I don't know
what's happened to my English in the
last two minutes anyway I don't know
exactly what factors they're basing off
you know they're obviously cutting the
line somewhere but what does pertain to
mid-range what sort of yeah factors
presented new entry level and high range
I'd love for them to put those you know
at whatever trying to think of the words
I'm just brain fighting live here but so
the mid-range market is the biggest as
long as the as well as the low range
market if we look at the / hardware per
person I would say the mid-range and the
low range would be beating the high-end
right because the high and you can have
someone spending ten thousand dollars
now for ten thousand dollars we could
easily build 20 computers for the low
end right so there's so many people for
one person so the high range is of
course going to be over inflated to per
person because it's just high range it's
got no cap essentially on it so it
doesn't surprise me that the high range
is selling the most in terms of total
volume of sales in money in dollar terms
yeah you know but what factors denote
that I'd love to find out it's it's a
funny thing that you when you talk to
people about this like well I'll ask you
the questions will ask a lot of people
so if you were looking at in videos
current lineup of GPU so the thousand
serious crux cards yet where would you
define their like entry level so
obviously you would definitely put
anything in d 50 n 10 but would to 1050
TI come in there that's starting to hit
mid range with the 10 c then 1062 1060
most people would say yeah well it's mid
range yet but then where is the 1070
also mid-range or is that going to mean
that would be a new class late it's
weird that it be a new class I'd call it
up amid adage now what makes it
difficult because you could say well
entry-level 1050 1050 TI but then that
would mean that and if you classified
the 1070 as high-end then the 1060 would
be the lone graphics card in that
granted there is two different models of
3 and the 6 gig but you it would be a
loan card in the middle and that's what
makes it kind of whoa I think I need to
see this is the problem like the 970
when it was first released in my opinion
was a high-end card it was so close to
the 980 which was the flagship when it
was first released now the n70 is
arguably it's behind its behind the 1080
by quite a bit even if you overclock
them you can't get them to 1080 speeds
and so that's why it that new class is
sort of bread now with the 10
the upper mid class I think that's you
know so yeah it's it's a lot harder to
define like you finish line is kind of
kind of like your Porsche Boxster right
not exactly a high-end car but it's got
a Porsche name on it and you know you
get all the pretenders who will go out
and buy a Porsche Boxster so yeah I
think I think AMD's lineup is actually
easier to define from it I mean most
people you'd say 474 idea definitely in
the mid range and then when Vega comes
out I mean we definitely know those are
going to be hind since AMD have already
got the mid-tier mid-range and
entry-level covered we know that the two
new Vega GPUs which will be coming out
will be squarely in the high-end mark
yeah but I think people in your comments
nail I think the people in the comments
nail it's kinda like RX 417 1070 are the
cards to get at the moment I think
they're the to cut their the two hottest
cards right for 70s your entry-level
sort of real good price performance
mid-range and then you've got your arm
GTX 1070 which is for those people who
want that value oriented higher-end card
so I think those are the two hottest
cards at the moment they're the two
cards ID pic even though the GTX 1063
gigabyte of the right price is still a
good really good that's a hell of a deal
yeah that's a hell of a deal when you
get them on specialist yeah so yeah I
would agree with that 470 I would say if
you're someone looking in the market for
the best value for money graphics card
then you have to go with either 474 80
depending on what models and deals you
can get at anything's on special or the
1060 either three or six gig again
depending on models and pricing and
specials and still hadn't yet but if
you're you're looking for the value if
you're looking in that area you'll find
yourself a hell of a deal and that'll be
a lot of graphics card for your money
all the 1050 to the 1050 is actually
coming in a pretty decent price too
especially if you're plugging it into
those oh yes I'll do like where the 1050
is out as well so they all though yeah
yeah I would agree that I'd say and
honestly i'd say this generation we
haven't had a better to be honest it's
the price performance have used a tick
yeah yeah it's very good it's very good
I would agree with that for sure because
a lot of people like the 1060 and the RX
470 especially has done very well in
terms of armed cells via the but there
we go like 2016 hit that 30 billion
dollar mark which was expected to hit in
2018 so we're kind of two years ahead of
where we should be which is really good
for PC gaming I think a lot of people
are starting to see what's going on with
consoles they're starting to see okay we
can actually use our controllers on pcs
so pcs you know they've got so much more
to bring to the table and if you're into
the used hardware segment you can still
get a really good price performance rig
out of you know pc gaming it doesn't
cost a whole lot to enter the pc gaming
market i'm going to have some pretty
cool videos coming that'll sort of cover
a bit of both how you know people
because I'm the biggest complaint i get
with used hardware as brian i can't get
the deals that you get and yet a lot of
the time they're one-off deals it
actually like ninety-nine percent of the
time they're one off deals you're not
gonna be able to replicate that because
there's only one person selling their
used stuff so yeah I'd love to do a few
more videos on that there will be a few
more videos but what we're seeing is PC
gaming is taking off it's coming a lot
more popular than we thought men like
people like you and me I'm sure we just
never even think about jumping on a
console and the sad thing is why my
brother forced me to buy a ps4 he
actually bought half the console for me
he wanted me yet into the console that
bad i played this thing for like it I
gave it a good go I tried playing
destiny for an hour I was just like I
want my mouse and keyboard I want you
know my specs i want my better frame
rates it's just it's so hard now to go
back to console unless you know it's
just the the the gaming experience pc
brings now is so much better then
console yes this is this is what we
would expect anyways I mean I have a
PlayStation 4 and the only reason I have
it is to play exclusives and but the
this is what happened every time when
these consoles are starting to reach the
end of their life I know they've been
refreshed but it's that's not the same
really and this is what always happens
when they start getting quite old which
a lot of them are are then a pc hardware
sales
to tick up and up and up in a few when
the new consoles come out maybe not so
much with a switch but I mean a new Xbox
or Playstation then you see the pc
hardware sales slowed down a little bit
and then eventually then a few years
later it will start to check back up
again and but this is what I've seen
before with the plate ps4 when it first
came out and xbox one when it came out
okay we'll move on to this topic year us
report suggests Tesla autopilot reduces
crashes by forty percent now it's an
independent study and apparently someone
died in one of these things a few months
ago and there's a lot of a parents here
but what I mean like you want to talk
about this one but I I think it's
fascinating I think it's fascinating
that we got autopilot coming into cars
me personally I would never give up
control of my vehicle I think that's why
I'm I'm scared of flying like I every
time I jump into an airplane I'm scared
because of the fact that I don't have
control I think that's where a lot of
people schedule it's just a natural
human thing I think it may be at is the
natural human reaction when i drive a
car I'm in control of it or I trust
someone in the driver's seat who i knows
in control so there's that factor there
that which is why i'd probably never
turn to an autopilot unless i got to
know my machine he had like a I and he
became my friend you know I think it was
something that you would use a bit and
it would make a lot of people nervous I
mean everybody fears what they don't
understand and when they first use it
they're probably quite scared and
everything but the idea that people
think as of right now anyways that you
turn things like autopilot on and then
you can just do it if you want they have
a nap read a book that's not how it
works you still need to be aware
watching the road and everything but the
autopilot should do a good job now the
reason why their sale are the crashes
are reducing is for quite a few reasons
there I have a bachelors an automotive
engineering so there we go guys care to
make it yeah to make it basic i did in a
whole assignment on this technology to
basically break it down the REE
why it doesn't have emotion like a lot
of people crash because they're raging
or they're impatient or they're
frustrated or they're in a rush Tristan
they can also see a lot that you can't
see we rely on our line of sight whereas
a lot of these autopilot technologies
and autonomous driving technologies use
what's called lidar so light detecting
radar and so it can see things that you
wouldn't be able to see in your line of
sight so say a kid was hiding behind a
parked car or something and he ran out
on the road to chase something you
wouldn't be able to see him until he
came into your line of sight whereas the
autopilot could see him for you know
quite quite a decent time and be already
anticipating that he might do something
like that there's a lot of things like
that which are quite interesting the
main sort of downsides to this right now
is that it has a lot of difficulty I
think with intersections a lot of time
you'll see people who have made reviews
and stuff and videos about it it'll pull
in behind parks cars thinking those cars
are lined up at intersection cars that
are parked very close to a intersection
and things like that also there's a bit
of trouble or not trouble but it's for
it to read signs and lights they usually
have to run cameras on the back of the
mirror at the central mirror and order
for it to see there because radar
obviously cannot see the traffic lights
or the signs in there and it's more a
kind of broad thing to pick up objects
so that's another interesting thing but
no this is good going forward and there
could be a time definitely there will be
a time in our lifetime where everybody
is using cars on autopilot and you'll
see the amount of deaths from car
crashes reduced dramatically to the
point where it would be a instead of a
common occurrence it would be actually
quite rare or an occasional thing that
you will ever actually hear about
probably by the time we're in our 50s or
60s I would imagine so the lie detecting
stuff basically you're saying if someone
was to invent some Superman glass
as we could get around that so there's
sort of that advantage negated yeah it's
it's that um yeah it's kind of it's hard
to explain there's it's not for all of
them as well like you cannot talk about
this in a very broad sense because lots
of different companies are using lots of
different technology but the general
idea is that is where the benefit will
come from as that things like some of
these different radar systems can see
things and that's we cannot see because
I driving is mainly based off line of
sight and a bit of hearing as well as
someone honks their horn or something at
us or we hear something you basically
said oh no more burnouts as well ah oh I
mean I don't think electric as a live a
replace petrol cars like it's like when
people when the car was invented it
didn't replace the horse it's entirely
like it's you still see people go riding
horses and stuff like that but they do
it for leisure now how many people
actually use horses for work and I think
petrol cars will be the same thing there
will be people will be like I'll just
use my electric car to drive smokin
because that's bitter but the pitcher
kara be a fun castell no more speed bomb
jumping oh man I think I'm and like I'm
not sold on this autopilot thing so
there's no Michael I no more speed bomb
jumping well we're what work this is no
fun taking the fun out of cups I think
you'll have to two cars no more drag
racing to let me know in the comments
are you guys sold on Autobots old
there's no me no more drag racing it's
going to be no more burnouts going to be
no more speed bump jumping so let me
know in the comments what you guys think
I'm not sold on autopilot I'm yeah I
rage quit I'm not getting it yeah eggs
eggs old this is a new MMO that promises
to be sort of like a fast-paced a game
where you can level up it's very PvP
orientated it's sort of targeted towards
more mature audiences and the good thing
about it is this is what I like about
this game they're giving everyone a
seven day free trial I mean that's what
I like about this they just said look
you play our product if you like it then
you can sign up
I mean that's that's a really good model
that's what i would want from a lot of
different companies instead of buying
their game realizing it's trash and then
wanting to return it which on a lot of
places you can but i like the seven day
free trial i really like it and is
looking pretty cool i'm definitely going
to check this out on febri 23rd looks
like it'll run on a potato too so
they've got that down pat I think if you
want to have this successful game
nowadays it's got to be a free or at
least free-to-play from the start and
then be run on the potato I think that's
the formula so yeah and then we got
titanfall to the developer said the game
can't be ported to switch because it's
so underpowered now this has made me
sort of turn away from the switch like
it'sit's so many years after the ps4 and
the xbox one or released you would think
that they would have a console that is
more powerful than its two competitors
are they just for three or four years
later you'd think that they would do
that right well Nintendo has never been
about making the most powerful console
Nintendo's whole thing has always been
about the successful what's that though
the 64 originally was that sort of it
was the Ducks nuts it was the best thing
out there the 64 another yeah I think
that yeah but in this recent age at
least with the last three since the we
came out on they haven't been powerful
by comparison so and I know if I will
yes I know people say it's gonna have
its older it's gonna have Zelda Zelda is
gonna be great but I yeah it's got to
have more than just Zelda I mean shits
and giggles aside here I if I buy one of
these things and I love Nintendo I
always loved their different sort of
games and platform they bring to the
table I thought the way you was actually
a lot of fun to play with casual friends
that weren't gamers yeah way I guess all
US enthusiasts we've got those friends
that when you talk to him about pc
hardware they kind of just scratch their
head and be like okay can we change the
topic they're the kinds of people that
play the wii u like and you can have fun
with them gaming so I hope Nintendo
brings that experience at the table but
at the same time if you buy a switch I
kind of want to play some of those
titles that ps4 without because I don't
want to go out and buy an xbox one I
don't want to go and buy a ps4 and you
know my brother went and sold my ps4
actually like a month ago so I'm console
us now so if I was thinking about buying
a switch I'd want it to run I wanted to
kind of do everything in general and it
looks like it can't so the develop said
you know Connie and then Borderlands
three it won't be able to play on the
switch as well so you know Zelda can
only carry this thing so far people are
going to say okay well I want to get my
switch i want to play zelda but i also
wouldn't mind playing this title that
title oh it's not on the nintendo switch
and it's never coming on the nintendo
switch what the and yeah just it's
that the the look of Zelda though it is
great kind of cartoonish type look
that's not going to be very intense in
terms of load but okay I think this this
Nintendo switch launch in general has
yeah like just everything to do with it
it hasn't gone tremendously well I saw
someone in chat before said though
Nintendo be charging you for playing
online too I did hear about that and but
yet that I just don't think this is
going tremendously well but we'll have
to see Nintendo it's always been about
the games rather than the console itself
the games and how you play being quite
sort of interactive that's why the wee
one when it you know came out and that
generation of consoles because it was
just the most fun families could play it
it was more revolutionary than the
others at the time and it just seems
like Nintendo since then I've kind of
forgotten that you can get away with
having an underpowered I'm console as
long as you make it that sort of you
know fun thing like what you were
describing yeah i know i know but i
don't know i think game is 11 at all
nowadays I think that's the new thing
they don't they're not realizing that I
mean yeah back with the wii u it was
okay internet wasn't as
because it is today nowadays everyone's
inform everyone wants everything for
nothing and you just you got to go with
that you've got to provide a console
that can do it all and if financial it
looks like a car yes I do we will move
on to the next topic call of duty
infinite warfare guy's tops that it tops
the charts for december 2016 most sold
pc game xbox one whatever most all title
and general in gaming and atop the chart
for 2016 now i copped a lot that's gonna
love this yeah well i mean i copped a
lot of i copped a lot of crap for
doing that he and finit warfare pc
people were like dude you're an idiot
you know your ears why you doing it Finn
at warfare in hindsight it was one of
the probably is the best pc i could have
done i think it got the most views of
any recent pc video that i've done so
next year you guys are going to get
another Cod pc if the game was so cheap
I was like wow it's actually like 30
australian dollars or something for a
triple a title that's not too bad i mean
yeah you you see some of the titles here
you see some of the titles here man
they're like eighty dollars or hundred
dollars for a triple a title on
Australia I mean I thought $30 kind of
like a no-brainer and yeah top-selling
title 2016 there you go cod okay guys
it's a time to get good yeah you know
people love the stuttering I guess
people like stuttering they like um a
engine that has is so old it's not funny
but hey thirty dollars it's not too bad
not too bad 30 strain dollars I'll give
him that that's not too bad if they're
going to keep releasing the titles that
cheap I'll keep buying them as I really
tube so and you know helps me get some
views on a video damn look at that also
surprised the infinite warfare pc video
did so well so there ya take that chat
anyway so i'm actually pretty surprised
that it did actually do number one
because i thought battlefield one was
better game I thought yeah I oh yeah I
think that one should really be first
but you know whatever it is what it is
um yeah battlefield one was cool I
really yeah like I'm actually really
enjoying the multiplayer this time
around it's not as frustrating as
battlefield 4 battlefield 3 was nice for
me I'm actually really enjoying the
multiplayer in battlefield one um you
know it's good to see I mean I'm
surprised overwatch didn't get higher
than it did that's really surprising
yeah yeah so many people play over what
like so many people on the surprise
world of warcraft didn't even get on
that child either that's really for
me that the two titles that i thought
would have been on there would have been
world of warcraft and overwatch higher
in the ladder at least i was really
surprised that some of these titles
knocked it off but again but we're
counting in ps4 and xbox one as well so
the fact that over watch which is a PC
predominant title made it into the top
10 just being a pretty much pc only kind
of thing what I don't even know is it
only pc I don't even know I think it's
on ps4 and xbox one to year so I know
what Warcraft is so that's why that
probably didn't make the list but yeah
interesting very cool yeah I mean
someone sit and chat as well rocket
League keeps getting more and more
players have you ever played rocket leak
it's actually if I ok I've seen it I
liked I mean I've seen it that much on
gameplay commentaries I kind of just
prefer watching it so interest yeah it's
one of those games I just liked to watch
call me weird but you know I get that
yeah it's got already it it's good for a
casual game it's good for something to
just play a few matches in and then sort
of you know go do something else yeah
after but yeah it is quite enjoyable a
lot of people are getting into it now
yeah so there we go cotton Finn of
warfare is your it's your Savior it's
your king guys yeah we're just going to
move out a Q&amp;amp;A now so get your comments
and questions already and Kevin I will
answer them for you so a we got near
video tech I asked can the console
people play against PC players
I don't know which game for pacifically
but most the time yes that hat yes I
still don't I still don't think a lot of
games support cross-platform play I
believe I was waiting for cod to
introduce that I think that would be a
huge sale whatever factor whatever yeah
ma'am I today just excuse me guys my
English is just that bad I don't know
what happened but um we got yeah I was
waiting for cod2 introduced
cross-platform play I think that would
be a really good thing for the for the
whole series and i also got asked from
the hobbit what's your stance on
downloading your tech lounge videos yeah
i mean you guys can download I'm just
you know just keep in mind that we're
doing this content and just support me
and Kev any way you can I mean there's
free ways to support the channel you
know obviously don't turn on that block
and whatnot so you do those things event
ourselves out you do what you like you
know so tell a lot of people you know
that's a good way to help them out if
you just want to help out more it's
usually yeah if there's a website or
something you want them on you can just
embed the video yeah um and that's
usually you know a good way to do it
also yeah so what's the best I think
this one's for you dude what's the best
new zealand game f sheep oh man the she
I was that what's the best Australian
game going to prison so I set out Kevin
do not do GTX 1060 versus our X 480
because fanboy flame is too much yeah so
I'm going to be doing a rematch I'm just
trying to get my hands on the right are
X 480 to do it but good but I'm last
time that's the only time I've ever
actually unlisted a video was not on my
actual show down but on a follow up
video i did i'm talking about it and
just that the people man the community
was just ridiculous because i had to say
at the time the 1060 in new zealand
anyways was the better card it got more
frames and it was the
price ya bein so the thing is no way I
could get around saying that the RX for
a tea was bitter now that is why I'm
doing the rematch because so much has
changed in terms of drivers and pricing
that it's only fair i redo it but i'll
go into it with the same mindset i look
at the price look at the features look
at the performance temps noise all the
stuff i cover every single base and then
i add it all together and just see which
one comes out until I don't go in with a
bias and that is who's going to win but
whoever I say when's the other side
complains I don't advise you have some
way and seeing is that's why you I mean
you've got a tailor to your most viewed
to I always do now videos for Australia
not just Australia also the states the
state's always comes first so if you're
not telling your content to the US first
and then New Zealand second then people
are going to complain because
immediately RX 470 I'd say is the best
buy in the states at the moment for a
graphics card in Australia is looking a
little bit different surprisingly looks
like the GTX 1060 and get it for around
279 aud or 269 australian dollars now
that's sort of looking like the best buy
at the moment in australia but i'd have
to say if i did a video on the 2 i'd say
look the RS 470 is the better buy in the
States and then the GTX 1060 is the
better by Australia something like that
so if you're not doing that maybe you
should do it you have to kind of give
different opinions for people in
different countries otherwise people
will get pissed off they'll be like
what's going on it's completely
different where I am on the UK I mean
what is it with the UK man I feel sorry
for you guys pricing is all over the map
over there and you know the UK is my
second I think it's my second most
viewed country and I just look at the
rising and I scratch i scratch my head
I'm like I feel sorry for you guys
you know what is going on with pricing
over in the UK it's so glad you know
they're getting pretty much like pound
for dollar like one to one equivalent of
price even sometimes the prices are
cheaper in the States if you were to
actually have that in a pound 141
equivalent and it's late Dan so we got
asked to have I checked out any checked
out cex for any get 16 what does that
stand for consumer exchange
for any use parts not that there's one
closer to home arm I check out gumtree
like a lot but I haven't checked it out
lately because yeah I've just got such a
big backlog to get through you spots I
was thinking about doing like a monthly
series where I go just parts hunting try
and pick up bargains people love the
vlogs I want to bring that back to the
channel in a more sort of scheduled
format so people can look forward to it
I definitely want to take care of all
the people who love the used price
performance that's something that's not
going to go away from the channel don't
worry yeah and so yeah breaks it okay
that's what they're talking about the
Briggs it's affecting the pricing but
even before the break that the prices
were all up in the air do if anything
that they if they sign a free trade
agreement with the US or something that
British and then that will bring then it
should be cheaper there anyway josh says
do you follow random gaming and hds
videos no i don't I've got my reasons
but again I don't say anything negative
so I'm not going to talk about it so
that's just me so yeah I just you know
I'm not going to say anything so I don't
follow these videos now and there's my
reasons but I'm not going to say in
publicly so yeah I mean what about you
keV ah nah just yes alright yeah ok so
fanboys are not sebat being frugal with
my hard-earned money and get what will
work not what I can brag about not
needing okay nothing going we Nick what
mechanical keyboard would you suggest
with RGB wrist rest and around 100 USD
oh it's probably something from Coursera
I guess if it's gonna be that maybe yes
I'm saying k65 lux ah I don't know
because I know us pricing but I suppose
if you're wanting the wrist rest as well
I mean my immediate thought goes to a
key 70 but that would be out of that
price range i would imagine anyways um
depends on you behind a yet it all
depends on the
yeah and there's some like I was doing
the recent tech deals video that was a
really cheap oil or keyboard I think
that's how you pronounce that a law I
mean that's blue switches it's like
thirty dollars it's so cheap so you can
get into the mechanical gaming keyboard
market really cheap RGB though
personally the one that I liked was the
azo RGB came with a decent wrist rest of
course I just recommend a few guys
getting a keyboard this is why I didn't
critique the arm the real force about
not having a wrist rest because I would
have used my own wrist rest anyway this
thing is so good it costs like ten
dollars it's like a latex memory foam
wrist rest and i recommend like i've
used this with any keyboard that I've
got since I've been reviewing keyboards
there's so damn good for your wrists
you'll just go buy one they're like 10
bucks um I'll try and leave a link in
the description below but you get them
off ebay or amazon or whatever and
they're just so good like I've even left
the plastic on because I move it around
that much so really cool item I use it
with the real force I've used it with
all my keyboards beforehand and since I
got it and yeah I don't need a rest rest
anymore so yeah that's what I that's
what I'd recommend forever I wouldn't
buy the keyboard based off the wrist
rest but for terms of an RGB keyboard f
of value for money wise i pick the azo
mechanical it's with the blue switches
it's so damn good like for a tee box or
whatever i love that keyboard it looked
good it felt good to type on actually
got it over there for my fuller mom's
computer so yeah there's a lot now
there's a lot of cheaper RGB keyboards
if you did sit on having RGB then yeah
go with that if it's not if you don't
really mind of having RGB or you just
want by color leds and stuff like that
then check out a ducky keyboard because
that's what I've been preaching for
years and they're just very very very
good value for money great build quality
so something like a and all the shine
series or even just a shine for or shine
5 what I think would be very well Robin
mukesh asked a good question will we get
low lag 4k tvs i play my pc on a TV I
think you will with the entry
option of the ps4 pro being that it's
the whole 4k even though it's not true
4k a lot of the times then there will be
a TV manufacturer that will switch on
and say well people are going to use
this for competitive plays on their ps4
pro we need to get low input lag on
these things so yeah we'll come I don't
know of any real TV that's targeted with
like a direct game mode like the bank
you has on that very popular monitor
that they have the 1080p one I think
it's the 27 hmm or something that's yeah
