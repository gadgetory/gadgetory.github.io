I'm gonna talk to you guys about mantle
so recently I purchased the 99 270 and I
got to do some benchmarking with it and
I got to have a bit of fun with this car
now the reason why I got this card was
because it's a little bit of a long
story but I had to I couldn't basically
use the gtx 670 of work after I had
finished making videos for the school so
they want to put it back in their main
rig and that's fair enough so I managed
to purchase one of these and I wanted to
test the name d card because a lot of
people have been telling me good things
and now this card is definitely good
value for money at 190 dollars if you
want to check out the review for this
card i will put the link in the
description below for you guys however
today I'm going to be specifically
testing mantle on battlefield 4 because
I wanted to run some tests for myself
and anyway let's get on with the results
ok so moving I'll on to benchmarks I've
got two different tests here I did a
single player test this was done on the
test range again we did 25 seconds three
times on each and this time around
interesting thing about comparing dx11
to mantle was that I had to use a actual
command in the console because I wasn't
able to use fraps with mental so you had
to type in Perth overlay frame file
login able 1 and 0 you had to toggle
with that to enable and disable it so I
did that and initially I use fraps for
dx11 however i did get slightly higher
results are slightly lower FPS scores
when i did this on the dx11 however when
I did compare apples to apples when I
typed the same console command into the
dx11 scores this is what I got and I
decided to use the apples apples
comparison right if I'm using the
console command for mantle then I'm
going to use it for dx11 as well so when
I did the tests on both using the same
console command and calculating the
average FPS I actually couldn't
calculate minimum or maximum because it
only displayed CPU draw time frame draw
times which you then had to calculate
the average and divide that into one
so anyway we did that and we got here
the average school on dx11 was I think
it was 70 7.51 frames per second so it
was that was good on the single-player
benchmarks I did this was an ultra two
times msaa speeds we then moved on now
to and I had the card overclocked for
all these tests because I think that's
if you're running a graphics card like
an eye on 270 especially the 272 9270
actually may wish to think about
overclocking but the 270 should
definitely overclocking it for free
performance so that's what I did now we
went over to the single player here on
mantle we got 70 7.86 so there was
virtually no difference between the two
I will put my link my the spec of my rig
in the description below but my CP was
clocked at 4.6 gig it is a 4670k so it
is pretty much one of the better gaming
CPUs out there and so yeah there was
just absolutely no difference in single
player I was kind of surprised I thought
mantle was going to make a difference it
made absolutely no difference in single
player both were very playable both seem
very smooth now moving over to the
multiplayer benchmarks this is when
mantle did score slightly higher however
I will reiterate that this is a
multiplayer benchmark and there is going
to be variance so now I've played on
operate I played on a level called
operation Locker it was team deathmatch
and basically I joined the game and I
could quickly it was the start of the
game so I could do the benchmark on dx11
and then I could quit changed a mantle
and do the same benchmark so it's pretty
much done with the same players same map
and we found that the single player here
scored 76.5 five frames per second and
when we move over to mantle we scored 70
9.33 so there was a slight increase in
fps however I would put that down to
variance as it is a multiplayer
benchmarking if I probably ran this a
few times would get some differing
results and one thing I will tell you
about mantle is when I was running this
benchmark there was some really big
stutters going on with me
too I didn't notice this on dx11 so I
thought meh it was hard to say but yeah
I wouldn't if I was playing multiplayer
or single player with BF 4 i'd probably
be sticking to dx11 that's just because
of the the multiplayer stuttering was
some of the stuttering that happened was
actually pretty damn huge so anyway
let's move on now to the conclusion so
in conclusion I can i mean when i did my
tests i found that there was virtually
no difference between dx11 and mantle on
my r9 270 I thought AMD said there was
about a seven or eight percent increase
if you have a high performance or CPU
like a 4670k I have a force examined
again i collected 24.6 gigs mind you but
i found there was just no difference I
mean it might make a difference in CPU
intensive k times but definitely in GPU
bounce scenarios I found there was no
difference at all so the single player
benchmark it was virtually identical the
multiplayer benchmark there was like I
think there was three a difference of 3
FPS and you I mean if I ran that test
numerous times I would have probably
have gotten different results so it was
a multiplayer benchmark so anyway yeah
in conclusion I will say that this
graphics card is great value for money
but I wouldn't be buying it for the sole
purpose of mantle if you're a bear for
player if you're maybe other games they
might implement it a lot better but
definitely as it stands this thing on
battlefield 4 this is the latest drivers
by the way I'm using the latest driver
set as of March 26 this was the latest
beta drivers it just didn't yeah it
didn't show me any viable increase it
didn't show me anything and if anything
I thought dx11 played more smooth I mean
there was some big stutters going on
when I used mantel so I don't know
what's going on there either so all in
all in a nutshell I yeah I mean for
battle for I just can't really see what
the big deal with mantle is so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this review if you
have any questions or comments please
leave a comment
comment section below and if you haven't
already subscribed attack yes city where
I'll be coming back with more juicy tech
videos for you guys if you haven't
already i'll put the link in the
description below for the r9 270 review
of this graphics card it is a really
nice graphics card it is a nice
mid-range reasonably priced graphics car
great for a mid-range build anyway I'll
catch you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
