first smartphone review ever this is the
s2 plus from a company called le phone
this video was brought to you by

description below to find out how you
can get yourself an amazing deal on tech
products today ladies and gentlemen
welcome back to tech yet city this is
bryan coming back to you guys today
oddly enough with a smartphone review
this is my first ever smartphone review
SoDo easy on me okay now this phone
comes in at a hundred and thirty dollars
and for the money it does represent very
good value for money but just how good
is the value for money in different
departments well today i'm going to tell
you guys all the strengths and
weaknesses of this phone but first we'll
take a look at the build quality and
what's in the box then we'll take a look
at the specs and then I'll tell you my
subjective experience with this phone so
included in the box is the phone itself
you also get a charger a screen
protector or Ashley a few screen
protectors and a clear case for the rear
protection of this phone now looking at
the rear of the phone itself you get a
tempered sapphire blue glass look there
with the le phone branding on it it does
actually feel a very high quality I was
really impressed overall with the build
quality of this phone they looking at
the top of the phone there you get a 13
megapixel camera which in practice takes
very good photos that surprised me as
well besides that you've got a
flashlight there which does allow you to
use as a flash or torch if you're in the
dark or anything like that and below
that you also get a speaker loudspeaker
there which in practice allows you to
hear voices pretty well but if you're
listening to music I'd probably step it
up to a mobile portable speaker solution
though moving on to the bottom of the
phone here you'll notice that they've
included this aluminium frame which
again feels a very high quality that's
the micro USB charging port which you'll
get a charger included and you can use
it for data transfer as well looking at
the left of the phone here we get the
micro-sim slot there which supports
dual-sim support and also the ability to
have a 32 gigabyte memory card in there
as well the one thing I will critique
about this slot here is that it was in
practice very hard to get
the slide out you had to use an included
tool which I would have much easier this
with much easier be remedied if they
just put a fingernail slot there and
allowed you to pull it out with your
fingernail as opposed to in practice
using this tool which you might lose in
the future or if you're out and about
you need to take it something out and
reinsert your SIM card for example you
may have trouble doing that on the top
of the phone here we have the headphone
mic jack which is 3.5 millimeters the
one thing to note is that you will not
get a headset or pair of headphones
included so you will have to use your
own if you wish to use or listen to
music from headphones with this phone
though on the note of the de Kamp
solution itself I did believe the base
in the sub base were lacking with this
phone for instance something like my
walkway did sound a little bit better in
practice especially if i was going for
jogs i'd much prefer listening to music
on this as opposed to the le phone s2
plus by moving on to the right of the
phone we've got there the power button
and the volume buttons which feel very
good in practice and again sheathed in
that aluminium frame it does represent
very good build quality now moving on to
the front of the phone we have here
again tempered glass which one thing to
point out about the tempered glass is
that it does fingerprint very easily and
the included screen protector is also
gloss as well so if you want to get rid
of fingerprints then I will suggest
using or buying a matte screen protector
for this phone that's something that I
would highly recommend as the
fingerprints work very noticeable though
looking at the business on the front
face of the panel here up the top here
we have a 2-megapixel front-facing
camera we also have a smoker o speaker
there for conversations and voice calls
and then we've got the screen itself
which is a 5.5 inch IPS display at 720p
resolution and it does look very good
for me I tend to not really care about
resolutions on a smartphone as 720p for
a 5.5 inch screen is more than enough
for what I'll need also down the bottom
here we have the UI button the home
button and the back button there so in
practice this phone will work
very well as well now look in the specs
and measurements of this phone you get a
quad-core cortex a53 cpu you also get a
2 gigabytes of random access memory and
16 gigabytes of storage space included
in the phone the battery is well one
thing I point out is that is hard
pressed into the phone so it is non
removable so that is a little bit of a
bummer about this phone they're looking
at the measurements you get 72
millimeters wide by 140 4 millimeters
tall x 18 millimeters thick or should I
say 18 millimeters thin it's also 125
grams though that note with the actual
weight of the phone even though it's
lightweight it does not feel cheap at
all like seriously this is one of the
best feeling phones in terms of quality
that I've ever felt in my life so kudos
telephone for making a phone that just
feels really nice to touch and feels
really solid though let's quickly go on
now to the last part of this review and
that is my subjective experience using
this phone so when I first pulled the
phone out of the box it came fully
charged which is a great thing so i
could start using it right away and with
that being said i was impressed at how
responsive the touchscreen was as well
as the brightness settings i could use
it in any scenario even outdoors in the
bright LED Sun things were still easy to
read at max brightness settings now one
thing that I will say with this phone is
that for me I have to base my review on
wireless only as when I inserted my
Japanese SIM card this phone did simply
not support the Japanese bands and what
this meant is that the phone would just
overheat it would literally drop five to
ten percent of the battery within like
five minutes and the web pages just
would not load up if they did at all and
took them a long time to do that so then
i double-checked the actual bands of
this phone in the japanese bands and i
found out they just weren't compatible
so if you do wish to buy this phone even
though it is unlocked and it is readily
available for worldwide usage you'll
have to check your country's bands and
whether they are fully compatible with
this phone that being said when I
started playing games with this phone I
was impressed this thing gave a very
smooth experience
and when I started playing a racing car
game for example I was very impressed at
how much fun it was is actually one of
the first times I've actually had fun
playing a game on my smartphone so you
will be able to play games and do all
that jazz with this smartphone the one
thing about the using this phone is that
the UI I thought did look a little bit
boring and basic it looks like something
that I would have used from 2008 for
example and I feel that with android 5.1
elephone could really produce a really
sexy you I for instance my huawei phone
that comes with a really intuitive and
really easy to use UI that looks really
good as well in practice so in
conclusion what can I say about the le
phone s2 plus will actually quite a lot
of good I was shocked at how good the
build quality of this phone was not only
that the included specs you're getting a
quad-core a 53 in there and you're
getting two gigabytes of ram and 16
gigabytes of storage space which when I
compare that to my huawei for example
you're getting double the RAM and double
the storage for fifty dollars cheaper
but on that note though one thing to
point out with this phone is that the
DAC amp solution was a bit lackluster
for instance I much preferred going for
runs with my huawei than I did with this
and I thought the base in the sub base
were a bit lacking and that seng that is
very indicative of achieved a cam
solution they're also a one thing I will
further point out with his phone was
that the included you i was a bit
lackluster did feel a little bit dated
so that's something for le phone to
maybe improve on and if they improved on
those two things they would have a
complete winner on their hands even if
you had to pay an extra twenty dollars
from the consumer standpoint I would
gladly pay that to see those two things
improved on this phone but with that
being said if you are a power user and
you just simply want hardware out of
your smartphone for the money then the
le phone is definitely going to impress
and I mean it even comes included with
the clear cover pouch as well for the
rear and also the screen protectors
which was a very nice touch so one of my
guys that's about it for me on the le
phone s2 plus I will be
this phone a four and a half stars out
of five because it simply is fantastic
value for money but I will be knocking
off half a star because of that dark amp
solution being a little bit lackluster
and also as well as the fact that the
you I just didn't really do it for me
they keep in mind though that the
included cameras as well we're very good
in practice so there are a lot of good
points about this phone and I did
ultimately like it even though it
doesn't work properly in Japan for me
and something that I will point out
finally is that this phone make sure
that it's compatible with where you live
so for me and Japan this phone is
practically useless for being a mobile
phone and but that being said I will be
shipping it off to my mom in Australia
and she'll be gladly enjoying a new
smartphone in Australia but you have to
use a smartphone yet for new eyes that's
about it for my review of the le phone
s2 plus if you liked it then please give
it a big thumbs up and if you have any
feedback or comments then please leave a
comment in the comment section below as
I'm sure there's something that I missed
to do with this phone since it is my
first smartphone review anyway guys if
