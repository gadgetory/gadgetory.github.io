rubber dome keyboard that's been
collecting dust grime and all that other
dirty stuff on it over the last few
years and you're looking to clean it as
fast as possible well this method may be
for you all you'll need is a can of
parts cleaner and optional is a can of
degreaser and polish rag so let's get
onto it so for this next part all you do
is get the parts cleaner and you just
spray away for a good twenty to thirty
seconds
and also make sure the keyboard is
facing upside down as to let all that
dirt and grime and excess parts cleaner
fall to the floor so on that note you
will want to or you I do recommend doing
this outside if you do it inside people
might get pissed off that stuff's
falling on the carpet of tiles but
anyway once you're done spraying away
once everything looks pretty clean you
can then let the keyboard air off I
suggest maybe doing this before you go
to bed and just let it air off until the
morning so after our keyboard has aired
off we can then grab a little bit of
degreaser and spray it on don't go
overboard here just enough to lightly
coat the keyboard and then just grab
that polish rag and just keep cleaning
away until the keyboard looks brand in
you and that's all there is to it
pretty much so let's have a look at some
before and after pics and then we'll go
on to a conclusion
so that's all there is to it that's how
you clean a mechanical keyboard or a
rubber dome keyboard and if you liked
