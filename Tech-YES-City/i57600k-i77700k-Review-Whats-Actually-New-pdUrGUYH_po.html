cabbie Lake I really did I mean there's
no IPC gains at all
IHS is still freaking glued to the dye
BCB is still nice and thin and weak and
then this happened
5 gigahertz on air in terrible ambient
conditions so let's take a look at all
the ins and outs of Intel's Mui 570 600
K and i7 7700 K
welcome back to tech city and I get it
guys I'll run those benchmarks for you
ASAP
so here we are at another release and
this time around it's ins there are even
more negatives to talk about them last
time and I'll get those negatives out
the way first since they are the most
glaringly obvious no IPC games like at
all seriously this thing was virtually
identical to skylake so identical that
I'd even dare say it's a new
architecture at all just a refresh with
better yields which is to be expected
from maturity of the 14 nanometer
fabrication though it does seem like it
has a thicker PCB this time around there
disappointingly enough they're still
gluing the integrated heat spreader to
the die and what this means is bad temps
also the pricing of these CPUs are
relatively the same to skylake sixty six
hundred and sixty seven hundred K CPUs
so pretty much a year down the toilet
and there are basically only a few
little features added to this CPU which
I'll talk about later and if you have a
z170 you can snap one of these in and
they'll work with the new cabbie lake
CPUs and there are only a few minor
features added to this CPU which I'll
talk a little bit about later and it
basically if you have a z1 17 that you
can snap in a cab you like CPU and you
should be good to go since they're both
1151 sockets so you can get a d1 70 for
cheap then you certainly should anyway
lackluster gains from this architecture
is the biggest thing here now let's talk
about the surprisingly positive stuff
new features on cabbie Lake include
native support for Intel's obtain
flash-based storage and there is also
official support for hdcp 2.2 and 4k HEV
c10 bit encoding and decoding support
there for enthusiasts there is really
only one thing that is positive about
cabby Lake and that is the huge
overclock and on air too and what I
consider pretty bad conditions I mean
30-degree ambience at five burgers on an
air cooler is something to be impressed
by and if you D lid that I'm sure you
could go higher this sample here went up
to ninety degrees Celsius in these
conditions while running a Cinebench run
though overall it looks like with cabbie
leg you can probably expect bigger
overclocks in general as opposed to
skylake and i think this is the only
saving grace for the 7600 K and 7700
case CPUs the fact that you can get
these things to five gigahertz stable
means that enthusiasts can pick up one
of these chips and derive their
performance gains which would usually be
expected from a three C improvements
instead from overclocking keep in mind
however I could have a cherry-pick
sample here there from what I've seen it
seems like I'm not the only one here and
higher overclocks across the board is
a thing also the power consumption
differences really look like they were
gained from the refinement as well
now another improbably the last positive
with can be lake over sky lake is that
this architecture is more
beginner-friendly as I would call it
meaning that out of the box this thing
with my Knock shoe au 14s cooler went
all the way up to 4.2 gigahertz without
me even touching a thing that's well
above its advertised speeds and also
notice this on my six core i7 6100 k2 so
it seems like Intel are tapping into the
auto boost function features that have
been seen hitting the GPU market hard as
of recent so in other words if you get
one of these CPUs
and a decent cooler and a Z 270
motherboard then you should have a good
experience with decent speeds out of the
box and also on Cabul eight Intel have
improved the performance of the eye GPU
with the scores being up over the
previous generation of skylake CPUs and
even though there was a significant
improvement it is still far from gaming
at decent settings on the latest titles
though I could imagine desk minis for
travelers taking advantage of these
gains for those easy to play multiplayer
titles which actually ran quite well on
csgo for example so there it is
disappointing release for enthusiasts as
the gains weren't really there from the
architecture though until have gone with
the refinement played this generation
which at least did work out for what I
had on my test bench though do remember
that this is still the Silicon Lottery
and you may even get a chip that might
not even overclock as high as some
skylake CPUs for example though on
average you should expect high
overclocks I would guess to make 400
megahertz on average and lastly I guess
another good thing to come out of this
is that it means that Intel has to
perform in the next generation of CPUs
as they have no more outs
other than bra architecture games and of
course the Zen is coming which has some
big improvements of its own anyway if
you liked this review them be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below what do you
think about the cabby lake lineup with
CPUs we'd love to hear your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
to these gains for those easy to play
multi tile players I am sweating in this
review because it's like 32 degrees so
my gods repeat after me
I love no IPC gains and I love higher
prices yep yep</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
