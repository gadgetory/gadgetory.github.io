you're sipping a cup of tea and you're
like damn my four core system ant
looking so good anymore what can you do
about it I'll tell you what you can do
right here today you can build 16 cores
32 threads of 2950 X glory and coupler
with 64 gigabytes of ddr4 memory Vega 64
phantom gaming graphics card from asrock
10 terabyte hard drive from Seagate one
terabyte nvme from Corsair MP 500 all
this is definitely gonna break the bank
it's gonna set you back quite a lot but
it is gonna be one epic machine that can
do it all streaming gaming video editing
at 4k this thing is going to be the
eclipse' of eclipses you'll be flying
past the moon if you're intended to go
to the moon though ultimately this
system is going to be an all AMD system
and hopefully it's gonna kick some tail
and we're still gonna put it together so
let's do all that and then we can see
how much it all costs and see if it's
worth
so here are all the parts here on the
table and some of the parts we didn't
mention in the intro the ax 760 that's
gonna be powering this whole build gonna
be giving that phantom gaming graphics
card all the power it needs as well as
that additional four pin CPU head on top
of the a pin and then we've got the
Thermaltake p5 I've never built in this
case before so I don't know how this is
gonna go over but let's give it a shot
so here is the build it is functioning
absolutely fine we've overclocked it to
4.2 gigahertz in the memory to 2800
megahertz so the memory is 2666 staff
it's 64 gigabytes as well so it is a
little bit difficult or more difficult
to overclock than a single or two sticks
of a gigabytes of RAM in a 16 key kit so
to keep that in mind however we did have
to relocate this graphics card here the
Vegas 64 from the riser to just a state
of PCIe slot because it was giving our
problems I don't know if this is just
the issue that's unique to this
motherboard but the riser cable was
causing problems and now it's all
working absolutely fine
so with all that aside we're gonna see
how this thing performs and post some
numbers and see if this is the PC that
is worthy of your money so here's the
overclocks now after 10 minutes and
they're running okay and that's CPU
temperature there and Ida is what a lot
of people go by however in Hardware
monitor it must have a sensor buried
deep into the CPU because it's reporting
their maximum of 121 degrees and also
their the node temperatures are going to
96 so this is pretty much topping out on
4.2 gigahertz on the 29 50 X I guess the
H 100 I Pro is not really designed for
thread Ripper to begin with so I mean I
notice the X for instance the enter mac
slick tacket on the 2990 WX did a lot
better this is sort of scoring in a
similar ballpark to the castle 280 and
also the wraith ripper now if you have
an AMD rx Vega graphics card one benefit
is you can turn on free sync and if your
monitor supports it and a lot of
monitors do support it and the results
before and after in fire strike were no
different well they're actually a little
bit in favor of having free sync on this
time around of course fire strike does
have some variants with that aside let
the games begin
so we now we just finished the gaming
benchmarks and streaming whilst we were
playing these games both the crew -
which had a 60 FPS kappa limit was
playing a 1440p ultra-wide both
streaming and normal absolutely fine no
dips pretty much whatsoever and then
moving over to Wolfenstein
- that was getting over 200 FPS at 1080p
even when it was streaming however the
streaming did introduce some problem
where it actually didn't really pick up
the game
I guess that's got to do with the Vulcan
engine itself in the movie over to
Monster Hunter we didn't drop much
frames at all
1080p we're getting over a hundred FPS
with the Vegas 64 solution and then
we're getting right on 100 FPS when
we're streaming 6 megabits per second
bit rates using 60fps at 1080p so this
rig can practically do it all if you
want to check out the review of the 2950
X then I'll put the link up here it's a
great CPU really well balanced for that
higher end desktop enthusiast that wants
to do it all but this CPU here in this
GPU combination if you're into an all
AMD solution and you've got a free sync
monitor this is one route you can take
however of course the 1080 Ti is a bit
more powerful and there are the new RT X
series graphics cards on the horizon we
don't know how they will perform just
yet but of course they will be more
powerful than your 1080 Ti and also
AMD's offerings on the graphics cards
lineups the 2950 X still yet to be
released as well but that coming in at
$900 definitely makes a build like this
worthwhile I was actually surprised it
did come in the whole total came in at
three thousand eight hundred and
thirty-two dollars u.s. which is about
five thousand two hundred Australian
dollars so it is an expensive machine
but what you're getting for this price
is actually pretty much top-of-the-line
everything sixteen cos 32 threads 64
gigabytes of memory as well ddr4 memory
this stuff doesn't come cheap coming in
around seven
seventy dollars alone you're also
getting a nice case that's open air it's
got a fresh design also by the way I did
decide to leave the panel off with the
actual sticks themselves because I just
feel like it just looks bad as well as
really giving it a cheaper look I do
like this open look of this case and
since even when you put the side panel
on dust still gets in and it doesn't
really help out with air flow at all so
I like this open looking better maybe
that's just my opinion but also going
through the specs we've got a 10
terabyte hard drive which is the iron
wolf Pro really nice drive and not to
mention that warranty is also massive on
this drive and then the MP 500 960
gigabyte nvme solution adds speed great
scratch drive great combination with the
iron wolf pro of course if you're doing
very serious work then you may wish to
get two drives and two hard drives for
example - I'm with pros whack them in
rate to get your backup all organized so
you don't lose any files or potentially
have any data loss and then some of the
last components to talk about the power
supplied the x7 60 I believe it's
perfect for this build really low ripple
platinum rated power play these are
pretty much core says best power players
not to mention pretty much the best
power supplies out there at the moment
and it doesn't break the bank either
especially in a build like this and then
we've got the corsair h 100 i pro doing
a decent job i have seen better
performance especially for thread ripper
though i will be doing a comparison with
this cooler versus for instance the
anima click tack on an 8700 K for
example to see if that block size really
does make a difference which I believe
it does for some of my ex 399 and
speaking of x3 nine the last component
of the motherboard from asrock the
fatality gaming professional it's a
really great match with the 29 50 X in
my opinion because it does deliver
smooth power the bias is really
intricate and you can set this thing up
with ease
getting it to 4.2 gigahertz and no
problems is I've tested in the past but
that pretty much wraps it up this bill
can do it all I do recommend checking
out some of the options I'll put the
links in the description below but you
may be wondering what was the purpose of
building this PC well I do want to add
this into a comparison when I tested
against the 8700 K and also the X 79
system I have here to make sure things
aren't all in my head we're going to be
using a thousand FPS camera and I was
well rid out any other questions that
come into that video I know if I don't
test an AMD CPU in that comparison
people will be wondering and that's the
biggest reason for building this because
I always like to trial out the hardware
more than just benchmarks and reviews I
like to take it for a test drive for a
good few months if you looked at my cpu
reviews in the past I take the platform
in its particular CPU and I actually use
them to edit videos and do everyday
tasks and not only that I learn the
overclocks in and out to see the
behavior of that CPU and then I can make
a better recommendation than the day one
recommendation that I've previously made
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button let me know in the
comments section below what you think of
this rig or if you have any questions of
your own and I'll be sure to get back to
you as soon as I can also there is the
1950 X that's currently available for
close to $700 now 16 cos 32 threads as
well but will not overclock as high as
the 29 50 X and I believe if you're
going with an expensive build like we've
got here today for $3,800 I would gladly
pay the extra premium for the 29 50 X
over the 1950 X and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
so you're in the market for a PC and
your penis is small now if you're this
person and insecurities get to you we
have the perfect solution 16 cos 32
threads you put this in the x3 99
motherboard bang your dick size is now
gonna get so big you're gonna hole in
the roof just to fit that thing out
there so we've got this coming in at a
hefty price tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
