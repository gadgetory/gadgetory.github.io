month that they release add-in nvme PJ
adding card SSDs which come in four
hundred gigabytes eight hundred gigabyte
and 1.6 terabyte flavors though as usual
with the driver reviews around tech yes
City I'll be throwing this through the
standard toy to test and skimming that
cream straight off the top to see how
this thing perform and whether it is
worth your money
welcome back guys this is brian rocking
in with a newly released nx500 which
under the hood sports eight banks of
toshiba 15 nanometer mlc nand flash
attached to to 256 megabytes so 512
megabytes in total ddr3 1600 megahertz
nanyo burst banks sending data to and
from a new generation fastened five
thousand and seven dash eleven
controller and when it came to the
benchmarks we firstly had my favorite
which is HD tune Pro we're conducting
extended right tests with 50 gigabytes
of pure straight stressing across
various data patterns showed that the
performance was very consistent with
both read and write speeds with reads
coming in at two thousand five hundred
twenty five megabytes per second and one
thousand three hundred and 80 megabytes
per second writes which admittedly in
the case of a product in a calibre such
as this is expected those the speeds on
a random test which is the most accurate
for real-world performance was quite a
stretch from the advertised three
thousand megabytes per second reads and
two thousand four hundred megabytes per
second writes which were printed on the
box though curiously when changing to a
zero filled Donna Patton which is mainly
used to securely erase data and isn't
really relevant to anyone wanting this
in a workstation the drive scored two
thousand eight hundred twenty six
megabytes per second reads and two
thousand one hundred sixty five
megabytes per second writes and here the
speeds came really close to those
advertised speeds marketing stuff
crazier but no I don't digress this is
important stuff
roll the Jesus music so performance is
quite solid though how does it compare
to the previous m2m VM EMP five hundred
that I recently reviewed on the channel
well after conducting more tests the
first of which was a SSD there really
wasn't any different
between the speeds however the nx500
dogs have an impressive five-year
warranty which is two more years than
the mp5 hundred three years and we're
testing the random access times it did
have extremely fast times with the worst
speed reported being 1.5 milliseconds as
opposed to the MP 500 which had a three
milliseconds worst response time game
boot times were virtually identical and
just like the MP 500 these nvme drives
are in a class above side of three
drives and one area they do perform well
in is Premiere Pro for example when
importing large amounts of files this is
where the nx500 did slightly edged out
the MP 500 which was nice to see though
there is a big heatsink and back plate
that certainly does add to the cosmetics
but does it actually do anything in
improving performance well the answer is
yes and actually it is a necessity as
when doing the temperature test for 21
degrees see ambience the nx500 scored 32
degrees idle and under stress scored 46
degrees which is well under the 70
degree limit though removing the
heatsink it actually introduced a new
dilemma the drive was now throttling
reaching the same 46 degrees but
performing terribly making this
comparison irrelevant and meaning that
you'll just want to leave that heat
think on there though moving on to other
specifications and features the included
software toolbox allows for cloning trim
and secure erase and the NX 500 400
gigabyte edition also has a 698
terabytes written and 2 million hours
meantime for for failure ratings which
on the higher capacity mode does expand
these limits further and there are smart
ECC smart refresh smart flash advanced
garbage collection and static and
dynamic wear leveling which also
contribute to these drives including a
solid five-year warranty which is very
generous and should service peace of
mind to someone out laying the 319 USD
asking price or if you aren't Australia
this will retail for 515 AUD so this
price it raises the question of is the
nx500 worth it and really in my opinion
it comes down to another question of do
you need this drive if you're a guy who
just installs your OS your favorite
games and all browsers the web then you
certainly don't need this drive
it would be a big fat waste of money
though if you do transfer a huge amount
of files have the extra PCIe lanes and
do scratch and record a lot of footage
with Premiere Pro for example or just
need a workhorse of an SSD that performs
consistently and of course it's backed
by a generous warranty then I can see
myself recommending this drive of course
there are other options out there and a
lot of you guys have been asking me to
test practically any drive I have here
against Samsung's Pro variants which I
unfortunately don't have though I have
heard a lot of good things about them
though back to the NX 500 solid drive
the numbers indicate good performance
and the drivers well built all round
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
review and let me know in the comments
section below do you currently have an
nvme PCIe drive if not why not and if so
what do you use it for
we'd love reading your comments as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
