to do is go into the website or the link
in the description below to claim this
prize this is valid until June 26 and
also on other tech news Hardware in box
and I we managed to go down to Sydney to
attend both AMD and corset events course
there were announcing
at a 1pc which is essentially an
all-in-one that looks very good and also
has some pretty good specs they also
announced a gaming chair so I guess
Corsair are getting into the world of
gaming chairs now I managed to get a
chance to sit down in this chair I will
say that it was very comfortable but I
do expect it to be quite expensive
since most gaming chairs are and now
lastly moving on to the AMD meteor event
this is where they were talking about
the rise in CPUs their intentions with
this CPU lineup and also talked about
their RX 5 Series release and the main
thing that I took out of this was that
the rising CPU lineup wasn't meant to
beat the Intel CPUs at everything but it
was definitely meant to be did at price
performance and be a very disruptive CPU
and I certainly think aimed have done a
good job of doing that
of course the whole time at the event I
was asking about AMD Vega only to be
shut down every single time that I asked
the question anyway guys I'm going to
get on out of here and if you appreciate
the giveaways then be sure to hit that
like button and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
