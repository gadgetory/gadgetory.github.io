you can make an LGA 771 CPU fitting an
LGA 775 motherboard welcome back to tech
yet City this is Bryan coming to you
guys today with an interesting video
this is called the LGA 771 mod and it's
essentially where you cut off two little
things in your motherboard pin socket
and then you also put some tape over the
CPU and then you can now have a cheap
LGA 771 Xeon CPU working in your LGA 775
motherboard and now the benefits that
come out of this is obviously you're
getting a good xeon bin chip it's going
to overclock really well and in most
cases is going to be a lot cheaper than
the q95 50 or 96 50
so quickly going through the components
and equipment needed in this mod you'll
need your Zeon 771 chip you'll also need
some little stickers which will allow
this mod to be possible these costs
around a dollar each I managed to pick
up five of them for three dollars I'll
put the link in description below for
all these components by the way and then
next you'll need a blade I prefer to use
an art knife this set me back about
three dollars from my hardware store
gives me a lot of precision and control
when doing a mod like this next up in
the list is your motherboard this is an
LGA 775 socketed motherboard the
benefits of having one of these is of
course overclocking and just a great
consumer motherboard lastly I like to
add a little touch and that's of course
to have a cheap chip laying around in
this case I have an e 84 Core 2 Duo
which will allow me a lot more control
and a lot more safety when doing this
mod as well as initially flashing the
BIOS to update the BIOS on the
motherboard now comes the daunting task
of cutting out the side brackets on the
edges there so there's two of these and
you will want to take your time and be
very careful so this is the part where
you're gonna have to use your blade as
you can see I'm using my art knife and
I'm just making a real clean cut there
on the edge now you will want to get
this closer to the edge or closest to
the edge as possible because if you
don't cut off enough and your CPU may
still not fit so just be careful as well
now you can see that I am using the e
8400 Core 2 Duo here is kind of like a
protector so if I do make a miscut then
the most I have to risk losing is a $1
CPU so I think that's about what these
Seabees are going for and so once you're
done with one side on the cut you can
just move to the other side cut that off
and then essentially just wiggle away
those little plastic brackets or there's
little brass plastic edges there and
just be very careful while you're doing
this because if you do break one of the
pins then your whole whole motherboard
could be essentially bricked so just be
very careful
you see here I got a little bit of speck
of dust in there it's actually not a pin
even though for some odd reason it does
look like a pin that's actually not a
pin so that's weird that that got in
there I think that was actually a bit of
PCB off the core to 8,400 duo now that
the most daunting part
of this task is complete we can now
trial fit our CPU just to make sure
everything fits properly and if it
doesn't fit then you may have to come
back and cut out a little bit more so be
very careful there however the arrow
will line up in the exact same spot as
it would on an LGA 775 CPU and after
that does fit we're now ready to do part
two of the mod so now it's time for the
easiest step in this whole process and
that is just to put the sticker down on
the CPU and essentially what this does
is allow your CPU to work on the
motherboard and so once you've done that
you can then use a pair of tweezers I
recommend that however I couldn't find a
pair of tweezers at my house so I'm just
using a pen and my fingers and so you
just lay down the sticker over the CPU
there making sure it's over the correct
pins and I will put up a reference here
for you guys so you can see exactly
where it should go and once that's done
you're essentially good to go your CPU
or Xeon CPU is now ready to be installed
in the motherboard and powered up this
is the last part of the tutorial and it
is optional however if you do want to
fully unleash your processor than I do
recommend doing this it is a pretty
simple process the first step involving
you going to your motherboard
manufacturers website and downloading
the latest bios in my case it's the p5 q
e rom here so i'm going to download that
then I'm going to go to a website called
deleted comm and download the mm tool
and then below that I'm also going to
download the LGA 771 micro code so just
two links there I'll put that in the
description below you just click that
and once you've got that all in one
folder you can then proceed to open up
the exe and then just click load ROM and
then load the latest bars that you
download from your manufactures website
into this program and then once that's
in that you can go over to CPU patch and
then click on browse and then find the
place where you stored all those CPU
micro codes there should be seven of
them and once you've done that you can
then start to apply each of them
individually into the BIOS so as we can
see here we click open apply and then we
get on the second
and do the same thing apply third one
and then the fourth one and then the
fifth one six one seventh one and then
after we've done that we can then just
check and double-check that they're in
there all the seven you microcode
patches that we've applied there and
then we can click Save ROM as and now
this is important you can save this as a
different name if you want to it's what
I recommend as we can see here I'm just
going to call this my p5 QE z on after
you've done that you can then load into
the boss and you open up the flash
utility program in this case I am using
the azuz easy flash - after you've done
that you just select the boss that you
want to load in as you can see I'm
loading up to 2016 custom bars that I
made and let it update and erase the
previous boss and then load that you
want in there and you should now have a
fully supported LGA 771 Xeon working in
your LGA 775 motherboard so when all
said and done you should have yourself a
really inexpensive CPU that boasts a lot
of performance for the dollar and also
one thing to keep in mind is that not
all biases will support the Xeon fully
there may be a dropped instruction set
and if you're one of those people then
you may have to make yourself a custom
box so I'll put the links in the
description below on how you can do that
and also that's about it for me today
guys so if you like this video be sure
to plug that thumbs up button and if you
haven't ready subscribe to check your
city for more tech news and reviews and
I'll come back and catch you in the next
one peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
