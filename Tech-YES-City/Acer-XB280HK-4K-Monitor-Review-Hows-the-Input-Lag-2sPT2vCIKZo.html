which is a 4k monitor that's meant for
gaming but how good of a gaming monitor
is it let's find out today
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech your cities Brian coming back to
you guys finally with the long-awaited
review of the ASA xb2 a thk now this is
a interesting monitor because it's 4k I
know right that's a lot of pixels going
in that 28 inch monitor so it's also
touted as having fast response times and
also having low input lag which I'll
give you guys some numbers later on the
review but before we get to onto that
let's take a look at the design of this
monitor and what it features so as soon
as you get this monitor in you'll notice
how extremely well packaged this thing
is you probably throw it off a mountain
and it'll still be intact
well maybe not throw it off a mountain
then you know what I mean it comes
pretty well packed as soon as you unbox
it you get the power brick there you
also get the DisplayPort cable and one
thing to note as well is that this
monitor only has connectivity for one
DisplayPort so if your DisplayPort goes
out then your whole monitor is going out
which is a bad thing I would like to see
more connectivity on this monitor though
that DisplayPort is needed for g-sync
which is also supported on this model
and since it is 4k at 60 Hertz
DisplayPort is one of the few ports that
does support and help run this monitor
also included with the monitor is a USB
cable and the side and also underneath
have for USB cable three ports there so
it works as a USB host if you need to
plug in USB three devices looking at the
dimensions of this monitor at 657
millimeters wide by 382 millimeters tall
by 59 millimeters deep which makes it a
pretty good or a pretty big monitor if
you're going to versa mount it and one
thing is that's good with this monitor
is it's VESA mount Abul as well however
let's quickly talk about the monitor
stand that comes included with this
monitor it's actually a really good
stand I was surprised it's one of the
best actually it is the best stand for a
monitor that I've seen in my life today
it's height adjustable and you've got a
lot of height adjustment there so if
you've got it on any desk situation this
will support a good height it's also
tilt adjustable and swivel adjustable
and you can put it on any desk and know
that it won't slip around it's got a
really good grip on the base so now onto
the actual color scheme of the monitor
stand itself and this is where it left
me scratching my head they've gone with
matte
and gloss and generally in the monitor
business you either go with either or
not both together it doesn't make any
sense so it's got gloss on the base and
then matte on the actual stand and
they've got a nice blood orange ring
around it which is kind of aces themed
color I guess now moving on to the
monitor itself they again decide to go
with this same gloss and matte
combination I don't know what's going on
in the design department there but the
bezel is a gloss reflective surface and
then the actual screen coating itself is
a matte non reflective surface now the
coating matte versus gloss that's up to
you guys they have their disadvantages
and advantages for instance gloss the
colors are more vibrant and they will
pop more however matte there will be
less glare and also your sunlight
environment won't be such a disaster to
work in so they're the trade-offs
between the two this is a matte coating
and I must say it's not it's actually a
really good coating for a matte coating
now on to the actual monitor itself the
panel in there is a TN panel so it's not
an IPS panel it runs at 60 Hertz at 4k
resolution and I'm delighted to say that
the response times on this monitor are
very crisp you've got also three
settings there to change different
overdrive settings you've got off normal
and extreme I like to play around with
normal and extreme I find normals the
best for general gaming though in some
cases I do like to put on extreme
especially in dota 2 when I've got
characters moving really fast I like to
be able to see them crisp even though on
extreme you do start to notice
overshooting it's kind of like this
black shadow that comes out of the
characters and it is a little bit weird
but the text is so crisp with the
setting on extreme now quickly talk
about the viewing angles than the
brightness the brightness is advertised
as 300 nits and I believe this to be
true as when I got this monitor out of
the factory it's set at a hundred and it
was really bright I had to turn all the
way down to 45 just to be able to use
this normally also the viewing angles
are extremely good for a tan panel and
also the color balance is actually
really well calibrated out of the
factory now another thing on that note
is since it is a tan panel the colors
while will look a little bit less
not as good as an IPS panel for instance
these two gloss IPS panels in the
background the colors are so vibrant and
they pop more than or better than any
other monitor I've seen in my life so
that's something to keep in mind when
you're buying a monitor like the xB 280
HK is that it won't have as good as
colors as an IPS panel especially in IPS
gloss panel or even a TN with gloss
coating for that matter the contrast
ratio is also reported as being 1001
though I don't have any way of testing
this as I don't have to get a testament
but one thing I can test for you guys is
the input lag and I'm delighted to
report that the input lag is really good
on this monitor when I hooked it up and
tested it against my korean panels here
which i know have really low input lag
because they'd have no built-in scalars
and i've already tested them against the
del p 2 4 1 4 h which has virtually no
input lag I was really surprised this
was only the ASA was only like losing to
the Korean panels by maybe half a frame
it was really slow it was just a B stick
there wasn't much in it and so basically
for gaming especially since it's a fork
a panel with g-sync support the input
lag in my opinion is really good for
this type of monitor honestly though the
exact figures for input lag there will
be a little bit of variance since my
method is pretty much just stopping down
my camera to four thousandth of a
shutter speed and then taking multiple
shots with time at three timers on the
screen and then I'll also I take many
different shots and I put the ports in
and out just to get accuracy though I
will say that it is pretty good if I had
to guesstimate the input lag it would be
somewhere between 8 to 10 milliseconds
maybe could be less could be more but
it's actually really good so if you're a
competitive gamer and you want to kind
of step it up to 4k then this would be
one of the best choices in my opinion so
lastly let's talk about the 4k
experience gaming on this monitor how
was it brain obviously you've got that
trade-off there where you've got 60
Hertz versus 144 Hertz at 14:40 P and in
my opinion I'm glad I took the jump to
4k even though the motion isn't as fluid
as 144 Hertz monitor
the picture is just beautiful like games
on this monitor look gorgeous
they're really good they're really crisp
you pretty much just leave the
anti-aliasing off in a lot of your games
and it will still look amazing
so the 4k experience I can highly
recommend it to you guys and since the
response times are really fast on this
monitor and for instance if I'm gaming I
don't notice any ghosting
however on these IPS panels I can notice
a little bit of ghosting in games and so
I do prefer to play on a TN panel when
it comes to games especially now that
it's at 4k I've got even more the reason
to play games on the Acer panel which
I'm actually got in my gaming setup
downstairs there keep in mind though
this is an expensive set up and the
monitor came in from me around about
$600 that's if I converted yen into US
dollars another thing as well you will
need a good graphics card to power this
monitor I'm currently powering it from a
980 TI which I overclocked and I managed
to get good frames in a lot of games if
I'm not getting 60 frames per second
then I usually turn down the settings to
accommodate for that and I'll be getting
60 frames regardless so all in all the
ASA xb2 ath K is a very good monitor
also one thing that I missed out was the
on-screen display it's got different
modes that you can choose from preset
modes like graphics movies and gaming I
just use the custom mode there with the
custom brightness setting besides that
you've also got your contrast settings
and also your overdrive settings down
there which you can change on the fly as
well and your brightness as well you can
change that on the fly besides that
you've also got an ultra-low motion blur
setting which for some reason is blurred
out like it's grayed out and I could not
get this to work no matter what I did I
turned off g-sync in the Nvidia control
panel
I then put all my games in full-screen
mode tried different settings and I just
couldn't get it to work which I believe
or maybe that this setting just doesn't
work on this monitor altogether so they
should kind of just take it out of the
on-screen display Mesa what are you
doing there anyway besides that you've
got the last button there you've got the
fully featured on-screen display panel
menu
we can change things like the gamma you
can also change the color temperature
though I do like to leave it at 2.2 and
warm which is the factory default out of
the factory as I believe it looks really
good though if you're a counter-strike
player you could turn this down to 1.9
as I know counter-strike players enjoy
that extra gamma especially in those
dark lit rooms now below that you've
also got other settings you can change
like your brightness and stuff like that
on this menu as well so here I am left
with nothing but a real big thumbs up
for this monitor I'm absolutely loving
it it's a really good 4k monitor really
fast response times really low input lag
really nice that's all I can say and
you've got that added on bonus of having
G sync so you're pretty much at 4k this
is where it makes the biggest difference
in my opinion so all in all they've hit
a really good mark with the xB 280 HK
and I can give it nothing but flying
colors I really love this monitor though
keep in mind though it is a TN panel and
it is a matte coating so your colors are
not gonna be as good as something like
an IPS panel that I have in the back
here with a gloss or a glass screen
coating on there with PD C so that's
something to keep in mind though for
what it's worth I just absolutely love
this monitor and I can't recommend it
highly enough for you guys especially if
you have the money though keep in mind
it is very expensive
this setup you're gonna have to get a
980 TI or something similar and then
you're gonna have to get this monitor
which will set you back over a thousand
dollars just to be playing games at 4k
so that's about it for today guys if you
liked this review then please give it a
big thumbs up if you have any questions
