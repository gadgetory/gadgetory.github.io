joined by Jacob you don't very good and
we got some products here that they're
proud to talk about especially this new
unique power connector coming out from a
VGA which essentially allows you to
change the position of your power
connectors in many different
configurations yes so what this is
called as the EVGA Powerlink yeah and
what we can do is first of all you can
configure it to like if you want dual
six pins or an eight and six so can
support a wide variety of graphics cards
and then what this does is it just kind
of snips snaps on there like that and
then it repositions the the power
connectors to this you know the lower
edge of the board here so that just
looks a lot cleaner for cable management
and we've been running in our system
over there and I mean it really is like
there's not many cables that are visible
in there so it looks really clean that's
that's the first thing that came to my
mind was the cable management coming in
from the side of the board there and
just coming in and to the rear of the
graphics card so actually looks like a
very unique product you can expect that
to be shipping some time either let's
late-september or early october is kind
of what we're shooting for right now yep
awesome so there so you can guys can see
that possibly by the end of this month
so that's pretty awesome we've also got
the graphics cards as well we got the
for the win edition from the GTX 1070
and the 1080 as well very solid products
there you guys notice you've got the
flat the whole flat look going there and
the fat graphics card is that something
that you guys have been really keen on
doing for it so this is using a CX three
point O with a CX 3-point oh we really
wanted to elevate the the quality of the
presentation so if you look at it I mean
it's really like there's a lot of
aluminum on it I mean it's a really when
you when you hold in your hands it feels
like a very high quality product and
that's one of the things that we really
want to deliver with a CX three-point oh
and in addition to that of course with
the AC x3 point 0 it also pulls really
well which is something that we're
pretty proud of as well
so I've noticed that as well and there's
no real RGB lining on there or something
you guys are just keeping it clean and
on this yep these there's LEDs in the
front here here up here of course you
can turn it off if you want as well but
it is on the FTW cars and classified it
is RGB so you can customize the color of
it to whatever you like and that's great
also what about PWM control in the fans
is that something you guys have
implemented this generational yeah so it
does have 10 10 power faces for the PWM
which is a upgrade over reference for
the fans we are using a new low-power
motor which is a lower power obviously
which actually impacts more than you
would think grabs card overclocking
because when you're talking about a
power target in when your nvidia
graphics card the fan power consumption
is taken into account with that as well
so especially on an especially dropping
down to the low an animated there on the
nodes you know you need quick response
as well especially if you like noise and
sort of high overclocks there you've got
to have a balance and you got to have
quick response to yeah yeah so you know
these cards they under full load they do
with the default fan settings I mean
they're doing like 65 degrees Celsius on
these systems back here which is really
good definitely good thing to hear about
it also got the no word on the kingpin
just as yet right nothing on kingpin
know yet we do have a classified version
which is one step above this one it has
a few more power faces a couple other
features specifically for like really
high-end overclocking but nothing on
kingpin yet so that's a you guys heard
the a VGA the graphics cards the power
supplies as well notice you guys have
been dominating the market with those
balanced supplies as well anything new
and the works there just the same solid
value for money and also the same
higher-tier power supplies just going to
keep coming out I think you're going to
see us continue to try to make
innovations there so we have today we
have a pretty much top to bottom line up
from 430 wats all the way to 1600 watts
we do have some new models coming out
later this year our g2 line which is a
very successful line for us we have a
new version g3 which will bring smaller
sizes more efficiency morphy
your stuff like that so we're pretty
excited about that very awesome products
also one thing that would like to clear
the air is the EVGA motherboards as well
they have you at the market with the
motherboards though there wasn't stigma
in the air especially from a couple of
years ago surrounding some of those
problems with you know compatibility or
the BIOS updates or whatnot you know in
the air now you just want to clear that
up the motherboards are generally
working really solid nowadays right I
think that over the last few years we've
certainly learned a lot and we've been
able to improve our team globally so we
have a bios layout team or we have a
bios team we have hardware loyal team we
have power team I mean we have
everything in place and our current x99
and z 170 motherboards for anyone who
owns them I think they are pretty happy
with them they overclock really good the
bios GUI people really like it's very
straightforward easy to use and yeah so
that's as well as definitely what we'd
like to hear solid products coming into
solar prices to think EVGA hitting the
market with that great work with you
guys doing that also I one question for
Ozzy's down under can we expect more
aggressive you know market penetration
there from fans down the stro yeah
absolutely not only in Australia but you
know globally we're looking to improve
our presence pricing everything but
definitely know in Japan as well me
living Japan previously avg I didn't
really have a presence there not much
but I know in America a huge absolutely
massive presence here right yeah today
our biggest markets is America obviously
and Europe as well but we are expanding
globally and making improvements
globally so you guys that you guys have
it so a vga are going to be making the
digital storm in the hole that's
actually named a pc maker is it they're
going to be making a market storm over
the next few years hopefully and taking
over the world so thank you so much
Jacob fer doing the interview and you
guys have any questions for Jacob are I
just leave a comment in the comment
section below and get back to you as
soon as I can if you guys enjoy the
video please hit the like button and
I'll see you in the next tech video very
soon be set up an hour bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
