quick and easy how to campaign on how to
overclock your cpu in under five minutes
and this is part of the I am Sydney 2019
campaign by Intel so today's video is
sponsored by Intel and if you guys make
your own how-to videos then you can
enter for a chance to win one of two
gaming PC's where the first PC for first
place is worth two thousand seven
hundred and fifty Aussie dollars and
then second place runner-up will win a
PC worth two thousand one hundred
dollars so all you have to do to enter
this competition is make a how-to video
like I'm doing here today on your
YouTube account with the hashtag game on
Intel though with that aside let's start
overclocking this CPU super quick super
easy so here I've got a 99 hundred K and
a Z 390 motherboard and I've got two
programs installed I'll put all the
links for the competition and the
programs I'm using in the description
below and we've got hardware info and
also the Intel Extreme tuning utility
now if you're on another CPU you can use
either 64 which is also a good program
but once they've installed we can then
go down here restart our PC and then
upon restarting our PC hit the delete or
f2 keys on our keyboard and that will
bring us into the BIOS now you can
overclock with the Intel Extreme tuning
utility but I still prefer personally to
overclock in the BIOS and for me it's
just straightforward and easy but once
we're in the BIOS here this is the
asrock bias which is the maker of the
motherboard I can then click f6 on my
keyboard and that will take me to the
Advanced Mode where from here on the
tabs I can hit the right arrow key go to
overclock Tweaker and then go into CPU
configuration by hitting Enter
and then CPU ratio hit enter and go
all-cause and then type in 50 and
on our numpad leave the CPU cache ratio
alone leave the CPU cache ratio alone
hit escape go down to D RAM
configuration go down to load XMP
profiles click enter click enter again
an XMP profile to hit escape go down to
voltage here hit enter go to voltage
mode hit enter again hit enter on OC
mode then go down to CPU core cache
voltage hit enter go to fix mode hit
enter again
then fix voltage we can type in 1.37
volts this is my CPUs voltage I find
that if you've got a better CPU than me
which you most likely will then you'll
be able to get 5 gigahertz with even
less voltage say 1.35 voltage but for me
my CPU actually needs 1.37 voltage to
remain 24/7 stable at 5 gigahertz so you
can copy these settings then Save
Changes in exit and hit enter and then
boot back into Windows and then we can
start stress testing so now that we're
on the desktop we can then double click
Hardware info and since we're on a
64-bit windows we can open the 64-bit
application left click run and this will
tell us all our temperatures sensors and
everything we need to know about these
overclocks and then also we can go back
to the desktop and open up our intel
extreme tuning utility and this has a
built-in stress test which for a 99
hundred k is the best thing being its
own intel stress test in utility so we
can then left-click cpu stress test and
click ten minutes and then we can start
testing and then come back and see if
we've passed
now we've passed the CPU stress test we
can then do the exact same thing for the
memory hit start testing come back after
10 minutes and we've passed both those
stress tests with flying colors so our
CPU is now ready to play games and do
other things like edit videos but if we
do crash or we do fail those stress
tests then we may have to go back into
the BIOS and either lower our CPU
multiplier from 50 down to 49 or lower
the voltage or raise the voltage if we
want to try and get that CPU stable and
without said I hope you enjoyed this
quick how-to if you have your own how-to
videos then make sure you upload them to
YouTube and put that hashtag in for a
chance to win a really good gaming PC
and the topics to choose range from how
to overclock a CPU like I did here today
or how to build a gaming rig or how to
PC gaming stream or how to build a
custom PC mod and lastly the links will
be in the description below this
campaign will run from today until the
end of this month May 31st and with that
aside I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
