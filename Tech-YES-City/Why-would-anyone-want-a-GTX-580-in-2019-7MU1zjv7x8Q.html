in 2019 I mean this god was released
near the end of 2010 making it basically
eight and a half years old now it also
only has one and a half gigabytes of
vram on board and it's renowned for
being a toaster oven however there is
one big benefit for this graphics card
and that is right here in this case an
OEM motherboard and it's not just any
OAM motherboards these are the worst of
the worst they don't have the option to
disable secure boot or turn on CSM so
practically every modern graphics card
is out of the picture when it comes to
compatibility with these motherboards
know that you can't update the BIOS and
unlock these features either because
they've practically been abandoned
because they're a bit old to but coupled
with this graphics card which will boot
on this motherboard you can still make
some really good value considering this
card here you can pick them up for next
to nothing on local deals and these
motherboards practically no one wants
them so what do we have when we put
something that no one wants cobble with
something them no on once well we have
tacky our city
now you may be in the market for a GTX
580 from 2010 but if you have a
smartphone that's not this old then
today's video sponsor raid Shadow
Legends has you covered for
entertainment while you're on the go
this game is completely free to download
and play on your smartphone you've got
raid boss fights PvP battles and also
hundreds of champions to choose from and
customize and I jumped on this game and
the player base is cracking it's getting
really big really fast they've got a
special launch tournament going on with
crazy prizes so make sure you join in
guys you can join clans make your own
clan names like I've done but tech yes
and the best news is if you're a lovely
citizen of tech yes City and you use the
link in the description below you'll get
fifty thousand silver coins and also a
free epic champion when you sign up what
are you waiting for guys links in
description below but I know you're
waiting for waiting for that potato GTX
580 let's get back into it so now the
card is a perfect fit to this
motherboard however all is not nandi
dandy in the land of takia City and that
is because this graphics card actually
had its support dropped from March 2018
of last year so any new games that come
out for instance apex legends it won't
get driver optimizations from Nvidia
anymore however that's still not going
to stop us from burning up the game and
seeing how this thing rot
so we just finished testing out Apex
legends and we got 720p low settings to
work and we got over 60 fps in this game
and the funny thing was the 1% 0.1% lows
weren't too bad a couple with a single
channel of memory and an i5 3470 so I
was actually quite surprised because if
it can play apex legends then it can
definitely play csgo dota 2 and even
fortnight absolutely fine but let's try
out some other more demanding titles in
2019 like Resident Evil 2 and then we'll
move on to shadow of the Tomb Raider
so now shadows of the Tomb Raider was
really awkward we started off with 1080p
settings the characters look like they
had some plague or mosquito infestation
on them and then dropping it down 720p
this still existed this problem and so
the FPS was like 42 and surprisingly the
minimums were still okay ago like 25 so
it wasn't stuttering or anything just
the FPS on the lower settings possible
720p wasn't really that magical number
of 60fps that you would want if you
wanted to play shadow of the Tomb Raider
so that games kind of a Miss but
Resident Evil 2 lowest settings 720p
actually did fine and we got over 60fps
17.1% loads were fine in this game so
it's time to talk a little bit more
about the GTX 580 now so now the GTX 580
in 2019 it's ok if you just want to get
into PC gaming and as we said in the
intro this card here one of the big
benefits is it'll combine with
practically any motherboard and work
absolutely fine and now for power
consumption it was ok we did get under
300 watts for whole system power draw
this is with a mediocre 500 watt power
supply so it was ok it wasn't that bad
and the ambient temperatures in here at
about 27 degrees at the moment so it is
quite hot we're still coming off summer
in Australia and so this whole system
together wasn't that bad keep in mind
you would want a much better case for
cooling if you're going to put something
inside this when I sell this I'm
definitely going to tell the person who
buys it just leave the side panel off
otherwise it just get too much heat
being dumped in the case and it's better
for longevity but speaking of the gravis
card itself the Fermi cards do indeed
run very hot and this is a combination
of course due to the GPU architecture
running hot itself but also due to the
cooling solution just not really paying
that up to par some of the aftermarket
cooling solutions like these Zeus models
and stuff did a lot better of a job but
still some of these cards even to this
date I even looked on gumtree just
recently you could pick one of these up
for about 40 Ozzie dollars well that's
the offer I put in I'm waiting for the
guy to get back to me and then come up
with a board that no one wants cheap i-5
a key buy stick of memory and a budget
250 gigabyte hard drive you'll have
self a whole system that'll run pretty
well so there it is with the GTX 580 and
to answer the question of today's video
is the GTX 580 still good for gaming in
2019 well the answer is yes and no
because it depends on what type of
gaming you're doing if you're playing
competitive multiplayer titles that are
easy to play then definitely yes and
it's a good card to keep an eye out for
with that benefit of basically meeting
with any motherboard out there however
on the flip side if you want to play
some of the latest and greatest titles
even on the lowest settings you may come
into some troubles just like we saw with
shadow of the Tomb Raider it also only
has a 1.5 gigabyte frame buffer which
again with some of those latest and
greatest titles is going to present a
problem for this graphics card in 2019
now also managed to run a quick fire
strike score and the graphics core would
put it somewhere close to that of a 2400
G from AMD maybe a little bit better but
it's still not bad for a GPU that's
almost nine years old so it's definitely
one of those cards to keep an eye out
for even if you sort of just come across
one for maybe 20 30 US dollars or 40
Aussie dollars it's definitely going to
make someone who's just looking to get
into PC gaming on a budget
happy and with that said guys I hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button let us know

about the GTX 580 have you tried one or
are you in the market for one or is it
one of those cards then you keep on your
hot list love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and also if you've
got a bit of time be sure to check out
today's video sponsor shadow raid
completely free to play on your mobile
if you're out and about you've got a bit
of spare time it's definitely worth
checking out links in description below
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now and be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
