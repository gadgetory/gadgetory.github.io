Corsair booth and they unveiled the new
to ATX micro ATX case and at first
glance I wasn't that impressed with it
to be honest this was the white version
and then the black version got sent over
and my eyes lit up
they actually quite literally lit up
like a Christmas tree but today we're
going to be putting a whole build in
this case and seeing what's good and if
it's worth your hard-earned money
welcome back to tacky our city and here
is the - ATX this is an update of
courses air series well at least the air
240 which was a micro ATX case that had
that extended room at the back it's a
pretty much party at the front business
of the back you can do cable management
so easy in today's build we have a non
modular 500 watt power supply cable
extensions and SSD and a hard drive all
in the back and there's just ample room
to work with also while we're back there
there is a removable dust filter which
does cover the power supply and you can
also install a 120 or 140 mm fan if you
wish to 3 2.5 inch trays which will fit
SSDs and an extra two trays which will
fit 3.5 inch mechanical bees which are
screwless installation you can also
install the drives from the rear the 3.5
inch drives you won't have to take out
the rear case there is a bracket that
goes over that now moving rid of the
front of the case this is where all the
magic happens you've got tempered glass
which is 5 mil thick on the top front
and the side you can remove all this
which I do recommend if you are doing a
build then there's also three removable
dust magnetic filters one being on the
bottom of the case the front and on the
top now in terms of fitting fans and
radiators in this case Corsair have
really hit the nail on the head here you
can fit 2 140 mil or 120 mil fans at the
top to 120 to 140 to the front and again
the same configuration on the bottom you
can also finally fit the H 110 or the H
115 I which is a 280 mm rad on the front
or the top of the case and even on the
bottom if you do have a mini ITX
motherboard in this case we did fit a
micro ATX board this was a used H 55
motherboard and everything worked out
really well we even had the bloom
to match the build h 115 i have tossed
being RGB that's the pro version and
we've got these light looped fans which
two are included with this case so you
can then remove the top fan move it to
the front which is what we did here link
it up to the rear where the corsair IQ
controller is located and then you get
full RGB control of your case and the
best thing about this is you can do some
really cool effects if you have a
keyboard or a mouse so you use that IQ
software set a whole effect that'll run
through or even better you can get the
temperature control on the fans
themselves the inner ring and what we
did here was we set the cpu temperature
to the inner ring and the GPU
temperature to the outer ring so
basically you'll know if both your CPU
and GPU are running absolutely fine and
if your motherboard even has a sensor on
board you can do an additional zoning
for that too so they've really stepped
things up in terms of their RGB control
made it very functional on top of the
aesthetics as well but that's the IQ
software which could be a whole
dedicated video in itself and let's get
back to the 280x with its tempered glass
of course fingerprint magnet and the
portability isn't really there the air
240 for instance had the acrylic so it
was much more portable but that tempered
glass is mainly for a stationary
position but now talking about
temperatures this is where corsair get
things right with those 2ll fans at the
front and the h 15 i pro venting air out
the top so we had a push-pull
configuration we saw only a 1 degree
difference when we put the tempered
glass side panel on we then saw a max
temperature 62 degrees so really nothing
in it
testing the cpu which unfortunate I
couldn't overclock on this motherboard
we saw 48 degrees versus 48 degrees this
was at an ambient temperature of 21
degrees so phenomenal performance
especially considering we're using
tempered glass and there's also no mesh
at the front of this case unlike the air
series which does have the mesh so we're
only drawing air in through the side so
they've done a pretty good job to get
the aesthetics right but still keep the
airflow okay now speaking of noise the
tempered glass does give one benefit of
keeping noise down while playing games
in cs:go we saw a max DB of under 50 DB
I think was like 46 to 47 so it was
really good so people who are noise
fanatic
we'll be happy with this case so after
the temperatures where we had about 200
watts being dumped in the case while
we're playing Counter Strike it did do
very well that the east of the build was
so straightforward I mean for a micro
ATX sized case this was doing really
well you can just install everything
with ease there's no sharp edges cable
management at the backs phenomenal if
you are a beginner and you've just got
cables everywhere you can just stuff
them in in this and you'll still get a
good look at the front so course I've
really got their simplicity down pat
with the air 280x now of course as I
said in the intro I do much prefer the
black version over the white version
they do come in at the same price we're
talking 170 USD roughly you get to light
loop 120mm fans and also the no
controller Pro and the hub there's also
the non RGB version which set you back
around 110 us you get to SP 120 s and no
controllers so it does save you a little
bit of money but you don't get that RGB
effect on either the fans or the control
and that about wraps up the review for
the crystal 280 X and it's a really nice
looking case I do prefer the black
version over the white version and you
do get those two ll fans included which
I would recommend relocating the top fan
straight to the front and then
installing the IQ software and
customizing that to your setup
there's also coming in at 170 USD does
include the controller and the hub you
can get the non I GB version as I said
before for 110 I'd probably go for the
RGB version if you can stretch it those
ll fans are amazing they look good very
quiet and they also have functionality
to go with it too and in this build we
did use some used brass performance as
well hope you guys would dig in that h
55 and also that DDR 3 as well as that
1060 that we picked up for a bargain and
of course if you were diggin it then be
sure to hit that like button and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
