been going crazy over GTX 10 atti rumors
and the fact that that rumor featured
the gravis card-carrying no GDR 5x on
board I'm gonna give you guys my opinion
today and let you know why I think this
rumor could actually carry a lot of
weight to what is down guys other than
that memory on the upcoming GTX 1080i
and that's exactly what I'm gonna be
talking about today with you guys
because we've got some rumors and
they've been released and we're talking
3328 CUDA cause we're talking 12
gigabytes of gddr5 memory now I'm gonna
stop there
gddr5 memory not 5x which was featured
on the GTX 1080 it was also featured on
the Titan XP or the Pascal version of
Titan and this is kind of an interesting
rumor and one that I actually think is
going to be true when we look at how
everything operates and the first thing
is micron are the only people producing
5 X at the moment and it costs more than
GDR 5 which has been out for almost a
decade now essentially so with that we
can is see Nvidia try to pull off this
play and the reason why they might get
away with it is because the bandwidth
shouldn't be too much of an issue when
we look at the fact that it's got a 384
bit wide bus there on the memory as
opposed to the GTX 1080 which only has
256 bits we can see that we've got a 50%
increase there and then we look at the
actual data rate of the memory we've got
gddr5 memory the standard stuff pushing
8 gigabits per second so vs. 10 gigabits
per second on the GDR 5x and now how
this weighs into play here is a simple
picture it like a highway you've got
four lanes on the GTX 1080 you've got
four trucks driving at an aggregate
speed of 125 kilometers per hour
now you've got a total speed there of
about 500 kilometers per hour now if we
contrast that to the theoretical gtx
980ti it's going to be released we can
see that we've got six lanes now so
we're bringing up another two lanes and
we've got six trucks and they're
traveling at a 100 km/h now we have a
total speed of 600 kilometer
per hour so we've got a 25% increase
still on that memory bandwidth if we
compare it to the GTX 1080 now we look
at the cooter cause we're getting about
thirty percent more CUDA cores there so
25 percent more memory bandwidth and
we've got 30 percent more CUDA cores
that kind of makes sense to me that
they're going to play this play when it
comes to the sales of the GTX 1080i not
only that it's not going to distract too
much away from the GTX 1080 sells itself
if you guys remember the GTX 980 when
the 980ti came out everyone just
completely forgot about the GTX 980 I
don't think NVIDIA wants a repeat of
that I think they want to keep selling
those GTX 1080s and they also want to
keep selling the Titan X Peas as well so
they can do that by simply giving the
Titan X P 5x and giving the GTX 1080i
non X and I think that way the hardcore
gamers will still end up going out and
buying that 1080i because it's like that
price performance King play there it's
the king of the graphics cards in the
gaming world but it's also gonna have
better price performance than a Titan XP
and then GT X 1080 that's still gonna be
a good play as well because it carries
that 5x or at least people will think
that way and they'll be inclined to go
out and buy one over a 1080i they'll be
like well I don't need that much
performance I'm just gonna get the 1080
and save a bit of money as well now as
for price we still don't exactly know
how much this graph Scott's gonna cost
and when it's exactly going to be
released but I'm pretty sure we can
expect this thing to be coming out maybe
possibly just before Christmas or just
after
I think that's looking like the date
when this card's gonna be released so
yes 1080 TI huge specs there is gonna be
a down cut tight and XP and I do think
that they're going to cut down that
memory bandwidth by using standard gddr5
though with that out of the way we hope
the rumours here surfacing with a core
clock of 1500 and 3 megahertz with a
boos clock of 1623 now that's coming in
under the GTX 1080 and since CUDA cores
are a huge factor in performance for any
graphics card from Nvidia we expect that
that extra 25% bandwidth avail
the memory shouldn't be too much of a
problem because it doesn't carry the 5x
and we've got those lower clock speeds
it pretty much evens out so you can
start to see that this room ah
carries a lot more weight when you think
about it probably now although a lot of
people out there like well you know 5x
has the ability to process 64 bits of
data per pin as opposed to standard
memory which only can process 32 bits
and that's a valid concern except it
doesn't apply to gaming so you know
that's out the window when we make those
valid comparisons with the GTS 1080
versus the 1070 we can see that the GTX
1080 really only carries that extra
speed on the memory itself due to the
faster memory and then the last point
that I believe makes this room a solid
is the fact that we've already got the
gtx 1070 out there in the wild this
thing sporting gddr5 memory and it's got
the same die as the GTX 1080 which is
sporting GDR 5 X memory so what we can
see here is one has the 5 X one has the
standard 5 and they're both the same die
both pretty much on the same PCB layout
there it's pretty much the same
configuration but in videos shown the
market already that they can do this
they can pull this off with the GPUs so
I think that this is actually going to
be a realistic play from Nvidia
especially with that memory compression
being upgraded with Pascal over
maxwell's anyways that's just my opinion
on the 1080 Ti I hope you enjoyed this
little video sort of gameplay commentary
I had it's been a while since I've done
one of these I've just set up my new V
67 G microphone from MXL pretty damn
sexy microphone I hopefully it sounds
pretty good as well so let me know what
you guys think in the comments section
below - do you agree or do you disagree
do you think that the GTX 1080 Ti is
going to carry that lower grade GD r v
memory versus the gt-r 5 X and if so why
or why not I'd love to hear your
thoughts and opinions and if you like
this video then please hit that like
button and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
