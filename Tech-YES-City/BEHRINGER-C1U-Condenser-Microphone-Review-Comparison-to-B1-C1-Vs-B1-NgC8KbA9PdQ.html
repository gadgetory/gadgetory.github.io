you just coming back to you guys today
with an unboxing review and quality test
of the bearing a c1u USB condenser
microphone now the u s-- stands for USB
which means all you have to do is plug
this into your computer guys and the
computer will power this and also it's
got an inbuilt ADC here so it will do
all the converting for you from audio to
digital and it will also power itself
phantom power so from the computer so
you won't need to plug in any other
power cables beside this USB cable now
comes with a USB cable it looks like it
is a 2 meter USB cable so if you need a
bit longer cable you can go down and buy
one for pretty cheap but this is this
should be enough for a computer setup
now it also comes with a microphone
stand guys which isn't the best for
instance I'll show you guys I'll do some
little comparisons throughout the video
compared to the b1 the b1 which is a
little bit more expensive comes with a
shock mount this comes with just a
little sort of tiny mount but overall
guys the fact that you're getting a
microphone clip with the product is very
good as well because I know some
microphones don't even come with a
microphone clip so you should be glad
and all you have to do now is buy a
microphone stand so it's important to
remember that you're probably going to
need a microphone stand guys if you
don't have one they go for around
fifteen dollars for a decent one so I
got mine for twenty-five dollars a
little it's got a few more adjustable
features on it but let's have a look at
the product itself now the feel of the
product guys this feels really good ok
it feels pretty heavy it's a the the b1
feels a little bit heavier but obviously
you're paying more for the b1 so you
should expect it to feel heavier right
now this is an XLR microphone so this
needs a preamp so it costs a lot more to
get this all set up than this does so
keep that in mind now this product
itself obviously another thing is it
doesn't have this has a minus 10 DB
feature which is very useful this
doesn't have any features like that it's
just a simple cardioid pickup which if
you guys didn't know it's like a love
heart shape so it'll pick up noise best
from this area in this area so overall
it you know it's got a lot of features
especially for an entry-level microphone
condenser microphone now this thing will
set you back around about 50 dollars I
got mine for about $50 and I'm going to
be
giving it away to you guys so check out
the giveaway and now it looks really
good so overall guys I'm feeling the
product itself down doing a little sort
of field this feels really solid here
you definitely you know that's sturdy
this here I feel if I push really hard I
could bend it in as opposed to the
bearing of b1 which has a very very
sturdy steel mesh over it so this feels
a little bit cheaper this steel mesh but
at the same time this this nice silvery
steel mesh also looks really good now
another thing to remember is this here I
also has it like an inbuilt pop filter
below it so you will not need a pop
filter guys which is a very good feature
like that the bearing a big one has its
own pop filter which goes over the top
so that's the difference there now I'm
you also get a one-year warranty with
this product and you also get a bearing
a decal or sticker see it's pretty good
I mean overall it's a great package the
packaging itself does not come with a
case though so all's it comes with is
this plastic packaging which is
obviously to save on costs and if it's
good thing it's going to save you guys
money as well so if you guys are
wondering the bearing of b1 comes with a
pretty big awesome case I do like the
bearing of b1 as well so if you guys are
thinking about upgrading to the bearing
b1 and you have the money I'd probably
recommend it as a lot of people have
been doing reviews on the b1 and they
are saying rave things about it I love
talking to my Barry everyone but anyway
let's get on with the quality test guys
I'll be quality testing this c1 first
and then I'll be comparing it to the b1
and I'll tell you guys which I think's
better and obviously you guys can have a
good listen to it and think and you know
make your own decision which one do you
like better and I'll also be giving away
so let's get on to the quality test guys
ok guys this is a test on the bearing of
c1 you and if I don't know about you
guys but I think this thing looks pretty
frickin epic I mean come on look at it
it looks really good I love the look of
this thing already
hopefully this quality chest sounds
pretty good I will get right into the
microphone to to test out if it's
distorting and I'll test it out from a
little bit further away now let's do the
barrenness b1 so just for comparison
we'll do a bearing of b1 on a bearing of
1 0-0
Micke preamp so this thing doesn't need
a preamp at all it's powered from the
usb obviously the data is going through
the USB and I don't think noise is a
problem like a lot of people say noise
is a problem on the 3.5 millimeter jack
but guys if you if you eliminate any
static or if you ground your power
supply unit you shouldn't have any
unwanted static going through your
microphone anyway so let's get on to the
behringer b1 you guys like the look of
this thing don't you
I like the look of it too so now let's
get onto the bearing of b1 oh yeah
okay guys before we move on to the b1
I'm just going to tweak it now so before
I had it turned up all the way to 100 so
the recording level was on 100 which if
you guys listen carefully there was a
slight hiss so that's right mr.
perfectionist here I'm just critically
analyzing a $50 microphone but hey you
guys love it I love it let's move on and
let's soive put it down to the recording
level is now at 70 and yeah hopefully it
sounds a little bit better than it did
before but keep in mind guys when you
turn the recording level down people in
skype and you know if you're talking to
someone live they might not be able to
hear you as well so keep that in mind so
I'm talking right into it I'm not trying
not to move as much as possible but yeah
hopefully it sounds a bit better now I'm
using also the 44 point one kilohertz
codec at 16 bit mono because that's what
it came with default on default settings
so I'm sort of tweaking it now and
hopefully it sounds a little bit better
than did before but let's move on to the
bearing of b1 now hey youtube this is
the bearing of b1 now I don't know about
you guys but I did notice a quality
difference between the b1 and the c1 you
I think the b1 just sounds a lot more
rich it's obviously it has a better
speaker in it that a better microphone
speaker that just takes I don't know it
takes it more just rich real rich a
signal I don't know about you guys but I
could definitely hear it so I did have
the volume turned or the microphone
recording level turned up to a hundred
as well but I found that was necessary
so I did do a test on skype and everyone
could hear me perfectly
so this microphone you can use the c1
you
you see one you you can use it for
normal everyday things like Skype and
recording things or talking to people
and it will work absolutely fine but I
did have the volume turned up to a
hundred so you may have noticed a slight
bit of noise or hissing and overall guys
it's a very good microphone entry-level
microphone I love the look of this thing
I must admit you guys probably liked the
look of it as well it does look really
good I just think maybe if you're going
to record commentaries turn the volume
down or turn the recording level down to
50 and then maybe turn it up in the
software's because when you do that
you're going to eliminate that you're
going to make less hiss so this is yeah
same level same settings as exact same
codecs exact same settings that I'm
recording like I'm using the PCM in
Camtasia Studio 8 to record at 40 40 40
4.1 kilohertz or something like the max
it can go and obviously yet everything
was pretty much the same the everything
was the same on the test so the levels
were pretty much the same and I guess
you guys did you like to see one or the
B one better I like to be one better so
every guys overall it's a cheap
microphone you can get it for $50 then
maybe you want to get it if not you
might want to get a blue snowball or
some of that but if you have like a
hundred and I got this for about $80 and
I got the mick preamp for about $40 so
$120 will get you a b1 setup which I
highly recommend and because I use it
myself I love it and maybe the blue
snowball I don't know about the blue
snowball like it gets really good
reviews but thing I don't like about the
blue snowball is it just looks like a
piece of like it looks like a
plastic piece of crap I mean yeah half
like that's why I said before half the
reason for getting a condenser
microphone is getting the look you know
that's it's like you know why do you buy
good clothes to look good so you know
that's it guys anyway I hope you enjoyed
