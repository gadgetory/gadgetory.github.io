experiment today we are going to another
dimension that is the dimension of
stupidity so we're putting a RTX 2080
graphics card and we're coupling that
with AG 4560 which is a penny emits a
dual-core middle e it does have four
threads but since we just got off the
back of testing this grabs card with the
higher end CPUs it's now time to pair it
with this to see how much of a
difference it really makes and if we can
actually bottleneck this graphics card
right here or perhaps we might just be a
little bit surprised maybe the little
Pentium can handle this card and don't
worry I'm not gonna use this card with
the vs 350
are you sick and tired of remembering
that you forgot your passwords well if
you are then today's video sponsor last
past has you covered
a popular add-on that's free to use on
popular browsers like Chrome Opera
Safari edge and Firefox and the best
thing is it can auto generate
sophisticated passwords and never forget
them it has secure cloud-based
protection which means that you only
have to remember your username for your
LastPass account and then it can
remember every single password
especially those sites that you don't
frequent munch and they require you to
have a capital letter and two smaller
case letters and then followed by two
numbers three symbols and then another
number on top of that I mean those
passwords do me in but the thing is in
2018 we do live in a day and age that
requires better passwords than your
simple abc123 which hackers can easily
gain advantage of so lost parts can
either auto generate these or you can
enter them in and it will never forget
on your behalf so it's finally time to
gain one up on your memory links and
description below
and balloon we said would stay and we've
got some interesting results to say the
least
the dual-core four threaded CPU it
actually surprised me it didn't do too
bad at all now we tested at 1440p to
start off with and I thought it got so
close to getting the numbers that were
close to that of in the GTX 2080 review
and for that review we actually changed
between an 8700 K and also 7080 20x and
these are six and eight core CPUs that
arrived both overclockable and I did
overclock both of them but this time
around we're even making things worse
for this little Pentium where we've got
single channel memory I've got an 8
gigabyte stick and a 4 gigabyte stick so
we've got 12 gigabytes of RAM and as we
said before this was used for the scum
budget PC so saving money was the number
one priority but it really shocked me
that for instance we'll pull up the
Final Fantasy 15 demo with DL SS enabled
we virtually scored no difference in the
total score with overclocking versus non
overclocking versus the original 20 80
review moving over to Far Cry 5 however
we did see some differences here to the
point where overclocking did actually
become a little detriment to the final
score which in this particular game it
does mean that certain intervals we are
bottlenecking and that bottlenecking is
actually being a detriment to
performance now keep in mind going in
from here I will say there's a big
difference between choking and
bottlenecking choking essentially is
where the computer will just start
stuttering big time and I've actually
found that that's more to do with memory
limitations itself so in the memory
speeds are too low or you simply don't
have enough system memory available
that's ddr3 or ddr4 then that's when you
will occur the phenomenon known as
choking though stuttering it was evident
in some of these benchmarks of course
moving on to pub G was a perfect example
where the 1% and 0.1% lows really
showcased this and the weaknesses of the
G 4560 where we did score these same
frame rates both non overclocked and
overclocked and also frame rates that
were lower than that of the a 700 K
in the original review so the 0.1% lows
in particular were a lot lower and you
could notice stuttering as you were
playing this game it was visibly
noticeable not just to my eye but also
the camera sure picked it up when I was
recording so a little cheat forty five
sixty is not doing a bad job but at the
same time it's not desirable either
cobble with an ITX 2080 moving over to
scum however again 1440p ultra wide the
results really shocked me this was
playing this game really well and it was
playing it so well to the point where I
couldn't notice the difference weighing
this and the original benchmarks that I
did on the 28th so it is only 40 fps and
the original benchmarks I did have to
pull up a different scene and I couldn't
actually find the part of the map where
I was benchmarking originally on because
it's just such a massive map and I
actually really haven't played the game
that much besides just benchmarking it
and this game played it pretty well I
mean when there was these new areas
loading up then it did start a massively
but after the area's loaded up it really
did a great job of playing on that
particular field with no real obvious
stuttering however the FPS is lower than
desirable but it's still a decent
experience with the little Pentium
however moving on to destiny - it was
capped again this time the overclocking
made a slight detriment to performance
so the bottlenecking here is reaching
that limit where it's starting to now
adversely affect performance they're
going back to World of Warcraft and I'm
honestly thinking I'm gonna be using
this game a lot more in benchmarks
because you guys are not only requesting
it you're also loving it as well people
will like messaging me after the 28th a
review going thank you so much for
including world of warcraft benchmarks
and here we have an interesting result
this is probably the most interesting of
all the results we got here today where
the G 45 60 was actually doing better
than when it was in the original review
I may have missed the setting here which
I do believe happened because I went
back and double-checked everything and
I'm like that can't be right I was doing
a little bit better beating out the 78
20x when I tested that in the original
review and I was kind of left scratching
my head because this was a real weird
result I mean I went
and double-check the settings and they
were all the same and I'm thinking well
okay what a Warcraft really mustn't have
come that far in the last fourteen years
since it was released but optimization
again as I said in the original review
dx12 makes absolutely no difference to
this game and then scaling it up to 2880
P which was a ridiculous benchmark saw
the frame rates pretty much drop out to
the same levels because the gravis card
is then being stressed at a hundred
percent but nonetheless of World of
Warcraft looks like it loves indeed that
single core high IPC performance so I
guess if you've got like a four core
7,700 cane you're overclocking that
thing to five gigahertz and that's
probably going to be one of the best in
slot CPUs for that game don't video zone
ray-tracing demo saw absolutely no
difference keep in mind I'm just
eyeballing this thing but it was again
consistently capped at 24 fps and then
moving on to the last benchmark Crysis 3
I'm actually gonna be using this
benchmark just like World of Warcraft in
a lot more videos but because it still
is in 2018 such a good game for testing
here the G 45 60 was actually doing
really bad this was probably one of the
worst results just like pop G in these
benchmarks and this is where it was
stuttering and it was actually
noticeable stuttering but also the total
performance was lower than that of the
original review so we were scoring 56
FPS at normal clock speeds at the 20/80
but then when we overclock the 2080 it
dropped down to 51
so the bottlenecking was becoming more
apparent here and it was probably
actually the worst result when we
overclocked so that's really about it
when it comes to the little Pentium but
it was really funny to see that a lot of
these titles the CPU utilization and the
GPU utilization was lining up near
perfectly though I will add on top of
that we didn't really take it to 4k
because I didn't really see the need the
results would have actually been
probably more in favor of the G 4560
scoring closer to that of the 8700 K in
the 58 20x because we are testing at
Ultra settings and the purpose of that
2080 review was to really extract the
most difference out of the graphics
cards themselves and not the CPUs
keep in mind if you are getting a G 4560
do not couple it with a 20-18 because
again I did test these games at Ultra
settings me usually as a gamer I play it
either medium or high settings more in
particular high settings because I find
that's the best sweet spot for getting
the visual fidelity and also the high
frame rates I actually never play games
at Ultra personally I'm just doing that
to stress gravis cards and expose
differences between the cards and make
sure the CPU doesn't become a bottleneck
in that particular review but G 4560 it
actually surprised me it did hold up at
1440p ultra wide with the two other CPUs
but when it comes to getting that better
experience this is where the G 4560
really falls flat in my opinion you can
see the stuttering was there was
inconsistent in the results and so I
guess when you're going past a mid-range
graphics card like a gtx 1060 or rx 580
for example then you'd really want
something better than the G 4560 not to
mention that when you take it down
resolutions and you drop the settings
down to high the GTX 1060 and also the
rx 580 will then be requesting more
frames from the CPU itself and then of
course you'll end up with the same
conclusion we've had here today but when
it comes down to it the dual core can
get up in boogie in 2018 and really was
surprising to see this CPU actually do a
little bit better than I expected I
didn't expect it to actually hold up the
graphics card at 100% considering this
is the latest and greatest RT X 2080 oh
my god you beaut graphics card dual core
did ok surprisingly shocking but that's
about it for the little G 4560 dual core
2018 you definitely want the 4 threaded
option not the actual 2 cores 2 threads
you might really come into some issues
then but still does okay especially for
easy to play games or popular
multiplayer titles I think World of
Warcraft did show just that but let me
know guys in the comment section below
are you still running a dual core CPU if
so let me know which if not when did you
get off a dual core CPU love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and
I'll catch you in the next Tech video
very soon also big thanks to today's
video sponsor last
I'll put the link in the description
below if you want to never forget those
forgetful passwords again peace out for
now BAE
and there we go no one ever knew this
abomination of an experiment happened</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
