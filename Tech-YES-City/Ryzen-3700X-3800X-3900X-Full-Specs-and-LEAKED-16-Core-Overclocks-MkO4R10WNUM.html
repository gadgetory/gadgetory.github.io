that has been hyped up ever since CES
with the Zen 2 architecture.
This is AMD's latest seven-nanometer CPUs
that is going head to head with Intel.
This is a big one because
they're changing from
GlobalFoundries' 12-nanometer
and they're going, as we said just before,
to seven-nanometer.
But they've also announced three new SKUs
this time around, and we'll
go over the details of them
as well as looking at AMD's preview
that they announced with
the Navi GPU architecture.
(electronic dance music)
Getting straight into
these details for you guys,
the biggest improvement is the 15% IPC.
That's instructions per cycle.
This is a massive gain
considering this is 2019,
and we've seen in the past
even with AMD going
from Ryzen 1000 to 2000
on the CPUs, they only got
around a 3% IPC increase.
But this time around,
it's absolutely massive.
That is a 15% IPC over the
previous 2000-series chips.
They've also gone two
times the cache size.
This is very important of course
to get those IPC improvements.
AMD also stated this was a prerequisite
to get the best gaming
performance possible.
Starting off with the
first chip, and honestly,
I think the most anticipated chip,
at least when I announced
these details at CES,
this is the Ryzen 7 3700X.
Eight cores, 16 threads.
They're announcing a 4.4GHz
single-core boost clock
as well as 3.6GHz across
all cores out of the box.
This is coming in at
$329, has 36MB of cache,
as well as a 65-watt TDP.
By the way, all the CPUs
I'm talking about here today
will be released on July 7th.
The next CPU to go through
is the Ryzen 7 3800X.
Pretty much a similar
thing to the Ryzen 7 3700X,
except they have upped
the clock speeds to 3.9GHz
and a 4.5GHz single-core boost,
as well as offering the CPU for $399.
The TDP rating has also
gone up from 65 watts
to 105 watts, and we will talk about that
a little bit later after
we get over this next chip.
This is the Ryzen 9 3900X.
3.8GHz boost across all cores
and a 4.6GHz boost on the
single-core performance.
70MB of cache in total.
105-watt TDP, as well as having 12 cores
and 24 threads.
They did show some benchmarks here.
The first was the 3700X versus the 9700K.
The next test that they
showed was the 3800X
versus the 9900K in PUBG.
The FPS was looking really
good for the Ryzen 7 3800X.
This does indicate one
thing to me personally,
and that is that the
eight-core, 16-threaded parts
are going to only be on one die,
and then that die is then connected
to the input/output chiplet.
AMD did talk about a chiplet design here.
As I said at CES,
I was looking forward to the eight-core,
16-threaded option because it looks like
that latency is gonna be the lowest
across all Zen CPUs.
This in turn will make
it AMD's gaming champion.
But the last benchmark they showed
was where the 3900X was going up against
the 9920X, which is a HEDT platform CPU,
and of course comes in
at a much more expensive price point.
This is $499.
They showed it going 32 seconds
versus 38 seconds in Blender,
and these results were
looking very good for AMD.
The last thing AMD talked
about in relation to
the CPUs and also their Navi GPUs
which we'll talk about later, too,
was PCIe 4.0 support
on the latest X570 motherboard chipsets.
They're also still using DDR4 memory,
but they didn't really
give out any details
in relation to the out of the
box memory speeds supported,
as well as how high things can go.
But rumor has it from
overclockers I've spoke to,
they have got dual-channel sticks
up to around 4.4GHz on
the 16-core variant.
Though of course, one thing
you guys wanna know about
of course is the all-core clock speeds.
How much are these things
realistically gonna
overclock in the real world?
I did manage to meet up with a few people
behind the scenes here
and get some sneak footage
from the water cooling guys,
and they were saying
that there is a 16-core,
32-threaded option,
and they did overclock it on water.
Here's the kicker, though;
it did go up to around 4.1GHz
on what you would consider
everyday overclocks.
They did manage to get
it just shy of 4.3GHz
on all cores for those one-time runs.
Stability-wise, it's looking
like it's going to top out
at maybe 4.1GHz, but keep in mind
that is an engineering sample.
But in the case of AMD,
I hear that they do provide
some of these chipset vendors
the engineering samples
that are really close
to the retail samples.
Another thing that I did
also hear this time around
was that this was one of
the tightest releases ever
in that they didn't let any
information slip at all.
In fact, a lot of the chipset vendors
have all closed rooms where
they had a person in charge.
If third parties wanted to
test coolers, for example,
they had to send the
cooler in to that lab,
get that person in charge
in that lab to test it,
and then give them the results.
Basically everything you guys heard
with the rumors of going
5GHz across all cores
was a little bit outlandish,
but the IPC is super impressive.
That 15% increase is absolutely massive,
plus the fact that they've coupled it
on seven-nanometer, and
the power consumption,
the 65-watt TDP, for
example, on the 3700X,
that is one thing to look forward to.
Very impressive announcement,
especially when it comes
to the CPU side of things.
Next up is Navi GPUs.
These are going to be
talked about more in-depth
with a full detail reveal at E3.
However, they did give
us a hint of performance,
and they did let us know some big news.
That is it's the RDNA architecture,
which is completely different from GCN.
It's got PCIe 4.0 enabled.
It's got faster clock speeds.
It's also got better
performance per clock,
going at 1.25 times.
And then they've also got 1.5 times
better performance per watt.
They are naming these the RX5000 series,
and they did (mumbles) display the RX5700,
and they did put it up
against an RTX 2070.
The game they decided to
display was Strange Brigade.
Obviously this is an AMD favorite title,
but the performance was
looking really good,
especially since this does look like
it's a mid-range card.
But what does remain to be
seen is a full SKU detail
of how many models they're releasing.
Is the Radeon 7 still going to be
their top-performing GPU in the stack?
Also on that note, the price,
and also entry, mid-range,
and high-end GPUs
in this architecture
all remain to be seen,
but I will be reporting
on that for you guys
when I get the chance.
With all that aside,
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
If you did, then be sure
to hit that like button.
Also, if you wanna see more of Computex,
all the latest products
that are coming out,
and the inside scoop on them,
then be sure to hit that sub button
and ring the bell to get notified
as soon as these videos drop.
If you enjoyed this one as well,
drop a comment.
Let us know what you think about
the new Ryzen 3000-series
chips coming out on the CPUs.
The Zen 2 architecture,
that does look like it's very promising.
I can't wait to get my hands on it,
test it for you guys,
run it through all the benchmarks,
give you the ultimate verdict.
With that aside, I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now.
Bye.
