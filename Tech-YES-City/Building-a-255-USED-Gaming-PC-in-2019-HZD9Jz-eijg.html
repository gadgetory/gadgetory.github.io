price-performance stuff and right here
I've got yet another yes delivery for
you guys on the desk let's take a look
what we've got here and this is a 170
dollar i7 rig that we picked up with a
gigabytes ram 2 terabyte hard drive now
it has one of the ugliest cases I have
seen in the history of computing as well
as having an absolute garbage power
supply list so we're gonna pull that
apart very soon strip it down and then
also prep the rest of these parts
because what we got here is a power
supply is just a pretty generic 600 watt
case compounds play it does work pretty
well especially for a low powered build
which would kind of go here on the desk
then we've also got an RX 470 which I
picked up for 70 Ozzie dollars but we're
gonna reflash this to an rx 570 and then
we've also got a 60 gigabyte SSD to
throw in there to help with the boot
speeds and we've got this for 10 Ozzie
dollars so so far we have 280 Ozzie
dollars I'll put all the USD pricing up
there for you too and then we've got an
extra $2.00 in LED strips but we're
still going to go pick up another case
which I've lined up for 30-odd Z dollars
but before we do that we'll strip this
thing apart and then get all the parts
on the table ready for a tech yes
cleanse
also guys I recently got this tool here
it's a electric screwdriver but it also
turns into an electric driver too but
I'm a bit conflicted because I don't
know if I should be using this or if I
should be using a Swiss Army knife let
us know in the comments below I mean
this one's also got a torch on it as
well and even one on the bottom so with
all the parts laid out here on the table
except for the case we're gonna go pick
that up now I still have to clean down
all these parts make them look like
brand new but I do want to go pick up
that case before it gets dark
it's $30.00 Aussie dollars which is like
20 USD it looks pretty good I haven't
seen it in person yet but I'm hoping
it'll come through for this build let's
go get it
so we just got back now and this case is
really big it's I think it's the full
sized ATX cases but even then it just
looks incredible I mean look at this
thing you've got two fans included that
side here bringing air in here mesh
front panel even got a handle up the top
here to carry this around to parties and
whatever and the best thing is at the
side here you've got a clear side panel
so we're gonna be able to put all the
pots in after we give them some tech yes
loving and then we're gonna put some
LEDs in and it's all gonna shine through
just beautiful I can already picture
this it's just gonna be not just like
price-performance but it's gonna be
looking incredible - so let's start
cleaning all these parts up and then get
ready for the build
so we now cleaned out all these files
right here everything is looking brand
spankin new one quick thing we have to
do though is quickly clean down just the
heatsink contact areas here just to get
the multi-purpose spray off so there's
no oil when we put down the thermal
paste and then we'll be good to go we're
gonna start building this thing also one
thing I did notice to report on for you
guys if you're in America don't use the
oil base wd-40 I got some in in
Australia here and it is indeed very
thick and oily if you're in Australia -
this stuff is just absolutely amazing
the multipurpose spray it just goes on
gives it a nice real thin film looks
amazing it's not sticky at all it's such
a good spray to work with but let's
start rocking this build
and here's the bill here it is completed
is looking Schmidt we got those two RGB
LED strips inside giving it some bling
we've also got that our x47 it's gonna
get flashed in the morning so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna crash out now
because it's pretty late and then I'm
gonna wake up and we're gonna start
installing windows and set all this up
and then install some games and see how
well this base performs so it's now time
to install Windows but one funny thing
about this case is that it's got a
Windows 10
om license key written on the back of
the actual case itself but in this build
we won't need a Windows 10 license
because we've already got a Windows 10
Pro license that was pre-installed with
this motherboard in here when I bought
the build off the previous person
however if you guys don't have Windows
10 activated or you need a Windows 10
Pro license then today's video sponsor s
CD keys have you covered for as little
as 12 USD using the coupon code TYC SK
you can get 12 percent off and get a
single end-user license this is the
legit stuff and then activate it and
have no problems I've used these keys
myself and never had one gone bad so
what are you waiting for links in the
description below use that coupon code
and save money today let's get back to
the build so we've installed Windows and
now we're copying the games across so we
gonna have to wait for that to get done
but one thing I'd always do with a
gaming PC something that's really quick
and easy is install UniGene heaven
install prime95 and also MSI Afterburner
these three programs are going to
quickly let you know if your system is
stable it's also going to give you in
the case of MSI Afterburner temperature
readouts so let's open these up and see
what's going on so now we're running
prime95 testing out the CPU I usually
leave that running for a good hour just
to test the system memory as well and
make sure nothing's crashing
everything's running smoothly but while
we're doing that we try to open up
UniGene heaven just to get the benchmark
running for the graphics card however it
crashed out with this RX 470 and now
Windows is telling me that this is not
recognized it's actually stopped a
device with an error code 43 on its
current V bios so what we're gonna do
now is use a TI flash to actually flash
this into an RX 570 so we can try and
get it working for gaming I actually
have to remember the exact commands to
force flash this so I figured this out
now I'm gonna close prime95 for this
just because you don't want your
computer crashing or even risking a
crash while you are flashing a bios it's
just gonna save you a lot of time and
hassle so we're gonna run this as
administrator again and then we're gonna
type in CD backslash that'll bring us
back to the main command prompt here
city spacebar ATI flash that will open
up a folder and then we type in hei
flash /i and now this will let us know
what adapter number our graphics card is
so it's zero so now we have to type in
hei flash and then type in slash P or
sorry - p zero that will select the
grabs card then - err for force flash
and then rx 570 files and that should
work that should now make this an RX 570
and fingers crossed it's going to take a
little bit of time and there we go
it's ready to be come in rx 570 so we
just got to restart the system and then
let's check it out
so if coming to a little bit of a
problem in that this after we flashed it
it works on the PC over there to test it
out but it doesn't now work on this
motherboard so I believe it could be
there secure boot enabled or a lack of
UEFI support on boot and so we're gonna
try and update the BIOS now and see if
we can fix it otherwise we're gonna have
to replace this whole motherboard
so now we tried updating the BIOS we had
to use zero zero four eight apparently
to get it to work but then we tried
updating from the in BIOS tool that told
us to go to Windows we use the Windows
Update and then it just bricked
so this motherboards essentially toast I
think it's a good reason anyway time to
get rid of this garbage out of the
system and change the motherboard over
something a little bit better and this
should work absolutely fine let's change
that over of course it's gonna add to
the build cost unfortunately but as we
said just before it's for the better
so this motherboard did fix the trick
there everything is working absolutely
fine the RX 570 is showing up now
unfortunately Windows is now not
activated because this motherboard
wasn't activated but it's time to
install some games and finally get
everything up and running properly we'll
talk about that Intel motherboard a bit
later in the video but let's see at
these games installed and see how this
thing performs
so after all the hassles we finally got
this PC running and the total cost came
out to about three hundred and fifty
five Aussie dollars or if you're in the
u.s. two hundred and fifty five US
dollars now the biggest thing that added
to the cost of this build was this
motherboard it was just so tedious as
well and man I don't know what happened
here like this is one of those things
where Intel really did a bad job on this
board in particular I mean why implement
a BIOS update tool when you force people
to go to Windows and update the BIOS in
Windows and everybody knows with mother
wood BIOS updates you generally don't
want to do them in Windows because it
has the highest chance of breaking a
motherboard and in this case we went to
do it it restarted the Machine and then
as it was restarting it just froze so
then after that the Mulla board just
didn't work anymore so I'm gonna save
this board for an episode of can yes fix
it so stay tuned for that I mean at the
moment it's just too much time to try to
get this thing to work especially all
the hassles that we had trying to get it
to work in the mean time where I thought
my rx 570 wouldn't have worked but I
found out I was like knows it worked on
the other computer and then it didn't
work on this I was like okay there must
be some sort of secure boot and not an
option to enable compatibility support
module CSM so that sucks that board
ended up wasting a lot of time and it
also added another 39 US dollars onto
the bill because that's what you can get
one of these h61 gigabyte boards for and
also we had to then install Windows 10
Pro on it so that was another 12 USD so
that pretty much added 51 US dollars to
the build that we shouldn't have had to
have added if Intel had just done their
BIOS updates right that was a bit of
knowing it really sort of blew the
budget out a little bit I mean it's
still a good budget build at the price
if we look at those gaming figures
they're looking really good I mean the
latest shadows of the Tomb Raider even
on high at 1080p settings still getting
around 54 average fps and then we moved
on to some of those benchmarks like
heaven we're getting a really good score
2400
and then 3dmark firestrike gives you
guys a good score on how the GPU and the
CPU perform where the GPU is getting
over 13 thousand points CPU is getting
over 8,000 points on the physics and
then moving through to a game like
hitman 1080p high settings was getting a
little over average of 90 FPS but for
some reason MSI Afterburner just
wouldn't accept the benchmark numbers
and so I couldn't accurately get you
guys an average FPS figure but the 0.1%
and 1% lows were very accurate so this
game was running really smooth on this
PC which of course is just awesome since
it's one of those latest and greatest
titles and then of course what about
dota 2 csgo fortnight and all those
other competitive multiplayer titles
well we booted up dota 2 and that was
running absolutely fine at 1080p you're
not gonna have a problem playing any
competitive multiplayer titles on this
PC and for the budget it's gonna do a
really good job giving you some smooth
gameplay but one thing about that I 720
600 even with a gigabytes of RAM it's
still a great little combo even for 2019
especially if you're on a budget just be
careful of some of these older
motherboards they may give you headaches
like we saw here today and then we move
over to the case and we had this CM
stormtrooper this thing has a handle on
it we whacked in to red LED strips only
added a little bit to the price of the
build and this thing is just massive
it's got two fans on the side and a big
20 centimeter fan at the top so things
are gonna stay very cool in this case
and especially for the price we paid 30
Ozzie dollars are around 22 US dollars I
think it was a good bargain but what do
you guys think let us know in the
comments section below what you think of
this massive case do you think it's
pretty cool I mean it's got some good
cable management options in there but
one thing that I would have liked to
have done differently in this build in
particular would be to change to a
palace play with some black cables I
think that really would have made this
bill complete I definitely noticed the
catch of a mustard standing out a lot
more in this bill for some reason I
don't know what it is but of course if
we did that that would have added to the
cost of the build even more since power
supplies with those black cables
generally cost more than the ketchup and
mustard kind but the good thing was the
Arak
for 70 did flash successfully to the rx5
70 and that even works with a 6-pin only
so if you guys want to test that out on
our X 400 or 500 series cards and get
away with just using a single 6 pin if
it has only one 8 pin connector anyway
guys that's about it for this budget
build if you enjoyed this one especially
with all the twists and turns and be
sure to hit that like button also if you
