PC a lot of people were wondering how I
actually managed to get my PC running at
1440p with over 60 FPS and multiplayer
titles well today's video is going to be
talking about important thing in PC
gaming that I like to call the balancing
act welcome to tech city this is Brian
and I'm going to cut straight to the
chase here it's all about balance when
you buy a GPU always think about the CPU
you're going a couple of width or vice
versa for gaming now I'm going to be
straight up with you guys I've had a lot
of experience building use pcs
especially over the last year and this
is allowed me to go near autopilot mode
when it comes to tuning a particular rig
that is knowing what games will work or
what settings without having to play
around an awful lot but here are some
tips for you guys if you want to tune
your PC properly first off optimize your
OS I've got guides for all these all the
way from windows 7 up to the latest
anniversary update of Windows 10 after
that I recommend getting a program
called MSI Afterburner with River tuner
statistics installed this won't just
allow you to overclock your GPU
different topic for a different day but
it will also allow you to bring up the
on-screen display which you will show
you statistics like temperatures memory
usage and more importantly percentage of
your CPU or GPU being used this is a
particularly important one because this
is where you're going to start tuning
your games to level both the CPU and the
CPU to over 90% to near 100% if possible
when you start doing this then you are
fully utilizing the maximum price
performance of your PC the one thing to
keep in mind here is that you will want
to start optimizing your games for a
smooth experience and this is just
simply playing the game and looking at
what is actually coming out on your
screen and this is where it plays an
important role with just sitting down
looking at things and forgetting about
an FPS meter and just using your eyes to
seeing what's coming out on the screen
if you look at my csgo settings for
example you'll notice that I dropped the
shadows and shaded detail this was not
only because I wanted to up the frames
but more importantly I wanted to get rid
of stuttering now I'm OCD about
stuttering more OCD and roaches about
input lag and trust me that's really
next-level OCD reach for the wind by the
way but getting back on topic
sure I speak for all PC gamers when I
say that no one likes stuttering even if
it is the micro kind now how do you
eliminate this well stuttering will
mainly come from your CPUs side though
it can come from the GPU side as well
especially when it comes to memory
limitations so try to make sure your GPU
is not near its maximum limit if you can
again using River tune-up to identify
how much GPU memory is being used and
looking at the specs of your graphics
card to see how much actual memory it
has for instance the 79-78 used had
three gigabytes of gddr5 memory and in
games I tested I turned down and
sometimes completely off any
anti-aliasing settings as for the CPU
side of things again turning off and
down things like shadows to distance
draw in physics like bullet impacts for
example can help greatly in increasing
frames and reducing stuttering now the
last type guy will go on to here is a
benchmark that I really like and it is a
really popular one - that's fire strike
it will give you a physics score a KS
CPU score and a GPU score and you should
always try to have these so that one
isn't too far out of proportion to the
other in the 1440p $174 build that i did
for example the balance was just about
right with a ratio of 1.6 or 1.7 GPU to
one CPU score or physics score now the
kicker here is that having a higher
physics score in proportion to a GPU
score is not a bad thing though it can
mean that money hasn't been spent
efficiently but having a GPU score that
far outnumbers the cpu score for example
a ratio that is higher than two to one
especially on budget pcs will generally
give you a bad stuttering experience
however on a higher end 4k gaming rig it
will be a different story since the GPU
is getting taxed a lot more in
proportion to a 1080p gaming rig also
one more thing to mention is that the
fire stripe benchmark does favor hyper
threading quite a bit but with the way
games are going with multi-threaded
support I don't see this as a bad thing
since CPUs even in the nalem generation
that's the first generation of our 7s
they're still very strong to this date
for gaming
anyway guys hope you enjoyed this video
and if you have any questions about
tuning or balancing or if you have any
tips of your own then be sure to drop a
call in the comment section below and
I'll catch you guys in the next Tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
