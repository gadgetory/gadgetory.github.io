parts hunt for 2018 I failed and I
failed miserably I only picked up a
1080p monitor for 60 ozzie dollars which
was a mediocre deal at best but this
time around the games and all the tricks
in the accents they're getting dropped
and if you're a follower of Dragonball
I'm going level 9000 if you're a
follower of bleach I'm going kuta sake
Ichigo bankai
I'm gonna redeem myself for you guys
let's see what we can pick up
welcome back to taking our city and
we've got some listings that were pulled
up here we need graphics cards and that
is exactly what I'm gonna be hunting
first deal we got is a seventy nine
seventy four forty dollars that's right
forty Australian dollars there may be a
little problem with this so if we can
get it we can see what the problem is
but they do say it is in working
condition absolute bargain next up we
got here is six gtx ten 60s came out of
a mining rig he's asking a little bit
too much we're gonna drop in an offer of
around two hundred and sixty Australian
dollars a pop since they are the six
gigabyte versions they are pretty
desirable then the next deal we got up
here is an r7 270x they're asking a
hundred strain dollars but there's no
offers so it wise will come in with an
offer of around sixty strand dollars
because that is what these cards are
generally worth will at least that's all
I'd pay for it then the last thing we're
pulling up here is an i-9 290x which I
actually put in an offer for on the
weekend and they got back to me the
person's name is Raven they go back to
me and they said yes they accepted the
160 so we're gonna go pick that up right
now here tonight and now think about all
these deals is there up in Brisbane and
that's about a one hour drive from me so
one hour there one hour back it's gonna
be at least thirty dollars in gas but if
we can pick up all those deals and it's
definitely going to be worth it but
let's go get these other deals
so we just got back and this is the hole
that we got it is a table full of gravis
cards and also some other stuff but what
we got here is six gtx 1066 gigabyte
editions we've got these four 265 a
little bit cheaper than that actually
because i didn't have the exact money he
wanted so let me off with like ten bucks
so we got these for around about two
hundred and sixty AUD a pop which is an
absolute bargain and then underneath
that is a 270 X we did manage to pick
that up on the road we sort of said
we're in the area we'll give you 60
that's all we can do take it or leave it
and they took it so that's an awesome
deal and then over here 7970 40 ozzie
dollars i don't think you're ever gonna
get a cheaper 7970 in your life and then
over here we've got yet another graphics
card a 290x that's right so 290x from
power color this is absolute beast mode
we pick this up for 160 AUD think that's
around about 120 us so the deals just
keep coming in they just keep getting
better and better and if you thought
that was good then we've got the 780 Ti
and I actually picked this up yesterday
I put in the offer on the gum tree ad it
was up for 200 astraying dollars put in
150 and then I went to pick it up they
accepted the offer when I went to pick
it up I realized it was my friend I
haven't seen him in like 13 years and I
posted up a tweet on Twitter too just to
like we haven't seen each other for ages
we chatted and he was like dude you just
have it for a hundred bucks I was like
you sure and he's like yeah and he's
like take some of this old stuff because
he was just clearing out his garage and
he gave us an 850 watt ocz power play a
really dirty Corsair I think it's a huge
55 I'm not too sure on the model number
and then we got this here this is a I
don't even know what this is it's so
cool it's a suitcase PC I've actually
got to look up the model number of this
because it's got a motherboard included
as well and he said he's just never used
the motherboard before as well rich said
never used it Ryan you can have it it's
just collecting dust here and I was just
over the moon because we're gonna make
the coolest build out of this suit
it's gonna give us some tech yes loving
of course but I am curious because I did
see the gtx 1066 a gigabytes they were
working however I haven't I didn't have
time because we're on the road to see if
this power color and also the 7970 and
also this 270x
if these three graphics cards were
working so what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna boot them up and see if they
all indeed do work
so we've just booted up the first 7970
here this is the first of the cards and
I've tried the HDMI port but now I'm
trying the mini to display to display
two HDMI adapter and it's giving out the
same problem where there's these two
bars going down the screen so I'm going
to see if I can underclock the memory
and the GPU clock later on I don't have
time to do it now but this could be
fixable
I do have faith in this if not I'll just
be starting up a new YouTube channel
artifact gamer on a budget and there is
the 270x
and that is working absolutely okay no
problems here let's try this 290x out
now hmm we're one for one which way is
it going to go and now we've got the
290x and that is working absolutely okay
so the good news is is that I've never
tried on enough that's good news I've
never tried a power colored card before
so I'm not sure how they run but this
one looks really well built and I
believe I have read up about them and I
do believe this was when power caller
started getting it right was with the
290 series so they did get a positive
wrap this certainly looks the pot and I
can't wait to put this in a build and
see how it performs
so there it is guys all on the table we
have six gtx 1066 gigabyte editions 179
70 now that was $40 and generally if
it's too good to be true then probably
is and in this case it did have two bars
going across but I do look forward to
trying to fix that thing and see if I
can get it working again we also had a
290x as well custom edition 780ti also
in r9 270x as well and then we had that
case motherboard and a power supply and
even a cooler thrown in this was just a
monster deal hunt and we got all that
for around about 2000 Australian dollars
because I did have to put gas in the car
to death drive up to prison and back and
that's about 1,500 USD for all those
parts it's just been a mega haul I'm
absolutely loving it I think I've
redeemed myself let me know in the
comments if you think I have as well and
that's the sort of comeback from that I
don't know if it was like I don't know
if was like people get streamed sniped I
don't know if people would deal sniping
me on the Saturday did feel like it
because I did have a couple of people
messaged me after saying like I was
hunting and stuff but I mean as I said
in that deal hunt on Saturday if the
price isn't right I'm not gonna buy it I
don't know about you guys if you're
buying them deals and you're getting
ripped off then it's not really a deal
for me it's like the hobby and the
passion is getting the the deal and
really getting that bargain and then
making something out of it and then even
make a little bit of a kickback for
having a bit of fun building a new PC
but also this marks a big change I think
people have made me step up my game and
for me and now I'm gonna be hunting
across the whole month and it's not
gonna be any more calls any more accents
I'll probably drop in a bit of satire
for a deal that I'm not too keen about
but when it comes to getting really good
deals I'm gonna be sniping him I'm gonna
be on them ASAP now so if people making
me step up my game I'm gonna make the
guys on the Gold Coast step up their
game as well so hope you guys enjoyed
this part son and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon also as
well I'm going over to Computex Saturday
night I'll be flying over there so I've
got a lot of booth coverage to do so I
kind of apologize in advance for the
amount of spam there's going to be a new
sub feed but to make up for that there's
this deals hunt there's also on the
first day of Taiwan there's gonna be a
hunt over there and then when I get back
later in the month there's gonna be
another deal sunset he makes three deals
hunts this month plus the show with
Danny so stay tuned for that and another
thing as well yesterday after I picked
up the 780ti with rich I went and saw a
person who was a person I met up with
the parts on and I think it was last
year when they called me out on the
phone Mitch and we've been friends ever
since he's a really cool dude he went
over to Japan recently and brought us
back some alcohol wipes because I was
running dry and they don't sell him in
Australia so big thanks to Mitch's well
for gonna stop the alcohol wipes now we
had a few brewskies as well so that was
awesome just love the community love all

and I'll catch you in I'll take a beer
very soon
peace out for now BAE and then we've got
this here this is so cool this right
