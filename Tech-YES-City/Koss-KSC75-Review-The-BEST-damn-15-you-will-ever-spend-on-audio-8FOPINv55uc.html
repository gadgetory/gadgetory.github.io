the dark coming back to you guys today
with a review of the KS C 75 s from cast
now this is a model with a little bit of
history I think though originally the KS
c 35 s and then cost decided to make a
sort of more budget oriented model and
obviously keep the sounds the same sound
quality now there is rumors about this
model in particular not just being a
little slightly bit inferior to the KSC
35 s however I'm gonna be reviewing
these today as they were phenomenal for
the money they won the budget $50
headphone shootout by a long shot and
the reasons were is because simply the
comfort and the sound quality but let's
first off let's get into the good let's
get into the nitty gritty stuff these
come boxed reasonably well they come
really they come boxed in a small
package I mean you're just getting these
head clip-on headphones in a small
package it comes relatively boxed
relatively well I don't really see these
things getting damaged in shipping now
another thing about the build quality
soon as you open these they do feel
really really light they weigh in at
about 32 grams which is extremely
lightweight they clip onto your ears
pretty well they do feel a little bit I
guess you know they could feel like they
break the the cord I guess would feel
like it could break pretty easy in the
wrong environment so that's something to
be careful of just if you if you're a
little bit rough with these they could I
could see them breaking in in in a
certain situation so putting them on
your ears like that they do feel really
comfortable and the sound coming out of
these is the most impressive sound I've
ever heard from a $15 pair of clip-on
earphones I really wasn't expecting
these to sound this good when I first
put them on with my portable player the
co1 s9 these things just sounded perfect
for rock and metal so if you're the type
of guy who likes rock and metal then
you're gonna love these they've just got
the right amount of bass they've got
that peak in the mids and rock and metal
just comes to life with these so I
really can't say much more than that I
mean well put up the frequency response
curve for you guys and just explain
everything
for you now let's talk about the detail
and the clarity of these headphones they
come with all the detail clarity is
pretty good I mean it's not like Fidelio
x1 clarity but it is good I mean it's
it's a smooth sounding headphone
obviously for $15 you can't expect the
best of the best but it's just it's a
got a smooth sound signature it doesn't
sound muddy at all so the mids the lows
and the highs are all solid they perform
relatively well and they're just a
smooth I'll reiterate that again smooth
sounding set of headphones it pooped on
in terms of sound quality pooped on all
the other headphones I thought in the
$50 budget comparison I thought they
sounded really good but then again I
like the sound signature of these
headphones someone might like AB AC
sound signature so as always with audio
it depends on the individual I'm a bit
of a mid head and I love a little bit of
bass as well so that's my preference
these definitely deliver my ghetto highs
is deliver all the same as these but a
bit more and the soundstage on these is
a bit better so these are my gaming
headphones so it depends on who you are
but yeah for gaming I can highly
recommend these to people on a budget so
the conference just their 10 out of 10
the build quality is probably about a 7
out of 10 I mean I can see these things
breaking pretty easy even though they
have a lifetime warranty also the edges
but the functionality of them and the
sound quality I mean sound quality for
the money is 10 out of 10 but I mean the
sound quality compared to say my Fidelio
x ones is probably like it's an 8 out of
10 I guess so
ultimately just value for money these
things scream value for money if you're
on a budget and you want to get into the
audiophile world then these are
definitely a great introduction now this
is the best part of these they're so
portable so I plug these into my : s
language a portable media player and now
I can go outside work out go for a jog
and these things just don't fall off
they refuse to fall off so I mean I
probably got on my ear wrong but they
just don't fall off it doesn't matter
how you put them on your ear they just
clip in really well and they sound
really damn good so I can highly
recommend these things just for pure
just epicness of the
frickin product I can't believe how good
these were for $15 so that's that that's
the review of the KSC 75 guys I hope you
enjoyed this little review I mean I'm
not going to keep blabbing on too much
about it but yeah this thing just has it
all for $15 so the cord I can see this
as I mentioned the Fadel shootout if you
want to maybe if you don't the cord is a
little bit short but I find that's
perfect with a portable media player
which sits in your pocket however if
you're using this with a computer you
may wish to get like a cheap you know
$0.50 or 1 dollar 1 meter extension
cable and yeah then you can use them on
your computer as well so lots of
functionality here I really like it so
really good highly recommended I was
completely blown away for $15 buy these
things they'll poop on any iPhone
earbuds that come with your iPhone or
stuff like that and yeah that's about it
guys I hope you enjoyed this review and
I'll come back to you guys with another
tech video very soon and if you have any
questions or comments about these
headphones or clip on the earphones
please leave a comment in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can
anyway this is the doc pacing out I'm
gonna go eat something I'll catch you
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
