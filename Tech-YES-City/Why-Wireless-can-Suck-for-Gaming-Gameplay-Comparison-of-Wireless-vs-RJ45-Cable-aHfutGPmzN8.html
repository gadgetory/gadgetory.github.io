coming back to you guys today with a
quick video on why wireless can sock for
gaming now as you guys know my e 2200
recently died on me and I was waiting
for an anti-sea to rock up in the mail
and it did today so in the meantime I
was using a wireless adapter to play you
know play games and do what I do did
work on the computer and it just sucked
like for gaming it sucked and this was
probably because I had a really thick
wall in the way anyway I'll take you
over to some gameplay footage I'll talk
about the catch-22 involved here and
also at the end I'll make some
recommendations for you guys so let's
move on to the gameplay video anyway so
this is a game called heroes of newerth
now this is a perfect game for showing
why games can suck if you getting packet
loss so as you can see here I'm getting
packet loss on my wireless adapter and
heroes and you know things are just
jumping around on the screen pretty much
teleporting from time to time and this
is just due to packet loss and since
it's a server-side based game when the
packets come to the client side where
I'm at you know that this the data just
says well you meant to be here now banks
or just teleport smell across the screen
it's really just jaggedy and pretty much
unplayable now I'm sure if I had a lot
better wireless setup this wouldn't
happen now I did test this on my wife's
laptop and I was only about a meter and
a half away two meters from the router
and you know there was no walls or
anything blocking and the gameplay was
really smooth so this just goes to show
that yeah the wall is sort of blocking
the wireless signal at my house but
let's contrast this now that I've
installed the NAC let's have a look now
so this is just popping over to me
installing the icings here the
disconnect symbols are just gone away
completely so there's no interrupts
there's it's just smooth now the
catch-22 involved with this is that if
you generally if it's too difficult to
route a cable and there's lots of
barriers of walls in between you and
your router then the wireless signal is
most likely going to be bad as well so
that's you know that's the catch-22
involve so I always recommend a cable if
you can so in conclusion I will say if
you guys want to go with a wireless
gaming setup and you probably will do if
you're going for the people with the
mini
TX builds you want to invest in a good
wireless router and also a good Wi-Fi
adapter now the onboard solutions from
the zoos and gigabyte etc on their mini
ITX boards are actually pretty damn good
they've got good signal strength so you
know there's no problems there if you're
thinking about pulling the trigger on a
mini ITX build then you don't have to
worry about those adapters what you will
have to worry about is getting a good
wireless rattle with a good signal in my
case I'm sure if I had a better wireless
router and a better wireless adapter I
wouldn't have the stuttering that I was
getting in this video but you know if
you guys are seeing what I'm seeing if
you guys are getting these packet loss
you know these disconnect symbols
constantly in your games and you know
you want to spend a bit more money in a
wireless setup than do so if you can
drill that hole and certainly drill that
hole as well so that's the you know
that's what I've done is I'll pull up a
little quick slide for you guys here you
know I need my I j45 cable so I drilled
a hole around the cable straight to the
router and that's what I'm using at the
moment so I guys I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did please give it a thumbs
up and I'll be catching you guys soon
with the width alive yeah the life is
coming tomorrow so i will catch you guys
soon with that and also there's a very
interesting video coming to which is
pretty cool you'll be you guys will love
it so anyway peace out for now but i'll
see ya soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
