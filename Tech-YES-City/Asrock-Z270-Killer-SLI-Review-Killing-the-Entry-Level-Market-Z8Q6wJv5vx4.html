rocks Andrew levels II 270 killer SLI
motherboard which features all the
necessities you want for overclocking
your Cabul X CPU or even your skylake
CPUs welcome back to tech city this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
day 1 review of as rocks new lineup of
z2 70 motherboards and this is their
starter mobo the killer that honestly
packs a lot more punch than I thought it
would with the 10 faves vrm that looking
closely at the MOSFETs it features
Nikko's pz 0 9 0 3 BK high side and
Nikko's PK 6 1/8 be a low side MOSFETs
there are as well traditional chokes
which are rated at 20 amps and the board
features 12 k solid state capacitors all
around it also features a fresh and new
updated looking bass which has two modes
easy and advanced with all the options
you'd want for overclocking your 1151
socket at CPU there are also six
different profiles the ability to update
your bias fire pre routed internet
connection and the fantastic fan tuner
which enables you to control pwm fans at
varying temperatures and speeds also
after running the 7600 K I have here at
4.6 gigahertz for over five hours the
temperatures of the MOSFET heatsink
stayed under 40 degrees Celsius in a 30
degree ambient environment and I also
managed to get this motherboard
overclocked all four cores at four point
nine gigahertz stable at one point three
nine volt for a boot and Cinebench run
pretty impressive though I did manage to
score a 5 gigahertz overclock on the
extreme 4 and even managed to get that
to boot to 5.1 gigahertz also I didn't
want to do too much testing on these
voltages and temperatures as it was
aligned CPU and that is no way to treat
mine goods there are 4 memory slots that
support up to 3777 megahertz overclocks
on all 4 slots besides that you get 4 4
pin fan headers are conveniently located
8 pin and 24 pin ATX connectors a
vertical mounted USB 3 connector which I
would like to see horizontally mounted
in the future 6 SATA 3 connection ports
2 m dot 2 slots to support both sided 3m
PCIe 4 speed connectivity with optional
raid support and moving down the bottom
of the board there is a heatsink which
features as Ross a new or RGB LED
control which can be controlled either
via Windows or in the BIOS and that
connects up to the chipset hub heatsink
to give you different effects
that are also able to be connected with
therefore pen RGB out edit to where you
can control external RGB LED lighting as
well
there also five USB to front port
connections from three different headers
a TPM and Thunderbolt adding card
connectors front audio out and also a
clear CMOS jumper above that there are
six PCIe ports four of which are one
speed and two of which are sixteen speed
connectors featuring asrock steel slots
which add more solder to the connection
points for extra strength for those
savages that don't like to screw off
their graphics cards moving on to the
onboard audio it features the realtek
ALC 892 codec which has excellent low
levels of crosstalk some of the lowest
I've seen yet though testing the volume
levels on the audio out there was
sufficient output for easy to drive
headphones the audio files will at least
want to add an amplifier on to support
higher end higher impedance headphones
as for the microphone here is a quick
test of what it will sound like so here
is a microphone test on the asrock z2 70
killer sli with the volume at 60 and the
input set with a 10 decibel gain here on
the v-moda boom pro looking at the rear
input output you have hdmi and DVI outs
ps2 4 USB 3 a USB 3.1 a and USB 3.1 C
inputs the audio has support for analog
5.1 optical out for 7.1 and then just
above that there is an Intel I - 1 9
v-neck also the last thing I will point
out is that this is a slimline ATX
motherboard so it won't extend as far as
normal ATX boards out there and also the
PCB is four layers though it does
feature what has are a call for layer
memory pool technology which is supposed
to be better than traditional 4 layer
boards so that we have an overall a
solid motherboard that hits hard for the
money coming in to roughly 130 USD so it
is coming in in a solid price and
although it does cut down features like
having a single bias and no clear CMOS
button it doesn't cut away too much from
what I think are the three necessities
to making a motherboard nor some product
that is you have a decent 10 phase vrm
though if you are into hardcore
overclocking then you may want to look
into a higher-end board it does have a
good onboard audio and a really good
onboard neck so it does have all the
three boxes ticked on this occasion it
also supports SLI and crossfire to you
guys that's about it from today if you
like
video then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below what do you think of the
killer SLI in the Z 270 lineup from
asrock would love to hear your thoughts
and opinions as always I personally love
the look of that bass I thought it was a
real good look I'd like to see them copy
that to rule their other bosses but
anyway guys I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
