I picked up 450 Australian dollars a
little bit of a back story behind this
laptop I've been meaning to do this
video for a while as well but I got this
when I traded it for a monitor that I
picked up for $50 it was a 27 inch 1080p
monitor and this computer came around
when the people were buying a computer
that I'll selling and they just said
this laptop was broken they said they
didn't want it anymore
is it fixable and I said look I don't
know what's wrong with it
I can give you this monitoring exchange
and they said sure and then I took a
look at it and it was actually one of
the hard drives so it had an SSD in it
which was quite small but it also had a
hard drive and that was giving it
problems it was broken to the point
where it wasn't even recognized and that
was causing it not to boot and upon
removing the drive everything else works
smoothly so it still had a copy of
Windows on it too and then I was looking
for a drive this is actually one of the
excuses why this video took so long to
make I was looking for a cheap budget
drive to put in so a 2.5 inch SATA one
came up on gumtree except someone else
snapped it up by the time I called them
so then I went on ebay when they had a
sale and I picked up a 7200 rpm Drive
this is a 500 gigabyte Drive so in my
opinion this Drive is gonna be perfect
for this laptop as the 500 gigabytes
that it needs to store games and also do
everything else and when I go to sell it
I can say hey it's got half a gig of
storage as well but today we're gonna be
putting this Drive in and then we're
putting the games on especially for
tonight because I want to see a
fortnight or run on this laptop since
it's very popular at the moment and we
also put another couple of popular
multiplayer titles on and see if it can
run but with that aside let's get this
drive into the laptop and then check out
what the specs are
so we just fitted up the laptop now
absolutely no problems and a booted up
lightning fast by the way it's also got
a gtx 765 m installed for the graphics
and then for the cpu you've got an i-5
42 10 m as well so first things first
we're gonna run Cinebench and firestrike
get some scores Cinebench being for the
cpu firestrike being for the GPU and
then we're gonna do some temperature
test with the heav'n benchmark for the
GPU and then i 264 for the cpu and then
after all those stress tests are done we
can get the games installed and see how
this thing plays providing it doesn't
overheat in the stress tests so let's
get that done so we just finished the
Cinebench run now and it's got 300 on
the dots so not too impressive I mean
it's actually really slow in my opinion
but this is a mobile solution and mobile
solutions of course they've run slower
than the desktop variants especially in
clock speeds you can see that two points
to execute that's right there and
interestingly enough the old Core 2 quad
that we had in the csgo potato number
two that scored around 324 I believe if
I remember correctly so the old Core 2
quads they can still get up and boogie
especially compared to things like this
now which is a Haswell based mobile
variant but let's run that firestrike
score and see how the graphics solution
holds up
so now the GPU and CPU scores are
actually pretty bad I was expecting a
little bit more on both fronts but I
guess really that's what you expect out
of mobile solutions especially in this
error I mean recently there's been this
big push with the GTX 10 series cards
and the max-q thing that this error you
know they've really were nerfed compared
to their desktop variants so I'm going
to check the temperatures now just to
make sure things are throttling
especially on the CPU side of things is
in the physics tests there was a big
stutter so that is usually indicating a
throttle on the CPU so let's check out
this Ida 64 CPU stress test first so now
I feel like the biggest idiot because I
pulled up this Ida 64 stress test and
that went to statistics here and it's
only got two cores and then I remembered
exactly what the I fives in this
generation were all about they're
actually dual cores with hyper-threading
so what you actually got here is the
desktop variant of an i3 pretty much in
a mobile so the naming scheme was kind
of weird with the mobile solutions and
how they did that and the desktop Aaron
of course the i-5 it's gonna have four
cores four threads so it's gonna be a
lot more powerful than there's two cores
in four threads and of course there's
lower clock speeds so it's going over
2.8 gigahertz on those two cores four
threads but that would explain the low
physics cores and of course the low
Cinebench scores as the temperatures
here are absolutely fine they're around
hovering in I think it is low 70s no mid
70s and that's after about 5 minutes so
that's absolutely fine this thing's
gonna run ok and games but I'm still a
bit confused as to why that physics core
had that drop as soon as it was booting
up it was going ok and then it had a dip
to like 2 or 3 FPS so bit confused about
that I mean let's see if this exhibits
this behavior in games but we will we're
on the heaven benchmark first just to
check the GPU temperatures and make sure
they're okay as well
so now we're running the UniGene Heaven
benchmarking this Bachelor is really
good because we can tell you a lot of
things and in the case of the laptop it
actually is a really good benchmark
since the GPU and CPU in this case are
definitely sharing those heat pipes and
fans and so originally I wanted to
overclock both of these components but
after seeing this benchmark I'm actually
not going to because if I overclock the
CPU and the GPU even just 10% it could
actually overload that cooling system as
you see here it's already hitting around
80 degrees even on the CPU side that's
only hovering between 20 to 40% so
imagine in a CPU intensive game if that
was going to a hundred percent this
thing could indeed in maybe hit some
thermal throttling so really not a good
thing to do on laptops in general and
that's overclocking unless you've got a
beast cooling solution on it and the
ambient temperatures are about 27
degrees in air at the moment - so
another thing as well as I put it on low
settings at 1080p because I want to get
a benchmark of this versus the csgo
potato now you did have a GTX 275 in it
and it only had 896 megabytes of
dedicated v room this I believe has 2
gigabytes of dedicated vir amps so it
does have more vram but i do want to
check that score out and just compare it
directly against the csgo potato since
heaven is a generally a GPU intensive
benchmark and we've already see the
score that 2233 I thought the csgo
potatoes scored around the 1500s so this
GPU is about 50% more powerful and so
with that extra frame buffer as well it
should be able to play for tonight and
pop G a lot better than the csgo potato
number 2 did so this will be an awesome
to see these results in these two games
now since they are sort of very modern
and they are more of the to more
demanding popular multiplayer titles out
there as well so if they can play those
two games generally they'll play csgo
and dota 2 with ease but of course let's
get on with those games
so the first of the games here is
fortnight and even with the recommended
graphical settings which I find it
generally a little bit too aggressive
it's getting around 40 to 50 FPS for
tuning this thing down to low settings
at 7 6 8 P this is the native resolution
of the monitor we're getting incredible
frame rates this is really smooth you
can see it going over a hundred fps a
lot of the times this is actually a
really good experience on this little
laptop now let's move over to pub G
though
now we're in pub G and it is running a
lot worse than a fortnight was so this
is the same resolution as well with the
lower settings so very low settings 7 6
8 P I think it is and you need to see
here it's subbed 30 fps this is out in
the open goes anywhere from this fps up
to 50 mid 50s inside buildings so this
is a pretty bad experience I mean the
CPU and the GPU are pegged
well the GP is pegged at 100% these CPUs
actually got a little bit of room to
spare so what we might do is drop the
resolution down and see if we can fix
this fps up but it might need to calm
down considerably I'd say because the
vram is not a problem that's 1.4 gigs so
it's still got an extra 600 megabytes in
the tank so what we're gonna do is drop
the resolution down because the GPU
processor itself is getting overwhelmed
so we got a bit of an FPS boost just by
doing that from 24 now 234 but the
lowest resolution you can put this game
is 720p so it's not that far off the
actual resolution of this monitor and
then we dropped the screen scale down to
70 so we did give it this is the best
this game can run on this laptop
essentially so let's just run around and
see if we can get rekt
so there we have it the $70 laptop
because I had to put a $20 hard drive in
it if you're looking at USD terms you'll
be looking around 55 USD that's what I
paid for this laptop now keep in mind as
well you're generally not gonna get a
laptop this cheap and this is one thing
that I recommend on the channel if you
guys can find a PC that people think the
whole thing is broken but really it's
only one component then you're going to
get a really good bargain a lot of the
bargains in the past that I've got on
the channel have been just that the best
bargains that I've got right beside me
is the csgo potato number two I'll put a
link in the description below for that
if you want to see it but it's got it's
a busy that we've built just off all a
lot of junk parts and we got this for
around 32 USD so it is coming in a lot
cheaper than this in percentage terms
but what surprised me was this beat the
laptop in the Cinebench scores we've got
324 Cinebench I think this got 300 yet
in games this laptop absolutely hammered
this csgo potato another two so what
I'll put that down to mainly was
probably the memory configuration this
only had like five gigabytes of real
offset memory and I don't even think
that's running in dual channel because I
had one gigabyte and then a three a two
gigabyte stick and I don't believe that
a run in dual channel run in single
channel but keep in mind we did need
that extra memory to run those games so
we kind of had to do the five gigabyte
offset configuration this on the other
end had eight gigabytes in dual channel
configuration so was running a lot
better in terms of ground-up specs and
tuning but it also had a better graphics
solution installed the gtx 765 m and
this had a to you by a dedicated vm
buffer this only had 896 megabytes so
that difference did play a role in
fortnight especially dota 2 was okay
both these games play dota 2 ok and with
dota 2 the interesting thing was I
really dislike playing on a small screen
I think if you're playing dota 2 24
inches I think is the sweet spot 27 is
pretty good but playing on small screens
is just really hard I found that out
first hand with this laptop so that was
a pretty cool thing pop G I didn't even
bother running pub G on this and I know
it definitely won't run on the
after trying to run it on this we did
get a playable experience it was around
about I'd say 40 to 50 FPS average but
keep in mind we did have it on the
lowest setting 720p which is lower than
the 76 8p on the laptops monitor and we
still had to lower the screen scale so
it was the absolute minimum settings you
can lock in for the game and it just ran
it it was okay so end of the day this
laptop does beat the csgo potato two by
a longshot
because it does have a screen and is a
smaller package but what it comes down
to at the end of day is getting those
deals finding those bargains and this
was an absolute bargain keep in mind the
problem could have been a lot worse than
it was it was probably the easiest fix
but at the end of the day the people who
got rid of it
thought that it was a pretty bad problem
it wouldn't boot at all so taking a look
at it
we took the hard drive out swapped it
around and it booted perfectly now here
in mind I may have had to change the
thermal paste but when I check in
thermals they're absolutely fine for a
laptop had no overclocking Headroom as
well which is typical of just a
run-of-the-mill laptop and that's about
it really this is the bargain here this
one here is just the junk parts built PC
but of course the one that's considered
broken and doesn't work is always going
to be a cheaper bargain for to be had
anyway guys hope you enjoyed this video
on the yeah $70 laptop and if you did
the be sure to hit that like button let
me know in the comment section below
what you think of both these pcs and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
at how well it ran in games especially
fortnight to and for not - there is no
fortnight to yet probably will be in the
future though</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
