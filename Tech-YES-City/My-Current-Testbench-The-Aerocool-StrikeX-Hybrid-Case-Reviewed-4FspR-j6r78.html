coming back to you guys today with a
review and I guess a semi unboxing of
the arrow cool Strike X so this is the
this is my test bench I've been getting
asked a lot of questions about this case
and honestly I didn't review it for a
while because it wasn't like it's I'm
gonna say first of all it is an
impressive case it's an isle of this
case however there's just some
durability issues and I'm gonna go
through that with you guys today but
first before we get into the review of
this thing
I'll take you through some guy Aster's
and photos I took when I was unboxing it
just to show you how goddamn big this
case actually is so there's the box
there I actually used this as a storage
case now for all my spared PC parts but
anyway let's move on to some of the
photos okay so first of all you can see
how big this case is it can't even fit
in the frame on my photo so I feel sorry
for the shop that has to post this thing
out I mean they're probably gonna lose
money on shipping if they're shipping it
to you for cheap as you can see here in
the case you before you open it up or
before you take off the foam you get two
extra power slot power supply brackets
there which you can load and get two
power supplies ready you also get one
with the case which is inside the case
and you get all your mountings tools
there and it comes with a lot of tools
so it comes with a screwdriver I believe
now you get the manual there as well and
then once you take off the foam you get
inside the so once you pull the top foam
off you can then pull the case out and
as you can see it's just huge the case
is massive and it's actually pretty
heavy as well so careful make sure if
you got a weak back you can get someone
else to pull it out so yeah this is
that's the case coming out now when we
move on to the hard drive bays you can
see that the this is a Western Digital
that I've installed into the hard drive
base you just pull these Bay's out and
store your hard drive and then you can
slot it in into these slots and it's
actually a really good idea I really
like it it's really quick for hot
swapping hard drives and if you want to
test a particular SSD versus SSD you can
get them ready and then test them on the
fly so a really good feature and
really like these drive bays their site
a3 as well so you don't have to worry
about them not being a being compatible
not being about it with your hard drive
so I really like that feature let's move
on now let's go back to the video now
let's look at the case itself now what
you get when you unbox this case and you
set it up this case is pretty much
touted as being a hybrid test bench
personal ATX case kind of thing and
honestly it does fit the bill I love
this case simply because this fan here
actually does a really good job of
cooling so the first point I'll make is
at this 20 centimeter fan here on top
actually cools all your components
really well and you pretty much have all
your edges blowing out everywhere so
this is bringing cold air from the top
and it's just all the hot air is getting
blown out because this fan is actually
pretty damn good so here you can see
I've actually managed to install
everything in the case itself so we've
got there the GTX 780 Lightning the
Animax 240 and there's just ample room
inside this case you've got also got
cable management here and here and here
so you can easily fit all your cables
that you need to fit now let's move on
now to the durability because it's one
of the things that I didn't like about
this case it was the probably the one of
my least favorite things so first of all
we'll move here to the front panel this
front panel here this audio port here is
already starting to give out a little
bit it's a bit the durability of it's
not that good the mic port I think is
actually gone fully gone so if they're
going to sort of this is only I've used
this case for about seven months and I
guess so this front panel is already
starting to get a kick out this USB port
here is already starting to kick out so
it's not that you know the build quality
some of the build parts of this case the
build quality is not that impressive I
think that the join between this part
and this part here so let me first say
that the left side of the case is really
heavy this case this slide here is
actually really heavy but this side here
feels like it's made in but majority of
plastic so if is that even a word the
majority of this side of the case is
plastic and so this side feels cheap
when it connects to here because it
feels like if you shook this in the
wrong way it
like this could completely snap off this
side so this case this side here is
really heavy and real well-built but
this side feels a bit cheap now this
thing here when I first got this and I
pulled it out of the case this thing
here doesn't sit in properly so that's
another durability issue half with the
case is this thing in the corner here so
this is your drive bay and it's it's
actually I mean it's good like you can
take it out and you can take put your
5.25 inch drive bays in there and it's
actually really convenient so it's a
real breeze to use this case I like it
everything everything does work
reasonably well it's just that you know
I think in some parts of the world they
charge $150 for this case I managed to
pick it up for $80 so it was a bargain
so let's move on now let's move on so
I've got the durability issues out in
the road and one more little
disadvantage I will point out about this
case is when you have it set up like
that I don't know if you guys can see it
but the top corner here this corner
starts to sag down after a little while
so maybe after 2 months of use this top
right corner will start to Sag down a
little bit and will look a little bit
off so there are the durability issues
or the quality concerns that I have with
the case let's move on now to the really
good points so again I've discussed the
20 centimeter fan is phenomenally it's
good it's quiet it does a really good
job of cooling this is another point I
like here you can adjust the height of
the case by setting it down like that
I'm not going to put it down too low
because the GTX 780 is a monster and it
takes up so you got three levels that
you can put this top three levels you
can put it on to and it's up to you guys
what level you want to have it on I
usually have it on the second level
there so it's as its as close as it can
be without hitting cables and it does a
really good job of cooling this also
apparently is able to be detached and
you can use it as a laptop cooler as
well which is actually a really cool
feature I think the hard drive bays here
let's move on now to this bit they're
really really as I showed you guys in
the slides before in a photo these just
come out and not gonna pull them out now
but
it's my computer or crash but these pull
out and you can just put a harddrive in
plug it in and you're good to go so
they're really good for a test bench
setup if you guys need to if you guys
are testing a lot of computer parts and
you sort of want your own personal case
I can definitely recommend this case
just keep in mind that the durability
and the quality of this case is not that
good in my opinion they could work on a
few little things put in a stronger
front panel maybe put a bit more weight
here and put a little bit of a stronger
metal chassis through there and
obviously a bit of a stronger connection
point with this tray up here so
ultimately I love this case though it's
nice it's huge and keep in mind that it
is really big so this is a standard desk
and you see here that it takes up pretty
much the whole desk
I have resprayed this desk black to
match the color code of this case so
that's pretty much all I can think of
with this case I mean if it's a
full-size ATX motherboard it'll fit
massive graphics cards as well as you
can see here I don't think it gets any
bigger than the GTX 780 lightning it'll
fit air coolers up until I guess another
20 mil you've got another hum another 40
mil on top of the any maxi 40 so it'll
fit
yeah it'll fit a lot of stuff in so it's
ER it's a really big case these also at
the back here you can take these out and
put them back in which is something I
really like you've got cable management
options at the rear of the case you've
got cable management options underneath
the case and also at the rear of the
case you can take the power supply in
and out and you have brackets that are
included with the case that will allow
you to get three or four power supply
our three power supplies ready in case
you want a hot swap pass place so this
case does come pretty loaded it is a
nice case ultimately I'm going to give
it a 4 out of 5
you know if the durability was really
good on this case I would give it a 5
out of 5 hands-down it's just some of
those is you know audio cuts out here's
the front panel I love using the front
panel because as you guys know I've got
the mic preamp here and that uses the
rear ports on my motherboard and when
I'm listening and just playing games I
just don't need the preamp so I want to
use the front panel and so my front
panel for me is really important and
when it cuts out
it's a bit of a pain in the ass so that
being said though the case is nice
you're getting a lot of case for your
money for $80 you are getting a really
damn good case so this blue light here
is well that's your power button you get
your reset button which also doubles as
a harddrive light which i think is
actually a really good idea I like that
they've done that so when your hard
drive is in motion on the right bottom
right corner there you'll notice that
the light sort of the red light will
flash just like a hard drive so it's
really cool I like how Arish strike at
doing their own little unique things and
yeah the cable management's good on this
case I can't really say anything else
about the case except I would like to
see I guess at the rear here more
mounting support at the right at the
rear there I'd like to see some more
mounting support for water coolers and
such that I mean it looks like there is
some kind of support there but when I
tried to fit a water cooler to it and it
just didn't really work so yeah but it
does look like it can do it just in a
weird way so I'd like to see maybe in
the future they sort of improve on that
a little bit and the durability in this
case would be a 5 out of 5 hands-down so
if you guys have any questions about
this case then please let me know in the
comment section below and if you have
any suggestions or yes or if you think
anything you'd like to see with this
case then please also put that in
conversation below - if you liked this
review please give it a thumbs up if you
and if you haven't read subscriber tech
your city so now this is my test bench
and my lovely case so this is it guys I
thought I'd share it with you guys today
and I hope you enjoyed it peace out for
