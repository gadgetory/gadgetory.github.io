I'm gonna be talking to you guys about a
product called the v-moda boom mic Pro
now what is this you're looking at this
thing and you're seeing well this what
is this little thing you've got here
well this is a microphone and it's also
a speaker cable so what this does is you
can plug this in to your audiophile
headphones like this and it will
essentially make your audiophile
headphones a gaming headset so the
benefits of this I guess I don't really
need to explain it but the benefits of
this is that you can use your audiophile
headphones as a gaming headset and as we
all know audiophile headphones sound a
lot better than gaming headsets if you
don't know this already then trust me go
out and try a pair of audiophile
headphones and then come back to me and
tell me I'm wrong because you won't
trust me so today I'm going to be
reviewing this product I'm also going to
be doing this review whilst talking on
this microphone to let you guys do a
little comparison of how it might be
good if it's good for streaming or you
know how good is it compared to a
condenser microphone so first off I'm
doing I'm talking to you guys on the
audio technica at2020 - boom mic Pro and
talk a little bit about this product
anyway let's switch over okay so now
I've switched over to the V mode of boom
mic Pro and any noise you hear from here
on will essentially be my the amp on my
ADCs fault not the microphone itself so
let me know how you think the actual
microphone itself sounds do you think it
sounds good this is my first time doing
this and I haven't heard it yet so this
is going to be a first time for me as
well anyway let's get on with the review
first of all you buy it you can buy this
microphone from Amazon for $30 and if
you're in America you can get free
shipping they will ship it
internationally which they did for me
for really reasonably cheap I got this
with the sound card shipped
internationally for about $15 shipping
so amazon are really really good when it
comes to international shipping but
let's get on with the product itself
when I first got this product I I first
picked it up and I was like wow the box
was relatively small and the product
felt really lightweight I was like oh
well I paid $30 for this but as soon as
I unbox it and as soon as I put it
into the headphones I realized Wow okay
these guys have solved a really sort of
niche problem and they're addressing a
niche problem with a niche product and
they deserve in my opinion they deserve
$30 for a product like this because
they're the only people I know who are
doing such an awesome product like this
this will turn any gaming headphone with
a headphone out 3.5 millimeter jack or
anything like that into a gaming headset
and not only that the cable itself is
braided it's high-quality you're not
going to lose any signal quality with
this cable the cable quality let's talk
about the cable itself it's 2 meters
long so it's ample fine in my opinion
I'd like to see this cable about 2 and
1/2 meters I personally find a 2 and 1/2
meters is a perfect sweet spot for me
with cable but 2 meters is generous I
like the fact that it's 2 meters it
could be worse so 2 meters is good two
and a half meters would be perfect 3
meters would be a little bit too much
but 2 meters is good I'm not going to
complain too much about that let's look
at the clip now the clip in my opinion
is my favorite part of the headphone
it's the most it feels really good it's
really nice touch the actual spring on
it works really well it has a mute
button on it if you want to quickly mute
your head your microphone and it also
has a volume control knob not only that
the clip itself feels really
high-quality and it looks good as well
the actual cable itself feels really
light the whole product feels really
light however some may see this as a
negative but I do see it is a little bit
of the positive because it makes
everything lightweight the cable is
ultimately going to be attached to your
headphones and it's going if the light
of the light of the weight the less drag
it's going to have on your head so the
fact that this is really lightweight is
actually a benefit for me now let's look
at the microphone itself the microphone
itself is I believe it's a 3.5
millimeter jack and now the microphone
is small when you first get this
microphone you're going to think wow
this is a small microphone however it
does what I need it to do and it I think
I mean I'm going to assume that the
voice quality is good because I'm
telling the review from this microphone
it also feels pretty well built I mean
the memory on the cable is really good
so if I move this microphone here it'll
stay there it won't move if I move it up
it'll stay there and it won't move as
well so
I really like that feature as well now
let's move on now to the actual jacks
themselves they're all 3.5 milimeter
jacks and they feel a little bit flimsy
I would like to see V motor in the
future if they didn't version two of
this maybe make the jacks a little bit
more chunky a little bit bigger
they'd feel a little bit flimsy to me so
false that could take something about
this product it would probably be the
jacks now it does come with a wire
adapter so if if you need that just if
if your phone or any any device supports
the three prong all three the three
lines then that'll plug into that but if
you're using it like me with a computer
and you need to split the headphone and
the mic cables this wire adapter will be
essential the Y adapter itself fills
reasonably good quality and messes to
standard Y adapter and ultimately this
product it comes together to work and
I'm going to come back to you guys now
so I'll just move back to the condenser
now and I want to know your feedback did
you guys think the v-moda boom Pro
sounded good my friend
our last night on skype he said it
sounded pretty good I'm going to check
the video myself and see how it sounds
but hopefully it sounds pretty damn good
also I'm going to say is this product
worth $30 if there was twenty other
competitors out there I would say no but
since v-moda have gone to the lengths to
make a niche product that addresses a
niche market I'm going to say yes v-moda
definitely deserve $30 for this product
I think it's fair value considering
they're the only ones that have gone out
and made this product if those like I
said if there's twenty other competitors
making this I'd say about twenty dollars
would be fair value but the Emotiv
really gone to the lengths to make this
and the effort to make this product so I
believe they deserve the money anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this review if you
have any questions about the V mode of
boom Pro and please leave a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can if you have
any requests please leave requests in
the comments - I will be reviewing the
Fidelio x ones as well really soon as
well as the Sound Blaster Z these three
products the v-moda / m / x ones and the
Sound Blaster Z all impressed me they're
really good I'm going to be getting
those reviews done soon got some other
tech videos on the way
I haven't forgot about you AMD guys on
the
FEX series are going to be getting an
overclocking - Dora done as well when I
get some time and this is the dock
signing out peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
