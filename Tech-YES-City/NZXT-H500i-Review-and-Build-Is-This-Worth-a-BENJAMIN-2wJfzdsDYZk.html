the very first NZXT case that I'm going
to be building with at least here on the
channel and this is the H 500 I
currently comes in at a hundred u.s. or
a hundred and 69 Ozzy I believe in the
UK it's over a hundred pounds as well so
if it's anything straight away the
pricing I'd like to see it fixed at
least in the UK and Ozzy compared to the
u.s. pricing where a hundred bucks is
pretty fair for a case they're for
thirty dollars over the previous age 500
what do you get extra where you do get
there Hugh plus and their digital fan
controller on the back as well as an LED
strip built-in behind this bar here this
is also the white version they do have
different color variants but since I'm
going to be doing a white and black
theme build here I figured this would be
the best pick inside you've also got two
SSD bays which are detachable and can be
placed on the rear side of the
motherboard tray behind we put your
cables technically if you had another
two of these trays you could mount four
SSDs in total also for the drive storage
for 3.5 inch mechanical drives you can
mount three of these as well
with a removable drive cage in the back
on the top is two included 120mm black
fans we're gonna be moving them to the
front of the case this is we're gonna be
using the ID cooling all-in-one liquid
cooler on 8b 360 gaming three Wi-Fi
motherboard with a core i5 8400 and the
GTX 1066 gigabyte for the drives we've
got a two terabyte and also a 240 by
Corsair SSD going inside this puppy
right here as well as a 700 watt an tech
VP power supply which is really good
value for money and since we got this
nice clean power supply shroud at the
front here we'd have to worry too much
about ketchup and mustard and yes my
hand is moving here which it shouldn't
be but that's because there's usually a
tempered glass panel in front here which
is easily removable with one screw on
the back you've got a solid panel with
enough room for cable management too but
with all that aside let's get this build
montage done and then we can properly
review this case and tell you is it's
worth your hard-earned
so it's now the next day you can pro you
tell by the smile on my face I'm pretty
impressed with this case it's a compact
lightweight case but it still has
tempered glass still has steel still has
that build quality building in this
thing there's no sharp edges cable
management at the back really easy to do
as well and this is even with that
controller included now speaking of that
control it's an extra $30 as I said in
the intro that does give you the option
to use their software which is actually
pretty straightforward gives you CPU GPU
monitoring and allows you to change all
the RGB colors with different patterns
and my favorite is the sensor control
which will link up different colors to
different temperatures of either your
CPU or GPU so you know if something for
instance a pump on your water pool is
failing because the lights will suddenly
go dark red in your case then you know
something's wrong
that's very functional use of RGB and
this allows you to do it know that the
automatic fan control in this case
worked really well we're dumping about
200 watts in the case while we're
playing pop G and the temperatures
weren't that bad as opposed to taking
the tempered glass off on the GPU we saw
a three degree drop after we took the
timid glass side panel off but the noise
was very quiet I'll let you guys take a
quick listen the CPU didn't change
temperatures all that's probably thanks
to the exhausting of that 120 all in one
mounted at the back so you can mount a
120mm fan or all in one at the back up
the top you can mount a 140 ml fan or
120 hasn't included dust filter and then
at the front you've got an easy
detachable plate where you can mount
either to 140 ml fans to 120 s or you
can mount up to 40 ml rad or a to 80 mil
rad and it's great that you can separate
the fans at the front of the build
versus putting the radiator at the back
and in this case I did put the fans at
the front of the case and that allows me
to route the cables through the back so
they're completely hidden from the human
eye
moving back now with the actual case
itself it is pretty compact in size yet
it is pretty spacious I had no problems
building in this thing there's actually
no complaints whatsoever very
straightforward inserting your power
supply straightforward putting hard
drives SSDs in easy cable management
easy and that allowed me just to really
complete this build in next to no time
also if you are in an older platform
like X 58 or X 79 and you want to use
RGB it's a great thing with this case
because that preset controller will
allow you to control RGB without the
need of a 12 volt 4 pin fan header a 5
volt 3 pin fan header for the RGB
controls
now speaking of extras with SSDs you can
detach the Bay's if you want to and in
that place there is an option to
vertically mount a GPU though you will
need an extra kit I believe from cable
mod which cost around $60 so there's a
little bit expensive to get that
vertically mounted GPU at the top of the
case you've got ample room to run cables
and even with a radiator installed
through there to get the top CPU pin for
example where you want it as well as the
fan headers movie the top of the case 2
USB 3 ports as well power light which
has a white ring around it and your HDD
activity as well as your mic in and
audio out and ultimately when it comes
down to it there's really not a whole
lot I can critique about this case I
actually really like the design that the
tempered glass is actually sunk in as
opposed to sticking out and it doesn't
really add much weight to the case but
still gives it that clean aesthetic that
you're looking for also all over the
case it's a very boxy simple design too
so it will work well in an office and
lastly it's coming in at a hundred bucks
so it's not gonna break the bank and if
you don't like the eye which stands for
intelligent control I believe you can
get away with that by going $30 down and
going just with the H 500 which at $70
is a pretty good buy as well since it
does include two fans so I think they're
hitting hard in terms of getting a clean
aesthetic good build quality and great
value for money and in the u.s. the
price is pretty good but like I said in
the intro 169 AUD I think in PPP terms
it is a little bit overpriced compared
to the US and in the UK it's over a
hundred pounds at the moment so if NZXT
can get their pricing right
internationally I think they'll have one
big winner on their hand
as they already have in the u.s. anyway
guys hope you enjoyed this review if
there's anything else you'd like to know
about this case and be sure to let me
know in the comment section below or if
there's any questions you have I'll get
back to you as soon as I can if you like
this one be sure to hit that like button
and I'll catch another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
