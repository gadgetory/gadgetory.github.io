the use price performance,
and over the last couple of months
I have been picking up
some of the best deals,
because I wanted to do a feature piece.
And right here,
we've got the best of the best,
going into a brand-new case.
Now, I couldn't find
a really good case
over the last couple of months,
that represented good value,
and have the RGB Blink.
So, on eBay sale,
I got this V200,
just four fans included,
and as a power supply,
which we will be pulling out,
and it's not a bad power supply either,
and then we going to be putting in
a 850 watt power supply.
So we got that for $100 AUD,
which is like $70 USD.
So I'm extracting a lot
of the value out of that.
We got the SOC Force Motherboard here Z87.
This is one of the best
overclocking boards.
I picked this up in a liquidations sales.
If you haven't seen that video,
I'll put it up here.
We've got this for $80 AUD,
which it makes it so damn cheap.
Then we got the GTX980 G1.
Got this for $180 AUD.
And then we got a 477OKA,
in last month's pot hunts,
for $90 AUD.
Then we got this here,
$30 Aussie Dollars,
to this water cooler.
It did include the bracket too,
so I am lucky.
But I don't know if
some of this stuff work.
So we are going to give
this graphics card some tech loving.
This cooler, some loving as well.
And this power supply.
And we going to delete this CPU.
And then, put it together
before we put it in the build,
and see if everything turns on.
See if we good to go.
But, besides that,
we've also got some Dominator DDR3 Memory.
Now, picked this up
off an old-school overclocker
from Team AU.
They sold it to me directly
for $100 AUD the four sticks.
Now, usually that's not
a really good deal for DDR3 Memory,
but since it is a Corsair Dominator
from much the best DDR3
Memory you can get,
I do consider that pretty good.
So basically,
we're going to be overclocking.
this build today to Kingdom Come.
And for drives,
I've got a brand new 240 GB SSD.
I picked this up for $39 AUD on a sale,
and a 2 terabyte,
which I got prorated
from four 2TB drives,
which I picked up for
a $100 noisy dollars.
So that makes it 25.
So the total is build
will come to $487 US dollars,
or if in stress $684 AUD.
So it's under the $500 price point,
which is a magical number.
So today's build
is not only going to represent
awesome price performance,
but it's also going to be
something that will look good
and overclock like a monster
with really good parts inside.
With that said,
let's start cleaning these parts
and put this thing together.
(upbeat tempo music)
(dubstep music)
- So I'm cleaning off this Graphics Card,
and there was so much thermal paste
on this GTX 980.
So someone was clearly having a lot of fun
with that thermal paste,
but that wasn't to worry
because I had a lot of fun
with the brake cleaner.
But also, another thing we saw
this GPU has the thermal paste
hard and crusty and that
will affect performance.
Which could be the reason why
this particular person
let this card go cheap,
because they thought
the performance is low
or great to a new card.
It's nice and quiet.
But that's not to worry
this thing will run even
better that brand-new
because we're gonna put
the better thermal paste on it right now.
(dubstep music)
- So all the parts are pretty much
ready to go except for one more thing,
and that is a delete on this 477OK.
Now, the reason it's being
is that the thermal paste is mediocre,
but it's actually a few years-old now.
So the thermal paste is probably dried-up,
and we want to get the
best overclocks possible.
So let's get that underway
(dubstep music)
- So we had some boot problems before.
But, it looks like we're just
going to update the Bios
as it's working with
this one random stick of hynix.
So, sometimes your memory
is not compatible with
initial rounds of Bios,
especially it's my little,
just pretty much brand-new and box.
So, after we update that,
everything should be
ready for a trial run.
It should be ready for the install.
(dubstep music)
- So basically the problem
with this motherboard is
the Altitude Dims won't support
the Corsair Dominator Memory.
I've tried the two Dims
in the second slot here,
and they work fine or for Dims
do with them switched out.
So, gigabyte Bios.
What are you doing?
This is the latest Bios as well.
This is why there is
a lot of frustration around
these old school gigabyte
boards and overclocking.
But, we got some of this stuff here.
I picked this up.
I actually got 64 gigabytes of this stuff,
for $200 noisy dollars.
So, I'm going to do 16 gigabytes
in just dual channel
instead of having it in the quad channel.
But that's not a problem, because,
we're going to drop the price down
to the build, but I did really
wanted to use this Dominator Memory.
(dubstep music)
- So we now got the build finished,
up and running,
and it is looking so good.
And we're just installing Windows
and today's video sponsor, SCD Keys.
If you guys haven't got
a Windows 10 Key Pro License already,
and they've got legit
single end-user licenses going
for as little as $13 dollars of pop.
So if you need one of these
and got a brand-new build,
and instead of going out
paying hundreds for a Key,
you get one of these today.
Delivered pretty much
instantly for $13 box
using the coupon code TYCSK on.
Check out links in the description below.
Let's get back to this build.
(dubstep music)
- So I've spent all last night
with this thing, tuning it,
pulling my hair out,
having a hard time to getting it
to run a hundred percent.
Now, along the way there
were some problems.
And the first of all,
the two stick of memory
that I put in, I believe,
one of them is actually faulty
because we changed that around.
Then everything started working okay.
But then we came into other problems
with a 4.6 gigahertz overclock
wasn't a hundred percent stable.
So we dropped that down to 4.4
just to get the testing done.
And then I decided to test a 388 drivers,
which is what Windows will automatically
install if you don't do anything
and don't download the latest drivers
and compare that against
the four to five drivers
which were the latest on invidious site.
And, here we did see improvements
in performance at 1080P high settings,
on all three titles
that I tested:
Metro Exodus, Anthem
and also Apex Legends.
Metro and Apex did see a sizable boost
going from 70 average and 84 average.
And also it felt smoother in general.
But that's because it got
such a big lift in FPS.
Apex went from 65 to 78.
But Anthem didn't
increased that much at all.
In fact, it only increased about four FPS,
from 52 to 56.
So that was pretty weird to see.
Especially since the drivers,
the 3/8 drivers is very old.
So there's not a whole to of optimization
going on in Anthem I believe
for the GTX 9 series cards,
but after ironing out all these bugs
the gaming performance was pretty good.
It ended-up being smooth.
The whole system power draw,
ended-up using 420 watts peak,
and when we're doing an eye to 64
and testing the whole system,
3D mark fire strike,
showed us getting GPU score
close to 16,000 points,
and then also the physics
score was over 12,000
on the 477OK.
However, here's where things get
a little bit iffy,
a little bit messy.
This case that we used, the V200.
Although it looks nice.
It's got the good bling.
It's got everything you'd want
for budget case on the surface,
the three fans at the
front just completely suck.
Like I was holding
a little piece of paper in front of it,
and you see there is just no air flow
coming into this thing.
So when we left the glass side panel on
during Metro Exodus,
the temperatures were
literally 11 degrees higher
on both the CPU and the GPU,
and it's got a temperature increase
just stupid because the ambience in here,
although there are around 27 degrees,
if things get hotter in summer,
that's the difference between
your system running too hot
for longevity purposes,
and just running cool
and actually getting better performance.
Cuz' your system can crash
if your it gets overloaded with heat,
especially when we're using over 400 watts
with this system when it's overclocked.
So basically with this
thermal take V200 case,
it's okay if you have a low power build,
say for instance,
you're using like 1060 or 1050 TI,
and just an I5 or a Ryzen,
and you're not overclocking,
but you if you're going
to overclock you CPU
and get some serious
hardware in this thing,
I definitely recommend
getting a different case
or changing around the fans of the front,
and installing a better outtake fan.
In this case, we did use
the corsair water cool,
the 120 ml solution.
But that was a bit weird
because I had to replace the fans
since I had broken fin on it.
But after the case, the motherboard
did present some problems
as we saw earlier
with those Corsair Dominator RAM sticks.
I really wanted to use these things.
I thought it would've been awesome to have
pretty much everything
in this build high-end
but that just didn't work out.
So it was like the case was problematic.
The RAM was problematic.
We have two counts of problems there.
The motherboard was problematic,
and then, the fourth thing
which is sort of, unknown at this stage.
I would have to do a lot more testing,
is I do believe the power supply,
this 850 watts power
supply from Silverstone,
does have high amounts of ripple
because the overclocking
did feel unstable.
And this is one of those things
where if even one of your components
in your build is lack luster,
then, it can bring everything else down.
Because when I went to check out
some detailed reviews
on this power supply,
did show a high amounts of ripple,
but having good ratings I guess,
with the max power draw and
the amps on the 12-volt line.
But there's a lot more to it
than just those two specs
and ripple is a huge factor if you guys
want to get better and more long-lasting
stable overclocks, out of your gear.
So what happened here today
was me getting a lot of really
good parts individually,
and really good deals,
but then throwing something together,
that ended-up honestly
being a massive headache.
Sure, I got it running now,
but it's still not at the levels
of overclocks that I'd like.
For instance,s the 477OK
with a better power supple
and also, in a better case,
I'm sure we've remained
stable at 4.6 gigahertz.
And also that G1 gaming
that went just above 1.5 gigahertz.
But I believe you can
get these up to 1.55, 1.6 gigahertz
stable in the right conditions.
So there all is with this build
and what happened today was the best
and also the worst experience.
Got the best deals but
had the worst experience
putting this thing together
and getting it to run smoothly.
And I think, this is where those problems
start to creep in, to people who want
to get into used price
performance and use PCs.
Especially re flipping
is especially if you're going for
enthusiasts parts, you
do have to be careful
because you can run into these problems.
And if you don't have the spare hardware
to chop and change things
then you're not going to know exactly
what could be faulty
and it can take a lot of time.
For instance, for me
I've been doing this for years
and it still consumes a lot of time
when I go to diagnose problems,
change parts, and then,
even then, it's not guaranteed
to work a hundred percent.
You can still come into on-going problems.
So that is sort of the risk you run.
I believe if you want to start out
with used PC hustling,
definitely get into the EOM stuff
find EOM builds that works,
you're going have not problems
when it comes to know overclocking.
When it comes to overclocking,
you will come into
problems sooner or later,
just like I did here just today
and it does take up a lot of your time.
Well you guys, I hope you
enjoyed today's video.
If you did make sure to
hit that like button.
Let us know in the comments section below,
however what you think of the GTX 980,
and also the 477OK in 2019.
They're definitely good parts
for 1080p gaming in my opinion.
And they're worth
keeping an eye out for it
if you want to get into gaming or you want
to get a nice build together,
because these two parts are probably
the best parts in today's build.
With that said, I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon.
