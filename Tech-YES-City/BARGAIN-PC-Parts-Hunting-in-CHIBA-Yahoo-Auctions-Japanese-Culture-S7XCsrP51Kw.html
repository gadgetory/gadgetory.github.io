rent-a-car behind me and today we're
going use PC parts hunting all around
the Chiba district in Japan so let's get
it on
so we just finished up at the hot off at
a mall called fresco now this is in
Chiba City I'll actually put the
directions on a map for you guys this
place in the past has never disappointed
me every time I've been there I've
always picked up something here and
today was no different I went in there
got a 500 gigabyte hard drive for around
$15 which isn't too bad I like using
those in budget builds a little bit more
than what you should pay you should be
around $10 but they're guaranteed to
work at least and then I got an a330 240
which is a pretty decent CPU for around
$25 so they were mediocre deals but the
best deal I got there was by far two
things actually a motherboard a Maximus
gene LGA 1155 motherboard it had two
bent pins on it and when I checked out
the back of the motherboard that looked
really good as well so one way to check
out a motherboard to see if it's
absolutely screwed is to look at the
back of the chips and if they are
discolored in any way then I'd recommend
staying away from that however this
motherboard I was looking at today had
no discoloration and when I pulled off
the socket there was two bent pins that
were bent upwards which should be really
easy to bend back in order to get this
motherboard working and I paid $10 for
that mobo and the last deal that we got
was the desktop PC for $30 now actually
open this up and it had an asrock age 55
motherboard in there which was worth the
whole thing in itself it also had a
bonus for gigabyte the video three
memory thrown in a power supply which is
actually confirmed working and the
motherboard is confirmed working too and
an i5 550 so the CPU isn't that good
I'll have plans to probably change this
around to easy on but everything else is
pretty good I'll probably check out the
cases again I got to take all these
parts back to Australia and also there
were more desktop PC but they weren't
that good value for money there was a
$40 one that I probably would have taken
a gamble on just that it's so big
I thought the $30 PC was better value
and of course there was an X for a fork
or phenom CPU but they wanted $100 for
that setup so I think I pulled out the
best deals there and of course we're
going to hit the road now and go to
another hot off so let's get moving
so we just got out of the heart off and
that was a complete buff there was
nothing good there worth the money I
mean in the past they have picked up
some good deals from this place
especially on the junk shelf but this
time around it was just a bust I mean
they even had an audio interface there
that was just not worth your money I
mean you can pick this up on Amazon
pretty much near brand-new condition for
an extra 15 bucks I mean some of those
old desktop PCs I believe we're even
there from the last time I did a part
time there so some old dinosaur cases
that were just not worth the money a few
t-rex's even but they had a massive
cosmos case the old version of the
cosmos I believe Kula mites are updating
this case it was good to see that even
though of course it was overpriced there
and the desktop PCs that were guaranteed
working were just a complete ripoff - I
even found a PSP there that just wasn't
worth the money I mean it was 3000 yen
it was a good price because I wanted to
load some custom firmware up but I tried
the bottoms out and they would just
messed up so I decided not to buy
anything from there and now we're
actually at the next hard off so we're
going to go into this place see if
they've got any deals because in this
one here I have picked up in the past
the $5 League of Legends PC so let's go
in and check it out
so we just got out of this hot off and
it was kind of like a semi bust I mean
there could have been some good deals
had they had had the advertised parts in
the actual build
there was an i7 2670 a gigabytes of RAM
but when I pulled out the parts to have
a look it was like there was no RAM in
there someone had already stolen the
memory out of this build and then
besides that was actually a really good
builder than i7 on a p55 motherboard
going for around about $100 now
generally I probably would have picked
this up but I don't have enough luggage
I've only got 40 kilos that I'm allowed
to bring back to Australia and of course
10 of that will be suitcase and closed
so I've kind of got a micro what I'm
bringing back and with that I want to
bring back the really good deal then
there's another case there that was
going for around $80 in an ABI think it
is enclosure all feel really good but
upon pulling it out the motherboard
which is a p55 BIOS though all the pins
were just completely screwed I was like
I kind of even asked them like guys why
are you even selling this motherboard
it's pretty much worthless but it is in
the junk section so it is justified and
one thing if you guys are going to buy
junk parts do check them out before you
buy them especially if they're in the
boxes as well because yeah if you get
something like that and then you find
out all the pins are bent you're in for
a rough time you pretty much got hosed
but they did have a keyboard which was
mechanical blue switches with
backlighting for around $15 with a wrist
rest it was a full 109 keyboard really
good deal if you were looking for a
keyboard on a budget so that one had it
I just don't need any keyboards at the
moment but I would have picked that up
they also had an 80/20 35 microphone
that was a pretty good deal for around
$80 as well or at least a couple of
years ago was still a good deal they
also had some desktop PCs that were
working but we're a little bit expensive
as well so ultimately it was kind of a
mess especially for someone like me who
wants to get those real good deals
but without said let's get on to the
next destination
miss me love
okay so we just got out of PC depot and
I'll put it on the map I don't actually
know what part of town it is it's just
in Chiba and this one has some really
good deals on CPUs they didn't have
really any motherboards or anything like
that I did pick up in the past the
20-dollar motherboards from here at z77
that was an absolute bargain but this
time around they had a 3770k going for
around a hundred dollars so of course
I've just picked that one up right now
they've got another 3770k there for
about a hundred and ten dollars or ten
dollars more it comes with the cooler I
didn't need the cooler and they had a
5820k for about two hundred dollars I
was about to pick this one up until they
said that I had to pay tax on this one
and not on the 3770k so very odd dilemma
I think they said because they
discounted the 5820k so much already
that they weren't going to put take off
tax because I think they actually don't
take off the tax here unless they mark
down the price a little bit it's just
them being really nice so it's a weird
dilemma but they definitely have some
really good CPUs there and I would have
pulled the trigger on more of those
deals except I do have to budget a bit
of my money here for the rest of the
trip I would have probably bought a 2500
K for about $70 as well I'm probably
bought that other 3770k and that 5820k
if money wasn't a limit but anyway guys
you know where this place is if you want
to get a deal on the CPUs and you're in
Japan this place it's still got them
here and I'm going to head around to the
next hot off now with a hot on so this
hot off behind me is generally a bust
and this time was no different I went in
there and the prices were shocking and
really the only reason I go here is
because it's so close to the other PC
depo it's like a five minute drive so I
think I'm going to stop coming here
actually because the prices this time
were worse than they've ever been before
I think they wanting like $200 for the
same CPU that I just picked up for like
a hundred dollars the desktop PCs
weren't that good at all they were
really like a boss I mean some of the
parts in there once
good and the prices they were charging
we're just a ripoff they had some
dinosaurs in there and usually I would
go dinosaur hunting it's just that I've
been dinosaur hunting in this place
before and the PCs and site advisors
just been filthy or they've just had
really really old parts in there so and
also they had a PSP for $30 as well and
I was going to try it out but then I
realized the color that they had it in
was like the worst color and I'm not big
on cosmetics but man if I pulled this
PSP out in public I would be embarrassed
with this color but anyway we'll keep
hunting and we'll find something good
pretty soon so we just got out of the
last hard off that we're going to visit
before we head back to our hometown in
our hometown we've got a few places to
check out but we just got all these
places out the way because there's a
further and if time permitted we
wouldn't have time to see the local ones
which we can check out later but in this
place it was a bus for PC park there was
like a queue 9550 old school LG a 7m
five quad core system in there but that
was going for around about $80 besides
that though I did find a $2 tripod and I
thought I had left to try put at my
friend's house here's the guy who I gave
my job to I thought I'd left a tripod
there but I actually didn't or at least
maybe his missus chucked it out or
something but we couldn't find it so
yeah picked up a really cheap tripod but
two bucks so I can just leave it
whenever I come to Japan I can do a bit
of b-roll on the g7 or on whatever
camera I bring over but this place
Dameon my friend also picked up some ice
cream maker as well so there was some
cool little novelty things here that
we're going for a pretty good price but
in terms of the actual PC parts there
was just nothing here this time but
let's get to our hometown and see if
there's anything good there
now just got back home from all this
used parts hunting and even on the way
home stopped off at a place called
wonder X this is a place end in local
town of Tor Ghana where I'm currently
staying at and I managed to pick up a PS
Vita for about 65 US dollars and
apparently this models got the OLEDs
screen on it it's a really good model to
get so I was really happy that I picked
up for $65 now does have the firmware on
it three point six five or something so
I have to use a thing called VHDL but
basically I wanted something to play
some old retro games when I'm on the
plane and also watch some movies and
this thing looks like it's going to be
perfect for doing that apparently it's a
lot better than the PSP - so really good
pick up a 65 bucks now all those other
pick ups that we picked up today wow
they were incredible I mean probably the
best deal was the 3770k we got that for
$100 that was an absolute bargain we got
all those other parts of the other
stores the motherboards the two CPUs at
the first place the hard drive power to
play even picked up that motherboard
with two broken pins and I found out
that cz 68 motherboard from a Zeus so it
should be able to run the 3770k if I get
it to work and if I BIOS update it so
the one thing I do regret is not picking
up those CPUs at PC Jeff I mean they had
that 3770k they're going for ten dollars
more that was still a really good deal
they had the twenty five hundred K and
the 5820k all gone for good prices
though again I just don't have the
budget at the moment to do that I didn't
bring enough cash to go buy a lot of
things that I would have bought had I'd
been living here because as you may or
may not know Ashley came here with the
main directive to see my little boy my
little son staying in Japan at the
moment and I'm just spending a lot of
time with him he's loving it I'm loving
it and I've got only a couple of days
off where I don't see him and this is
when I'm making these parts vlogs for
you guys and also you may be wondering
what's going on with Verizon 3 I
actually did get
the CPUs like a week earlier before the
NDA lifts however I couldn't get out any
results as I had already scheduled to
come over and see my little boys
unfortunately I didn't get a day 1
review I will be getting the comparisons
coming to you guys and also a pretty
cool build coming with rising 3 so I
look forward to giving you guys that as
I'm sure you'd want to see how it stacks
up against other CPUs like the G 4560
and also the risin 5 1,400 so I look
forward to bringing you guys that
comparison I'll maybe test it with like
a gtx 1070 or like a mid-range graphics
card because i think that's where that 4
core is going to be coupled with in a
lot of gaming pcs and even productivity
pcs and now there's also something else
that i wanted to talk about because in
the previous used parts pc hunt that i
did some people in the comments got
actually pretty upset with the little
snippet of video that I took of this
chick sleeping on a bus and now if some
people think that it's disrespectful for
the Japanese culture and really there
was a lot of Japanese people on this bus
and I've lived in Japan for quite a
while man if they're all looking at me
and staring at me with cold eyes I know
that I'm being real disrespectful but
actually there was a Japanese guy beside
me who is laughing his ass off and even
then if it's disrespectful to the
culture you've got this argument of
culture versus law and now if that's the
case you could say that even Japanese
people are being disrespectful to their
own culture a lot of the times because
there's a classical argument of a place
that I used to live in called cassia
City and the train line there had a line
called the jaw Bahnson and now the jaw
bond sin when the send just means train
line in the jaw bonds the name so it's
the jewel bond train line had this
little dilemma where there was a
Japanese salary man that's just guys who
go to work all day and then come home
they were jumping on the train and just
getting some cheap drinks from the
convenience stores and just having a
laugh you know they'll just laughing
having fun talking to each other and a
lot of people found that disrespectful
they thought it was rude they didn't
like it and I was on this train a lot of
the times I had to go to work and I
witnessed this a lot of the times and
although saw was a few dudes just
drinking on the train having fun
probably had a long day's work
got to go home to a nagging wife and all
those sort of this might only be their
opportunity to have a bit of fun in
their day so what I saw is just a couple
of dudes not breaking any laws and just
having a bit of fun they weren't getting
in anyone's grill they weren't offending
anyone those doing their own thing and
there's this cultural thing like should
you be the guy who follows something
that some rule that some guy made 500
years ago now he's dead do you have to
follow those rules is that one thing you
have to do like there's this other thing
in Japan that it's really rude to eat
and that's an old tradition that's
really not really relevant today a lot
of people just walk on the street and
eat now because the they don't care
about this cultural rule so I think it's
fine to eat if you're in a hurry and
you've got to go somewhere I think it's
fine to walk a knee I don't see a
problem with it so guys that's just my
opinion on it there's the laws there
they're the boundaries you live within
them as long as you're not breaking the
law you're not doing anything bad in my
eyes I mean sure there are cultural
traditions which I'm sure a lot of
people do respect and in many ways I do
respect a lot of Japanese traditions and
now we're living in the digital age
everyone's got a smartphone that has
video capabilities I mean everyone's
taking videos everywhere
I got memed five years ago and I mean I
don't really care it's just I'm sure I
gave a lot of people in the world or
laughs I didn't even know someone took
this photo of me they actually
photoshopped a massive beer in there and
made me and I just saw I was laughing I
mean it's providing people a laugh but
it goes it's a touchy subject that could
go on for hours and hours and there are
good points on both sides of the fence
however that said we'll get back to the
used parts hunting which in this case
there's one more Avenue if you are in
Japan that you can hit up the use PC
parts and that is the online auctions
now there are some other auctions that
has become popular my friend says
there's one on a smartphone he uses but
for me the yahoo auctions have always
been gold for picking up bargains now
I've actually bought I actually got to
PayPal my friends and money but he got
me a 9 X 58 motherboards and we got
these for like $70 a pop so really cheap
I even bought 6 X 58 d Zeus motherboards
and now my friend he actually wants
three of these as I said to him look
dude you could get these for 70 bucks
and easily flip them
for like 150 160 bucks you've got other
people selling I'm actually selling them
for $200 so he was like really got the
doorbell actually speaking of auctions
that was the postman he just delivered a
UA for FX this is a mic preamp I bought
one of these for Steve from hardware
unboxed because they generally go for
$200 plus in the US or Australia and in
Japan young boom up like $60 now they've
got essentially onboard effects like an
onboard a compressor and 48 volt power
in a nutshell they're really good for
the money and they beat out a lot of
traditional prints in that they have
those extra options to turn your mic on
the fly but anyways back to auctions in
Japan if you want to shop online like
the Yahoo auctions you will most likely
need a friend who lives here or already
have a yahoo account created because in
order to buy things I think you have to
get certified or registered with your
address and so you'd want to get that
organized before you come to Japan if
you did want to buy things off the Yahoo
auction which I highly recommend you can
get some really good deals not just on
those x58 motherboards but a lot of
other things like use power supplies and
of course shopping around outside of
Tokyo is highly recommended if you want
to get some really good deals on use
price performance parts in Tokyo itself
of course the new parts are always
really good value for money so I can
highly recommend that if you want to
build something like the Mini ITX rig
that I just built recently but
all-in-all I think I've hit up all the
avenues here in the limited amount of
time that I have and I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and if you did
then be sure to give that like button a
big smash for us and I'll look forward
to reading your comments as always and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
they're back on moon red girl mare
excuse me sir
but would you happen to have a this is
pretty cool this actually came with a 32
gigabyte memory card and a looks like a
SIM card but you can insert into the PSP
Vita I never knew this thing could take
a SIM card so maybe I could just get rid
of my smartphone and use the PSP as a
phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
