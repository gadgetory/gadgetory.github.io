about a new amazing level of microphone
and it's going to be my new lab Mike
from here on this is the noise one from
a company called nice labs
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
check yes city this is Brian come back
to you guys today was a quick review of
this lavalier microphone from nice labs
and I'm also going to do a quick shoot
out and compare it to these two Sony
lavalier microphones which I actually
really like however that being said
going on forward this is going to be the
new level ear microphone that's going to
be giving you guys audio on the majority
of my videos and let me explain why so
when I first got asked to review this
microphone I looked at the website and
immediately I was like what I've got to
get this thing I saw that it had a 10
mil diaphragm and what this means is
going to capture your voice a lot more
we'll give it a lot more warmth and get
a lot more of a natural tone coming out
of it then something with a smaller
diaphragm say these Sony's that I have
here also as well when I've got the
product in I was like wow this is
actually a really well-built products
got an all-metal construction has a pop
filter built in and it's also got the
right specs for recording on things like
iPhones and if you get a splitter you
can record like I'm doing now and that's
just direct to your camera that's right
i'm recording directly to my camera
which is known to have a pretty bad ADC
anyway so back on to the microphone
itself it costs around 60 USD and that's
including shipping the one thing you
will get out of this microphone that
you're not getting out with the cheaper
microphone is just simply a good product
it's better than the Sony's and with
that being said we'll quickly do a sound
test right now unedited and you guys can
listen on your headphones or your
speakers so first up will do the nice
one from nice labs this is how it sounds
with unedited at about a volume level of
25 going into my camera so that's one
fourth on the volume on the recording
volume level now let's change over to
the Sony lavalier microphone the single
diaphragm microphone and then we'll
change over to the stereo and then we'll
go to the camera audio for you guys okay
so first up here we've got the Sony ECM
sp10 this is a smartphone lavalier
microphone though as I said before you
can just get a splitter and then you can
split it to a normal three prong and you
can use it on your normal devices and
you're probably wondering why I didn't
review this microphone and that's
because it was pretty much I thought it
didn't differ too much from the stereo
microphone but let's switch over to that
now
so this is the sony ECM cs3 here's what
this will sound like now this is
actually a stereo microphone that I've
raved about in the past that's about
fifteen dollars and man for the money it
is impressive so this is what this
sounds like also in editing software you
can change it to mono if you so wish so
this is a great microphone in its own
right however let's move over now to the
camera onboard camera audio and as you
can see here this is what the camera
audio sounds like compared to any
lavalier microphone so with that being
said will quickly go over the conclusion
for you guys and we'll talk about the
nice one a little bit not more a little
bit more so in conclusion I can't help
but be nothing but really impressed with
this product the build quality is really
good it looks sleek it's black it's just
a simple design it looks awesome now
that the 10 mil diaphragm on this thing
sounds awesome well that's when I did
proce production editing I thought this
lavalier microphone was getting some of
the best audio I've ever heard in my
life coming out of a microphone for
sixty dollars like are you kidding me so
you probably think it will six dollars
less expensive for a microphone but not
one of this quality so this is the new
microphone that you guys are going to be
hearing all the audio from my videos
from so I really put my hats off to nice
labs if you guys are in the market for a
phenomenal lavalier microphone and
you've got sixty dollars then I would
say look no further go get one of these
things because I mean look I'm moving
around and I don't really hear any like
I've tested it before it's like
vibrations and stuff it doesn't suck
that into the noise either so it's
really good I'm really impressed I'm
going to be giving this product of five
out of five stars because i'm just that
impressed with it especially since it's
coming from an independent company too
it's great that it's not one of these
mainstream products that we've always
hear about like you know your sony
microphone or a rode microphone it's
just great to see a company that i've
never heard about before makes such a
phenomenal product so anyway that's it
for today guys and the great thing about
this review as well as you can hear it
for yourselves I don't need to tell you
how good this product is in this review
necessarily because you guys who get
your headphones you can put them on
and here how good this thing sounds so
you guys I hope you enjoyed this review
if you did please give it a thumbs up if
you have any questions about the noise
one from nice labs then drop a comment

description below and yeah that's about
it for today stay tuned for another tech
video peace out for now bait a headphone
itself they've gone with a 14 millimeter
driver here they call it the Borak
speaker system and it's actually legit
like it sounds</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
