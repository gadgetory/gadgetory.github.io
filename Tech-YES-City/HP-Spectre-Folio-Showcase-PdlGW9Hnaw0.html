I love desktops.
They are the bread and butter
in terms of what content
I make for you guys.
But sometimes I need to be mobile.
Whether it be getting deals
or helping out others,
or even testing out mice
with other YouTubers,
I still need to be connected.
I need efficiency.
I need speed.
I need power.
And most importantly, I need portability.
So here we have a solution.
Meet my new best friend, the HP Spectre,
which is an 8th gen Intel
Core Processor-based PC.
Let's take this thing for a test drive.
(energizing music)
This thing is a beast.
It features an i7-8500Y Intel processor.
And in this device, in particular
supports 16GB of DDR SO-DIMM RAM built in
and has a 500 GB SSD,
packed into something
smaller than a magazine
and lighter than a
two-liter bottle of water.
This is where the
portability factor comes in.
I mean, I even built a
mini-IGX desktop recently
that although has God-like specs in it,
I sometimes need to quickly get up and go.
And I need something smaller
that still has Windows 10 on it
for my programs.
So the HP Spectre is a perfect fit.
It has a touch screen that
actually doesn't suck either.
I can multi-task two
hands with this thing.
Or if I find myself in a tighter spot,
like an airplane, for example,
then I can turn this thing into a tablet
where I can still watch
all my favorite movies
by just simply heading over
to the Microsoft Store,
downloading Netflix, and away we go.
Or if I wanna check out Ozzy
Streamers having a crack,
then I can do that too.
Though given how small
this thing actually is,
and of course given that
it's not a gaming PC,
it still doesn't stop me form trying it
with a few different games.
With the upgraded HD 615 Graphics onboard,
it can still do some
light gaming on the go.
Though if the touchscreen isn't
giving me the frags I need,
then I can use the Type C USB Converter
and still plug in a standard gaming mouse
and get some frags.
As for the always connected aspect,
how do we stay connected
to the internet anywhere?
Well, here's where the
device has an eSIM built in.
So you can use this like a
mobile phone if you want to,
or have it connect to 4G LTE internet
with the in-built gigabit LTE adapter.
Without having to ever pop a
SIM card in, though of course
there is still room for a SIM card
if your local network providers
still don't support eSIM technology yet.
For me personally however,
I can now do things
like my accounting on the
go, snap digital receipts
with the in-built camera,
talk to friends and
take business calls via Skype on the fly.
Though with all this fancy talk,
let's put some of these
claims to the test.
(calming music)
So there it is.
Absolutely incredible performance
in something that is 6.9 mm thin
and is extremely lightweight.
This model in particular also has
genuine leather integrated
into the laptop itself.
And the build quality
all around is phenomenal.
The keyboard and the
touchscreen work flawlessly.
And I know for business
and pleasure on the go,
this tool will end up
saving me a lot of time
and headaches and just make
life easier in general.
If you want something, or you're like me,
crave something that is much
faster than a lot of laptops,
much smaller than a desktop,
and has the best connectivity in the world
of any portable device,
then all you have to do
is ask for 8th gen Intel 4G
LTE when you are on the lookout
for something like this.
And you will now be on
your way to a better life
without seeing the
low-battery-go-connect-me-soon warning.
Though, let us know
below, in the comments,
what you think of laptops in general.
I think this is what
laptops are supposed to be:
small, portable, but
still packing a punch.
If you wanna know more about laptops
with 8th gen Intel inside,
then I'll put some links
in the description below.
And with that aside,
I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon.
Peace out for now. But.
