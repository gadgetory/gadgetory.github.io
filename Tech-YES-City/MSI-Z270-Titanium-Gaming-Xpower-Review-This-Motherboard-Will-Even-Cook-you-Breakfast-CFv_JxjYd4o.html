going to overclock your cpu but in an
alternate reality it could cook your
breakfast do your ironing and clean your
dishes this is the Z 270 X power gaming
titanium motherboard from MSI that has
so much to offer not just for people who
want 24/7 stay below Glocks but also for
extreme overclockers that want to take
their cpu to the brink or even higher
welcome back to tech city this is brand
coming to you guys today with a review
of one of MSI's most premium
motherboards out there the X power
gaming titanium now as the name suggests
MSI have gone with a silver and black
thing with this board that honestly
isn't just looks like I mean sporting
what looks like a 17 phase VRM with
Infineon IR 355 power stages that are
rated at 60 amps some of the best out
there MSI zone s FC 60 amp chokes and
complete solid state titanium capacitors
this is sure to even impress the most
nitpicky of overclockers the cpu power
connectors can be charged by an
additional 4 pin after the 8 pin to make
it at 12 pins in total this ultimately
enabled me to take my 7700 k to 4.9
gigahertz at 1.3 2 volt I did get the
7700 K to 5 gigahertz though the
temperatures were nearing 100 degrees
the 7600 K however was able to get all
the way up to a whopping 5.1 gigahertz
on this motherboard at one point four
zero 5 volts though it did crash Midway
during a Cinebench test however it was
able to complete a run at 5 gigahertz at
one point 3 9 volt also when testing
this board for 3 hours plus of 4.6
gigahertz the temperatures of the vrm
only went slightly above 40 degrees in a
30 degree ambient environment and when
looking at the UEFI boss has two modes
simple and advanced and after sifting
through their bias it was very
impressive and easy to use with custom
fan settings overclocking profiles and
also the ability to automatically
overclock your cpu with the knob on the
motherboard or in the boss itself I
found that the level 8 setting was just
right with the CPU and this time around
when using the level 8 setting it
surprisingly found the 7,700 case sweet
spot overclock of 4.9 gigahertz at 1.32
volt this was shocking into really
surprised me this was right where I had
found the 4.9 gigahertz stable overclock
myself it goes to show how far automatic
overclocking has actually
damn impressive job and if this keeps up
and guys like me no longer going to be
useful anymore
moving on with the board there are four
ddr4 memory slots to support over clocks
up to 4000 megahertz in total and just
above that is a BIOS flash button the
memory slots feature is steel armor
plating the strength and supports and
also helps reduce electromagnetic
interference not that you should be
holding mobile phones close to your ear
and stuff like that though this armor is
also featured on PCIe slots where there
are four sixteen speed and also two one
speed slots though I found the top slot
was not able to be used if you have a
big cooler like an actual u 40s that I
have here which was vertically mounted
so I had to mount it horizontally in
order to fit a card in the first slot
there is also a 6 pin pound connected
there to provide extra juice to the PCIe
lanes should you decide to four-way
crossfire or two-way SLI these cards on
this motherboard near that there are
three MDOT two slots where the mid point
has a dedicated shield eight side of
three ports two of which face vertically
and are powered by an as-needed chipset
and another six which are powered by z2
70 chipset also powered by this is a
dedicated u dot 2 port and on that note
all the storage devices connected by the
z2 70 chipset are able to be mixed and
matched with native support from Intel's
new obtain raid driver looking further
around the board there are six four pin
headers with one of those ports having
dedicated support for a water pump below
that there is a horizontally mounted USB
3 front out my favorite and then moving
along you have an RGB out for external
control of RGB lights from this
motherboard a two-pin slowmode connector
to pin overclocked retrack connector
power reset and manual gain boost knobs
for test benches and on that note there
is an overclock panel included which can
be attached to the top of the board for
more on the flight changes even in
Windows this is usually designed for
liquid-nitrogen overclockers and there
is a port there for the manual external
voltage point readouts and checking
they're moving back to the bottom of the
board you can get an extendable USB card
which can take two USB front outs and
convert them into four with the option
of being powered by a molex connector
there is also four USB to front outs
from two headers an additional USB 3
vertically mounted header one TPM and
Thunderbolt adding connections one clear
CMOS jumper and located around there is
three PCI cease fire switches which can
quickly cut off PCIe ports and also a
bar selection switch which supports dual
bars another feature down the bottom is
a digital readout which can help
diagnose boot problems and also when a
normal use helps readout you
CPU package temperature moving on to the
onboard audio which is called the audio
boost for it features the realtek LC
1220 codec which has excellent levels of
low crosstalk and the volume has plenty
enough for headphone users the audio
files may want to get a dedicated amp
for some hard to drive higher impedance
headphones as for the microphone here is
a test of what it should sound like
here's a quick volume test on the msi Zi
270 X power gaming titanium mic input
with a V motor boom Pro this is at a
volume level of 60 with a 10 decibel
gain there looking at the rear input and
output you get a hdmi and displayport
out one ps2 3 USB 2 ports 2 of which
have a thousand Hertz needed polling and
the other which can be used to hot flash
of bars below that there is a clear CMOS
button a USB 3.1 and 3.1 C inputs and an
additional 4 USB 3 ports testing out the
USB 3 speeds also showed no problems at
all
the audio has support for 5.1 analog out
optical out for 7.1 and then just above
that there is an Intel I - one 9v and
Intel - one 180 and I sees with land
teaming technology which can utilize
both the port's that combine their
processing power into one to help reduce
taxing the CPU and online CPU bound
games how to actually really test this
for a significant difference I don't
know though also included is a one-year
license of xsplit gamecaster which is
what I currently use to stream the
weekly tech show great piece of software
and also what the fastener hemic audio
panel MSI gaming lantern dragon eye apps
are included - with dedicated support
for VR devices with MSI's VR readyboost
which actually dedicates a USB port for
stabilization and extra power there also
a heap of other handy apps and drivers
included on this DVD and you also get
accessories and a lot of them we're
talking clear side of three cables
labels all the accessories that you've
seen in this b-roll as well is included
with this motherboard to match that of
the theme - so here we are with the
verdict this board is just packed to the
max I really couldn't think of any more
I'd want from a motherboard other than
it just overclocking everything for me
on its own well it practically almost
did that with the 7700 K I have here
which was extremely impressive and
everything on this board from the vrm to
the
features to the audio to the massive
amount of expandability to the 1000
Hertz polling rates and to the included
software to the dual NoCs
just impress me I mean this is a
top-tier board and one that is designed
for people who either want the best out
of their gear or want to go crazy with
extreme overclocks and at 370 USD or
around 550 AUD it is certainly priced
high but again it is a premium product
that certainly delivers for its intended
market and I know I could probably build
an awesome used PC for less than this
whole motherboard itself but again
different strokes for different folks
anyways that's about it from the Z 270x
power gaming titanium from MSI if you
like this video then be sure to hit that
like button let me know in the comment
section below what do you think of a
motherboard as huge as this would love
to hear your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in the next
tag video very soon peace out for now
