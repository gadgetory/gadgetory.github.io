a lot of talk that there could be a
possibility of a repeat of 2017 and
that's when a lot of popular gaming
graphics cards was sold out of retailers
you couldn't get any stock especially at
MSRP prices and we even saw certain GPUs
pretty much double in price to what
you'd be used to paying after that we
saw a massive crash and of course there
was a lot of used mind graphics cards on
the market where you could get really
good deals but there is with the recent
price surge of Bitcoin a new fear that
GPUs especially gaming graphics cards
could be at risk of being sold out again
so today we're going to talk about this
possibility and actually scary enough
I've done a bit of research and there is
one possibility I can see happening
where gaming graphics cards could be in
another frenzy like we saw in 2017 but
there's also a lot going against it so
let's discuss both sides and then you
guys can be the judge on what you think
is going to happen so graphics cards
like this the gtx 1660 TI and also i'm
going to point in to the equation the
gtx 1660
which would be probably the most
relevant mid-range GPUs for most gamers
are these at risk of being sold out well
at the moment no and the reason why is
if we go over to a website for instance
what to mind calm it will give you how
much profit you can earn per day if you
were to start mining cryptocurrency on a
graphics card like this so now just to
replicate a scenario on what a typical
at-home miner would get I'm gonna put in
10 gtx 660ti since these are currently
the most efficient graphics card on the
market in terms of power efficiency so
that usually will translate into the
most efficient mining cards which is
what unfortunately miners also demand
just like gamers miners also need to
keep the power down even more so because
generally those graphics cards are being
mined 24 hours a day so on this website
we've got 10 gtx 660ti s we've also got
10 cents a kilowatt-hour which in real
estimates is actually pretty
conservative for instance in Australia
I'd say the average price would be
around 20 cents US per kilowatt-hour so
this is actually pretty low we can see
that we're only earning even on altcoins
about $8 profit per day which isn't a
whole lot if we move down to a
cryptocurrency like a theorem for
example which is what most people would
ideally want to be mining because we'll
talk about it soon basically there's
been this whole altcoin craze that's ran
through in 2017 which I honestly see is
a more desirable cryptocurrency for
miners to mine then for sainu olt coins
that are starting up and reason being is
that the whole cryptocurrency market
already went through a whole old coin
phase in 2017 and what we've seen with
trends is that bitcoin is still the most
dominant cryptocurrency and in fact
recent trends suggests that bitcoin is
actually surging further ahead in price
than all the other crypto currencies so
now basically taking into account ten
gtx 660ti s it would take that
particular person at ten cents a
kilowatt-hour approximately seven
hundred and sixty seven days to get
their return on investment which is
nearly two years so at the current rates
on the market for mining
cryptocurrencies with gaming GPUs it
just really isn't that viable not to
mention that your hardware could burn
out in that time and there's also extra
augmented costs involved things like
managing this mining set up potential
blowouts extra gear needed like ddr4
memory a CPU and a motherboard as well
as an extra power supply to power ten of
these graphics cards so at this point in
time it's not really ideal for someone
to go out and buy gtx 660ti s and use
them for mining cryptocurrency however
here is where the big curveball comes
into play that cryptocurrency that we
spoke of aetherium
it's actually had some talks and even
submissions into making that
cryptocurrency
what is known as anti assic because at
the moment aetherium is currently an
asset controlled mining environment and
that is they have application Pacific
integrated circuits which are dedicated
to mining that cryptocurrency and this
essentially means a lot better
efficiency than something like a gtx
660ti since that hardware is dead
catered towards mining that
cryptocurrency now this is what has
ideally been keeping a lot of the gaming
graphics cards and their cost down is
the asset miners have moved in and made
the gaming GPUs irrelevant for mining
cryptocurrency another two examples of
this is also Z cash and Xen cash a
cryptocurrency that I used to follow
heavily they are now asset controlled so
what was once mined with GPUs is now
being mined with asacs however the
recent submission with the theorem if it
gets approved could see the assic miners
are no longer viable to mine this
cryptocurrency and so if this scenario
were to happen then put it quite simply
it would be 2017 all over again where
people be rushing out to get gaming
gravis cards and start mining aetherium
because the profits and return on
investment would be so good now the
asacs are no longer competing with
gaming GPUs now here's where I need your
help in the audience do you think this
submission will be approved from the
research I'm seeing that it's currently
sort of being delayed and I'm not sure
if big companies like bit main and
especially all their clients would be
happy with this approval going through
since there is a lot of money and I mean
an absolute ton of money in the whole
asset business in terms of the hardware
site they're selling the new hardware
they're making profits and whether or
not they work with the cryptocurrency
market to keep it a success if ik but
one thing I do know for certain is in
2017 a lot of gamers got screwed over on
GPU prices when there was suddenly a
demand from miners so now in closing out
this video we've got two sides of the
argument here we've got old-school GPU
miners that want to keep mining with
their graphics cards and they don't want
to see a sixth ache over the market but
then you've got typical gamers
especially with the Zen to launch coming
up for example that will want to build a
new PC get one GPU and just start
playing games and I'm sure and I speak
on behalf of a lot of these guys is that
we don't want this whole scenario that
we saw in 2017 to happen again where the
gaming graphics card prices were just
absolutely absurd furthermore I don't
know if Nvidia would be too keen for
this to happen again
as when we saw the crypto glut this
actually affected their stock prices
big-time with the stock almost having in
as little as three months so be
interesting to see how this whole thing
plays out but anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button also let us
know in the comments section below do
you think these beloved gaming GPUs are
at risk love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon but
if you want to see these tech videos at
the moment they drop sub button also
ring the bell
it's just down there and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
