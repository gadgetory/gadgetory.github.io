that is supposed to offer a nice balance
between price and performance though is
with all things yes let's take a look at
this board and whether it is really
worth your money
welcome back to tech city and let's take
a look at this vrm you get an 8 plus for
phase power design sporting c no power
SM for 336 low side MOSFETs and SM for
337 high side MOSFETs that are rated at
40 and 35 amps at 100 degrees Celsius
respectively chokes are rated at 45 amps
and the KFOR features 12 K solid state
capacitors there are four dimm slots
capable of supporting up to 64 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory and currently XMP
profiles were not working with this
mainboard and the maximum I could get my
memory too with speeds of 20 400
megahertz with 1t command timings
however there was no option to change
the command rates which is important for
getting higher memory overclock
especially past 3 gigahertz unreasonable
voltages the vrm heatsink itself was
getting quite hot I measured it at about
63 degrees on the sink after 20 minutes
divided 54 at 3.85 gigahertz on my 1700
X this was unfortunately the max I can
take this CPU to at one point three five
six volts and the CPU although booting
would not work at higher frequencies
ironically enough cross testing my
overclocks with others showed that this
seems to be about the voltage sweet spot
for these CPUs on 24/7 overclock and the
k4 fatality handled that absolutely fine
the onboard audio is quite simply
exceptional with minus 90 decibel levels
of crosstalk the lowest I've seen yet
and features the ALC 1220 codec with 7.1
surround support and the mic input as
usual on a throg board is quite solid
with low noise I'll let you guys have a
listen there is a quick mic in test on
the X 370 gaming k4 motherboard with AV
mode of boom pro microphone plug
directly into the mic in port with a
volume level of 50 and a plus 10
decibels there are 2 m2 nvme PCI
slots that support native booting and to
pcie 3.0 still pleated 16 speed slots of
support SLI or crossfire there is also a
full 24 PCIe land connectivity available
on this board with the options for an
extra 4 PCIe 1 speed slots and beside a
connectivity you get 6 side of 3 slots
that can be put into a raid array
there's also three USB 2 and 2 USB 3
front outs
5 fan headers with one being a dedicated
water pump header a TPM connector a
doctor debug bias readout HD audio and
comport headers and three LED
connections there is only a single box
on this board and looking in the BIOS
menu just like any Azeroth board there
is a lot of features here with the
ability to manually overclock peace
states which are essentially like your C
States but you can program them the way
you want to with different voltages and
clock speeds this is where I really like
to set in over clocks manually to take
advantage of the cool and quiet features
if your processor is not being stressed
there is also options to disable and
enable many of the features on this
board so there is no option to save your
overclocking profiles which was a pity
you can however change memory timings
and even attempt to enable XMP profiles
looking near the rear of the board there
is also the option for a wireless module
that can be connected via an m2 slot
which the module is not included with
the motherboard further down there is
two ps2 ports HDMI out six USB 3 ports
which one is a finality Mouse port for a
thousand Hertz polling one USB 3.1 and
one Thunderbolt connector below that is
your standard audio an optical jack and
an rj45 port for the Intel I to 190 NIC
so verdict time and the gaming case for
is a solid motherboard coming in at 145
USD or 220 AUD and that even includes a
dank RGB LED on the X 370 chipset
heatsink which I know you guys all love
though giggles aside it features a
decent vrm in good onboard audio
solution and of course a fast intel i to
119 neck it is this combo that will
certainly keep gamers happy though the
vrm still doesn't feature mosfet as good
as the higher cloth
Taichi which is also more expensive and
overclocking is really hard without a
clear CMOS button especially on an
entirely new architecture which makes me
recommend this ball
to people who just want to get a risin
are 70p you a good cooler and just slap
it on and let the auto overclocking do
its thing
in other words this motherboard will be
a great solution for those turbo noobs
just getting into tax or people who
couldn't be bothered overclocking hey
guys if you enjoy this video be sure to
hit that like button and if you dislike
the view I'm sure to pop a dislike down
there and let me know in the comment
section below what you think of the as
rock X 370 gaming k4 motherboard is it
going to be your X 370 motherboard of
choice would love to hear your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace now for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
