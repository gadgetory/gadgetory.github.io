knock Shores D 15 s which is the updated
model of the D 15 ladies and gentlemen
welcome back to tech es city this is
brian coming back to you guys today with
the second knock shoe Akula review a
very recent now I tested the D 15 and
honestly a lot of what applies with this
review today will be exactly the same as
the D 15 so if you want to go watch that
video I'll put the link somewhere here
where you can go click on it and check
it out but I'll quickly save time with
this review sirs essentially these
coolers are exactly the same thing
except the base plate has been shifted
to allow this to fit an X 99 platform
with ease without hitting that first 16
speed graphics port which is mainly
where everyone wants to be installing
their GPUs especially if they only have
one however there is one caveat to
getting the D 15 s over the D 15 and
that is that it does come with one less
fan in my opinion this is a negative
since these 140 millimeter fans that
came with the D 15 were absolutely
kick-ass they pushed a lot of it and
they did so whilst being very low in the
noise Department so now we'll quickly go
over a glance of the features of the D
15 s then I'll move on to the benchmarks
and give you guys my subjective opinions
and thoughts on the D 15 s so now with
the D 15 s it's just like any natural
product fantastic build quality
fantastic unboxing experience comes
packaged so well you get mounting kits
there for both AMD and Intel you also
get future compatibility support from
nock Shore themselves in that if a
socket doesn't fit you can just email
them and they'll send you out the
respective bracket for free which is
absolutely amazing customer service in
my opinion now everything on this is
flush there's no sharp edges on the
cooler as well so diabetics will be home
and hosed king of the dimensions
themselves this cooler measures a
hundred and 61 millimeters wide by a
hundred and fifty millimeters long by a
hundred and sixty four millimeters tall
you've also got sixty four millimeters
of clearance therefore the RAM in both a
horizontal and vertical configuration
on all platforms looking at the base of
the unit itself however we've got a
mirror finish here which is
nickel-plated over copper and that
extends the copper heat pipes which are
also nickel-plated as well which are
then connected to all the aluminium fins
and this cooler weighs in at 1.15
kilograms with one fan attached as
opposed to the d15 which weighed in at
one point three kilograms with two fans
attached you also get extra fan Clips
there and a low-noise adapter as well as
nock Shuler's fantastic thermal paste
solution which does a very good job it
cools just as well as mx4 which is some
high-quality stuff included is also the
very well laid out manuals there for
installation which will allow even a
dummy to install this cooler Knox will
have also included a long Phillips head
screw driver there which will take
installation no time to install this
cooler at all
now moving on to the benchmarks this is
where all the business happens we've got
the 5820k at one point two five five
volt there at four point three gigahertz
at 22 degrees ambient temperatures and
we can see here that the NOC shouid e15
s with only one fan does lose out to the
gamers storm assassin and it comes close
to the Animax t 40 which is a $40 cooler
though keep in mind though when you put
the low noise adapter on there the look
the noise gets very low and this brings
the temps up to 82 degrees so low noise
freaks will be glad with the performance
of this cooler considering there's just
virtually no noise at all coming out
when you do put that low noise adapter
on there however it was important to
note that when I did add an additional
fan onto the D 15 s it did perform
exactly the same as the D 15 which
speaks lengths for noxious quality
control in that pretty much every D 15
coming out is performing identically and
they're machined very nicely onto the
skylight benchmark with my 6600 K
clocked at 4.6 ago that's at one point
three five volt we can see the D 15 s
here with one fan is doing a great job
it's cooling about the same as a T 40
though with the low noise adapter there
it is just making absolutely no noise
and still putting our decent temps
though when I did again put the
additional fan on there it performed
exactly the same as the D 15 so but the
six core and the four core will be kept
well under control with the D 15 s
though let's move on now to a conclusion
so overall in conclusion with the D 15 I
was very impressed just like the D 15 I
mean Knox was build quality and
attention to detail are just absolutely
amazing they are the best when it comes
to air cooling though one thing I was
disappointed though with the D 15 s is
that it only comes with one fan and I
think that the D 15 and what made it
king of the hill was the fact that it
did come with those two fans and they
are required for it to beat out all the
rest of the competition at least when I
did my benchmarks so it was a little bit
disappointed that it didn't come with
the extra fan there that the D 15 comes
with since they are I think the same
recommended retail price of 100 USD and
I'll let imagine a lot of people are
buying this for the six core
for solutions on the enthusiast platform
since it is a big and bad air core that
will do a great job though I'm glad to
say that it did alleviate that problem
of able to fit it horizontally on the
x99 platform so all in all I'm going to
be giving the D 15 s four and a quarter
stars out of five where it gain that
quarter of a staff for compatibility it
lost three-quarters of a staff for the
fact that it didn't come with two fans
and it was the two fans that made the D
15 king of the hill especially when it
came to beating out all the other air
coolers and it was that that I loved
about this cooler not only was knock she
was amazing build quality and attention
to detail there but also the performance
was there as well
so with the only with one fan it starts
to lose out that performance though keep
in mind though that the noise and we
will mention this with only one fan the
noise becomes extremely low and that's
the thing though for me personally with
two fans on full overclocks
and full load the d15 wasn't even noisy
so you would have to be an absolute
noise freak to need one fan on a low
noise adapter that's just my opinion but
it will be there it will accommodate
people because with a low noise adapter
on full load I mean I could hear
everything else over that cooler so
that's a very good thing on the noise
very low noise there with one fan
installed there one thing I will say the
knock shoe it is I like their Redux fans
as well so they've got the re Ducks fans
which essentially are uncoded fans and
you can spray them from the get-go
whatever color you like so I'd like to
see them maybe release a cooler with
just redux fans as well and also maybe
include an extra fan with the D 15 s
that's just a little bit of feedback but
I love this band I mean it's a hundred
dollars it is a little bit expensive and
if you do want it to be king of the hill
you will have to pay an extra twenty
dollars over the D 15 which was a
hundred dollars as well so anyway guys
that's about it I'd love to hear your
comments and feedback on the D 15 s in
the comment section below
and also if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
