have ever bought a hard drive you'll
know that Seagate are one of those
choices for those big chunky drives and
in fact I've got four of them in mine
ass at the moment and they have come a
long way over the last decade to the
point where I think their drives are
absolutely fine nowadays and I do
recommend them without hesitation but
how about their SSDs them getting into
the SSD market I think has been long
overdue they're competitive Western
Digital for example has gotten in a
couple of years ago and with that
they've been bringing some pretty solid
competition to the market
Seagate however especially with this SSD
is seeking to break into the mass market
though as with any tech yes city review
I'm not gonna beat you guys around the
bush we've got a 240 gigabyte version of
this stuff coming in 80 USD or in
Australia a hundred and forty three
Ozzie dollars it scales all the way to a
three point eight four terabyte drive
which is coming in at eight hundred and
eighty USD or in Australia fourteen
hundred and seventy nine and honestly if
you're an Aussie and you're in the
market for one of these then you'd be
much better off just buying from Newegg
directly however as you can see with
that pricing structure these drives are
coming in significantly more expensive
than otherwise cheap SSDs that are out
there in the market for instance you can
pick up 240 gigabyte SSD nowadays for
around 30 USD make this Drive nearly
three times more expensive than the
cheapest options out there though after
testing this thing pretty extensively
here in the studio this is where the
price difference of these drives does
start to make sense and that is the
actual consistency of the read and
writes themselves I haven't seen a line
this smooth in any test that I've ever
done on any SSD ever it's pretty much
just flat across the read and writes
which means that not only the read and
write algorithms Seagate are using in
these drives is phenomenal but also the
controller and all the other hardware in
between is also top-notch I believe
they're using the latest firmware
revision on an s10 fasten controller as
well as to shave a 64 layer NAND flash
banks for the actual storage itself
they've also got that attached
when an yo ddr3 burst Bank and in this
case since it is the 1.9 4 terabyte
model you do get two of those situated
on the PCB itself
speeds and inputs and outputs per second
are pretty good however it is limited by
side of three and when comparing it
against other drives around here
it's pretty much one of the norm in the
pack though the temperatures and the
build construction of this SSD are
pretty good and upon taking it apart I
was very surprised if you guys follow us
on Instagram then I did post a picture
of this and what was inside and it's
literally like they've gone away with
thermal pads and they've just used a
whole tube of thermal paste inside this
SSD I was surprised because I've never
seen this before in any SSD or any
storage device that I've tested before
however when I did the temperature test
they did turn out very good for this
Drive securing a maximum temperature of
38 degrees on the surface and 40 degrees
in software in a 25 degree ambient
controlled environment the drive itself
weighs in at 76 grams is housed in a
metal chassis which also functions to
cool down the SSD as well as give it a
nice aesthetic though the last things to
go through with this drive now is what
makes that price differential I guess
worth it and that would be the mean time
before failure on this drive is rated at
two million hours so to put that in
perspective they're basically saying the
half-life of these drives is even more
than that of the average human lifespan
which is twenty-seven thousand three
hundred seventy five days or 657
thousand hours so quite impressive
though unfortunately in a review like
this I cannot put that to the test
reasons being pretty obvious the
insurance rating otherwise rated in
terabytes written is actually quite
impressive as you go up the scale this
one here the 1.9 2 terabyte drive is
coming in with three thousand five
hundred terabytes written insurance
rating and then the top of the line is
coming in with seven thousand all the
I'm wolf one ten Astra is also coming
with a five-year warranty and a two year
data recovery warranty is included
however one thing I noticed is that they
tout
software that will be included with this
drive but it's currently not available
yet so I couldn't test that for you guys
and take it for a whirl though they do
advertise this drive as being civically
for nass solutions whether
being a tiered cash structure and that
you use this as a burst Drive for your
slower hard drives or you can buy the
bigger models and just have an all SSD
solution benefits of that of course less
heat in the nest as well as having
faster transfers across the drives
whatever rate configuration you wish to
do the last feature over in this line up
to talk about is their juror rate or in
America I believe you guys would call it
dura based often durable and in a
straight we say durable this feature
here relates to the SSDs having extra
capacitors on board in case of a power
surge or power loss their data won't
risk being corrupted because it will
save the last state before it switches
off and to sum things up for you guys
with the iron wolf 110 SSD it's a nice
solution that definitely comes in with
the right initiative for an ass based
solution Raiden rights are extremely
consistent as I said before the best
I've ever seen in any storage solution
coming through here
but of course the price is a little bit
expensive but for that price you are
definitely getting a premium SSD that I
would say is worthy of carrying that
nasty title in the moniker of the actual
branding itself and you guys hope you

Seagate getting into SSDs do you think
they're going to have a tough time with
the amount of saturation that we're
seeing in this market what do you think
they will pull ahead as a champion in
this market love reading your thoughts
