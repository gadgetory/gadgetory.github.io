pizza movies did I just have a dream
about being some things until octane how
do they go together I get it the time I
save if I'm using Intel obtained versus
not using Intel obtained could allow me
then to go to the movies and eat pizza
well we're gonna put this to the test
and see if it's true
right here we've got Intel's obtained
ribes
and these are now going into laptops
australia-wide they are really
cost-effective and Intel claims and they
actually make some bold claims then they
can speed things up to 2.6 times faster
when it comes to accessing media files
they're also stating the octane makes
your everyday tasks up to 2.1 times more
responsive as well as when it comes to
games levels loading 4.1 times faster
and then the games themselves launching
up to two times faster and here today
we've got obtained we've also got a
laptop with a drive with it installed a
16 gigabyte module so you'll be turning
that on and off checking the before and
after speeds but one thing when it comes
to obtain I've tested this in the past
we've got a 72 rpm Drive here this is a
hard drive goes into the usual desktop
systems this is faster than the drive
decided this is a 2.5 inch laptop drive
that spins at 5400 rpm this is what
generally goes into laptops when you
want more storage the advantage of them
is that they're smaller and hence
lighter and more portable but the
disadvantage is that they're actually a
lot slower than your 7200 rpm hard
drives they're going to desktop machines
so if anything this little obtain module
here will make more of a difference when
it comes to putting it in a laptop than
it did to putting it in a desktop PC
which I tested I'll put the link up here
now responsiveness this is a very
interesting thing one that I've been
investigating lately with a 1,000 FPS
camera so I can get some very accurate
results so there's the first benchmark
we're gonna pull up for you guys and we
saw here when we're loading up a large
video file I got up to eight times
faster speeds well actually over eight
times because when I didn't have
obtained installed the 1,000 FPS cameras
time limit actually ran out with obtain
off vs. on and we scored 642
milliseconds opening up this large video
file and then with it off we scored over
5,400 milliseconds or five point four
seconds so if anything these claims by
Intel are actually even better in the
real world but looking at a music file a
small music file 3 megabytes this here
loaded up virtually the same so from
those two tests alone we can already
see a trend that's starting to develop
and that's when the bigger the file the
more time you're going to save with
obtain versus not having it installed
though moving over now to Adobe Premiere
Pro this is a 4k video editing program
when we loaded this up for the first
time with octane off we scored a hundred
and thirty seven seconds with it on
fifty six seconds
so we're up to 2.4 times faster on the
initial load when we loaded it up for
the third time we scored 44 seconds with
no obtain vs. 15 seconds with octane
installed this is a 2.9 times difference
so the more you use your computer the
more this little obtain drive is going
to be working hard to save you time
they're loading up some video games and
within that video game a map and also a
load screen we saw with dota 2 the first
time we booted this up 1.7 times faster
with octane on the third time we booted
up it was 12 seconds versus 32 seconds
this was up to 2.6 times faster when it
came to the map load however this loaded
up 27 seconds versus 22 seconds so it
was only 1.2 times faster though when it
came to the actual load screen before
the map we saw 10 seconds versus 5
seconds on the first load which is the
most important because you're going to
load up into that game and then play it
for a few hours switch the Machine off
and then probably do the same the next
day if you're a gamer so 2 times faster
for the load screen 1.2 times faster for
the actual map itself so it does make a
difference when it comes to games the
one thing I will point out when it came
to navigating menus and also just
clicking things within dota 2 itself it
was a lot more responsive and there
wasn't less clutter and things sort of
lagging with the obtained on vs. off so
you can definitely notice that in real
world applications even for small things
but moving on to boot times when we
booted up the PC we've got a minute and
43 seconds versus 21 seconds this is on
the first boot on both goes 4.9 times
faster with obtain on so as we saw with
the intro we thought it was going to
make more of a difference when it came
to a laptop with a slower Drive and
obtained is indeed making a bigger
difference than it does to its desktop
counterpart the last test we're gonna
throw up here is some numbers for you
guys crystal disk mark we
saw the read and write speeds especially
the read speeds were substantially
faster with obtain switched on 932
megabytes so 7.4 times faster and when
we had it off it was only a hundred and
twenty five megabytes not to mention
some of the random read and write speeds
were aided a lot faster as well and this
is where you're gonna notice a
difference with your overall
responsiveness of your system in
everyday tasks so now it's crunch time
and as we saw with modules like the
octane they really speed things up they
speed things up to the point where in
2018 they're also so cost-effective that
you wouldn't want to live without one so
you've either got to get one of these or
an SSD in your laptop and it will make a
considerable difference and save you
that time so you can then go out and get
a pizza and movies because you won't
have to sit in front of a screen and
just wait for horrid load times that
would otherwise over time definitely
cost you a movie in pizzas but all jokes
aside laptops like these are being
rolled out with octane pre-installed all
across Australia this Dell Inspiron 15
inch with a core i5 already has it
installed from the get-go so if you are
in the market for a laptop then I do
seriously recommend getting something
with either an SSD or an Intel obtained
module pre-installed this will
definitely save you a lot of time and
just make your life a lot easier in
general and with that said I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did then
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comment section below do
you like pizza and movies well do you
like 5400 rpm drives love reading your
comments and your thoughts and opinions
and I'll catch you on the next one peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
