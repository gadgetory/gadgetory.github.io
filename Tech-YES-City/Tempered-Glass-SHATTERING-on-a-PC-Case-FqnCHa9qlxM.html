and just have a listen to this matrix
has boy even open it it's just shattered
glass last night we're about to start on
the next project and this was the deep
cool matrix 55 case we're gonna use this
in a budget bill with rise in CPU and
also a RT X 27 t was gonna be a really
good build especially for the money if
you're in the new parts but we can
really see here is just there's no side
panel it's just the tempered glass side
panel is shattered in chipping and
usually I'm one who's all for wearing no
masks when I'm using a bit of wd-40 or
just something quick and easy but we can
see right here on close examination
there is glass dust here so this is one
time where you just don't mess around
and so as we're unboxing it we knew
something was wrong we'll quickly play
the noise for you guys
so ever since I was a kid we've always
known that whenever there's broken glass
you just stop what you're doing and you
take things super careful because this
stuff it's not only dangerous in that it
can cut you really easy and it can cause
some serious damage but also this here
the dust is very dangerous for your
lungs as well extremely dangerous so
we've got a gas mask here what we're
gonna do is since we unbox this on the
table last night and you're still in the
plastic packaging outside we are going
to essentially just clean this up really
carefully and slowly and then put it all
back in the box and hopefully we might
have a case that's still able to be
worked with but let's get on with this
so we're just cleaning up this case and
during this we can just see how much
glass is actually coming out of this and
there's still more in there so what
we're going to do is just clean it up
stage by stage because there's a little
bit of glass that's fallen on the floor
so you really just want to keep track as
you go because yeah this stuff can be
very dangerous and I'm just actually
surprised at the sheer amount of volume
of glass that there is so I'm guessing
that's a I guess a half decent point
already is that deep pool is using a
decent tempered glass in their rigs I
mean that's pretty thick
also while you're cleaning up the glass
don't forget to do a quick workout and
this is my latest little toy in the
background here
bring a smashed outside
so almost finished now but we're just
going to go over it with the data vac
and I really get out any last piece of
glass as well as there's actually a
little piece right there as well as just
getting off all the glass dust - which
is probably my biggest concern at the
moment so here's the matrix 55 with the
tempered glass aside so that's a sad
thing but at least I can do a build out
of this now with Rison five like I
initially intended to but before we get
on to a conclusion there is something
just a little bit off with this case I
mean it looks a little bit dusty it you
know could could use a some check yes
lovin
so now we're coming down to conclusion
time and this is sort of a rare case
where they've sent the case from Taiwan
via DHL so for me to contact deep cool
and say hey send me out another one I
don't have to send this back and then
they're gonna have to send us out
another one and seriously for a budget
case it's just totally not worth it so I
thought for deep cool I will still take
a look at their case it'll just be - a
side panel and I guess it's the good
thing to come out of this is we can warn
each other about dangers in tech and
tempered-glass definitely has a big
danger and that is that it's fragile and
in shipping things can get damaged and
if it's glass then it's going to be a
real pain to clean up so if you guys buy
a tempered glass case whether it be from
a store whether it's shipped to you if
you can hear that glass just shaking all
inside the case then don't even bother
opening it just take it back and say
look this is gonna be an absolute
nightmare to clean up as it took us a
few hours and we'll being really careful
but if you are working with glass it's
one of the things that I just don't mess
around with if you saw a few weeks back
I caught my thumb up really badly but
that was on an alienware case with the
metal bracket glass all cuts so much
easier and the amount of damage it can
do quickly is unbelievable but if you
decide to take the plunge and clean it
up for yourself always be super careful
with glass
seriously take your time it doesn't
matter if you've got to take an extra
hour to just clean up everything make
sure there's no glass lying around make
sure you wear shoes you might even want
to wear gloves but do have a good vacuum
cleaner we have a cyclone cleaner around
here I heard they're like the best for
cleaning up glass vacuum bags might not
be as good also if you're cleaning up a
mess like this do have a dust and pen
ready really helped out and we got the
whole thing back in the plastic bag in
the box and there's no debris leftover
but also a mask is really important in
my opinion because I don't know just for
some reason my instinct says that that
glass dust is some really nasty stuff I
haven't really researched it but since
we were kids we've just always known
when we're working around something and
glass breaks then you just got to all
stop and just take it easy
start tiptoeing around everywhere and
just
really be careful also another point I
want to raise in this video is that I
haven't really seen the point of
tempered glass to me it doesn't do much
it just adds weight to the case which is
going to not help the person delivering
this via shipping it's going to be more
heavier for them they're probably more
likely to drop it or break something and
also it's just more fragile so acrylic
for example it's just really sturdy it's
really strong and you still get the
pretty much the same effect as you would
with tempered glass and if you guys have
been around here long enough you'll
definitely know that I'm careless with a
lot of things but when it comes to glass
it's just like not being super careful I
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
but also stay tuned because we've got
like a budget rising 526 hundred you
build coming it's gonna represent some
phenomenal value for money and hopefully
we can throw in some bling I was
planning to throw in a bit of bling but
since this case is missing the tempered
glass side panel it's probably not going
to look as good so I guess the deep cool
matrix 55 isn't off to a good start
already also let us know in the comment
section below what's the worst
experience you've had around broken
glass have you had a broken tempered
glass case before love reading the
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
