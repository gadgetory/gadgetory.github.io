with the bay ring of be one I had to
return the 80 20 35 audio-technica
so welcome back you guys have been
wondering where have I been for the last
two weeks and the answer is I've been
pretty damn sick I came down with some
weird virus or infection they didn't
actually know what it was but
essentially it felt like someone dropped
a piano on me so like I had no headaches
or anything like that but my body just
ate for literally a week and I think it
was a combination of a lot of things I
think I got an infection like I had a
blood test on and i think i got
infection and i was going like I was
just working out too hard and eating the
wrong food and your body just all it all
came to a stop and had to rest anyway
I'm rested up today we're going to get
tech-talk done looking at the gtx 880
series there's lots of rumors flying
around but these rumors look a lot more
solid we're going to look at the
haswell-e which is coming out very soon
as well which is interesting and then
we're going to take a look at ddr4 and
also going to look at the Pentium
overclock the 3258 and the best
motherboards I've also got some tech
that's just come in i'm going to be
reviewing a lot i'm gonna be giving you
guys a lot more videos as i'm now on
summer holidays anyway let's get on with
the first topic and this is the gtx 880
and 870 now the release date here is
confirmed to be coming this november
according to sweet clockers which is
known to have pretty solid estimates
it's actually could be as early as
october however the sad news is is that
the gtx 880 and 870 will be on 28
nanometer this bothers me because i
tried i recently tried the 750 ti
maxwell architecture like I tried this
Maxwell architecture here and as you
guys know I did a review on the 750 ti
from game wood and man Maxwell's
performance per watt was insanely
impressive i was really impressed with
it and I was I was dying to see if they
were going to release a gtx 880 with the
20 nanometer that would even improve and
fishin see even more so I was kind of a
little bit sad to see that Nvidia is
releasing it on the 28 nanometer but
it's understandable for from a company
standpoint I mean they've got to release
new products to sell new products right
so it's actually not invidious fall and
I believe it's TSMC's fault they don't
have the 20 nanometer manufacturing
process ready for rollout yet so our
masked mass production so that's that
and a little bit sad but same time
we are going to get more a performance
efficient GPUs coming out so that's the
good news are the actual specs of the GD
x 7 and the 880 and the 870 I don't
believe like I said before my other
prediction I don't believe they're going
to be that much faster than the seventh
series i think the 780 Ti is still going
to kick ass legitimately I don't think
you're going to have a jump say you had
the 780 ti over the 680 I don't think
you're going to see that forty solid
forty percent jump a forty fifty percent
jump in performance this time around I
think you're going to see more of a
similar performance however a lot more
power-efficient that's just my thinking
with Maxwell AMD is supposedly brought
out the r9 390 x which is allegedly
leaked however this one here is just
really i don't like I read the I've read
the leaks and they don't seem as certain
as the gtx 880 series maxwell's so I
mean I'm looking forward to seeing what
AMD have on the horizon I mean I'm
really keen to as always you guys want
to see competition as if AMD does go
broke I do agree with a lot of people
competitions always a good thing so
everybody goes under we're going to see
high prices on everything I mean I don't
look trust me when I don't I don't
forget what Nvidia did with the 780 they
released it 650 and then they dropped it
down to five hundred dollars when AMD
brought some competition around so
competition is a good thing however I
will say that with all this things with
all these products that are going on
this year Maxwell was a breath of fresh
air for me I really am looking forward
to Maxwell especially 20-nanometer I
hope they get it out anyway and video
they have Pascal on the horizon as you
guys know that released the they've done
a presentation on Pascal and it actually
looks really damn impressive they've
also going to put a RM processor on
board and they don't think they're going
to stack the memory as well so and video
look like they've got some real iron d
in the pipeline they've delayed their
other series called the Volta and some I
really don't know too much about voltar
and Pascal but I am looking forward to
Pascal as Maxwell was damn impressive it
really did impress the pants off of me
so yeah that was really good anyway
let's move on now to the next topic
intel haswell e there apparently once
site bottom line talent
is releasing pre-orders on these CPUs
I've never heard of the website before I
mean if someone wants to chime in and
know if they're legit or not then that
would I guess that would confirm more or
less the prices of these things however
this is looking really good the 58 20k
at 425 dollars so that's a 6-quart 12
threaded CPU that's the only going to
cost 425 dollar mean that is not that
bad I mean this time around I'm actually
impressed and tells kind of listening a
little bit i guess and we're getting
some good budget value for money items
for instance the 3258 yes i do have it
in my hands this is the 32 58 and i'm
going to talk about it later but they're
unlocking the motherboards on the 8th
series so hopefully we can get some
budget motherboards and some good
overclocking on a budget so let's get
back anyway to topic ever 58 20 k 6
cause 12 threats beast and apparently is
going to come out with a three point
three gigahertz base clock now this is
the model that I'm very keen to see
however there is much some concerns and
that is the DD the cost of ddr4 and also
the cost of the x99 platform as soon as
it comes out I mean if the model is
going to cost you three hundred dollars
in the ddr4 like you're gonna get 16 gig
at least that's going to cost you two
hundred dollars then that's a lot of
money considering the CPUs only four
hundred dollars I mean I like the fact
that 58 20 k s going to be cheap however
all the Augmented costs in building this
computer is going to add up to a
substantial amount so I'm very keen to
see some more pricing on the motherboard
specifically and I'm keen to see some
pricing on ddr4 I mean essentially ddr4
should be cheaper than ddr3 however
there's always that milking process when
products are first released we've got
here the 5 9 30 k I mean this is going
to be six again six cores and 12 threads
this really doesn't look like that like
that of a compelling sale I mean you've
got here an extra two hundred dollars on
the cpu for an extra essentially i mean
people at lifting lists in the speeds as
different speeds here but we got a 3.5
gig base clock and a 3.9 turbo as
opposed to a 3.6 turbo I mean
essentially they're both kcp you so you
can overclock both these cpus except you
just paint two hundred dollars for
essentially a cpu that's clocked higher
maybe possibly even Bend a better bend
chip so I'm not too sure if that's worth
the two hundred dollars if I do upgrade
to house well it's definitely going to
be the 58 20k the 59 60 X however is
going to be there eight course 16
threaded beasts now this thing is going
to be the first eight core true eight
core desktop as Intel calls it for the
desktop users now this thing is going to
be an absolute beast but however it's
going to cost like a roundabout ring
from the pre-orders here one thousand
one hundred dollars so that's going to
be very damn expensive for you guys
wanting to get the eight core 16 threats
and I kind of knew that was the case I
mean Intel's not going to give away
their proprietary tech at a bargain
that's just not how it works so I mean I
didn't I didn't expect the eight core
version of this cpu to be anything under
like eight hundred dollars when I was
first looking at just theory crafting
prices in my head but this thing yet
definitely going to be expensive I don't
think it's going to be worth the money
honestly especially if you're a gamer it
would be worth the money to someone who
does a lot of production and they're a
solo artist for instance I can imagine
some of the big attack channels who make
their own videos could benefit from this
59 60 X even though it's a thousand
dollars technically if you're making
over a thousand dollars a day which some
big youtubers are they can definitely
save you the time and time is money so
we moved now back onto pricing here and
we have the 48 20k now this was gonna
this was originally 325 dollars this was
the budget for core eight threats
however it looks like this time around
intel is doing out with the forecourt
eight threaded processes and that seems
logical as there wasn't really a big
difference between this and the 477 TK
in terms of performance so I do like
that Intel's only I mean they're
offering their baseline model as a
6-quart 12 threaded CPU on the x 99
platform as we see here the 4 930 k this
is clocked at three point four gigs and
this is five hundred and eighty dollars
retail so you can see here the CPU
essentially is going to be a hundred and
fifty dollars cheaper then what Intel I
mean then what their previous generation
offered office so we're moving out onto
the best bet notice that
these chips are also going to be
soldered as well so for guys like me who
love to overclock we will not have to
deal lid that has will eat chips as we
saw here someone tried to delete an ivy
bridge-e chip and they failed miserably
and they found out it was actually
soldered and they destroyed the chip so
that's something I'm really looking
forward to soldered overclocking again
that'll be a fresh of breath of fresh
air and now we're moving back to ddr4
also so this was something I pointed out
before in the costs of ddr4 now ddr4 is
going to be more efficient it's going to
be about 1.3 volt I think the spec
however how much it's going to cost is
anyone's guess I'm keen to see when
these sticks hit the market the consumer
market how much they're actually going
to be in terms of speed I mean they're
not going to be that much faster than
ddr3 so I don't think we're going to see
that huge of a benefit however I said
before they think the power savings are
going to be really important there with
ddr4 now one thing about ddr4 as well as
at all it may not be mainstream until
2015 which is worries me because if it's
not mainstream if it's not in mass
production then the prices the ddr4 is
going to be pretty damn expensive so
that's something that does worry me a
little bit especially since the tablet
market is going to want access to
cheaper I mean lot more efficient RAM as
well and stuff like that so the note pc
market as well so something to be i keep
an eye out for i'm really like I'm
scared of the day they release ddr4 more
prices they're going to charge for ddr4
that's going to scare the hell out of me
so anyway don't like if you guys see
ddr4 at ridiculous prices don't say I
didn't tell you so because I'm telling
you now anyway let's look under some
other bright news I guess this is good
news Zeus is adding overclocking and
this is probably old news but however
azuz gigabyte as well so i'll move this
here as well gigabyte pretty much all
the main man all the main vendors are
adding support for overclocking on their
non CE platforms now this is really good
news because we will get to finally see
these threads like this is the Pentium
3258 and we're going to see which budget
motherboard is
good for the CPU it now I'm gonna talk
to you guys straight away I don't think
like I'm gonna tell you I straight out I
think there's a model here that I really
love and I've actually ordered it it's
the gigabyte I've actually got right
here for you guys so it's the be 85 m
from gigabytes the ultra durable
motherboard now this thing has two cpu
to cpu four pin supports it's also got a
little bit of extra caps and chokes on
board so I'm hoping this will do a good
job of handling the pentium and the best
thing about this board is it's only $55
retail in Japan I mean imagine it a bit
cheaper in the States so this looks like
a good board with the Pentium I'm going
to be testing the hell out of this and
giving you guys the ultimatum and
telling you if it is a good
recommendation because ultimately if
this thing works I could imagine the
Pentium 3 30 258 it like at four point
two gigs possibly even 4.4 on a stock
heatsink being a really good compelling
value when you couple it with a gtx 760
or something like that so on the other
hand just be wary if you're going to go
out and buy something like this just be
wary I personally wouldn't recommend
something like the cheapest h81 em you
can get your hands on as you see here
there's really it's just really a
bare-bones model once you put a gtx 760
in there to 6-2 6-2 ram probably gonna
have a few hard drives you've only got
three chokes there in limited amount of
caps and one for penn cpu connector so
honestly i wouldn't recommend something
like this for gamers for someone who's
going to game on this thing do some
hardcore gaming i don't recommend
getting the cheapest motherboard
possible hence why i'm personally
getting the b85 from gigabyte so
hopefully this works out and if it does
i'll be doing a really good review on it
so i'm thinking right now it will work
out anyway this is a ddr4 intel's 40
nanometers skylake will support ddr4
pcie for and solder express now this is
the thing sky lakes on the way after
Broadway abroad will most likely be
released at the start of 2015 and when
that's released it essentially means
that the z97 motherboard is going to be
another single freaking chip motherboard
platform because it's going to support
his e 97 supports
well supports ddr3 skull is going to
support DDR for that means are gonna
have to go and buy another motherboard
if you want to upgrade to Sky lake so
I'm a little bit disappointed in the
fact that lately we just have to buy so
many new we have to buy pretty much a
new platform every time we want to buy a
new chip it's really getting annoying
and yeah this is sort of something that
I don't look forward to recommending got
you guys but anyway yeah Broadwell yeah
if you get a new z97 just understand
that broadwell is going to be pretty
much a one gen chip for your motherboard
that's it anyway let's move on now to
the next bit and that is Broadwell is to
be released I guess at the end of 2014
this looks like it'll be released for
the laptops maybe before it'll be
released to the desktops I honestly not
too sure I mean everything is getting
delayed I mean you're seeing TSMC delay
their 20 nanometer it tells delaying
their 14 nanometer it may even be I mean
I'm predicting Broadwell be art now in
the first quarter of 2015 so anyway as
we look with the H one thing I want to
talk about also lastly with the h87 and
the h81 and all this b85 unlocking I
think Intel's allowing the partners to
do this for a specific reason and the
reason they're allowing the partners to
do this is because they want to refresh
sales I mean sales are probably getting
stagnant because they haven't given us a
new product broad Wells not released yet
so people don't really have the need
upgrade personally my 4670k I do not
have a need to upgrade to a 469 TK or
479 TK because it's the same chip my
chip goes to 4.6 gig stable all day
every day I might not even get a chip
that's as good as my 4670k so I think
they're this with them unlocking the h87
and be 85 motherboards they're
essentially trying to get the people on
sandy and possibly even the gen before
that to upgrade the Haswell now so it is
a good I mean it is a good sales tactic
i do believe it until it officially
given the go-ahead to all the vendors to
do this and it makes also it makes
really good promise on the fact that the
3258 will be a legit by now so if it
means essential people like you're
buying z87
for these chips it's not worth it do not
go out and buy a Z 897 or a z87
motherboard especially as the 87 just
for the 3258 if you're getting a z97
you're going to use it as a bridge to
broadwell and that's understandable
that's personally what I would only do
with it but it's up to you guys anyway
that leaves about everything I've talked
about everything I want to talk about
today also um that's about it sorry I'm
a little bit rusty I haven't made a
video in two weeks but I want to get you
guys the tech videos I'm going to be
getting these reviews done like I said
I'm going to be getting the review done
on this the be 85 m ds3 from gigabyte
I'm going to be getting the 3258 review
done I'm going to see how high this
retail sample overclocks i also got sent
a 256 gigabyte it makes 100 from crucial
so I'm going to be revealing that for
you guys and telling you how this
performs I mean this thing is retailed
at a hundred and ten dollars for 256
gigabytes of SSD that's pretty damn
impressive anyway I mean the 512 version
it's like about two hundred thirty
dollars as well like damn as if these
are getting inexpensive now and you
pretty much want one if you're a desktop
user anyway guys if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and if you
have any questions or anything you want
to talk about in the comment section
below please put a comment in the
comment section below and i will reply
as soon as i can and if you haven't
ready to give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already to take
your city and yeah I'm back on track I'm
healthy now I'm all good I've also got
the animatics I've got some any max case
for thirty dollars i'm going to review
so there's lots of reviews coming for
you guys and did i tell you i love you
guys and peace out for now i'm gonna
roll the outro bye
