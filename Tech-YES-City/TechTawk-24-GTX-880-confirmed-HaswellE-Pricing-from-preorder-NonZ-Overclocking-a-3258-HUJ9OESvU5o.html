with the bay ring of b1 I had to return
the 82 a 35 Audio Technica
so welcome back you guys have been
wondering where have I been for the last
two weeks and the answer is I've been
pretty damn sick I came down with some
weird virus or infection they didn't
actually know what it was but
essentially it felt like someone dropped
a piano on me so like I had no headaches
or anything like that but my body just
ached for literally a week and I think
it was a combination of a lot of things
I think I got an infection like I had a
blood test on and I think I got an
infection and I was going like I was
just working out too hard and eating the
wrong food and your body just thought it
all came to a stop and I had to rest
anyway I'm rested up today we're gonna
get Tech Talk done looking at the gtx
880 series there's lots of rumors flying
around but these rumors look a lot more
solid we're gonna look at the haswell-e
which is coming out very soon as well
which is interesting and then we're
gonna take a look at ddr4 and also gonna
look at the Pentium overclock the three
to five eight and the best motherboards
I've also got some tech that's just come
in I'm gonna be reviewing a lot I'm
gonna be giving you guys a lot more
videos as I'm now on summer holidays
anyway let's get on with the first topic
and this is the gtx 880 and 870 now the
release date here is confirmed to be
coming this November according to suite
Clockers which is known to have pretty
solid estimates it's actually could be
as early as October however the sad news
is is that the gtx 880 and 870 will be
on 28 nanometer this bothers me because
i tried i recently tried the 750ti
Maxwell architecture like I tried this
Maxwell architecture here and as you
guys know I did a review on the 750 Ti
from game wood and man Maxwell's
performance per watt was insanely
impressive I was really impressed with
it and I was dying to see if they were
gonna release a gtx 880 with the 20
nanometer that would even improve and
fish'n see even more so I was kind of
I'm a little bit sad to see that Nvidia
is releasing it on the 28 nanometer but
it's understandable for from a company
standpoint I mean they've got to release
new products to sell new products right
so it's actually not invidious fall and
I believe it's TS MCS fault they don't
have the 20 nanometer manufacturing
process ready for rollout yet so our
mass mass production
so that's that and I'm a little bit sad
but at the same time we are going to get
more of performance efficient GPUs
coming out so that's the good news are
the actual specs of the GTX 7 and the
880 and the 870 I don't believe like I
said before my other prediction I don't
believe they're gonna be that much
faster than the seventh series I think
the 780 Ti is still gonna kick ass
legitimately I don't think you're gonna
have a jump say you had the 780 Ti over
the 680 I don't think you're gonna see
that 40 solid 40 percent jump a 40 50
percent jump in performance this time
around I think you're gonna see more of
a similar performance however a lot more
power efficient that's just my thinking
with Maxwell AMD is supposedly brought
out the r9 390x which is allegedly
leaked however this one here is just
really I don't like I read that I've
read the leaks and they don't seem as
certain as the gtx 880 series maxwell so
i mean i'm looking forward to seeing
what AMD have on the horizon I mean I'm
really keen to as always you guys want
to see competition as if AMD does go
broke I do agree with a lot of people
competitions always a good thing so
everybody goes under we're gonna see
high prices on everything I mean I don't
look trust me and I don't I don't forget
what Nvidia did with the 780 they
released that 650 and then they dropped
it down to $500
when AMD brought some competition around
so competition is a good thing however I
will say that with all this things with
all these products that are going on
this year Maxwell was a breath of fresh
air for me I really am looking forward
to Maxwell especially 20 nanometre I
hope they get it out anyway and video
they have Pascal on the horizon as you
guys know they've released they've done
a presentation on Pascal and it actually
looks really damn impressive
they've also gonna put a are in
processor on board and they don't think
they're gonna stack the memory as well
so and video look like they've got some
real iron D in the pipeline though
they've delayed the other series called
the Volta and so I'm I really don't know
too much about voltaren Pascal but I am
looking forward to Pascal as Maxwell was
damn impressive it really did impress
the pants off of me so yeah that was
really good
anyway let's move on now to the next
topic intel has
well they're apparently once sight
bottom-line telecommunications is
releasing pre-orders on these CPUs I've
never heard of the website before I mean
if someone wants to chime in and know if
they're legit or not then that would I
guess that would confirm more or less
the prices of these things however this
is looking really good the 5/8 20k at
425 dollars so that's a 6 quart 12
threaded CPU that's the only gonna cost
four hundred and twenty-five dollars I
mean that is not that bad I mean this
time around I'm actually impressed
Intel's kind of listening a little bit I
guess and we're getting some good budget
value for money items for instance the
three to five eight yes I do have it in
my hands this is the 32 58 and they're
unlocking the motherboards on the 8
Series so hopefully we can get some
budget motherboards and some good
overclocking on a budget so let's get
back anyway to topic F of 5 8 20 K 6
cores 12 threats beast and apparently
it's going to come out with a 3.3
gigahertz base clock now this is the
model that I'm very keen to see however
there is much some concerns and that is
the dhih dhih the cost of ddr4 and also
the cost of the x99 platform as soon as
it comes out I mean if the motherboards
gonna cost you $300 and the ddr4 like
you're gonna get 16 gig at least that's
gonna cost you $200 then that's a lot of
money considering the CPUs only $400 I
mean I like the fact that 5 820 Kay's
gonna be cheap however all the Augmented
costs in building this computer it's
gonna add up to a substantial amount so
I'm very keen to see some more pricing
on the motherboard specifically and I'm
keen to see some pricing on ddr4 I mean
essentially ddr4 should be cheaper than
ddr3 however there's always that milking
process when products are first released
we've got here the 5 930 km in this is
gonna be 6 again 6 cores and 12 threads
this really doesn't look like day like
that of a compelling sale I mean you've
got here an extra $200 on the CPU for an
extra essentially I mean people have
lifting lists in the speeds there's
different speeds here but we got a 3.5
gig base clock and a 3.9 turbo as
opposed to a 3.6 turbo
I mean essentially that both kcp you so
you can overclock both these CPUs
accessions just paint $200 for
essentially a CPU that's clocked higher
maybe possibly even bend a better Bend
chip so I'm not too sure if that's worth
the $200 if I do upgrade to as well it's
definitely gonna be the 5/8 20k the 5
960 X however is going to be their
eighth course 16 threaded beasts now
this thing is going to be the first 8
core true 8 core desktop as intel calls
it for the desktop users now this thing
is gonna be an absolute beast but
however it's gonna cost like a
roundabout ring from the pre-orders here
$1,100 so that's gonna be very damn
expensive for you guys wanting to get
the 8 core 16 threats and I kind of knew
that was the case I mean Intel's not
gonna give away their proprietary tech
at a bargain that's just not how it
works so I mean I didn't I didn't expect
the 8 core version of this CPU to be
anything under like $800 when I was
first looking they're just theory
crafting prices in my head but this
thing yet definitely gonna be expensive
I don't think it's gonna be worth the
money honestly especially if you're a
gamer it would be worth the money to
someone who does a lot of production and
they're a solo artist for instance I can
imagine some of the bigger tech channels
who make their own videos could benefit
from this 5 960 X even though it's
$1,000 technically if you're making over
$1,000 a day which is some big youtubers
are they can definitely save you the
time and time is money so move now back
onto pricing here and we have the 4 8 20
K now this was gonna this was originally
$325 this was the budget for core 8
threats however it looks like this time
around Intel is doing out with the 4
chord 8 threaded processors and that
seems logical as there wasn't really a
big difference between this and the 4
770 K in terms of performance so I do
like that Intel's
only I mean they're offering their
baseline model as a 6 quart 12 threaded
CPU on the x99 platform as we see here
the 4 930 K this is clocked at 3.4 gigs
and this is 580 dollars retail so you
can see here the CPU essentially is
going to be a hundred and fifty dollars
cheaper then
what Intel I mean then what their
previous generation offered the office
so hey we're moving out on to the best
bet notice that these chips are also
going to be soldered as well so for the
for guys like me who love to overclock
we will not have to deal lid that has
we'll eat chips as we saw here someone
tried to delete an ivy bridge-e chip and
they failed miserably and they found out
it was actually soldered and they
destroyed the chip so that's something
I'm really looking forward to soldered
overclocking again that'll be a fresh of
a breath of fresh air and now we're
moving back to ddr4 also so this was
something I pointed out before in the
costs of ddr4 now ddr4 is going to be
more efficient it's gonna be about 1.3
volt I think the spec however how much
it's gonna cost is anyone's guess I'm
keen to see when these sticks hit the
market the consumer market how much
they're actually gonna be in terms of
speed I mean they're not gonna be that
much faster than ddr3 so I don't think
we're gonna see that huge of a benefit
however I said before they think the
power savings are gonna be really
important there with ddr4 now one thing
about ddr4 as well is it all in it may
not be mainstream until 2015 which is
worries me because if it's not
mainstream if it's not in mass
production then the prices the ddr4 is
going to be pretty damn expensive so
that's something that does worry me a
little bit especially since the tablet
market is gonna want access to cheaper I
mean a lot more efficient Ram as well
and stuff like that so no PC market as
well so something to be keep an eye out
for I'm really like I'm I'm scared of
the day they release ddr4 them what
prices they're gonna charge for ddr4
that's gonna scare the hell out of me so
anyway don't like if you guys see ddr4
at ridiculous prices don't say I didn't
tell you so because I'm telling you now
anyway let's look under some other
bright news I guess this is good news
Zeus is adding overclocking and this is
probably old news but however as Zeus
gigabyte as well so I'll move this here
as well gigabyte pretty much all the
main menu all the main vendors are
adding support for overclocking
on their non CE platforms now this is
really good news because we will get
to finally see these streets like this
is the penny in 32:58 and we're gonna
see which budget motherboard is good for
this CPU now I'm gonna talk to you guys
straight away I don't think like I'm
gonna tell you guys straight out I think
there's a model here that I really love
and I've actually ordered it it's the
gigabyte I've actually got right here
for you guys so it's the B 85 M from
gigabyte it's the ultra durable
motherboard now this thing has two CPU
two CPU four pin supports it's also got
a little bit of extra caps and chokes on
boards so I'm hoping this will do a good
job of handling the Pentium and the best
thing about this board is it's only
fifty five dollars retail in Japan I
mean I imagine it'll be cheaper in the
States
so this looks like a good board with the
Pentium I'm gonna be testing the hell
out of this and giving you guys the
ultimatum and telling you if it is a
good recommendation because ultimately
if this thing works
I could imagine the Pentium 3 32:58 it
like at four point two gigs possibly
even four point four on a stock heatsink
being a really good compelling value
when you couple it with a GTX 760 or
something like that so on the other hand
just be wary if you're gonna go out and
buy something like this just be wary I
personally wouldn't recommend something
like the cheapest H 81m you can get your
hands on as you see here there's really
it's just really a bare-bones model once
you put a GTX 760 in there two six two
six two Ram probably gonna have a few
hard drives you've only got three chokes
they're in limited amount of caps and
one for pin CPU connector so honestly I
wouldn't recommend something like this
for gamers for someone who's going to
game on this thing do some hardcore
gaming I don't recommend getting the
cheapest motherboard possible hence why
I'm personally getting the b85 from
gigabyte so hopefully this works out and
if it does I'll be doing a really good
review on it so I'm thinking right now
it will work out anyway this is a ddr4
Intel's 40 nanometer skylake will
support ddr4 PCIe 4 and solder express'd
now this is the thing sky lakes on the
way after Broadway abroad will most
likely be released at the start of 2015
and when that's released is essentially
means that the z97
board is going to be another single
freaking chip motherboard platform
because it's going to support it's
nothing z97 supports Broadwell sports
ddr3 skull is gonna support ddr4 that
means are gonna have to go and buy
another motherboard if you want to
upgrade to skylake so I'm a little bit
disappointed in the fact that lately we
just have to buy so many new we have to
buy pretty much a new platform every
time we want to buy a new chip it's
really getting annoying and yeah this is
sort of something that I don't look
forward to recommending got you guys but
anyway yeah Broadwell yeah if you get a
new z97 just to understand that
Broadwell is gonna be pretty much a one
gen chip for your motherboard that's it
anyway let's move on now to the next bit
and that is Broadwell is to be released
I guess at the end of 2014 this looks
like it'll be released for the laptops
maybe before it'll be released to the
desktops I honestly not too sure I mean
everything is getting delayed I mean
you're seeing tsmc delay there 20
nanometer and tells delaying their 14
nanometer it may even be I mean I'm
predicting Broadwell be out now in the
first quarter of 2015 so anyway as we
looked at the h1 thing I want to talk
about also lastly with the H 87 and the
H 81 and all this be 85 unlocking I
think Intel's allowing the partners to
do this for a specific reason and the
reason they're allowing the partners to
do this is because they want to refresh
sales I mean sales are probably getting
stagnant because they haven't given us a
new product Broadwell is not released
yet so people don't really have the need
upgrade personally it is my 4 670 K I do
not have a need to upgrade to a 4 6 9 TK
or for 790 K because it's the same chip
my chip goes to 4.6 gig stable all day
every day I might not even get a chip
that's as good as my 4 670 K so I think
they're this but with them unlocking the
h87 and beardy 5 motherboards they're
essentially trying to get the people on
sandy and possibly even the gen before
that to upgrade to has well now so it is
a good I mean it is a good sales tactic
I do believe it until it officially
given the go-ahead to all the vendors to
do this and it makes also it makes
really good promise on the fact that the
32 58
we'll be a legit by now so if it means
essential people like you're buying z87
motherboards for these chips it's not
worth it do not go out and buy a z8 97
or z87 motherboard especially it's the
87 just for the 32:58 if you're getting
a z97 you're going to use it as a bridge
to Broadwell and that's understandable
that's personally what I would only do
with it but it's up to you guys anyway
that leaves about everything I've talked
about everything I want to talk about
today also um that's about it sorry I'm
a little bit rusty I haven't made a
video in two weeks but I want to get you
guys the tech videos I'm gonna be
getting these reviews done like I said
I'm going to be getting the review done
on this the B 85m ds3 H from gigabyte
I'm gonna be getting the 32:58 review
done I'm gonna see how high this retail
sample overclocks
256 gigabyte and makes 100 from crucial
so I'm gonna be reviewing that for you
guys and telling you how this performs I
mean this thing is retailed at a hundred
and ten dollars for 256 gigabytes of SSD
that's pretty damn impressive anyway I
mean the 512 version it's like about
$230 as well like damn SSDs are getting
inexpensive now and you pretty much want
one if you're a desktop user anyway guys
if you'd like this video please give it
a thumbs up and if you have any
questions or anything you want to talk
about in the comment section below
please put a comment in the comment
section below and I will reply as soon
as I can and if you haven't ready give
this video a thumbs up and subscribe if
you haven't already to take your city
and yeah I'm back on track I'm healthy
now I'm all good I've also to the
animatics I've got some Animax case for
$30 I'm gonna review so there's lots of
reviews coming for you guys and did I
tell you I love you guys and peace out
for now I'm gonna roll the outro bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
