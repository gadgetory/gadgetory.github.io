motherboard this is the z170a gaming in
five from MSI ladies john welcome back
to tech es city this is brian coming to
you guys today with a skylake
motherboard review this is the msi z170a
gaming m5 now first of all this review
we'll take a look at what you get in the
box take a look at the features on the
motherboard then we'll look at the bars
quickly and then we'll take a look at
the onboard audio and the killer and IC
and then I will tell you guys my
subjective thoughts and opinions on this
motherboard with that being said though
let's get on with it
so included in the box you get six SATA
cables you also get an SLI connector a
easy Quick Start manual you also get a
driver CD and some little notes there to
put on your cables as well which is an
interesting touch and you also get the
famous door note hanger there which you
can hang on your door to let people know
that you're gaming now as soon as you
pull this motherboard
out of the box you'll notice that it has
a red and black theme to it and also the
paint included on the motherboard is a
matte black finish now going over the
vrm so upon pulling off the heat sinks I
noticed that it had a 10 + 2 phase power
design so that's ten phases dedicated to
the CPU and then two phases dedicated to
the ddr4 memory there now an important
thing with skylake is that they've put
off the voltage regulator off the CPU
back onto the motherboard so vrm is a
little bit more important on skylake
than it is on house well now the good
thing about MSI is what they've done
here is they've included a really good
vrm solution you've got Nikko's MOSFETs
they're on the low side you've got 20
amps on the MOSFETs on the high side
you've got them rated at 13 amps you've
also got titanium chokes they're all the
way across the vrm there and then you've
got MSI's dark solid caps which all in
all this will give you guys a very solid
and stable overclock when I tested the
heatsink out after gaming on it at 4.6
gigahertz at one point three five volt I
noticed that the temperatures were like
37 degrees for the VR
this is in a 23 degree cooled
environment so the vrm is certainly
capable of handling any cpu or any four
core overclocks that you throw at it now
moving to the right of the board you've
got four ddr4 black-themed memory slots
there and one thing that I notice is
that they've got ddr4 boost printed
there and upon inspection I've noticed
that they've isolated the circuitry for
the ddr4 memory which is a cool thing if
you're going for a really high overclock
though when I tried overclocking my
memory my memory wasn't that good
so the ddr4 boost couldn't help a lot
there so moving down the right side of
the board there you've got a USB three
front out you've also got six sided
three ports and to solder Express ports
there so if you use two of those Saito
Express ports they will cancel out four
of the side of three ports there so
that's something to keep in mind below
that you've also got a LED indicator
which will oddly enough tell you your
cpu temperature and I found this to be a
really useful touch and I really like
what they've done with this because
especially if you're gaming you want to
know if your CPUs getting really hot now
just besides that you've got a heatsink
there with the dragon logo covering the
chipset hub there which they're still
kept on the z1 78 architecture now
moving down to the bottom of the board
here from right to left you've got a
power jumper there as well as a clear
CMOS jumper and then you've got two USB
to front outs there as well as a TPM
connector a serial connector and a
chassis intrusion connector you've also
got the slow mode switch there is just
something there interesting that they've
brought into the gaming m5 motherboard
they're now moving to the left of that
we have the audio boost 3 with its own
dedicated section this is the real tach
1150 which has its own electromagnetic
shield you've also got tray sliding
there which lights up red in the dark
now moving to the right of that you have
a m dot 2 slot there and you actually
get two of these one further down the
board as well and then you have four PCI
one speed slots and you also get three
PCI 16 speed slots however the first
port is the only port that will work in
16 speed mode the one below that will
work in
speed if you wish to put your graphics
cards in SLI or crossfire and then the
one below that is dedicated for 3-way
crossfire which will work in four speed
only they are all PCI 3 compatible now
looking at the fan connections you get a
total of five with two of them being for
pin and three of them being three pin
and then at the top of the board you
lastly get the 12 volt connection there
which is really easy to access and it
isn't a good location so for input
output from the top to the bottom of the
motherboard we get one ps2 there we also
get two USB to ports a DVID port and
then six USB 3.1 slots there one of
those being type C and then five of
those being type a you also get a HDMI
output meshed in there as well as a
killer ni c e 2400 land input that now
for audio out you've got a optical out
there you've also got manual
configuration for analog 5.1 out as well
as a headphone out and a mic in and line
in port also with the motherboard it's a
very solid motherboard with the PCB
being pretty thick and I'll surprised at
how rigid the motherboard was and how
good everything felt on the motherboard
but a quick look at the boss one thing
that I've noted with the boss is that
they've changed it since the z87
iteration when I use the G 45 gaming
they've made it more simpler that made
it easier to use but they've also kept
the options they're more advanced
overclockers so I noticed that I had all
my favorite options there and even
though with skylake I believe they've
done down the overclocking a little bit
which is an MSI's fault they've still
given you all the options you would need
for an enthusiast overclocker now with
that being said let's take a quick look
at the onboard audio solution and the
killer and IC software suite now let's
take a look at the onboard audio
solution included with the MSI zi 178
gaming but this is the audio boost 3 now
when I started putting on my pair of
headphones this is the Fidelio once and
started listening to music I was blown
away by how good this output was the
bass and the sub bass were there which
is indicative of a decent or a good
dak ant solution and I think on this
output stage they've included jewel Opie
amps they've also included a real tech
1150 dak and as well as that I will
state the separation was pretty good as
well if you've got easier to drive
headphones like mine which are low
impedance these are the Fidelio wants
high sensitivity then the volume will be
more than enough and it will sound
phenomenal though one thing I will
stress is that if you have hard to drive
headphones for instance hi-fi man hey
chief for hundreds and obviously you
will want to go out and get a separate
amp to power those hard to drive in its
headphones so keep that in mind another
thing as well is the crosstalk was
extremely low which means that you're
going to get a true stereo sound coming
into these headphones also the included
software suite was actually really easy
to use you've got preset accuser you
also got things like room correction and
you've got profiles that you save there
the one thing I couldn't find was a
custom EQ which I would have liked to
have seen though that's easily remedied
by a free program called equalizer apo
and I've actually got a tutorial for
that up with a link in the description
below that now let's move on now to the
mic input
so now we've talked about output let's
talk about input and now for this
segment and the previous segment I've
been using the v-moda boom probe plug
directly into my onboard audio and now
when I started critically listening to
the audio going into the black input I
noticed that when I started speaking
there was a little bit of noise but if I
went and I didn't say anything
there'd be no noise at all
did you hear any noise I bet you didn't
so what that means is that noise
suppression is turned on by default now
when I check the options I couldn't find
any checkboxes to turn on or off noise
suppression which is a little bit of a
bummer because if you're using this for
even relatively professional recordings
like doing streaming or something like
that
then you do want noise suppression off
because it ultimately changes your voice
and it I believe it makes it a little
bit lower quality the one good thing
about the mic input is that it is really
loud and when I was doing a quite a
Skype conversation with my brother I
noticed that he could hear me very
clearly and there was no hissing or
anything like that so it was a good
thing I mean the mic input is solid I
would just like to see the option to
turn on or off noise suppression so
let's quickly take a look at the killer
a 2400 which comes included on the
gaming m5 motherboard now when I first
installed the drivers and the software
suite or the killer a 2400 I was
impressed by how much more simpler
they've made the user interface so it's
a lot more easier to use nowadays and
the good thing about killers claims is
that they're actually legit I've tested
this in the past I'll put a link in the
description block to the testing but
basically if you're a a university
student for example at a dorm where
you're on a congested network and you
will get a better online gaming
experience now if you're using the
killer and I see with the software as
opposed to another and I see which is a
great thing the killer are offering
their with their software suite however
another good thing that MSI is done with
the implementation of the killer is that
they've allowed the option to just
install the drivers only which is a
fantastic thing with people like me who
aren't on a congested network don't need
the accompanying software suite so kudos
to MSI and also I haven't come into any
problems with the NI C so in conclusion
the z170a gaming motherboard from MSI is
one solid solution I was really
impressed with the three top things that
I look for in a motherboard that is the
vrm solution first off I look at that it
was a really good implementation that
they've done here you've got a 12 phase
power design with all solid components
and a decent heatsink there
which takes care of cooling and it ran
cool in practice and this was with a
pretty heavy overclock so for the VRM
they've checked the box there next thing
I look at is the onboard audio solution
now the audio output was phenomenal so
if you're a guy who wants to get into
gaming and enjoy your games this
motherboard has a really good onboard or
their solution to boot now one thing I
will critique though is the mic input
there I do believe that could use a
little bit of work there as I know as
rock for instance on their motherboards
are including pretty solid mic imports
there so that's one thing I'd like to
see improved on this motherboard however
the killer and I see the third thing
that I look for on a motherboard the
killer and I see is definitely solid
when I was playing some games on this
motherboard I noticed that the killer
and IC did not miss a beat and also the
software suite has improved a lot since
the last time I used it so all in all
this motherboard is a solid solution for
someone who's looking to get into
overclocking with this simple and easy
to use UEFI bass also some things that I
forgot to touch on you get included an
xsplit license with this motherboard and
they've also put metal shrouding on the
PCI Express ports they call this the
impregnable armor so this will
essentially make it so that you don't
break your PCI Express ports I mean if
you're into being a barbarian and
installing graphics cards then this
motherboard might be really good for you
even though I don't know anyone who does
that though on that note I will say that
I could not find a clear CMOS button
which was something that I was worried
about first however upon overclocking on
this motherboard and then coming into
failed overclocks like for instance I
just tested it with a complete failure
an overclock I noticed that the boss
just reset itself really quickly when it
came into a failed overclock and it got
you back up and running in no time
so essentially giving way to not needing
a clear CMOS button in the first place
so very good implementation of the UFL
BIOS by MSI there now for the ultimate
question of is the z170a gaming m5
motherboard from msi worth your money
and in my opinion yes
and I will be giving this product a four
out of five stars today because it has a
fantastic vrm solution that's the
military class 5 which besides the
marketing is a very cool vrm solution
you also got a great implementation
there of the bias which both beginners
and advanced users will find familiar
and easy to use and you're also having
things like included xsplit license and
just overall a great output on the audio
there which is the realtek 1150 so if
you're using headphones you will have an
amazing experience or easy to drive
headphones you'll have an amazing
experience listening to audio however I
will be knocking off one star for that
mic input because I believe a product
that's aimed at gamers especially one
with an included xsplit license should
have a more solid mic input or a more
solid amp included on the mic input so I
will be knocking a staff for that so
that's about it from me guys if you like
this review then please give it a thumbs
up and if you have any questions then
drop a comment in the comment section
below also this motherboard was provided
for me by MSI Australia and it does cost
around about 300 AUD however here in the
States and you're in the UK and you can
pick it up for cheaper then by all means
do so it is one great motherboard to use
in practice though that being said you
go probably want to know how it performs
house Kylie performed Brian house Kylie
performed well I've done some
preliminary tests and in gaming I did
the ARMA 3 benchmark which is my cheap
EU bound test it performed about five
percent better than the four deep near
the house wall floor core 46 70 K at
four point six gigabits also in
productivity it did very well and it is
a snappy cpu however it's not leaps and
bounds ahead of
we'll just keep that in mind however
I'll be leaving the benchmarks for the
CPU review for you guys and I'll catch
you in the next tech video very soon
peace out for now
