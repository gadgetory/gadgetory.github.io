I've kind of actually never heard of
before but here goes nothing welcome
back to Tokyo city's brain come until
you guys there with a different kind of
video one where I'm helping out the
fellow Ozzy's down under now ebay have
this sale going on at the moment where
they got twenty percent off tech deals
and so from certain select sellers you
can get twenty percent off and there's
actually some pretty damn good items
that you can pick up a deal on in Oz so
the first of the deals here and my
personal favorite is a 980 TI going for
730 aud though we can still take twenty
percent off that and we can end up
getting this graphics card for 583 aud
which translates into like four hundred
and something USD which is actually a
really damn good deal considering we're
in Australia though if you want to get
the latest and greatest the same seller
also has the GTX 1080 going for about
1080 dollars aud which is really damn
expensive but it's sort of like the best
deal you get on eternity at the moment
down under the next deal I've got here
is a laptop for you guys this is the
inspiron 3000 it's got a dual core
processor in it for get about to ram and
SSD in there it's going for around about
320 AED with free shipping not bad at
all the next deal I've got here is a
samsung 22-inch 1080p display which is
really good for that person who's on a
budget just getting into pc gaming for
128 aud including shipping not a bad
deal the next deal i managed to find is
an SSD from Sandy sees as a 480 gigabyte
model and it's going after you apply
discount or that coupon code you will
get it for 183 aud including shipping
and also if you're getting into a new
building use of ddr3 memory the same
seller has a gigabyte sticks of g.skill
value series they're going for 51 aud so
you can get two of these for around
about a hundred australian dollars and
that'll help you for 16 gigabytes of ram
with a new build and the last deal i
have for you guys is the XP 270 hates
you from asa this is renowned or
arguably one of the best if not the best
gaming money you can currently get for
gaming it's 144 hurts 27 inch IPS
display there it's also got g-sync
built-in and you get it for 791
australian dollars after you apply that
coupon code there and this will bring it
in line with American
probably around about similar price to
what you get it for in America they keep
in mind we do pay for shipping GST and
all that stock so it actually is a
pretty good deal once you factor in all
those things anyway that's about it for
me today guys if you liked this video be
sure to hit slam pommy the abuse and be
nasty with that like button and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon and also if you know of any other
deals and be sure to drop in the comment
section below as they're sure it will
help out some other Ozzy's who are
looking to get a bargain and I'll catch
it in the next tech video very soon
these happen now bye
Oh wouldn't it be cool if you could turn
you you're into a USB port that would be
pretty cool like just just upload some
data like hey guys yeah ah cool man yeah
I know you're talking about now yet
those benchmarks I can see the
difference they're awesome it's not
really awesome is the three phone I'm
just gonna get crying calling now right
