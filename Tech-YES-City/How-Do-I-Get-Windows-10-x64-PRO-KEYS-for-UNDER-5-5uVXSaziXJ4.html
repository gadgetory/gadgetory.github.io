where I built a heap of pcs a lot of
people were asking where I get my
Windows 10 Pro keys from a lot of people
were also really OCD about the IO shield
and guys I can't install an IR shield
that I don't have it didn't come with a
motherboard when I bought it but if you
guys want a cheap Windows 10 key this is
what I do
I just simply go onto eBay and find the
cheapest seller available and in this
case it happens to be a guy called fast
codes I've actually been using him for a
few months he sells codes for 199 pound
or quid and that in USD terms is about
two dollars eighty I think very cheap
for a legit Windows 10 x64 Pro Licence
now it is a little bit funny because
when I log on to the ebay.com and the
eBay kaamdar you there the different
eBay sites the codes are actually a
little bit more expensive there I
actually found the cheapest codes to be
on the ebay co uk website so maybe this
guy is getting them really cheap at
wholesale and he's even selling them to
websites like those cd key sites now one
thing I will give you guys a tip on is
if you buy one of these CD keys use them
straight away in the past and I'm not
going to name the websites name I have
bought a Windows 10 license and I didn't
use it until a couple of months later
and then it didn't work so I would
recommend getting these keys using them
straight away and so when I build pcs
I'll usually order a heap of these keys
depending on how many I'm building use
them straight away and I'm always good
to go I haven't had one problem with
eBay sellers yet and they do come in in
my opinion the cheapest out of any
sellers I wouldn't even be surprised if
some of these websites are buying keys
from these eBay sellers and then selling
them on their own websites and marking
it up three or four hundred percent and
now I'm sure there's gonna be people
asking about the validity of these keys
but I'm not a hundred percent certain on
where they come from all's I know is
that when I put the key into Windows and
go to activate it it works Windows says
that I've got a legit license of Windows
10 x64 Pro and I'm home and host also on
that note you can get these keys go to
the Microsoft website and if you've got
a USB key that's big enough you can then
make a curry
bootable Drive and then you can install
Windows even with the latest creators
updates so it saves a lot of time its
hassle free and of course it doesn't set
you back much at all especially if
you're into flipping and selling PCs you
can get these keys very cheap and
they're legit too anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comments section below
how do you get your Windows 10 licenses
or do you still use Windows 7 or Windows
8 love running your thoughts and
opinions as always and if you haven't
already don't forget to hit that sub
button and turn on email notifications
if you want the latest videos dropping
in your email box as soon as possible
because apparently YouTube is sometimes
not sending my videos to the viewers sub
boxes which is really weird I don't know
what's going on there but tomorrow I
will be dropping this 35 inch ultra wide
monitor review for you guys testing the
input lag and all that goodness and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon
peace out for now bye also I'll leave
the link in the description below for
the seller that I'm using to get my keys
off there does look like there are some
sellers coming in a little bit cheaper
I'm honestly not - game - try them
because I'm really happy currently with
the seller that I'm purchasing the keys
off haven't had one problem and as long
as that keeps going the way it's going
I'll just keep using them really happy
with the prices anyway guys see you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
