become and beside me here we've got a
fresh one this is the Gemini T coming at
169 USD and slated for a quarter three
release it does feature a lot of things
that other cases don't that one
particularly got RGB on the top and on
the front this is a preset controller
included and you've got hinged doors
opening that up reveals what's inside
the case up the top the ability to fit a
240 ml rad or to 120 ml fans at the
front 360 mil rat or 3 120mm fans also
there's a hard drive cage we can fit 2
3.5 inch mechanical drives you can
remove that however to fit in a 120 ml
rat or a 120 mil fan and then above that
is a plate where you can mount a 240 ml
rat or 1 to 120 ml fans and then the
rear of the case 120 mil rad or a 120mm
fan lots of options for mounting fans
and radiators as you can tell but at the
rear of the case there's also another
tempered glass door so that's 2 5 mil
tempered glass doors in total with a
vented top as well for that radiator at
the front you've got two removable dust
filters and at the bottom and you can
insert the power supply in and out from
the rear of the case there's also ample
room for cable management and an SSD
slot at the back of the case so that's 5
drives in total and then on the top of
the case there is a type-c connector as
well as to type a USB 3 ports and your
mic and head jack sets
mm 18s Computex coverage wouldn't be
possible without gigabyte or Corsair
bringing you the quality and also the
reliability that you need when building
a new PC now to the left of me is slated
for a quarter three release sue but this
is a totally different design two pcs in
one case and it's not that large
especially some of the other cases that
I have seen in the wild from other
companies and this one is called the
Gemini X you can fit in one mini ITX
built on one side and then on the other
side a full-size ATX build with
clearance of 140 ml for a tower cooler
or for a graphics card 350 mil now this
is coming in at 899 USD and it is an
in-house design just like some of other
Cougars previous cases that they have
released so it's all machined and tooled
at their own factory hence why it is
usually a lot more expensive than their
other cases however it is catering
towards a very unique design and a
unique market it also features tempered
glass throughout the build and also pre
fit RGB LED strips as well also with the
Gemini you can fit in to 240 ml rads on
each side of the case so a total of 4 if
you wish to as well as 5 120 ml fans so
for a total of 10 fans in total and
they're not just releasing some new
cases there's also a chair that's going
to come in at 369 in quarter three as
well originally only in the black and
orange
however this like any other chair of a
high price range does have a really
comfortable feel to it you've also got
PVC leather hide adjustable and you can
move it down like most of those gaming
chairs that go all the way down and do
that fancy stuff too so now here's some
flagship vortex RGB SPB 120mm fans from
cougar they're going to be coming in at
$24 for a single piece or 89 for the
3-pack you do get the remote and
controller included with that as for the
aesthetics on the rear you've got the
outer ring shining through but on the
both sides you'll be able to see the
inner ring with those 24 LEDs in total
on this particular model and what we're
looking at here is a 240 mil rad that is
going to be coming out in early
September for around about $150 of
course you get to ring fans included and
the light itself on the
block is addressable RGB so it's looking
like it'll bring in ascetics and
hopefully the cooling performance does
match that of other competitors
all-in-ones if not be better so the last
new product coming in quarter three from
cougar is the dive this is a 7.1 virtual
surround emulator as well as a DAC which
can replace that of your onboard audio
especially in an old build if you've got
a real crummy sound card or really
crummy onboard audio you can actually
boost the volume as well as plug in your
headset and be whisper-quiet as it does
plug into your computer via USB so if
your computer is susceptible to static
noise this can replace that and at 25
bucks it's not gonna be breaking the
bank either so now on the last of the
products from cougar is a very unique
keyboard and why it's unique is it's got
two speakers included and the plan here
is to immerse with your current speaker
set so if you only want to get voice
from teamspeak for example or discord
they can send it through the keyboard
speakers to leave your gaming headset or
your gaming speakers just for the audio
in game now slated to be released at 140
dollars of course including Cherry MX
switches and it's coming in at quarter
four so the dates aren't final yet
neither is the pricing it's still in the
concept development stages but it does
look very good and the addition of this
speaker could really bring something new
to the game here from Cougar and that
about wraps it up for the Cougar booth
here in 2018 Computex but I am holding
something that is in concept as well
this is a full alloy keyboard aluminium
and it's really heavy like the whole
thing is made just of solid aluminium
this thing is a brick I think at least
weigh about three kilo now they are
seriously thinking of releasing it so if
you want to see something like this
released let us know in the comment
section below and I'll get back on show
Coogler be reading in the comment
section below and if you enjoyed this
one then be sure to hit that like button
