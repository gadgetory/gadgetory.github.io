announcement and release,
you guys have requested that
I do an optimization guide,
which I've done, and I'll put
the link up here for that.
But also, on top of that,
there's a heap of new changes
that didn't get mentioned in that guide.
And today we're gonna go through
all those different changes,
starting with appearance.
First up here, we have the
new optional light theme.
It actually looks pretty cool,
if you don't mind me saying
and Windows Explorer also has a new icon.
And the Power Menu has received icons too,
which will have a small orange dot
if there's an update pending.
There's a new default wallpaper too.
So this is actually
welcomed in the fact that
you know that you've
actually updated to 1903,
when in previous Windows versions,
if you've updated, you're like,
&quot;Okay, am I actually on the
new Windows update or not?&quot;
This wallpaper officially lets you know
that Microsoft is mining
your data yet again.
On top of that, you've also
got a new look Game Bar,
but you can also change your pointer color
in the settings to custom colors.
Wow.
But what else is new in these changes?
Let's roll that intro
and also today's video sponsor SCDKeys,
where if you want a
legit Windows 10 Pro Key,
you can get it for as little as $13
by using the coupon
code TYCSK from the link
in the description below.
♪ I wish that I was a madman ♪
♪ So bad maybe-- ♪
With that aside, let's get on with
the Settings app changes here.
And the Storage page is now more visual
to show what is taking up space.
There's also been more work
towards merging control panels
into the Settings apps themselves,
so you don't have to go down
and find individual setting menus
that has sort of been fragmented
in previous versions of Windows.
But there's also a drag and
drop now to install fonts.
This does make life a bit easier, I guess.
Then next up, we got the
microphone icon in the Taskbar,
which shows you when it's being used.
So you visually know that your
microphone's turned on or off
and if apps are actually using
that in the background too.
The Camera page in the app
Settings is also showing now
which apps are using that Camera,
whether it be actively or passively,
and you can now configure a
static IP and DNS server address
for Ethernet connections
in the Property page.
But moving along, you can
also have defragmentation
available through the Storage
page of the Settings app.
Also setting up the
alternate sign-in options
is now more clear.
There's also a new search
section in the Settings app
to control if explicit
content will be shown
and if it will search the Cloud.
So, those parents that love
a particular type of video...
might now have some
layer of protection.
There's also added options and information
about indexing on Windows
and a new voice activation
page in the Settings app
to control Settings is also available.
There's the new Phone Calls page
to allow or block apps
from making phone calls,
if you're using this device, for instance,
with an eSIM or a SIM card
that may help actively
manage your Windows phone.
However, moving now onto
keyboard tweaks, touch input.
So if you're on a tablet
with a touchscreen,
this will now adjust the
hitbox of your virtual keyboard
to pretty much optimize the
accuracy, making it easier.
Also, holding down the Windows key
and pressing the dot at the same time
now brings you up a panel
supporting the emoji 12 standard.
Windows keyboard now also includes symbols
and Windows can optionally
suggest Autocorrections
for a physical keyboard.
There's also new phonetic keyboards for
Hindi, Bangla, Tamil,
Marathi, Punjabi, Gujarati,
Odia, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam.
I butchered the pronunciation here guys,
so I'm just gonna put them
up on the screen for you,
but there's also support for
Adlam, Osage, Vietnamese Telex
and VNI Number based inputs.
Moving onto features, there's
the Sandbox on demand VM
for running apps securely
and independently.
There's also the new Clipboard
history tool, Windows + V.
I actually really love this
because I do copy paste things a lot
and having a record and
being able to select things
that I copy pasted, three copy pastes ago,
makes life a lot easier.
You can now also launch Desktop,
and I'm pretty sure this means
the Microsoft Store
applications and mixed realities
such as Spotify, Paint.NET
and Visual Studio Code.
So besides the new features,
there's added on features
which work differently now
to the previous features that existed
in previous versions of Windows
and, for example, a few extra
options in Snip &amp;amp; Sketch.
Windows 10 also now
supports raw images natively
such as CR2 and CRW for Canon,
NEF for Nikon, RAF for Fuji,
DNG for Sony et cetera.
The library is provided by LibRaw.org
and Windows Defender now has
Tamper Protection and Application Guard
and you can now set the
default tab in Task Manager.
Also your Downloads in Windows
Explorer are now sorted
and categorized by date,
with recent first by default
on the Download page itself.
Now onto the next section
of Windows Installer.
Windows 10 Setup background is
now white instead of purple.
Cortana is now silent by default
in the Windows Installer.
Thank...
Also in Apps and Features,
more apps are now uninstallable
such as 3D Viewer, Calculator,
Calendar, Groove music, Mail,
Movies &amp;amp; TV, Paint 3D,
Snip &amp;amp; Sketch, Sticky Notes
and Voice Recorder.
If you're building a new PC,
also you'll now need 32
gigabytes of minimum disk space.
Existing devices won't be affected.
And Windows Update has received
some improvements in my opinion.
Windows 10 Pro can defer
updates now by up to 365 days.
You can also now pause updates
from previous Windows Updates page
and you can now pause all
those updates on Windows 10
by up to 35 days before you
must install the latest update
after which you can pause again.
But other than that, Windows
can now automatically
uninstall updates if your PC
can't boot after updating.
Updates will still not update
during the active hours,
but Windows can now automatically
adjust your active hours
based on your device history too,
so if it detects that there's a low season
during the day automatically
for doing work,
it can then update during those times.
But it is of course, will
enable a background service
which I'm not a big fan of personally.
If it's not already enabled.
Now onto the last of optimizations
in terms of firstly, Windows Narrator.
They've apparently
optimized and improved this,
I'd never used Narrator
so I wouldn't know.
Windows will now remember also
your brightness regardless of
if you're plugged in or off battery,
which is pretty interesting
for Windows tablet or laptop users,
especially on these low power devices,
so you may want to play
around with this setting
especially if you're
using this on the go a lot
and you quickly change the brightness.
There is a huge difference
between having your brightness
on max and on low brightness for a laptop,
mobility and battery usage,
but focus assist now turns on by default
when using full screen apps
and some Cortana tweaks and changes
have been made to Settings.
A brightness slider is now also visible
in the Action Center.
Sorry if that was quick,
there was a mountain of
different features and updates
and things to get through,
but now the last section is
the problems that are present.
And the first one being,
display brightness may not
respond to adjustments.
This also can occur in nightlight.
I had a weird problem
where I set automatically
and then I turned it off and
it just kept the brightness on
even though it was like 4 pm here,
so that's kind of a little
bit of a bug at the moment,
I'm sure they'll update that soon.
The audio not working with
Dolby Atmos headphones and home theater.
This is another problem
that's been identified.
There's also duplicate
folders and documents
showing in a user profile.
And the next one I've
encountered personally
and that is if you got a
USB storage device attached
or a SD card through a
memory card reader attached
and you're trying to update to 1903,
then it won't let you update,
so you gotta remove that,
then restart the update
process again which thankfully,
it doesn't remove all your downloads
like it has in the past.
But the next problem that is known is
unable to discover or
connect to Bluetooth devices.
Next stop if you're an Intel Audio device,
it can display some weird error,
like daud.sys notification
and then sometimes there can be
intermediate loss of Wifi connectivity too
and an AMD RAID driver
incompatibility also exists.
Next up in the line,
older versions of BattlEye
anti-cheat software
sometimes can be incompatible
and these are for Fortnite
and also PUBG, for example,
these games do use this anti-cheat system
so if you are having problems,
you will wanna update to the latest.
And then last up on the line is
Direct3D applications on rotated displays
may have trouble going
into full-screen mode.
And besides that,
that is all the features and
changes in Windows 10, 1903.
