recording and you don't know which
microphone to use well Blue Microphones
sent in their Yeti boat the silver and
black out version and today I'm going to
be comparing them against all the other
microphones that I use here on the
channel so it's gonna be a very intense
showdown but before we get into this
comparison I will preface by saying all
the microphones that are going to be
featured in the comparison are in a
different league
compared to you very cheap $5
microphones here's what a $5 microphone
will sound like you could probably hear
the difference already that all the
microphones in today's comparison will
be in a different league - a really dirt
cheap microphone like this one that I'm
using right here so with that aside
let's take a look at the blue Yeti and
see how it fares welcome back to tokyo
city we have four different microphones
up for comparison here today first of
all the level ii microphone which i use
in all my normal regular videos this is
the micro lab by H&amp;amp;M very good
microphone if you're into recording
directly into your camera then of course
we've got the blue yeti microphone which
comes in at 119 us currently or you can
pick it up in australia for 169
australian dollars then we also have the
V 67 which is going through a compressor
the U a 25 X this is my choice will
currently my choice for streaming when I
do streams for you guys and then lastly
we have the audio technica bhp s one
fantastic microphone if you've got a lot
of background noise since it is a
dynamic it will cancel out a lot of
background noise as opposed to the other
three microphones that I'm using here
today they are condensers so they will
pick up a lot more background noise but
with that aside let's get that
comparison underway
good morning evening or night time
depending on where you are around the
world this is what the blue yeti
microphone will sound like just straight
out of the box no settings configured at
all except I have changed it to the
cardioid pattern so this is the standard
pattern talking about 10 centimetres
away from the microphone so let's switch
over to the other three modes on this
microphone so here's what the
omnidirectional setting will sound like
this is a mode that's essentially meant
to pick up everything in the room it's
mainly not a good setting for streaming
now the blue Yeti also features a mode
called stereo this is
what it will sound like talking at the
same distance and the last mode that the
yeti features is bi-directional this is
great if you've got two people on either
side of the microphone doing an
interview for example me on this side
talking the way I am and you've got
someone else on the other side of the
microphone talking like this next up is
the MX LV 67 this is a microphone that I
use for the majority of my live streams
it's going through the you a 25 X at a
roll and this has also got a compressor
built on board next up on the list is
the audio technica BP do you even H Pro
s1 that this is a headset that I took a
look at in a vlog that I did earlier and
it's essentially a dynamic microphone
and it's going through that same edirol
you a 25 X so this is what this will
sound like so now here's the level ii
microphone that i use for all my
recordings on my main videos on the
channel so this is a good little
comparison because i'm sitting in the
exact same position as i am with all the
other microphones so there's a
comparison done for you guys i'll let
your ears be the judge I don't want to
introduce any bias but I will give my
opinion on the matter and I think that
the V 67 was the deepest or warmest
microphone out of the four I thought the
audio technica
of course being a dynamic was a little
bit less warm than the other three
microphones the blue Yeti was right in
the middle is actually a little bit
closer to the warmer side so it's got a
fantastic sound out of the box and now
this is where things get very tricky
with audio because what sounds good to
me might not sound good to you I think
for me streaming personally the V 67
really gives that broadcaster feel it
just is an awesome microphone running
through that you a 25 X that I've got of
course the blue Yeti will probably be
better for a lot of other people's
voices especially if you've got a deeper
voice than I do so I absolutely love the
sound coming out of the blue Yeti it's
an all-in-one package USB powered you
get a three-meter included cable you
don't have to mess around with any other
settings you just plug this thing in
you've even got that USB headphone port
so you can bypass your onboard audio you
can completely disable it if you want to
you won't need a sound card anymore and
you'll get fantastic audio both
recording into the ADC and listening out
via the DAC now the microphone itself it
comes in two
1.4 kilograms in ways pretty much
exactly the same as the V 67 on that
stand that I chose for us so very nice
weight very solid all-metal construction
to the Yeti itself you get the mute
button on the front as well which you'll
instantly mute your microphone great if
you're streaming got the volume control
in the front for the audio and on the
back you've got the gain control which
on this comparison I did set very low so
it does have a lot of extra power at its
disposal to kill those four different
modes as well which is labeled very
easily on the box so you can identify
which pattern will be good for you
you've got um need errection all you've
got stereo bi-directional and also
cardioid so to be great for people who
also want to produce music and not just
broadcast or do voiceovers now of course
are there any weaknesses with the blue
Yeti microphone well going from top to
bottom I really don't see anything that
I don't like about this microphone the
black version I had here for some reason
had the logo upside down I don't know if
that's just blue Yeti trying to crack a
joke with me being down in Australia but
well played because I do get to keep the
black one and I have to send the silver
one back so that was kind of funny to
see that and on the bottom of the stand
you also get grips as well so it will
grip any surface really well and of
course the simplicity and use of
Eastwood this microphone is sure to win
a lot of people over one thing that I
forgot to touch on as well with the V 67
versus marked friend they did sound
pretty similar however I thought the V
67 was introducing a little bit of more
bass I noticed the subwoofer when I
listened back on my Z 906 it was
introducing a bit of bass and that was
starting to shake my desk so as I said
before the V 67 was a very deep tone the
Yeti was a very balanced condenser
microphone I absolutely loved what was
coming out of this thing for 119 us
currently 169 AUD it's a really nice
microphone also another thing that I'll
talk about in this review that's quickly
I haven't really talked about in the
past with the channel is acoustic
geometry so if you get this microphone
or you get any other microphone and it
sounds terrible to what the person in
the review has then you might want to
look at the actual geometry in your room
of how the sound is bouncing off the
walls as you saw behind me here I did
have sound tiles so I did have a set up
that
is good initially for recording audio if
you guys have seen my studio creation
vlogs you'll know when I just had the
concrete walls in this room I had to
actually step outside and do my audio
recording because the reflections were
just so bad so I will put a link in the
description below for you guys where you
can just see the differences with
acoustic geometry and it's a really good
eye-opener video in my opinion if you're
just getting into professional
recordings and that's about it really
with this microphone I actually didn't
mention it's a 14 millimeter capsule as
well and it does have a threaded mount
on the bottom of the microphone so if
you wish to use a different stand then
you can remove it from this stand and
plug it on to a different custom stand
if you wish to there's also a lot of
different colours available for some
reason I was really loving the black and
red themed microphone I think that would
go well on the streaming desk so I
actually love to try that out
perhaps blue Yeti can swap me the black
one for the black and red one anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed today's
comparison if you did then be sure to
hit that like button let me know in the
description below which microphone you
liked best out of the four and also why
or perhaps you might have liked the five
dollar microphone I don't know but I
look forward to catching you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
