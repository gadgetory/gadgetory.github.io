Branca my back to you guys today with
some gameplay commentary over a game
called cars to now I just picked this
game up and I wanted to start playing
with my little boy when he's old enough
to play video games and it's kind of a
friendly fun game so I'm kind of
enjoying it even though I'm still a noob
at it but I wanted to talk to you guys
about CPU cache it's more it says
something that's an interesting topic to
me because it's something that I've
noticed especially with this year when
I've come through three different still
actually five different CPUs but more
typically I've tested the FX 8320 I
tested the i-5 for 670 gay and I've
tested now the 5820k and it kind of
feels to me like the more level 3 case
you have on board the CPU the better it
is for gaming whether it actually
affects FPS or not so in the past I mean
Tom's have done a great article where
they've tested two CPUs pretty much
identical except the one CPU had no
level 3 cache on board and it actually
made a direct difference to frame rates
but what I'm more interested in is does
level 3 cache affect actual frame
latencies as well that's something I
really want to test so maybe I can maybe
pit a to a dual core pentium against my
i-5 for 670 K with half its cores
disabled I think that would give some
interesting results so if you guys want
to see a test like this let me know in
the comments below I think it'd be
pretty interesting actually testing the
frame latencies and does it affect
smoothness of gameplay but is one thing
I've noticed with my 5820k is how it's
just butter smooth and everything like I
never get a hiccup in pretty much any
game now with my GTX 970 it's just an
absolute butter smooth experience and I
can recommend it to people who have I
guess a bit of extra money to blow but I
mean honestly is it worth an extra 4 or
$500 and the additional costs over an fx
rig or an i5 rig certainly not it I mean
the i-5 and the FX 8320 played games
perfectly well it's one thing I wanted
to talk about two of the FX 8320 it felt
like you know in the rare occasion when
the games was sort of framed for frame
when the i5 @ 1080p was the same frames
as the FX 8320 it felt like the FX was
slightly smoother and it's something
that I didn't really mention in my in my
benchmarking but now that I've got 5820k
I kind of confirmed that yeah the more
cash you have on C
for you the better it is for gaming in
my opinion I just have to get more solid
tests and more solid results with maybe
frame latency but the FX 8320 wasn't a
bad cpu for gaming it's just the problem
with the FX series as was the IPC's
especially unless cpu single or dual
core games that really let the FX series
that IPC really let the FX cpu down but
on multi-core games like I mean
multi-threaded games like Battlefield 4
it was pretty it was okay it was good as
a good gaming experience on that CPU but
so another thing that kind of supports
my theory that it affects smoothness of
gameplay is that a few people have
messaged me saying that they're only 760
K the AMD sort of four core CPU with no
level three cache and they're telling me
that their gaming experience absolutely
sucks on this CPU and I've had a few
messages now it's kind of similar with
this and there and I mean this CPU if
you look at it it's it's I mean it looks
like good value for money on the surface
however it doesn't have any level three
cache at all so maybe if you're on a 760
K you can put your experience in the
comment section below that's if you've
tried say an i7 or something or an i5
you try to step up CPU as well so let me
know because a lot of people have been
messaging me saying that yeah they're on
these budget CPUs and they're not
getting a game good gaming experience
even coupled with something like an R 7
OS are in r9 270x so that's something
that I'd really like to test as well
maybe I should get my hands on a 7 60 K
and let you guys know if this CPU is
actually a good CPU for gaming so yeah
level 3 cache I do believe it is an
important factor in especially for games
and I mean level 2 occasion level 1
cache they're pretty important as well I
mean you look at the skyrim benchmarks
that I did with the 4 670 K versus the 3
570 K and that kind of yielded some big
increases in Skyrim which is kind of a
CPU cache dependent game so CPU cache
definitely makes a difference for gaming
just I would like to test how much
especially when it comes to frame lenses
so guys I hope you enjoyed this sort of
vlog commentary about CPU cache I do
want to do some more research on it and
if you like this commentary please give
it a thumbs up
if you have any experiences or you have
any of your own tests and please share
them in the comment section below and
I'll get back to you guys as soon as I
can anyway I'm going to go now and I
guess I might play some more cars to
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
