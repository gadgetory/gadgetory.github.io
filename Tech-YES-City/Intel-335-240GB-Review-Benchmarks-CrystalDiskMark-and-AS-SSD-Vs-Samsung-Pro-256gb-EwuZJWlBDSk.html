brownies you coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing and full review
of the intel SSD 335 series 240 gigabyte
model now i'm going to say first thing
is first intel pack this thing really
well i just recently reviewed my toshiba
256 gigabyte SSD and now that thing came
packaged reasonably well however I you
know probably us probably wondering why
don't you using that well I benchmarked
it i started using from like a day it
started having stuttering problems and i
was just like that I'm just
returning it and I got this instead the
intel SSD 325 this was going out for a
hundred and seventy dollars and the
samsung pro 250 gb what 5256 Cuba was
about 230 dolls so this thing is sixty
dollars cheaper I'm in it for the right
speeds this thing from all the reviews
i've read has solid write speeds and
I'll get on to that later with the tests
and this is what we get in the package
first so we get this a really nice it's
as soon as you open the package you can
see why intel have such low failure
rates on their SSDs is because it comes
so well packaged you also get the
factory Intel seal which comes here so I
already taken mine off but if yours does
not have that that means someone has
opened your SSD in the process of
getting the factory to your house so
make sure you look out for the genuine
intel seal make sure it's still on that
when you get your SSD from intel now
when you open the package you can just
see it just comes it's a heavy package
it comes with this bracket which this
thing man you could probably use this as
i don't know like a tool for building a
house it is just so strong as i mean
like if I I mean I could you know
slightly I can slightly bend it but I
mean it is solid like it is one solid
bracket that think this thing is solid
one of the most solid SSD brackets of
felt it's huge you get asada a three
cable with it as well so it's really
good molex to SATA power adapter if you
need that you also get the installation
guide and warranty manual in there yet
also a little guard there you get
brackets and screws you get the speed
demon decal this thing that she looks
really cool i like the look of it like
I'm actual
use this on one of my cases I don't know
which one but it'll get it certainly
gets slapped on one of them and this is
the SSD itself is the most important
part and just see the finish on it it's
made of metal so the casing steel and it
feels absolutely amazing the SSD feels
solid like it's a you pick it up and
it's like hey you're actually getting a
product what are the SSDs I've picked up
have just been like featherweight this
thing actually has a little bit of
weight to it and I like that it's got
the nice and tell logo there it looks
really good the finish on this side is
amazing it's really smooth however if
you turn it over it's like I don't know
what they're doing with the finish on
this side is like they've just you know
standard the back of the factory oh yeah
this just whack a sticker on it send it
out so this sides actually the finish is
pretty bad on this side but that's not
to worry because no one's really going
to see this side of your SSD so I like
that they've just you know save time and
costing a cutting costs which is really
good in a smart way so that's that guy's
that's the product there I'm going to
run this thing through a few benchmarks
and I'll give you guys the ultimatum on
this product now there is the 525 series
which is coming out recently I think
that's more for laptops from what i read
this thing is definitely a desktop SSD
and it's pretty huge so let's get on
with the benchmarks anyway so moving on
to benchmarks the first benchmark is a
sssd now this is just a basic benchmark
test your SSD and gives you a score on
both read and write and gives you an
overall score so it's very just a very
good program for quickly testing and
getting a general idea of how faster SSD
is now straight away you'll notice that
the read speeds on the Intel 335 240 you
but I'm not that impressive but the
reeds be I mean the write speeds however
are very impressive it's school 355 and
as you guys may have watched in my
toshiba 256 gigabyte review I'm mainly
concerned with write speeds I am not too
concerned to read speeds so the read
speeds are adequate and but the write
speeds are very impressive on this Drive
and not to mention as soon as you just
pick this drive up you just it just
oozes quality so i tested as numerous
I just gave consistent results it just
feels like a solid drive i mean there's
absolutely no problem so far with it and
yeah great choice especially for a
hundred and seventy dollars now moving
on to the toshiba this is the drive that
i previously thought you can see that
the read speeds were monster they were
pretty damn quick they were pretty much
like the samsung pro but i found the
right speeds were lacking and just yet
didn't I mean they're not lacking
they're still very very quick but the
random 4k rights for example weren't
even like faster than my corsair force
320 gigabytes so that was a bit of a
letdown so when this thing started
having stuttering problems I just
returned it to the store and I say
myself 30 dolls and got the Intel 335 so
awesome anyway it comes with the 3-year
warranty but let's move on to some other
benchmarks the next program is a program
called crystal dis mark and this just
tests the drive numerous time so I
actually tested this five times and it
already tested five times so I
essentially tested 25 times and it gives
the you'll notice that the 4k read and
rights are impressive they're pretty
damn good and that's what I'm looking
for i'm looking for consistent solid
performance and the until 3 35
definitely delivers there now sorry on
the warranty yes its three-year warranty
but the toshiba was also three-year
warranty the samsung pro has a five year
warranty but that's an extra 60 dollars
so i don't think it really warrants that
extra sixty dollars in this case but it
does have faster speeds as well but this
is very impressive so we'll move on to
the toshiba and you can see here that
the right speeds are just lacking i mean
it's the 4k reading rights are pretty
bad i'm in my opinion the sequential
read and rights are great that as we
know on a desktop power machine these
sequential read and rights aren't that
important unless of course you're just
rendering videos day in day out and that
will be important then but and you know
an antec and all these major SSD review
sites when they reviewed the SSDs it
showed that the 4k reading rights with
the mostly compromised like ninety
percent of SSD usage so yeah that's that
now the yeah so the toshiba just wasn't
impressive
in the areas where it needed to be the
Intel 335 was impressive in the areas
where it needed to be now moving on to
the Samsung 256 gigabyte per 0 this
thing as you can see it's just beastmode
it just destroys every benchmark there
is the 4k reading writes a very
impressive the sequential read and
writes the queue depth of 30 to the
reading rights they're very impressive
as well so this thing overall is just an
impressive SSD you know but the thing
was is that it was when I returned my
toshiba this thing went up and priced
like 230 dollars the Intel 335 was only
a hundred seventy dollars so i went with
that and i'm going to say that i am very
impressed with the intel 335 it delivers
in the areas where i need it to deliver
in and not to mention the whole start to
finish with the intel SSD is just
consistently good so i think if you want
to go with an SSD and it's what i read
with a lot of reviews or a lot of people
who buy the intel is that they're right
you you know it doesn't score as well as
the other SSDs but everything is just
consistently good with the Intel so
ultimately i'm going to recommend this
product because i've been running it for
over a day it's absolutely fine it's
hasn't had one hiccup it just works the
when i unboxed it it was just an amazing
product it felt great as well i was very
impressed and so it just yet overall i'm
going to recommend this thing if you
especially if you can pick it up cheaper
than what the other competitors are
offering and i highly recommend this
product and yeah guess so if you have
any questions about this product please
