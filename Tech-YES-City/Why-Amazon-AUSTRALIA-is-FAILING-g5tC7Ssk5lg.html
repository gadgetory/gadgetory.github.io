now they're the global online retail
that in 2017 turned over 177 billion
dollars and as of now is valued at close
to 1 trillion dollars they're a massive
success in the u.s. Japan UK and EU but
what have Amazon in Australia done wrong
and what should you buy from them if you
are a Z the answers might shock you
so quick to on the website shows that
it's functional clean and serves where
you want to see but let's be real
pricing Amazon usually have the best
prices and the service is simple quick
and super easy to fix if you come into
problems but back to that price factor
it is ultimately the make-or-break take
for example this GT X 1080 Strix comes
in at 855 Australian dollars including
delivery which is more expensive than
all local Australian retails which are
selling around $850 max and that's in
your hands right then and there meaning
the other retailers have the item
actually in stock not to mention in the
US it's five hundred and thirty US
dollars or seven hundred and twenty six
ozzie equivalent dollars on top of the
price there is also a three week
delivery time but if you want cheaper
parts of the cost of shipping time you
can get the same GT X 1080 Strix for
$7.99 was shipping within the week I've
even seen those prices drop as low as
730 Ozzie with recent eBay sales and
let's pause right there eBay
they've been dominating Australia for
quite a while now we're in 2017 they had
total online sales of roughly four point
six four percent of Australia total
retail trade
that's all trade and in Australia alone
made six and a half billion dollars in
total revenue which is over fifty three
percent of total online trade excluding
food they constantly have five ten or
even twenty percent coupon codes that
brings costs of popular electronics down
under that of even most volume
orientated Australian retailers and
sometimes even beating that of us prices
so it seems that eBay is determined not
to let Amazon even get a foot in the
door so to speak when it comes to the
promised Aussie land of the consumer
they probably be asking yourself if
prices are higher and I have to wait
three weeks for shipping then what's the
point of even using Amazon well for
those items in particular I think it's a
clear miss but surprisingly the savings
start to come into play when you would
look for the smaller things that you
would usually go and pay full price for
one example of this is video games but
let's say you're a console player
god forbid gave them bless my soul but
let's say you want to buy some physical
games normally without thinking you
would go to the store like JB hi-fi
harvey norman eb games or maybe even Big
W if that tickles your fancy you
wouldn't normally consider buying
physical media online otherwise you
might as well just buy an online version
right wrong
take for instance Gran Turismo on the
ps4 for example EB games being the most
expensive at $100 ebay coming in at
second with $29 and harvey norman big w
and JB hi-fi all coming in around 24 or
25 bucks now let's quickly check Amazon
Estrella wait no that can't be right
12 bucks with free three-day shipping
from the official Amazon au Store now
there is a deal let's give it the
benefit of the doubt let's see Detroit
become human hundred dollars fifty four
49 and here comes Amazon a $44 marvel
spiderman $100 pick-up 79 pick-up 79
pick-up 77 posted and Amazon Ian again
with the best price of $69 shipped ok so
games are definitely cheaper but what
about the consoles themselves ps4 slim
one terabyte black no games no flash one
day base lzb
509 jb and big w 479 now amazon at four
hundred and fifty nine dollars well uh
my god so cheap be quicker they might
sell out quickly
it's a console right now I haven't
included eBay in these sales because
Sony don't have an official store there
so you'll have to wait for a reseller
which may not get you the best price on
a new system though other things are
certainly coming in cheaper than
retailers - like DVDs and keyboards and
also say this g502 Mouse so the deals
are definitely there the postage time is
definitely there for some things but how
is it that the Sydney Morning Herald
reported that Amazon Australia ran at an
estimated 8.9 million dollar loss in
2017 we can definitely see the
limitations of Amazon Australia when
they're shipping from amazon us like the
thread ripper 2990 WX of course they
won't have stock just sitting around in
australia but that right there is the
problem because now amazon have a
similar price to the Aussie retailers
but include five hundred and ten dollars
of import tax and $20 shipping and that
will take four weeks to get to you
clearly not worth it but at the same
time I think the biggest part of
Amazon's flops
so far in Australia is that the lack of
clear marketing showing people that they
can get great deals with Express
shipping to their door but also
partnering with local retailers to have
all bases covered when it comes to
having decent priced items on pretty
much any item you can think of and for
me personally this is what I think gets
me I don't want to check a site and
waste time if they're continually going
to be hit and miss if I go on eBay on
the flip side I know I'm going to
usually get either the best price or
somewhere near the best price and this
is a huge factor that Amazon has to
consider if they want people to
continually come back to this site that
is they have to build loyalty they'll
know the problem still exists here as
well and that is the Aussie consumer
we're just like any other country's
resident is to someone else
different Ozzy's love a good bargain and
even if it's not a super oh my god clear
out bargain I have to get this now we
still like to think that we are getting
some kind of discount no matter how
small it is
so eBay definitely cater to this craving
and they have the market as we say down
pat though going forward for Amazon I
don't think we're at this point where
you can order food with same-day
delivery
nor can we do that on eBay really well
not that you'd want it why though to be
honest I haven't tried it yet but I
guess I just prefer my food local but of
course for other items that a lot of
Aussies would otherwise want Amazon
still seems to be just to hit and miss
and in an age of digital perfection
anything less just won't suffice so
going forward from here it is pretty
clear that Amazon have a really tough
road ahead of them competing with eBay
Australia eBay have gained not just the
loyalty for auctions but also for Buy It
Now and making digital stores come to
their marketplace to really have
established a trust relationship with
the consumer that's going to be really
hard for Amazon to beat but if Amazon do
want to compete then they really in my
opinion have to get the consistency
right anyway I hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let us know in the
comments section below why do you think
Amazon is having a tough time in
Australia as always love reading your
thoughts and opinions and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
