CES 2019 in Las Vegas Nevada they have a
few new motherboards on display some
which are gonna be released very soon
some which in the next month the first
of which in the next month is the Steel
Legend series on the B 450 motherboards
for a m4 and they've got here the B 450
M as well as the full-sized variant
these have essentially a beefed up
design on the vrm with better caps on
board also a better aesthetic with that
camo look coming into play so if you're
a pop G fan and for instance you want a
motherboard to go with your fascination
then this is certainly gonna please you
no matter what
as for pricing I'll keep you guys
updated in the description but right
beside that is a very interesting new
chipset not exactly a popular one but a
little bit different so let's take a
look
won't matter JG City we heard the rumors
of the 14 nanometer shortage and it is
coming into play now with a chipset
being released to accommodate that
shortage this is the b-36 5 m and also
normal sized variants they feature a 22
nanometer design on the chipset itself
losing that of the USB 3.1 gen2 however
asrock have countered this with a unique
design on the phantom gaming 4 series
where they've added in their own USB 3.1
gen2 chip they've also added in a beefed
up v RM 12 khz con capacitors as well as
a sleek design on the right hand side of
the board with a very unique design I
must say if you guys are into sort of
accents and different kind of curves
then this is surely gonna look good in
any case you wish to put it in in terms
of release dates for the phantom gaming
be 365 M that is going to be early
February the price is still yet to be
determined but one thing about these
boards is they will indeed support the
9900 K they've got a phase V RMS but
they've also got a mini ITX solution
with onboard AC Wireless and that's got
a five phase vrm and that's touted to
even support the 9900 k2 which I will be
putting to the test so definitely stay
tuned on the channel and then last on
the line with these motherboards is the
pro 4 which is coming out also on the be
365 line they've got the M variant and
the full-size variant but you may notice
a big aesthetic upgrade here with a big
chunk of metal over the VRMs that
deliver power to the CPU then we've got
the m2 heatsink which is even thicker
than some of the other designs i've seen
on other azrog boards and other
manufacturers and then a beefy steel
heatsink on the chip set itself maybe
with that 22 nanometer running a tad bit
hotter it might indeed need it and in
terms of the availability with the pro 4
you can look at the end of January so in
about two weeks time release date for
this board prices are still yet to be
confirmed but I'm told they'll be
roughly around $90 for the full size
variant USD MSRP and then for the M
variant shave about $10 off for that and
now coming out of CES is also a new
alliance from asrock with their phantom
gaming series going in combination with
team group and
so Coolermaster to give out some unique
designs on memory as well as SSDs as
well as RAM and what we got right beside
me here the K 500 Coolermaster case with
the mesh front panel and then behind me
they've also got the HP 500 with its
mesh front panel as well so basically
the whole theme of this is if you want
to match up your case with a phantom
gaming graphics card as well as
motherboard then you'll have the whole
combination from start to finish with
this lineup of products now in terms of
pricing and availability with these two
cases we're looking at around early
February this one here the HP 500 mesh
with the three RGB fans included is
going to look like it's costing around
170 dollars and then the K 500 with its
included RGB fans I'm told is gonna cost
around 85 USD and if you guys remember
Computex 2018 there was the team force
delts or RGB SSDs these are the phantom
gaming variant of course they've just
got that aesthetic added onboard you can
get into 250 or 500 gigabyte flavor or
even a one terabyte variant in terms of
availability they were actually already
out on the market as of CES 2019 and
they're moving on to the memory which is
of course very important for Verizon
they've got the phantom gaming in thirty
two hundred megahertz flavor 3600 and
also four thousand so pretty much the
same as the Excalibur RGB that has
already existed and you get that phantom
gaming aesthetic which does look pretty
sleek I'm gonna be honest I like the
graphics card look if you combine this
all together I'm very keen to see what a
build would look like at my home on my
desk replacing the air 540 which I don't
know if I'm ready to replace it yet and
that's all we've got here at the asrock
booth to CES 2019 I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
the new motherboards what you think of
the PGA we're not talking about the golf
we're talking about the Phantom gaming
alliance and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now Bay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
