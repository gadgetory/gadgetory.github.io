pc where you simply build it you take a
picture of it and you go to the clubs
you show everyone guaranteed bitches
ladies and gentleman welcome back to
take a city for june of 2015 and today
we have a budget of seventeen hundred
dollars for australian UK as well
they're more expensive i'll put the
links in the description below for those
two builds as well however today is
going to be one huge gaming PC this
thing is freaking amazing like this will
play every single game you can throw at
it and it'll do it so it's pretty much a
high-end gaming PC not only that we've
got a really strong CPU in there if you
want to do video editing if you wanted
to production whatever watch porn stream
games render a video and talk to your
mom all at the same time this thing can
do it so for the CPU were going with an
i7 5820 k now this is a 6 quart 12
threaded beast now this thing is
overkill for gaming and I will state
that already however with the i747 90 k
being price of around three hundred and
twenty dollars I see this as a no
brainer you spend an extra fifty dollars
you're getting two more calls and four
more threads so it's an absolute beast
of a cpu for the money and i think with
that being said I think the i 747 90k
needs to come down in price as this
thing completely Trump's it for value so
for the cpu cooler we're going with the
cooler master 612 this thing is a big
cpu cooler and if forty dollars it's
going to do a fine job of cooling that
5820 k at 42 4.4 gigs it depends on how
good of a cpu you get really well if you
get a bad cpu like me you might only be
able to get it up to really 4.2 gigs at
decent voltages though if you get a good
cpu I can see you're getting 4.4 gigs at
around 1.2 5 volt maybe so if that's the
case kudos to you you won the silicon
lottery so for the motherboard we're
going with an x 99 asrock extreme3 and
now what can i say for one hundred and
sixty dollars this is entering that
territory of good value for money and i
never thought i'd say this about an x 99
motherboard now what you're getting is
you're getting a good on-board audio
solution as well i think they use the
purity audio too and i've got this on my
asrock extreme6 at the moment and it's
really good they've also got the Intel
and I see they're pretty much the best
you can get on a motherboard and not out
of that you've got a decent vrm which is
what the 58 20k needs all that for one
hundred and sixty dollars no-brainer if
a memory we're going with
ddr4 4 by 4 gigabyte sticks of memory
and for the money I mean for $125 there
really isn't that much of a premium over
ddr3 memory so I think now's the time if
you guys wanted to upgrade to this big
platform with memory prices and
motherboard prices coming down I think
it's a perfect time to get on the x 99
platform if you've always wanted to do
that so for the SSD we're going with a
crucial MX 100 256 gigabyte drive now
for under a hundred dollars this thing
is a no-brainer as well Wow I've got one
of these in my system at the moment and
it's my favorite SSD it's the best
value-for-money SSD you can get out
there considering you're getting the
Marvel controller on board so really
consists in SSD you're going to love it
especially if you wish to step up to
doing productivity with your machine
which this thing will be capable of
doing also on the notice storage will be
going with a western digital one
terabyte blue now this Drive needs no
introduction really good value for money
you're getting a lot of storage for your
dollar so this Drive will pretty much be
for putting those games that you don't
play that much as well as putting all
that extra stuff on there who knows
maybe you download porn right and put it
on your drive keep it for later all good
now on to the gravity are the most
important part of today's build and
we're going with a 980 TI from nvidia
this is the EVGA acx 2.0 plus edition
now this is a custom cooling solution so
it will be quieter than the reference
model which is generally what we want i
mean the quieter the better especially
if you don't have to pay a premium for
it now that the custom coolers generally
do a better job of keeping the GPU
cooler which means that you can
overclock higher which means that you're
getting more FPS feared dollar so EVGA
with one of the only custom coolers out
there at the moment definitely gets the
thumbs up so for the case we're going
with a bit of an unusual solution here
this is the animax full mo st with the
st standing for steel no not like
robbing people like metal steel though
at eighty dollars this thing literally
is a steal because you get 414
centimeter fans included which if I know
animax probably they do a really good
job of implementing quiet fans know that
it's a full sized ATX case so it is
going to be huge you're going to
a lot of room to work with this case and
not to mention animax have some of the
best cable management options especially
in terms of value for money cases then
it's made of steel so it's heavy it's
durable what more could you want for
eighty dollars stop for the power supply
we've got the EVGA supernova next this
is a 750 watt fully modular gold rated
power supply so this thing comes in at
eighty dollars after a mail-in rebate
though at that price even if it's a
hundred dollars it's still a great value
for money power supply so you're going
to need a really good power play and I
always recommend spending the extra
money on the power play because it's one
of your most important components that
you can keep for a long time even after
you've gotten rid of your 58 20k rig in
three years time you can still use this
seep power play so that's why I always
recommend investing in a good pals play
because it not only help you overclock
better it'll also be reliable you can
use it for future sake and you'll have
to worry about anything cutting out or
anything like that so I'm a big fan of
Overkill's power supplies this is one of
those and you've also got ruined there
for sli as well if you wish to do that
so that about wraps it up for today's
gaming PC guys also if you are in the UK
or Australia I've got you covered with
links in the description below albeit
they are much more expensive than the
states though that's I guess we're all
used to that by now especially for in
the tech community we all know that
America gets depressed prices so Kelly
and that's about a guy so if you enjoyed
this video please give it a thumbs up if
you have any questions or comments about
today's build and please drop a comment
in the comment section below and I will
catch you guys with another tech video
very soon oh yeah don't forget to hit
that like button peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
