180 city this is brian coming to you
guys today with a look at an SSD more
specifically two of them in raid zero
and how they perform this is the 600p
MDOT two nvme PCIe drive from intel the
256 gigabyte version that carries a
quite impressive five year warranty as a
silicon motion controller and can
theoretically do much higher speeds than
standard SSDs running over side of three
especially two of them in raid zero
which combines the drives for double the
speeds but at the expense of doubling
the potential failure rate in this
scenario however this is exactly what I
wanted to look at since they are really
cheap drives especially for being an m2
PCIe solution so in installing these
into my MSI titanium motherboard
installation went pretty smoothly and
even the first benchmark das SSD
benchmark which I consider more of a
standard consumer gamer benchmark did
quite well and pulled off some
impressive figures so when I got on to
the more intense benchmark HD tune Pro
which pretty much tells me everything I
need to know about a drive sensitizer
loads with a zero mix or random patterns
it produced some really really odd and
on that note quite terrible performance
figures it was so shocking in fact that
a standard hard drive would be a better
option if you were doing any kind of
intense file transfers or production
work for example copping many large
files from one drive to another this in
my opinion is unacceptable for two
reasons the first being in the real
world when you are putting this drive
through heavy workloads it will be
wasting your time and the second reason
being since something is clearly being
stressed too hard it can potentially
cause your drive or even the whole
computer to crash which in a work
environment is unacceptable as well but
you may be wondering why is this quite
simply something on this drive as being
overloaded of us said before whether it
be the cheaper TLC NAND flash memory the
memory buffer or the controller
I just can't simply recommend this drive
to anyone using it for a workstation in
mind though that is it maybe the SSD
benchmark school was still quite
impressive and if all you
want to do is game and/or have a very
snappy experience without doing any
intense file transfers and the drive is
going for a special price then I could
see this drive being a decent
recommendation though there are two
other MDOT two PCIe nvme solutions that
I've already tested here that is the
Corsair MP 500 and the a piece is e 280
both are currently a bit over $200 and
offer much faster speeds and have mlc
flash based memory and don't have any
performance issues when it comes to
consistency so I would recommend either
of these drives over the Intel solution
even with this one being in raid zero
unless of course you need to install the
small m dot two form factor and you are
on a strict budget so it may be an
option worth considering if the price
and usability of what you want from an
MDOT to SSD but for the better part
there are much faster and more
consistent MDOT 2 is already out there
albeit a bit more expensive and there
are of course 2.5 inch SATA 3 SSDs that
perform more consistently for the same
money so the form factor is really the
only thing going for this drive
anyway guys if you enjoyed this video
then don't forget to hit that like
button though if you dislike the video
then be sure to slam that dislike button
and I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon on also let me know in
the comment section below what you think
of the 600p from Intel I'd love to read
your comments and opinions as always I
mean would you just put two of these in
raid zero and then go tell your friends
about your Toph raid zero solution here
we go I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
