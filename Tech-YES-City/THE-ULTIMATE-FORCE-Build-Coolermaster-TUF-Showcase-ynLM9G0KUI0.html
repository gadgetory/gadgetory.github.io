the enthusiast tech game making anything
from coolers to cases to peripherals
however recently they've collaborated
with the Zeus on the Tough Series that's
tu F but one must start with cooler
masters strength of their products are
they really tough and more importantly
are they worth your hard earned let's
find out welcome back to tech yes City
I'm right here on the desk I have been
building a whole studio set up for
Coolermaster we've got a lot of
different products here we've got the MA
for 10m CPU cooler comes in around 60 US
dollars in Australia it's actually 79
AUD however oddly enough the bigger
variant the ma 620 P is actually $10
cheaper and straight in the u.s. they're
the same price 60 USD now for this money
you get to RGB addressable fans a CPU
cooler that is really well built and
performs really well too we've got an
8700 clock to 4.3 gigahertz on all
caused in this case with low noise I'll
let you guys take a quick listen as you
guys may have seen in the past I've
tested the non tough version of the 620
P on a 4.5 gigahertz overclocked Xeon X
56 75 and that handled it extremely well
however with the coolers themselves you
are looking at about a $10 premium for
the tough aesthetic if that's what you
want to go with in this case the 410 M
does have the RGB shining through the
top of the cooler as well and you can
control that in the software which is
actually really good considering there's
lots of different things you do you make
macros control your mice keyboards and
even the RGB on the fans themselves for
the cause though moving now on to the
case a big thing the master Box 500
they're making this in the tough
aesthetic as well and as you can see
here everything is really clean it
doesn't look over the top there's no
tacky designs it's smooth it's straight
to the point and more importantly when
you're going through the build in a case
like this in refitting like we've done
here up to 8 fans you realize that it's
actually simple easy to build in cable
it's a breeze and everything fits
there's no cross threaded screws or
anything like that it's just straight
business and good build quality the case
itself comes in at 80 USD includes three
120 mill master fence and has the RGB
control of titute if you're in Australia
125 AUD
they're all done here's were added an
additional three master fans so we've
got six RGB fans and then two on the
cooler itself so eight fans in this
small box and the airflow is actually
really good but not only that it keeps
everything cool even while I'm playing
games like fortnight and pub G for
example this thing with the
thermal-imaging camera kept everything
nice and cool nice and easy I think I
saw even the greatest card was only
going up just over 50 degrees - so
everything's kept under control as you
heard earlier with the noise very quiet
now what about some of their peripherals
because in the past I have used some of
their mice and keyboards and I haven't
been convinced I did give them feedback
and I told them what they needed to work
on and I'm glad to say that they've
taken that feedback and they've now made
that peripherals pretty much some of the
best out there the keyboard really
impressed me they're included wrist rest
its magnetic and it feels so good on
your hands to type in I'm scoring
consistently over a hundred words per
minute on red switches and the great
thing about the keyboard is the rigidity
of the keys is very solid so the build
quality is there the RGB controls there
and also the comforts there as well this
keyboard if you want to get the MK 750
comes in at 110 us or 159 AUD now moving
on with the mouse and the mouse pad
itself I've got to be honest with you
guys I've always cringed at RGB on a
mousepad
however after using this one and seeing
it in the flesh it's a subtle design
it's not too in-your-face
and it doesn't break the bank either it
comes in at 24 US dollars or if you're
in Australia 34 AUD you can turn the RGB
off as well by a simple touch if you
wish to so that's a really easy and neat
design not only that for a hard mousepad
now I'm gonna be honest with you guys I
do prefer soft style mouse pads even
over this one it's actually for a hard
mousepad the best I've tried even though
I still prefer that soft mouse pad as
I've said earlier now as for the mouse
the MMS 30 this is a big step up from
their pre
is my swear I used them in the past and
the clicking actually fatigue my hand
I've never had that before but this one
has soft clicks really easy doesn't
fatigue you the design looks really good
the grips on the sides are really nice
and more importantly the cable is very
malleable comes in at 105 grams however
it is a palm grip is my so I'm more of a
fingertip gripper so if this is more
your kettle of fish then this is a
really nice Mouse coming in at 43 US
dollars or 57 AUD however before we do
move on to the last coolermaster
component here I will point out that the
mouse and the mouse pad combo have a
little bit of something different going
on the mouse itself uses a regular cable
and the mouse pad uses a braided cable
so I would like to see that kind of
matching each other for consistency now
just after we're getting out of cables I
will see the MH 750 although it's a nice
headset it's got this red cable and it
is triggering my OCD since everything
here does have black cables I'd like to
see that as a black cable that would
look really nice but speaking of this
headset itself closed-back design so
sound won't leak out the audio quality
is actually really good considering it's
coming in at 78 US dollars or 98 AUD
really comfortable as well clamping
force is a bit tight so it will work
well on smaller heads and the microphone
itself doesn't have a standard flip out
mic it's actually on the unit which can
control the 7.1 sound the volume and
even the RGB you just clip that on to
your shirt however I find the cable is a
little bit too long I'd like to see them
shorten the distance between the cable
and the unit itself so as you don't have
this cable sticking out and hitting your
mouth almost or at the very least make
it adjustable then everyone wins and in
conclusion we've got the whole studio
set up here the whole build is really
nice we're using the BenQ 32 inch 4k
monitor playing games like dota 2 at max
settings were getting over 100 FPS
playing fortnight of 4k we're getting
over 150 fps at high settings really
smooth really nice if you want to see
that monitor review I'll put a link up
here for you guys but also in this bill
we've got a gtx 1070 as well as an 8700
great combo of course the gtx 1070 Strix
being a little bit
overpriced at the moment at least
compared to their own Strix 1080 so if
you were to build something like this
I'd recommend spending a little bit
extra and grabbing that 1080 version
there's a lot more powerful than a 1070
though looking at the total build price
here excluding the monitor we're looking
at around seventeen hundred and
thirty-three u.s. dollars or if you're
in Australia two thousand four hundred
and sixty-two what you're getting here
is a decent headset nice mouse and mouse
pad and a really good keyboard and a
solid case with really good build
quality so inside you'll notice that
I've used the 410 and there's two
reasons for that I thought it the 8700
didn't need any more cooling but the 620
P was actually too big for this case it
wouldn't fit so will barely just able to
close the tempered glass side panel but
inside we did have two SSDs we had eight
fans with two of their own individual
cables and we had no problems routing
all the cables inside this mid sized ATX
sourish actually smaller in then a lot
of other mid sized towers as well inside
of course we've got that nice ballistics
on GB memory the tactical traces this is
3000 megahertz but because of the 310
series board were only able to get it up
to 20 666 but that did not give us any
problems scoring solid scores in
Cinebench and also giving us very good
FPS numbers in those titles that we've
played here today and that about wraps
up today's video for coolermaster price
in 2018 and also the tough collaboration
series if you guys enjoyed this one then
be sure to hit that like button also if
you have any feedback things that you
would like to see fixed on cool master
Protestant drop a comment in the comment
section below I know for sure they are
listening the mouse and keyboard have
come a long way since last year's
products and also these tough products
here they do look pretty good I'd say
they look pretty strong but that's just
my opinion and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
