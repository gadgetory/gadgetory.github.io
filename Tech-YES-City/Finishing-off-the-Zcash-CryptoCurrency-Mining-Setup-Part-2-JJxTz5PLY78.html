of the mine rig and now before you hit
the dislike button think about this I'm
only using samples that are collecting
dust and I borrowed some samples of
Steve as well
I have literally out laid hardly any
money at all I bought a couple of
motherboards off eBay on a sale and that
was really about it when it came to this
build other than that I want to get into
mining to test it out just to learn new
things so when people ask me about
mining I can tell them hey X Y Z and you
can do it with a DD anyway guys today we
are going in the room where I've
currently got eight GPUs set up at the
moment so I'm kind of like strapping
back here there's eight GPUs I'll show
you in this room here eight GPUs and two
of them are not connected at the moment
because I had eight in this room working
and it blew out the power on this house
so actually I've got a ship four of
these GPUs off to my friend's house and
then I'll have four GPUs running here so
my friends agreed to have a power meter
going in his house and then I'll just
pay in power every month really cool
friend has actually been helping out the
channel a lot over the last year so big
thank you to Shannon but anyway without
further ado let's go finish off one of
these rigs at my house and then we are
going to go ship the other rig to the
other house and then we'll have these V
mines finished
you
so here's the part going to be sending
to my friend's house there's a couple of
GPUs I'm going to pull the main GPU out
of my main rig as well self-sacrifice
for the win and then we've got this is
the ax 1500 I it's one of the best
pounce flies out there it's titanium
rated as well so if you thought platinum
was like the highest you could get this
is like titanium as well so it's
incredible we're going to be using this
thing to literally like get the best
power efficiency we can with these GPUs
but also if you guys want to set up a
mining rig then you're going to need
these things here they are pci express
cable rises they cost about six dollars
a pop but essentially they'll allow you
to fit more graphics cards on a
motherboard because all those thick
graphics cards if they're two or three
slot they can now be split apart and
then you can also rise them above the
motherboard to get the heat dissipated a
little bit easier kind of like what I'm
doing here I've got them risen above the
motherboard even though it's a little
bit dirty at the moment I just don't
really have time to clean it up but this
setup here is pretty much going to
remain the same I might just move the
motherboard and keyboard over to the
right and then finish that one off so
that's pretty much finished that's the
setup it's going to remain here
okay so there's a setup in my place it's
all done it's all ready to go so that is
one setup complete on the D mine but
also goes before we do that and yes that
is a doorjamb in the background here you
know Gorge in for the win but before we
do that z cash honestly so far people
are asking me how profitable is it is it
worth your money is it worth your time I
won't know for a good month like I've
only had this thing running for like a
couple of weeks and so far it's
definitely nowhere near as good as I
thought it would be like people are
telling me they're making mad bucks like
they're living it up I'm not really
living it up at all guys actually I
think you would be like if you went out
and bought all this hardware especially
at the moment you'd be lucky to even
break even especially in Australia on
the current power costs so I mean this
sort of mining thing it really does
favor people who live in countries who
have access to extremely cheap power
yeah let's get this all sorted out
finish it off and then we'll get parts
in the gun and finish off with the
friends house all right so right now at
my friend's house we got all the gear
unpacked
this is Shannon here as a member of tech
yes City is actually a member on the
forums - really cool I've got to get
back into the forums when I get a lot of
free time basically when I'm moving to
the new studio which is coming really
soon so we're going to put these on this
little rack here mini Rack old monitor
and that's all you need for mining is a
real dirty old monitor so you can just
boot it up and open the Exe file and
yeah let's start putting this thing
together for GPUs and motherboards going
to be on this little custom thing here
and the power supply is going to sit
right behind it
all right so after about an hour of
fiddling around got this monitor working
and the whole setup is working mining
and we had a problem on this graphics
card here where the DVI ports actually
blowing out so I had to get a DVI to
HDMI connector off the other 1080p eyes
and kind of wish you know every 1080p I
had a DVI port on it but not to worry
the mining rig is set up at this place
and my friend's house and the mining rig
is set up at home so in about a month's
time I can tell you guys how profitable
this whole endeavor is and how you know
mining Z cash has been going for me and
whether or not it's worth your time but
at the moment preliminary figures my
mining on a pool called supernova it's
really not that great you know like I
heard a lot of really good stories about
people were just making millions and I
mean I'm sure they are if they've got
like a thousand GPUs and they're in a
power place with cheap power but for me
personally I don't know it's really it's
not that much like I mean put it this
way you certainly couldn't live off it
so on eight GPUs so you may be wondering
in my mining setup why I'm using Nvidia
graphics cards and I'm mining what's
called eques hash and that's actually
suited for Nvidia graphics cards and now
since the
and boom I sold all my rx graphics cards
off actually got ridiculously good money
for them and now with the theorem that
cryptocurrency is suited towards AMD
graphics cards they do a lot better in
terms of mining performance then Nvidia
graphics cards I have heard though with
that cryptocurrency they are starting to
favor and video graphics cards a little
bit I'm not too focused on that however
as I'm mining a different cryptocurrency
called Z cache now this uses eques hash
and NVIDIA grabs cards are actually
really good for mining this
cryptocurrency so now a lot of people in
the last video ask me how I mind these
cryptocurrencies and I'm actually only
mining the cash at the moment so I've
only got experience with that
cryptocurrency and in order to mine this
you have to do a couple of things and
it's not difficult at all it's really
quick all you have to do is have your
graphics card ready or how many grabs
cards you want to use and download a
thing called a miner I use a wbf which
is suited for Nvidia graphics cards
utilizes CUDA and it does really well
for the cash and other eques hash crypto
currencies and what you do with this is
essentially you just put in your
transparent address or your private
address in the miner and you can do this
by opening a wallet first so I'll put
the link in the description below for
this to download if you want to mind d
cache for example download d cache for
win and then if you install this program
it'll open up a wallet and then you can
make a new address and there's
essentially your address where you
receive and send money in the
cryptocurrency that you're using and in
my case I'm using Z cache so I make that
address and then I open up with the
miner the text file and I can choose
different pools I actually don't know
how to solo mine yet so don't ask me
anything about that only know how to
jump on a pool so actually just edit the
file with your address and then you can
put a dot after that and put in the
worker so if you've got just rig one for
example and that'll be easy and then you
open that file up and now you are mining
the cryptocurrency and you can
automatically get paid however if you
want to mine with say an example I mind
with supernova if you want to mind with
a cryptocurrency pool like supernova
then you actually have to make an
account first and this is what I've done
they charge a 1% pool see I know also
the software developer of the program of
ewf charges one
as well so once you've done with those
two you are now mining and you are now
making money and the good thing about
supernovae is they get a little website
where you can monitor your computers and
make sure they are mining and if one of
them is down you can then be alerted if
you're out and about and you'll be like
okay I need to reset that computer and
start up but what about the frequency of
crashing and overclocking and tweaking
your graphics cards to mine the
cryptocurrencies well actually at the
moment I think if you do a 90% power
limit it's what I finding is working
best in terms of mining the
cryptocurrency and also keeping the
gravis cards a little bit cooler than
usual and also have them not crashing as
much in terms of overclocking them
that's something you'll have to do I
find just giving it a little like 30 40
even 50 megahertz boosts 80% fan speeds
at all times and then 90% power limit
and then about 200 megahertz on the
memory works fine they hardly ever drop
out they do drop out probably once every
couple of days so you have to reset the
machine and then start it up again so
that's my experience so far but as I
said before I've only been doing this
with six graphics cards at the moment
and from today I'm actually doing with 8
graphics cards so from today I'm going
to come back in a month time and see how
profitable it's been but at the moment
it's not looking anywhere near as
profitable as I heard it was it's about
maybe $25 a day
u.s. and you're paying about six to
seven dollars power in Australia so
really sir how many graphics cards I'm
using it's not that profitable it's not
like hella profits yes sir yeah you're
making much more at your day job at the
moment anyway so there it is with crypto
currencies guys it's definitely one of
those things that I'm just trying I'm
really I'm for both arguments on both
sides of the fence I mean there's valid
points that people raise on both sides
of the fence so I'm really just one of
those guys who's just giving it a go I
want to learn it and understand it
rather than bash on it before I start to
understand it or have little to no
experience with it so that's what I'm
trying to do at the moment with a crypto
currency trying to get experience with
it see if it is profitable see if it is
safe and transparent and see how to
trade that for actual money in my pocket
as well that's probably when I'll make
the next video is when I've actually got
cash in a main currency like a strain
doll
the US Dollars and I'll tell you guys
and update you about how profitable it
has been or whatever the deal is so I'll
keep you guys informed and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did then
please give it a big thumbs up and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon and if you've got any questions
about cryptocurrencies especially with Z
cash then be sure to drop a comment as
well I'll get back to you as soon as I
can and I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
Oh doodle
that's why I happen to be wrong with no
audience just somewhat Vidya tobacco go
Bureau we're all here old mister I'll
put that on the bloopers the printer
doesn't sound too good
what about a monitor how does it monitor
channel so this is an induction speaker
and and basically you put it on
something and the surface then becomes a
speaker okay let's try the ball is low
cool the wall definitely sounds the back
I go let's try a clock what about
my graphics card good bumper on the car
wow it's pretty good
