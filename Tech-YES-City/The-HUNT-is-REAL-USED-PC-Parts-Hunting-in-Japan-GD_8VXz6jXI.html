you guys a lot of people have been
requesting that I go to the junk stores
and show you guys the deals live so
today and tomorrow I'm going to be
documenting just that and yes I am
wearing my PJs because I just don't care
welcome back to take us City this is
brain coming to you guys today with the
video that I'm just going to go around
and do a massive hunt and show you the
deals that I get and what goes through
my head when I'm buying some of these
deals and what I look for when I buy the
parts so the first place we're going to
go to is a place called wonder X and now
they just sell they basically get stuff
off people and they don't give them that
much money for it then they just put it
in their stores and resell it and some
of those things can be computer parts so
hopefully we'll go there and we might
get lucky but let's find out
okay so they've got like laptops and
tablets here but generally all the stuff
in the case you're not going to get a
deal because they've tested it and they
know it works and they're going to mock
it up alright so over at the junk
section now and it's a bust
also if you're into retro gaming they've
got like super nintendo games and like a
and nintendo 64 games and stuff like
that but let's get on to the next place
because yeah this place as I said before
was a bust
okay so at the main section here all the
junk pieces are at another one direct
and it's pretty much a boss here as well
I mean we've got a Dell here for ten
bucks it's got Windows XP on it so it's
gonna have a really dated motherboard
and CPU same with this one here there's
an optic plex down there for fifty
dollars which wouldn't be too bad but I
mean I've got way better deals in the
past before so we're gonna skip out on
that one this one here is just a case
and a power supply this one here is got
an AGP socket on it and you know you
guys want to vist the key
there you go be my guest and we've got a
thirty dollar case with nothing it's
just got old crap in it and same with
these three here so we've just got a big
massive boss here except for this thing
I'm going to open this up and check
what's inside this since it does look
like a server great PC ok so I've opened
this thing up and damn like there is a
cooler like just floating around in here
some dudes like pulled off like the
memory out of the two I mean wow like I
usually take Gamble's and stuff but this
thing would just not a no like with a
friggin cooler floating around in there
for how long man I'm not too game to try
that since all that's to do is just
essentially hit one of these resistors
busted off and your whole motherboards
toast
pretty much so yeah but it has a looks
like a call to Joy from 2005 so in the
motherboard itself is going to be pretty
dated anyway so we are going to keep
looking around see if there's any other
deals in here all right so we got here a
Pentium 4 and it's $10 oh my god
bust 550 what passed by cost $60 cases
bust boss and that's another bust right
there
bust bust bust bust bust Star Wars
ceramic mug okay doc Darth Maul bust
okay Star Wars ceramic mug number two
let's have a look please be Joe Joe
please be judge ah come on Jar Jar Binks
yes look at that
judge yes Jar Jar Binks I'm getting that
I'm getting that so yesterday was just a
complete bust except for the Jar Jar
Binks mug I mean check that
like that just made the whole trip
worthwhile yesterday make something
Google refine some punch today so today
we're going junk hunting new day new
prospects and the place is called hard
off it's just like Wonder X they buy you
stuff and then they resell it and yeah
hopefully we can find some deals so
let's head there and see if we can get
lucky all right so we are now at a
different place called hard off and we
can see here we've got a pretty good
case for fifty dollars it's man check
case and a Core 2 6300 so we're gonna
open this up and just have a little look
at what's inside in terms of the
motherboard and what not because it does
have a 320 GB hard drive in there which
is an indication that it is a pretty
decent spec computer but let's take a
look anyway so pull it apart now and
it's got a decent power supply it's got
a hard drive in there it's also got a
lot of fans in there and it's also got a
massive cooler down it's also
interesting got a heatsink on the North
Bridge so I'm actually going to take
this because the case is just that damn
good so let's get it so now there's
something else I want to talk about and
that's in Japan the deals like why
there's so many good deals and one of
the reasons for that is because in Japan
you actually have to pay money to dump a
lot of your stuff like especially
computers and stuff like that so what a
lot of people do is they just go to
these places like hard off from one
direction they just essentially dump
their stuff and get a little bit of
money back so it's a lot cheaper to do
that as opposed to going to the dump or
the tip where you have to pay money in
Japan so that's the reason why I guess
you can get a lot of good deals in Japan
but anyway let's get to the next place
and see if we can get lucky
so we go deal here and it's a GT 730
which yeah I mean junk that's not really
that good
so yeah it's mediocre I mean if it was
definitely working I think about taking
it because it's junk I'm still gonna
take a gamble on like $40 which just
isn't worth it and another one now
actually looking around here we've got
Apple these old Apple whatever they are
a 104 sevens and they've got three of
them but I mean for $50 that's not too
bad considering how good this case is I
mean it's made of all steel and yeah I
could do a really cool project with that
so when you take a look at what's inside
see what parts are in there and then I
might get what I might get this so we're
at the next hard off right now and I
didn't take up that Apple 10:47 because
I checked on my smartphone the specs
were like 2003 or 2004 it depends on the
model so I would have just been buying
that PC just for the case so I mean I
can think about that one because there
was three different cases there and
let's get in with the next place and see
if there's any deals
so we've scope this place out and this
looks like a really good deal I mean
it's got an i3 in it and it's just
missing out all that's missing is the
hard drive essentially so damn I'm
actually going to see if there's boots
up and and I want to see if it's got a
graphics card
there so we're just checking this laptop
out at the moment and you see the
screens doing something really crazy
I can't even check the specs mean my
guess would be like something inside is
a bit loose maybe the cable insides come
loose but even then it's still a gamble
so I think I just want to miss even
though it may have pretty good specs in
there I'm just not too sure so we've
found a power supply here for five
dollars so this is pretty good I mean
it's got 50 amps on the 12 volt line so
it's actually really good
one thing though it is missing those
proprietary connectors so I will have to
kind of hack this up or try and find a
way to get a solder connector out of it
but otherwise should be good to go for a
build and that's if it works
and another one all right so we've
walked into this place and there's a ten
dollar alpha on XP here it's not too bad
but I mean whoa yeah
like that is that's bill thing I mean I
was about to say like I get this maybe
just for the power supply in the case
but this thing is like really disgusting
like this looks like it's a health
hazard so and it says here the BIOS
doesn't even get to the BIOS so yeah
might give that one a Miss that's pretty
interesting to four to seven but still a
bit overpriced I think because you know
it's got a busted and motherboard in
there and send about a 95 2400 so kind
of a bust here but let's keep looking to
see if we will find anything so another
really good thing about these places is
that they got really cheap keyboards and
mice so you pick something up for like 3
bucks like this and then get a mouse for
like a dollar and your home and home
so we're in this one now and they've got
I mean if that was a 480 I'd pick it up
for 50 bucks but it's for 60 then
they've got a 58 74 60 $60 I mean not
really good deals
I got a five 64 75 that's a complete
fast
so yeah the grams cars kind of a boss I
mean the powers way looks like this here
looks pretty good either 850 watts
already power supply for I think it's
$80 or something that's not too bad if I
needed a really good power supply same
with this they've got a/c sonic power
supply there so I might never think but
yeah I mean it's just priced at that
level that's not really worth it same
with some of the PC's here so this place
is kind of like they know their prices
and they're trying to get that extra bit
for it which kind of pushes me out of
the out of the race though this is a ten
dollar PC and you guys are probably
thinking the same thing as me like what
the actual is going on here
Wow that is by far the most dirtiest
case I have ever seen in my life
I don't even think a proper cleanse from
brake cleaner would fix this one off so
we've got here what looks like a LGA
1156 motherboard but the problem is is
that when we zoom in there there's like
I can pin that's just completely missing
like I even know what the hell's going
on there it's just completely gone so
I'm not going to take a gamble with that
one no way the $30.00 though you can
keep them on the board and I'll keep my
money
I saw at another place now and they've
got a mini ITX H 81 motherboard for 30
bucks
like I'll take that and they've also got
a z77 motherboard for 20 bucks okay
that's that's pretty damn crazy so I'll
be taking both these motherboards I
still got to think about whether I'm
going to be taking this I means to the
GTX 580 miles edition it's $200 but damn
these graphics cards were worth an
absolute fortune when they were first
released so I'm just gonna quickly check
if it's three gigabytes shared or if
that's three gigabytes total so we just
got out of there we got the two
motherboards and now we're gonna go to
the last place the final destination
another hard off and I did pass up that
Mars card I know probably some people
out there probably hate me for it but
essentially you've only got one half
gigabytes of frame buffer there and four
to five ATS in SLI that's you know
that's a pretty limited frame buffer
especially even like for 1080p gaming so
yeah pass that one up even though I love
the weight of the cards look at the card
and I think it's got like a 22 phase vrm
on it too so it's pretty crazy but
anyway let's get on to the next place as
I mean even then I can come back and get
this deal if it's still there I mean I
can go home and think about it more not
so let's get on to the last place anyway
all right we read the last one now I've
actually never been here before this is
hard off off house all right let's go
inside and see if they got any deals
okay so at the last hot off here and I
mean it is just a Pentium 4 Bonanza in
here but I still got to check some of
these pieces to see if any of them
actually worth getting I mean yeah but
it's looking like I mean I can't really
find anything too good except one thing
I did see was this keyboard it's
actually interesting because it's an NEC
from back in the day and it's been a
very interesting switch here I don't
exactly know what that is so maybe
someone knows what kind of switch that
kind of feels pretty interesting does
kind of feel like a mechanical switch
not too short that one is but yeah they
want 50 bucks for it anyway so looks
like it might have been popular but not
at that price alright so we've picked
some stuff up off the shelves here we've
got a pounce by five and watt power
supply for ten bucks pretty good deal
we're doing a 3500 plus socket 939 CPU
for three bucks it looks like it's
actually brand new so wise we'll pick
that up and then we got the accompanying
motherboard for it which they got eight
dollars there but when we flip it around
it's got five dollars so I think I'll
take the five dollar price tag on that
so they got like a mouse here for a
dollar just like a laser mouse so I
found this on the junk section - it's a
US 122 it's like an audio interface I
mean looks really good
it's only missing the cable and they
haven't checked it yet so I really
flipped that you make 50 bucks on it or
something
so we found one PC here in the junk
section that looks pretty good ones are
taking the panel off and ironically it's
actually got no price tag on it so I
have to get to the front counter and see
what they're gonna ask for it because
it's got a pretty damn decent power
supply in there 600 watts in sonic
powers play it's also got a p5q LGA 775
motherboard and of course a cooler on it
and yeah it looks like it's got a hard
drive in there too so if we pick this up
for even ten twenty bucks man be a
really good deal like really really good
so so we handled them down and we ended
up getting this for ten bucks so wow
that was a really cool deal that's
easily the best deal yet today so
awesome let's uh finish up and get home
Booya
so there we have it this is the final
score here we have a fifty dollar case
this was all that LGA 775 stuff that's
pretty much complete I'm just going to
check out the graphs got a bit later we
had two motherboards picked up here that
was twenty and thirty dollar sales
another fifty bucks and then we had this
AMD cpu and a motherboard for it and
then pounds plus five bucks so that was
eight five eight three five three we're
three five and five so that's $13 and
then we had ten dollars for another
power supply 20 dollars for this thing
here the audio interface and then we got
this for ten bucks which was just one of
the best deals I've got to date so that
is freaking amazing and all that came to
like one hundred and fifty something
dollars plus the jar-jar mark I mean I
told you that was good luck I mean
jar-jar binks said it was gonna happen
so it did happen and all that was about
160 dollars so that is a massive haul
this is probably one of the biggest
holes I've done on the weekend because
people wanted to see deals and you guys
got deals so there we have it that was
just one awesome weekend of hunting
deals and I'm glad you guys got to see
the whole thing step by step and if you
guys liked this video then be sure to
give it a big thumbs up and if you have
any questions or comments about today's
and yesterday's massive hunt then be
sure to drop a call in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can and if you haven't
already subscribe to tokyo city because
from here on we've got a lot more builds
coming and one thing I will point out is
that I've still got to test these parts
as some of them could be busted you know
parts in those pcs especially could be
broken so I'm gonna have to diagnose and
test and see if it works but hopefully
it all works I mean lately I've been
getting lucky I mean today I think I got
extremely lucky so
yeah awesome bills to come and I'll look
forward to seeing you guys in another
tech video so peace out for now bye
I know you guys are thinking you're like
I want to see if the pots work I want to
see if they work well I'm gonna do a
junk or funk test right now for you guys
alright we got first off we have a funk
right here files water recovery I know
what's going on here but at least some
list of you know CPU works and stuff so
we'll figure that out later bounce by
works
okay so the power button is completely
mangled on this case I'll have to
quickly see if I can fix it
you
see if we get a signal out of this thing
jungle funk baby alright cool so it
looks like the machine is working
perfectly fine except for the gravis
card that does look like it is pretty
much screwed there so and that's not a
problem since the graphics card is the
least of my concerns with this one which
is pretty cool okay so now it's time to
test the five-dollar power supply let's
see what happens here okay that's pretty
cool we get a beep now to just boot this
thing up mom
come on there we go all right awesome so
the five dollar pals play looks like
it's working let's try the $10 pounce
play that's pretty good so far surfacing
boots on okay all right so this pounce
blade does work too
I kind of thought it wouldn't since it
did have a weird smell coming from it
but there you have it
candle pal spies working too so we've
got like it looks like here all funk and
no junk except for that motherboard on
the first PC which could be busted and
lastly our task cam is being recognized
in Windows in the device manager so
we've got what looks like old funk and
no junk I still have to test the
motherboard out but I will need CPUs and
whatnot for that BA looks like we've got
a really good score and I'll catch you
in the next tag video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
