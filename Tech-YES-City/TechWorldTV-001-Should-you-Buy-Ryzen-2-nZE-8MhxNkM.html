world TV this is the first episode we're
doing of a new livestream and I'm joined
here by the one the only tech deals how
you doing hey everybody how you guys
doing today so they're gonna come up and
chat and hopefully the chat will become
alive I'm hoping anyway so we'll quickly
roll the intro as well I've set up
everything this has been a big work in
progress to get the stream desk set up
to get the audio right
we've even got jar jar here for the
inception and the introduction ceremony
so we'll quickly roll this intro let's
do it I have something clever to say off
but think of something funny while I
drink my coffee alrighty so basically
behind the scenes
mr. deals and I we have been sort of
talking a lot we talked a lot on Twitter
especially and we did a livestream for
the patron viewers and we're gonna
continue doing that but yeah it was just
a really good chemistry I like the way
the I guess even I stopped casual chat
was flowing and we decided to give this
a shot where we're gonna talk tech news
with you guys so if there's anything you
want to say we'll get straight into it
well hi everybody how you guys doing
hopefully we have a bunch of people from
both I just tweeted out a thing and
hopefully we get a bunch of people in I
can see chats already flowing speak up
say hello and we are gonna talk about
news and some rumors and just some
various tech stuff but we might you know
we'll see how it goes we'll answer some
questions and chat if we see something
interesting pop up but basically grab
some coffee or a drink and sit back
relax and have some fun with us yeah
exactly
well we'll pull up the first topic here
this is the Rison tube we're gonna talk
about rising two very hot at the moment
and we've got here of course WCC F Tech
always leading the front and now when I
was in Thailand I spoke to the guys at
AMD
and they were very annoyed with WCC of
Technol they're basically in the process
of trying to squash whoever's giving WCC
F Tech the rumors
so yeah they basically always on top of
these rumors whether they're true or
false and it sort of does annoyed them a
lot I guess it annoys any company that's
trying to keep something under wraps but
yeah we've got here the risin fives 2600
we already announced this on our channel
as well that the details and the specs
which CPU are you looking forward to the
most the 2700 X because not only does it
have more cores than Intel but the clock
speed is finally competitive and it
comes with what appears to be a top
notch stock cooler that is exactly my
sentiments - I was predicting like as
soon as I saw it it mean it comes with a
raised smile I'm gonna start the wraith
prism my bad it's a gorgeous cooler and
you're paying 329 bucks and you're
getting that cooler included so for me
it was like a no-brainer you're getting
their flagship plus you're getting a
cooler that you can use that cooler as
well like legitimately use it and do a
little bit of overclocking and get some
good speeds so it's a great pack light
this time around I think they've nailed
it of course we're gonna have to wait
for the results and all the other stuff
but yeah that's my pet going in this
time as opposed to the previous
generation I was like even before it was
released I heard rumors of that risin 5
1600 that was coupled with the race pile
and that was a really good matchup it it
was and I think a lot of people are
gonna miss the the switchover because
the new rise in 520 600 I love the price
I mean I love that they've come down on
the price $199 launch price which of
course means discounts possible in the
future but $1.99 for the risin 5 2600
but it's not the spire anymore it's the
stealth and its stock speeds the stealth
is fine but it isn't gonna have the
overclocking Headroom the spire would be
that's actually a big concern I asked
them at the event I said ok coming into
this the yet the 2600 only comes with
the stealth cooler for you guys don't
know that's a 65 watt TDP
cooler as opposed to the previous
generation we had a Verizon v 1600 that
was coming in with a 95 watt spire
cooler so of course getting that little
bit extra out of your CPU was pretty
important right especially if you're on
a budget so this time around you're
getting a in ways yeah I guess I got to
say it's a nerf cooler on the 2600 but
the 2600 X does have that better spire
cooler so it does sort of a little bit
of a thing I did ask them about that the
event and they like because it's on 12
nanometer as opposed to 14 nanometer you
know it's gonna be more efficient so
yeah it's not gonna be a problem at all
it's just of course having that extra 30
watt TDP on the Headroom of the cooler
will help if you want to get those sort
of value for money over clocks so well
it's there it's $30 more it's 229 the
better cooler in my opinion is it's you
know the the right spire alone is not
worth 30 in my opinion but it's worth
something and then you've got 300
megahertz faster turbo out of the box
the 1600 X unless you're on a really
tight budget if I were buying the six
core chip when in the first gen my two
recommendations were risin five 1600 and
risin 7 1700 with the included stock
coolers because the 1600 X and the 1700
X didn't have coolers and of course at
launch they were a lot more expensive
that the 1700 X was what 399 so it was
like $80 or 70 or whatever it was more
but now the the price jump from 2700 to
2700 X is only $30 it's only 10% and
it's a better cooler and I mean
seriously if you're spending 300 on a
CPU is 329 really that bad yeah that's I
mean it's a great price for a flagship
for nameday so you're exactly right
you've hit the nail on all the heads
they're coming from the 8900 X the
previous generation we got 2,700 X it's
going to be better and it's cheaper so
this time around very crazy like I'm
really surprised that AMD are doing this
from the get-go but what's missing
they're swinging hard and
I'm pulling up here blunt ease video he
made a video and there's a frame in
there so the Zen plus architecture so
this is what aimed is promising three
percent greater IPC up to 16 percent
better level three cache latency 34
percent level two that's a massive
massive improvement on the level two
cache latency 13 percent better level 1
cache latency and of course the memory
latency as well lemon scent better so
not just is the IPC better this is what
Andy's claiming and we can't release
figures until the 19th unfortunately
this is what they claim with the slide
and I didn't release this slide by the
way a it's it's looking pretty solid I
mean you've got better like my biggest
issue with the risin 1000 series was
latency and I've said this and people
actually allotted to you know hardcore
yes men and women out there they agree
with me people who had tried both Rison
and coffee lake who both overclocked
those systems they agree with us they
said yeah there's something on with the
latency with rosen the 8700 k feels more
snappy and so these latency is being
improved that's a big thing for me
coming in to rosin Zen plus the second
generation so yeah well it's it's it's a
refined platform after a year
AMD did something incredible last year
where they came out with a new chipset a
new CPU a new production process 40
nanometer they did you know the FX chips
weren't on that they came out with ddr4
Ram support first time and they did like
all they did everything you're not
supposed to do which is they did
everything new at once and it was a
remarkably good launch yeah there was
some RAM speed teething issues yeah I
mean I pcs and clock speeds weren't as
good as people were hoping but it was
remarkably good considering where they
were coming from and so now they've had
a year to refine it to improve the
production and to get the clock speeds
up improve the latency as you say all I
can tell you is that it has been a long
time since we've had these conversations
I I remember
and many people in the audience will not
remember just due to age or they weren't
in the business at the time but I
remember the Athlon XP versus Pentium 4
days and it feels like that all over
again it's like well you got the big
blue Intel guy over here and then AMD
came along with the Athlon XP and yeah I
mean Intel use their money to kind of
try to force Pentium 4 on everybody and
of course
Rambis which was another story all
together
but yeah would you buy well maybe that
question has to wait for the 19th but a
good question for the 19th would be is
there any point to the existing coffee
lake chips now with these out yeah well
there's gonna be a lot of questions I'm
gonna be running a lot of content on of
course this whole new series are
fulfilling back broken promises in the
backlog as well so all those broken
promises they're coming they're gonna be
fulfilled in the next month and a half
that another big thing as well
especially back then versus now
marketing was so much more influential
back when there was Pentium 4 Athlon XP
days I mean you saw those big blue 2 TV
ads Intel Inside Intel inside people
automatically thought Intel was better
because they had marketing that was a
big thing nowadays you've got so much
just communication on forums YouTube
comments wherever it is Twitter
yeah strong word of mouth gets around so
much quicker now people are much more
well-informed than they've ever been and
so this thing around good product is
gonna be think about the fact that the
platform we're talking on didn't exist
during the Athlon XP and Pentium 4 days
all you had were you know PC Magazine
and computer world shop or well PC world
I mean you there were fewer outlets for
the information and it was easier for
Intel to buy advertising and spend money
to keep the knowledge of AMD out
I'm sure Intel wouldn't want me to say
that but of course its history it's what
happened but now we have some we have
social media which you know didn't exist
back then so people are aware of this on
competition is awesome all this
everybody in the audience raise your
hands how many people think we'd have
eight core consumer
excuse me six core well we'll talk about
that in a minute six core consumer chips
from Intel if Verizon heppen launched
last year yeah that's how many people
would think that the that the eight core
Intel chip would have dropped because
think about broad well II the eight core
chip was a thousand bucks in the 10
quart ship was seventeen hundred dollars
and look at them now I believe what is
it on Amazon right and I think that the
eight core sky like X chip is like 469
or something yeah that ones are not
doing too well well no because rising
exists it's you know yeah and of course
then the handicap it at least you could
have made an argument for the eight core
skylake x if they'd given it 40 PCI
Express Lanes but the handicaps of the
28 see that was yeah coming into that
that was my biggest carafe with it was
like the eight core they in certain ways
they nerfed it was previously the eight
cores and the 40 PCI Express Lanes and
then it's like okay suddenly we're
taking that away I keep in mind like I
thought the 5820k and I'm actually
looking for one at the moment I think
5820k is still extremely relevant to
that was soldered got it overclocked
pretty well that was yeah I'm actually
in the market to get one of those chips
again cuz I'd love to do some
comparisons with it so because I
remember back then 2014 I think 5820k
was released and when it was released
ddr4 memory was so cheap and it was just
like wow that CPU back then even though
it was overkill for gaming now it's like
if you still own the 5820k and x99 it's
so relevant by extremely relevant still
so that had quad channel 28 lanes and it
wasn't that I think it was at my
Christina yeah for 300 bucks where
you're at yeah back when I said yeah I
still have my I in 2016 I built an ATS a
6800 K Broadwell e6 core and I still
have that it's um you know the funny
thing is at the time I did a series of
videos back in 2016 when my channel was
very very young when I talked about the
fact if you were in the market at the
time for an i7 I did a 6700 K
a skylake versus 6800 k-rod welly
it's one of the early videos that kind
of caused my channel to make a jump in
the early days and a lot of people kept
saying to me oh that stupid six core is
not mainstream nobody's gonna need six
cores in a lifetime if you go back and
read the comments beneath that video in
2016 it was comment after comment from
people going in the lifetime of this
computer nobody's gonna need six cores
games don't use it Dobies gonna take
advantage of it this is dumb and I'm
like I can see the writing on the wall
guys Oh what do I know but if you'd
bought that back in 2016 you still have
a great platform I mean even coffee like
yes coffee like is faster clock speeds
but think about it you basically had a
coffee like in 2016 if you I think it
was like 100 to 150 bucks more between
motherboard and the CPU cost at the time
and if you're building a $1,500 machine
to get 50% more cores for 10% more money
that's me anyway yeah alright so how I
could Jesse I've got a question that how
high could you overclock you 6800 K cuz
I have a 280 millimeter Corsair H 159 on
it and it runs well enough at 4.4 but it
is not a 264 stable at 4.4 okay it is a
264 stable at 4.2 but ultimately I ended
up setting it to 4.0 because temps are
lower the fans turned slower and the
real world performance difference of
rendering a video between 4.2 and 4.0
was minor and I like silent computers so
yeah I mean I did not actually I think
you mentioned the what the the 5820 yeah
I think the 5820 actually overclocks
better it does yeah I was gonna say it
over close to 4.5 I biked on average 4.4
to 4.5 stable and so you got like four
point two versus four point five and
that's why the 5820k was such a good
bike cuz Broadwell II that didn't do too
well and I think Wendell as well had one
died on him or something at 4.3 or side
off the top man
ask him again but yeah I think the broad
abroad well these aren't soldered oh
really what they was I don't think they
are I somebody perked me from wrong but
I don't think they are okay 5820k the
last soldered chip yeah we got a
donation as well Jack said keep up the
good work thanks jack
thanks for watching brother so yeah so
we got sorry in 5820k 6800 case stuff
thanks for watching guys as well love
the live stream web back I haven't
livestream for a long time as well so
I'm out of it
teksu you live stream regularly to you
um
I do I don't live stream on YouTube as
much as I probably should I live stream
on Twitch more and whenever I live
stream on YouTube what ends up happening
is either hand up not answering
questions in chat or I try to answer
everything I've done a couple of Q&amp;amp;A
streams where they end up running three
hours long and then I've lost my voice
okay well we'll do a bit of Q&amp;amp;A at the
end of this chat but uh as soon as a
risin to the Sarai's Ansari was in
second generation my bad Rosen's will be
next year 7 nanometre we've got the
rising second generation coming very
soon I think it's tomorrow night the NDA
lifts at 11:00 p.m. Australian time it's
9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time in the
u.s. so 19th of April that's when the
NDA lives I think if they had common
knowledge now it's posted everywhere
we've got now the next topic as well the
8 core 16 threatened I guess this ties
in with Rison second-generation
perfectly right we've got the next topic
we're gonna pull up here which is the
tweak town so they've got so many ads
plastered on both WCC f Tech and tweak
town it's like this thing almost chokes
my computer it's like come on guys you
gotta like maybe make more efficient way
of implementing ads like I love that
some more for ads but like it's starting
to slow down this poor computer here but
we got z3z there better z 390 chipsets
and we've got the of course the room at
9,700 k so
apparently biostar confirmed that it's a
95 watt TDP yeah so what do you think of
this with the 9700 k beam possibly eight
cores 16 threads 95 watt TDP we remember
to go on to 10 nanometer 2-year so 10
nanometer and 95 watt TDP what's your
concerns going into this or what's your
thoughts ah another chipset another year
all the people who just bought z3 70s if
they're not able to put an 8-quart chip
on them or people I get comments beneath
videos where people went out and they
bought a Z 370 board and they bought say
an i-5 8400 figuring they'd wait for the
eight core chip thinking they could just
buy the eight core chip because they
didn't want to buy the six core and
being in between and so what they did is
they bought the budget i-5 figuring that
in six months to a year
there must be an upgrade that they can
go to and they are going to be so pissed
if they find out that they can't put
these new chips on one of the biggest
comments that I see about AMD when
people say yeah I'm going AMD as they go
I have three to four years of
motherboards support yeah Intel has got
to chill with the number of chipsets
that get sold they do so historical uh
no Jacob thanks man I said love your
videos keep up the hustle hey always
keeping up that household man I mean
look at the this is all created thanks
to you guys patron viewers everything
viewers sponsors everything's coming on
board actually speaking of sponsors as
Rock and Corsair as well so as rock they
were really cool with that X 370
motherboard review well quickly talking
about that they were really cool with it
they let it slide like they weren't so
angry I guess because I said look at the
end of the day this comes back on your
company right if you're making good
products you're gonna get good word of
mouth it's not just me as a review or
reviewing these products you've got to
be the best if you want to be the best
in market share then be the best in
terms of making products and yeah I
guess we've had a few lengthy
discussions in the last couple of weeks
and it's been good they seem to be on
the right track
they look well yeah we'll keep up the
sponsorship with the channel and I
respect that
because I have in the pot I mean have
you ever done a review and it's been
negative and then you had the company
run away oh I've had I've done positive
reviews and had companies run away what
are you talking about that scene that is
really weird you you have to name the
company then what
so you a good product gets a good review
and the company runs away what you can't
tell me anything have I have I said
anything negative about a and B in the
past year oh wait that's where we goin
okay I did I you didn't get sent out a
reviewers kit AMD please send this man
out of reviewers kit what yeah I'm
really shocked there I don't know
because they you they they sent me they
sent me all the rides and stuff last
year they sent me 500 RX series and the
thing is here's the deal I'm not gonna
change my reviews I'm not gonna stop the
the rising AP used for example they
didn't send me the the 2200 G and 2400 G
I recommend them I think they're great
I've done a ton of performance videos on
them so just because they don't send me
stuff doesn't mean I'm not gonna say hey
this is great product yeah um because at
the end of the day it's about the
viewers and not the companies but well
whatever at the end of the day though
I'm sure your viewers would love to see
day one coverage of rosin the
second-generation lines I know where I'm
going Thursday morning so you're gonna
have a delay because you have to still
thoroughly test it and get out you know
the results that your audience wants so
yeah I was actually really confused
because I thought when we've sort of
talked about things with Rison in the
past like I thought the 8,400 is a good
CPU from Intel and in gaming I thought
it was better than the rosin 5 1600 era
saying and you were sort of more on the
fence of the 1600 so you've always been
more even more Pro rising than I don't
know well the the 8400 is a better
short-term CPU for gaming it's got
better IPC it's it's if you only care
about a 12 month time frame for gaming
yes the i5 84 hundreds a better choice
but if you're buying
CPU for three years because I mean how
many people upgrade ok I understand
people do upgrade every year but I don't
think the average person does if you're
looking for a three year CPU I think two
years from now the 12 threads of Rison
even at a slightly slower per thread per
core performance will be more useful I
mean I'm already seeing games in
midnight I test Assassin's Creed origins
it will slay of all six cores all day
long I mean there's already games right
now that we use six cores and on the i-5
8400 I'm already seeing 80 to 90 percent
CPU usage what future does that give
that CPU to grow into eighteen months
from now yeah just to say sorry we got a
Danish as well thanks and Stephen said
we knock schewe still loves us x58 keep
on hustling yeah x58 is well we've got
some great content coming with x58
versus of course this new stuff and
other new stuff that's a broken promise
I didn't fulfill with the Verizon 5 1600
but it's coming ASAP so get your sub
boxes ready
that videos see what I have here I can't
actually the brightness is so bright I
can't see just tell me this is a x50 675
oh you got one
o 6 cores 12 frets so I'm just saying
and and I have a nice a soos piece
exterior the board dude I love you right
now look chats gonna love you right now
as well who loves tech deals right now
he's just got an X 56 75 he's got a x58
motherboard this guy is
yeah I'm just can I call you mr. serious
biz things anything in a serious
you've got to overclock that platform
there you really have to it's it gets
massive gains like 40 percent out of
overclock it's huge and I paid like $45
for that CPU on eBay yeah incredible
it's it's a deal of course the
motherboard x58 always about the
motherboards and I love it now because
people are spreading the word about what
the motherboards situations like yes you
can go on eBay by a board for 300 bucks
you get ripped off but a lot of the
times you can go get that motherboard
pay a hundred I've paid in Japan
like six of x58 motherboards and there
are zeus GD 65 from msi are things at GD
65 they were just really solid boards
and I got in for like 70 bucks a pop my
friend even jumped on it who doesn't
even he's not even a tech at all really
all he does is play Nintendo DS's he's
in - he's in a console gaming he was
like you know cuz he likes flipping a
few things in Japan
whether it be use plus he's like dude
get me three of those motherboards he
born for 70 bucks flipped him for like
170 on you a eBay US so yeah I mean
whenever you can get a cheap deal on an
X 58 board don't pass it up and with
that look at the value that you can
extract out of it that's the biggest
thing so x 58 is your savior and now
I've actually lost track of where we
were talking about with that donation in
X 58 we went on a whole new tangent high
all I can say about the about I am so
glad that int that AMD has sort of
kicked the table over and forced Intel
to respond because the fact of the
matter is six core 12 thread CPUs
existed ten years ago now they charged a
fortune and they were expensive and they
were not meant for consumers but they
could have been you know we went from
single core to dual core 2 quad core in
a fairly short period of time in the mid
2000s and then it just stopped at quad
core and of course so software got
developed for quad core it was there for
a long long time but we're finally back
on track because obviously we're not
going to ten gigahertz CPUs any time
soon due to reasons so all we can do is
develop software for multi-core and it's
like it's about bloody time ok and we're
gonna go down to conspiracy Avenue now
because everyone loves it and everyone
loves a good conspiracy theory I know
every time I ask the chat do they like
good conspiracy theory they say yes do
you think the real reason we haven't
seen gains in cores and threads for
mainstream is because of Adobe
that would not be my first thought why
do you say that because Premiere Pro
only uses 12 threads perfectly utilized
once you go to 816 it starts to scale
off I do not think that they are now
addressing that data Rison is a little
bit of a joke anyway bit oh sorry I
blame a DOS
no well I'll say this when Rison first
launched I know I'm being mr. serious
when Rison first launched risin 7 1700
had poor CPU utilization in Adobe yeah
but it's been getting better over the
past year honestly though Adobe in
Australia I always plan like 20 bucks a
month they opted to like 50 bucks a
month and it really like man I'm fuming
because it's like they don't I feel like
nothing's been improved really nothing
in Premiere Pro has been improved
nothing is like nothing's changed with
their software in the last few years yet
I'm paying two and a half of you know
250% more money now for my monthly
subscription it what what's going on
with this software I'd love to see their
competition yeah well da Vinci I mean
and everyone's telling me to use DaVinci
Resolve everyone saying you DaVinci
Resolve it's free yeah and it's like I
tried using Vegas Sony Vegas and I rage
quit like I just couldn't get the stuff
organized in the amount of time that I
wanted to I was so used to just
organizing clips in the workflow and
Premiere Pro that when I went to Vegas I
just rage quit so I'd love to set Vegas
up like Premiere Pro and have it so
everything works the exact same but I
guess that's not possible but with that
I don't mind using Premiere Pro but I'd
love to see them upgrade adding new
features adding new base transitions
improve everything but it just seems
like is this copy/paste formula every
year and then your monthly subscription
goes up so and then yeah I'm gonna blame
them for the reason why we haven't got
more than four cores eight threads adobe
has milked
lock-in for a long long
because they went to the subscription
plan and dropped the selling of the
packages and you know of course if you
go look at you know comments and forms
and everything people were so livid and
pissed about the the going to
subscription only but it clearly has
worked out for them because they've got
a ton of people subscribing to them
because if you're a professional content
creator yeah there's other alternatives
there's DaVinci some people use final
cut on Macs even though max or mmm they
are what they are they you know you have
Vegas and other things but it's kind of
Premiere Pro and then it's everything
else and so they sort of have you by the
short and curlies yeah well I muscle
mean I'm Misaka for it I'm locked in so
we should be used to it and that the
time it would take to get as proficient
as you are in something else the $50.00
a month is not a big enough pain point
mmm to get you to relearn new software I
know it's it's harsh at the moment so it
really is like because I do want to
learn new software just to say hey Adobe
I might come back if you innovate and I
think that that sort of train of thought
is coming back with Rison versus Intel
AMD versus Intel Rison and AMD that
their big thing is to say look we're
pushing more cause more value we're
innovating it's time for you guys to
step up now and it's a really good thing
because Intel is responding and it's
great I love competition and everyone in
the audience I'm sure loves competition
of course there will be a few guys out
there like I don't love competition no
Intel for life and vice versa on the AMD
side of AMD AMD for life but what we're
seeing is increased competition better
value and that's a win-win for everyone
and I'm glad it's hitting the CPU market
anyway GPU markets sort of man that's
crazy we're gonna transition into that
pretty soon with crypto currencies but
yeah what do you thought your thoughts
on the competition then
I think that Intel has been trying to
think how to phrase this um Intel has a
very long history of not wanting to play
with others going all the way back to
the 8088 the only reason they gave AMD
and x86 license in the first place is
that IBM before in fact applause for a
second as you can say thank you for that
one stop for a sec we got a donation at
Tech bloodbath says he's looking for
opinions I actually didn't catch the
message I didn't catch the rest of it
just a second
he's got a okay he has a G 4560 z170
motherboard and you can get a used i7
but he feels like a new x47 yaar five
2600 would be a better upgrade if you've
already got the ddr4 yeah what's your
thoughts well it depends upon the price
of the used i7 but if you can get a used
i7 for under $200 do not discount the
headache hassle and trouble of changing
motherboards possibly having to
reinstall windows worrying about your
license versus a drop in CPU change and
nothing else I recently upgraded my
son's computer he had an i-5 6400
essentially on a be 150 motherboard I
had a spare I 770 700 K I flashed his
BIOS dropped it in took it took longer
to flash the BIOS and restart the
machine than it did to change CPUs and
the 7700 K runs at 4.2 4.3 turbo on all
four cores you know it turbos to 4.5 but
really it's 4.2 4.3 but the fact is I
put a hyper 212 Evo on it I mean 20 20
ish dollar cooler and it runs cool and
quiet at max turbo all day long on a
cheap be 150 board and yes it would be
nice to have more cores or more threads
but if you can find that CPU for 200
less-used how easy is it to drop a CPU
in versus changing your whole platform I
know it doesn't think ok Zeon's baby
Coalition game thanks man
Zeon's for the win yeah maybe he wants
to just back date to an x58 motherboard
ddr3 cell all that new gear that's an
option but do you think that's gonna be
a thing though he sounds like you see
set x4 70 risin 520 600 he knows what he
wants and building a new computer for me
is a lot of fun and I just I love
changing over motherboards and
especially if I wasn't doing YouTube and
had my own little system to tinker with
I would go with x4 70
Verizon 520 600 it's new it's fresh it's
sort of like you can I mean you've got
the Brittany how much of a value we're
gonna place on the bragging rights here
mr. deals you can now go to school or go
to work or go to uni and tell your
friends that you have an X 470
motherboard and arisin 520 600 do you
know that do you how much that's worth
those bragging rights I'm old I don't
care well we got to take care of the
younger generation that's the thing so
he's gonna earn some rep on reddit as
well so yeah I'd go with the X 475 2600
I still have an i-5 2400 dell optiplex
in the other room with the gtx 1050 and
when i sit down and play games with my
kids i play on it and i actually kind of
like the fact i mean i have plenty of
expensive fancy high-end computers but i
kind of get a bit of a kick out of the
fact that that's like $100 computer with
like a hundred hour graphics card in it
and it plays it plays overwatch at 1080p
perfectly it plays League of Legends
World of Tanks you need nothing more
than that I love the I love the deal
this reason why my channels call tech
deals that I love how much you get for
that you don't have to go out and spend
even 500 for a gaming computer you can
spend 200 and get a gaming computer how
cool is that
it's very cool that's why I love the use
scene so you're the deals man I'm the
yes man I just whatever we do it's all
about getting that value right well and
the funny thing is you mentioned the
rising 4
five 2,600 2,600 ex this might be a
controversial opinion but I am kind of
of the opinion that if you're building a
complete new machine if you're getting
now upgrades may be different because if
you're just buying motherboard and CPU I
I get I get the distinction but if
you're gonna go out and go okay I'm
buying motherboard CPU RAM case power
supply graphics card etc etc etc SSD
hard drive I'm a little bit of the
opinion that I would be tempted to skip
the Rison 5s completely in bio rise in
720 700 X and I know a lot of people are
gonna say come on man you don't need
that today the risin 5 2600 6 cores 12
threads that will play games for years
it'll do lots of stuff yeah but for a
hundred bucks you get a better cooler
higher out of the box clock speeds and a
ton of future proofing could you
possibly get a CPU that lasts as long si
the x58 platform if you bought an X 470
today with the 2700 X could we be
talking in 10 years and you could be
sitting you're going you know my 2700 is
still just fine yeah that's like the
idea I'm gone I completely agree 2700 X
is amazing sorry to sort of cut you off
here we did get a really good question
actually the completely blew over my
mind and I know you've been talking
about this a lot specter and meltdown
and now apparently x58
cannot get those updates and support
even through the windows update I
believe because I believe windows were
rolling out sort of like a mid until
Paul that the the I the i7 920 will not
be getting Spectre updates yeah and so
my thoughts on this is just ridiculous
um they have to I mean that the x58 is
so relevant is so relevant it's still
relevant a lot of people love that
platform give it some loving
I think they should fix the core 2 quads
okay look I I'm gonna make a deal with
the viewers okay I do have some
sponsored content coming out with Intel
how about we all just give Intel a haber
loving and I'll tell them look we'll
give you a heap a loving but you
update the x58 platform in return let's
see if we can make that deal we cut a
deal like instead of saying I was a
sponsored video rather a negative
comments would just say yep love this
sponsored content love this showcase
Brian absolutely amazing Intel and then
we give them some loving and I'll say
look and return for that loving you
update x58
who's been told about deal would you
like my honest opinion of that yeah I
think it's going to take a court of law
and a judge ordering Intel to do it
before it happens I think like I
actually spoke to him on the phone
recently and they they know it's a new
age they know it's a new thing they know
YouTube is a massive thing now it's got
a massive communities they know it's
more I guess that's why a lot of small
companies are doing really well now they
don't have red tape there's no red tape
it's really cutting in it's just hit and
miss like a lot of these companies like
small companies are making things in
like I look at cougar for example
they're so quick and they're so whatever
they do we do a video together be a case
review we organized it a week before
bang it's out BitFenix as well before
gamers Nexus put a tombstone on them
there was a sort of donation I'm 16 I
just bought a 47 70 and 974 370 bucks
that's pretty good okay we got another
two-pound donation I'm not kissing in
tells us they can I get yet hey okay
alright it was a proposition guys it was
a proposition we can do that and if they
guarantee an x58 update the whole the
whole thing the whole outlook is now
changing and I gotta admit the one thing
I'll say about AMD this time around this
2,700 X launch is going to be I believe
one of the most successful things I
think of already the most successful
launch in 2018
they really organized everything well
the events it was like the funnest event
I've been to for a tech event they
really just got down to the details what
everyone wanted to know yeah and so I
think AMD is changing in that sense I
will be interesting to see if Intel's
going to change that way as well where
they're becoming more direct with the
workers because I'm a one-man band at
the moment I just do like you know when
people throw me up 20 pages of contract
to Psalm like what what is this like can
you just give me the deal oh what you
want me to do
and we'll if it's bad I can renegotiate
it or if it's good we'll go ahead with
it and a lot of the small companies get
that rights like a one page contract
bang yep you know you're not gonna
absolutely bash the company brand if
it's a bad product reveiw so there's
yeah there's protections in there but
yeah I don't know maybe a maybe that's
why game is Nexus got blacklisted from
like I don't know I did he he just he
just bashed the products didn't he like
much come here we're talking about like
Coolermaster BitFenix and stuff like
that like the case of cooler cooler
master didn't mind uh I think carefully
what I want to say here um I stopped
caring a long time ago like yeah you're
gonna be trying your master does not
mind criticism if it's delivered in a
balanced way
I had a few criticisms and comments
regarding the the H 500 P and I even
opened my H 500 P review with all right
let's just get the bad out of the way
right away let's talk about the front
panel let's talk about this but you know
and when I sent them the link to that
video and they did not get previewed on
that video by the way I published that
without them saying it I don't I don't
give when I do reviews for products like
that I don't they don't get to see it
first I sent it to him and I said I hope
you guys aren't too upset by this but I
did actually start with the negatives
because I will not be taken seriously as
a reviewer if I don't address the
elephant in the room
and to paraphrase their response was we
don't mind
of criticism if it's delivered in a
respectful way yeah that's I like that
honestly I do like that clause I mean
yeah like I in the past man I've been
like way back when I first started
YouTube I was brutal you know I was
ranching almost and I realized hey what
what if I was a company making a product
and you know everyone's different in
this worth world everyone has different
trains of thought and what if you poured
your heart and soul into a product you
sent it out to someone and then they
just absolutely obliterate it and
obliterate your company and whatever you
know so I sort of change my thinking if
I've got negative points about a product
I'm just gonna say the negative points
about a product I'm not gonna bash a
company or bash the brand or anything
like that I'm just gonna say the
negatives of the product that's it and
so yeah I'm I'm that respectful way now
because I put my own stone and put
myself in other people's shoes sort of
thing I just don't like yeah like just
yeah going the extra mile something's
bad just say it's bad say what's bad and
move on sort of thing I guess yeah I
don't know ever going with this anyway
maybe we should all I'm saying is is is
that I think the thing that upset
Coolermaster with with gamers Nexus is
the fact that they it was savage but it
was savage the funny thing is I nothing
nothing he said was untrue
I'm loving his reviews it's I mean it's
just it's just it was it was just maybe
a little over the top now personally I
actually actually agree with gamers
Nexus in in their follow up because they
went out and bought the H 500 P match
cuz obviously they didn't get sent it
and they ended up saying
problem solved they fixed it they did
this they did this great why didn't they
send this to us we're happy to give this
a good recommendation because I'm maybe
I'm old school but I'm of the view that
you want to be if you have a dispute or
you're unhappy with somebody if at all
possible be the bigger man and
coolermaster sending the the H 500 P
mesh
first to gamers Nexus would be them
saying they should have done that we're
we have basically we have our big boy
boots on we're adults we can deal with
and of course they came out with the
mesh because of the criticism they
recognized that they didn't have a
finished product and they fixed it and
they're making the front panel available
for existing users who want to change
over and it's only $20 and I think $20
for the whole front panel I mean okay
somebody's bound to say they should give
it away for free but I don't know it's
coolermaster floor masters not that big
of a company are they they're
medium-sized company darah I'd say just
off the top of my head they've got
distribution chains in a lot of the
major countries through but they're not
the size of Corsair no cool series
massive holy like I didn't realize how
big Coursera and actually is gonna save
got strafe keyboard here I absolutely
love this keyboard it's my favorite
Corsair keyboard yeah love it love it I
don't even know what yeah who's their
sponsor I guess I gotta plug them every
now and then but they this court his
keyboard is so good I love this keyboard
and they sent over a few of them for the
benchmark setups and stuff but yeah
they're they're Dominator Corsair like
wow and to be honest they're really
really good to work with like you tell
them negatives about the product as well
you take look fix this this this this
they go back and fix it they they listen
to feedback as well even like the best
thing about it is when I went to
Computex you speak to the CEO and second
in charge and it's like they listen to
you they love feedback they constantly
want to make their products the best out
there that to me is a company that's
gonna win so anyway I have you got
dealings with Corsair a little bit they
it's hit and miss they've sent me a few
things in fact I actually have I'll hold
it up if you want to see it yeah this is
a Corsair k68 RGB keyboard in front of
me they sent me yeah they sent me the
speckle for cases it may couple powers
wise although for some reason I can't
get them to send me the the new RGB
coolers they came out with their very
hit and miss they send me like half the
stuff I asked for and not the other half
and I have not been able to get them to
send with the new obsidian 500d which
annoys me because my favourite case of
all time is the obsidian 750d and I've
now built two separate systems on my
channel win that and I sent them links
to both and said I am your biggest
obsidian fan send me the send me that
thing well I'm gonna cut you off and say
the AAAS series is the best like a 540 I
if you're not changing over components
that much best case ever a 740 you got a
side panel there but for a guy like me
changing over graphics cards and stuff
man those the air series is just hit the
nail on the head no tempered glass as
well to be honest after working with
tempered glass I'm not a fan of it you
know how clumsy I am there just yeah air
series was just like bang don't even
have to change anything I'd love to see
them update or add some stuff I've got
another time so yes man take deals
together yeah he ordered the H 500 P
mesh awesome I've actually got the H 500
P here - sorry quickly change I've got
to test it still so I will be doing some
testing relaying my thoughts I will say
one thing from what I've seen on your
channel and other channels that H 500 P
it looks really nice like the looks wise
like aesthetics it looks it's beautiful
and from a pure appearance point of view
it is more attractive than the mesh yeah
but they're not lying
nobody is lying about how ridiculously
easy the front panel comes off and the
airflow sucks
now I built a rising 7 1700 X into that
H 500 PE and I put a cooler master what
is it ma 610 P that the six contact RGB
cooler on to it yeah runs cool and quiet
for all the airflow issues it
now what I put in 8700 K for 5 gigahertz
in the in that no because it doesn't
have an affair flow but you want a real
high airflow case for that I mean you
don't want to put it in that but it's
pretty yeah it's pretty well that's not
what the bib thanks and so like I
actually kind of came out of that review
liking that case and that's that's the
thing about reviewers like there's been
this big thing on the reviewers you know
people calling reviewers shills and
whatever reviewers the reviewers with
their own opinions at least the ones I
know all the reviewers that I
collaborate with they're all honest
people they're gonna give you their
opinions and this is just what's the
good thing about this whole community
everyone's got a different opinion now
our game is Nexus like for instance with
the game at the end so he ripped it a
new ripped at a new one and that was
justified he said exactly why he ripped
it a new one I me on the other hand I
loved it I love that case I thought from
mid-range gaming pcs it was phenomenal
like I turned around and flip I've never
flipped a PC faster in my life then that
sale with the end so someone saw that
case and they just fell in love with it
and they even told me when they picked
it up dude this thing looks so good and
I put that thing together in like half
an hour I forgot it was so quick to put
that thing together so they did do a
good thing like in aesthetics they just
missed out on the airflow but if you put
in mid-range parts in GTX 10-6 deal and
not overclockable CPU and under why like
you have any problems with blowing up I
mean if you put in a 970 motherboard and
a what is it the 95 90 yeah like you
might blow up the vrm five seconds
sooner than you otherwise would have
blown it up if the case you know if you
had a better case so as that but
are do you watch Jay Paul do you do you
watch Jake no no interest whatsoever I
don't have time for that if I want drama
I'll go play with my three kids and
listen to them argue
yeah I'm subscribed guys i watch his
videos email notifications turned on
links are in bio I do buy that merch as
well so let's and the other one as well
Logan Paul I watch them both subscribed
and the yep just subscribe guys so we
got here our X 600 series GPU project
Zen detailed so this is a big thing in
that you were saying before this was the
first time we've got the new team post
risin working on the GPU architecture
yes yes this is a look at that all the
good stuff about rising that we love the
low temperatures the better power
consumption the better performance the
better design they get to put a fine
point on it as much as I want to tell
AMD I love them
Vega kind of sucks it's it's I know
that's harsh but it just it just does
and I recently did a video i retested I
got an aftermarket cooled vega card and
I just it just isn't competitive at all
and this goes it goes three singing one
of the I guess that's the one biggest
thing I think that the lot of the
community said it's great if you want to
get grabbed free sync monitor and want
to enjoy yourself sort of stock out of
the box half of the Vega cards I've
tested have problems with power delivery
unless you're really picky about the
power cables you use I've had to under
bolt them to get them stable I've got a
gigabyte gaming overclocked with the
after aftermarket cooler on it and I
suffered more hard system locks at
completely bone stock settings that I
actually could tell you I had to
undervolt it to get it stable
out-of-the-box I've had more than one
Vega card from different companies do
that and and I've got a good power I'm
testing I've got a see sonic prime
titanium power supply on my test bench
so I have no power performance issues
whatsoever Vega is clocked too high in
my opinion they push the clock speeds
and voltages to levels to try to compete
with the 1080 and 1080 well it doesn't
keep it with the 1080i if they had down
vaulted it and down clocked it by like a
hundred megahertz from the factory and
if they could sell it for 349 it would
be the ultimate 1070 killer yeah I just
honestly the Vega though I've never seen
a GPU architecture that's been so
heavily dependent on memory speeds to
gain performance it was it was bizarre
testing that thing out and then when you
did up those memory speeds the power
consumption was just through the roof
yeah Vega I only got one card and I've
had to borrow a card off a friend when I
was doing the 64 because he got a 64
card so and then I may hocked my 56
throw it to a crypto minor border cut
away too much money yeah bought a camera
with it says great you know you're
getting getting a um when you think
about you're getting like a fork a
brand-new sony a7s 2 and stuff for the
discount so yeah it's like thanks crypto
- and that's it we're gonna go on to
crypto - soon but with the 600 series
here this looks like it's a step in the
right direction right so we've got 12
nanometer as well they go any hard on
this 12 nanometer they're using the
second generations 12 nanometer too by
the way so it's Vega all the cards are
looking like they're gonna be on the
Vega line here and they're all looking
like they're going to be HBM - yeah
you're looking at WCC F Tech all you're
looking at okay let me scroll down
because oh I see what you're looking the
600 series are going to be 12 nanometer
but those are going to be this year this
700 series the one that I see everybody
excited about is Navi which is the seven
nanometer next year next year's not that
far off if you can buy yourself
something to tide you over for a year um
of course you know we form a fanboy like
if you only want to go with AMD oh wait
like is the meaning like a GTX 1060 is
awesome it's one of the go-to cards that
I recommend like they're the tide you
over argument like are you coming from
like get a 1050 or like what's your tide
over to wait till 2019 I just want to
write that right now uh either a three
or six gig 1060
I really wish the rx5 80s were a bit
cheaper when when the five 80s launched
after the press cards the first after
market card that I bought was a gigabyte
horas extreme one of the highest clocked
cards but it has that ridiculously huge
cooler on it and that was my favorite
card and I only paid like 259 for it but
I don't have it anymore because the
cryptocurrency mine are offering me
nearly eight five hundred bucks yeah I
mean that's like honestly like people
probably looking at the challenge like
oh man you make more money than you do
it's like nas a crypto rush that's like
paid for everything in the studio it's
been fantastic
this crypto rush has just created a new
studio essentially it's been phenomenal
and you know when people hate on crypto
- I'm just sitting back sort of yeah hey
guys I'm just the messenger with a brand
new studio so yeah like six AMD 600
series this year it's not looking like
it's going to be super impressive is
that so you're saying wait till Navi 7
nanometre much more power-efficient new
architecture HBM three gdr six memory
this and they're promising are they
saying like 1080 performance for 200
bucks 250 bucks yeah of course
but of course Nvidia will have something
out new before then as well but
if Navi is designed by the same
leadership team under Lisa and the new
team that did then if they can bring the
discipline that that Xen brought forward
to Navi in other words what I'd like to
see AMD do if I have my wish list is to
do to NVIDIA what they did Intel
Steve said how Kryptos saved AMD GPUs
from yeah from done from plummeting the
crypto did I mean I think crypto did
help out AMD a lot and I think they've
admitted they actually they haven't made
it to it and videos like loving it
they're just graphics cards sold out for
days but yeah the Navi series looks
really good
I would I honestly my favorite Khan from
AMD all this time for the last few years
has been the rs4 70
I like that card was gone for like a
hundred and seventy bucks back when
you're building gee 45 60 PCs and stuff
you could put together a PC for like 400
bucks with an RX 470 energy 4560 it was
just phenomenal value back then and even
now that PC would play games absolutely
fine I want to bring back those days it
seems like PC gaming has just been hit
with a massive nerf stick and you've got
games that are getting so popular and
you've got PC people wanting pcs and
that's why this error of use PC parts
Hustler's is growing more than ever and
I'm gonna keep assuring that in you know
I'm gonna keep deal hunting keep making
to use vids I love that stuff it's
awesome but I think that is getting a
lot of growth in itself because of all
these ddr4 Ram prices graphics cards
being sold out the use scenes really
gaining some traction and I got a
question for you are you gonna jump in
to survive Ashley you are you've got a
next 58 motherboard X 56 75 but are you
going to jump into some used graphics
cards sort of deal hunting performance I
am NOT a fan well here's the thing I do
have older graphics cards in a number of
systems but they're cars that I've owned
since new I still have to
tx9 70s and the 970 still awesome if you
have a 970 wait you don't need to
upgrade I mean unless you're like 4k
gaming or something but the you can find
some deals online 70s 99 80s 980 T is on
eBay for the price to performance there
is better than the new stuff but if
you're buying a card that has been run
24 set and of course I never believed an
eBay ad that says o lightly used for
gaming a few hours a week
anybody who types that seriously no
she's not guilty admission of guilt you
got a dance if it's if it's been run
24/7 stacked with six other cards next
to each other and shoved on the floor
against the wall
and it's been running for 18 months at
at full speed yeah yeah I understand
that some minors if they're minors etc I
understand that they may have under
vaulted or under clock for power
efficiency or maybe but not everybody
does that and you know it may not have
had enough airflow because it's been
here's the thing I like hassle-free
systems I am not worried that this chip
has been run 24/7 for years upon end and
if it has I paid forty five dollars for
it so yeah you know but if I go out onto
eBay and spend $300 on a 980 TI and and
with graphics cards the problem is it's
not that it works or it doesn't
it's that it usually works until it like
the screen blanks occasionally or you
get artifacts have you ever had the
Whirlpool no okay well not the Whirlpool
just like this shrinking square you'll
just see a screen go you into a black
hole I wonder if anyone else is saying
that I've seen it once and it was like
bye bye bye bye GPU boom and it just
died I've had that happen once forgot
what Carter was ages ago
you mentioned the rx 470 do you remember
well I don't know if you how closely you
watch new egg prices in America but just
before the 5 500 series came out you
could get an Rx for 70 on new egg for
100 and
$9.00 Wow and I remember seeing that I
tweeted about it and a bunch of people
said but the 500 series are coming out
why would I buy this yeah I wasn't a fan
of the 500 series they just like
literally everyone spoke to guys as well
at events and then everyone was the
signs like yeah
power drill was like 50 60 percent
performance was up like five ten percent
it was it wasn't it wasn't the best way
to do it well how different is it then
say the 7970 to the 280x to the whatever
or the night or the 290 to the 390 and I
mean how many times have they relabeled
these things yeah now well you mentioned
earlier before we started the 580 X
they're coming out with in what yeah
that's what I was you pulled me out this
link with the 600 I was looking up 580 X
and I mean a lot of this stuff doesn't
really interest me a whole lot like
refresh is on GPUs the na'vi thing does
interest me going into na'vi
i think that's awesome but that's 2019
so and that's all saying with the tide
over like gtx 1060 isn't really a tide
over card man like I've sold pcs where
people just love having a 1060 in there
they're like that's their dream card
like for me I could play games day in
day out and just have a mad experience
on the 1060 wouldn't be well not right
over not to what not to plug the video I
posted today yeah but did you by chance
see at least see the title of the video
I posted today no actually I've been
busy test soak I wasn't to rather than
second chance 4k gaming on a 1050 Ti
can you do it in triple again thank you
I'll go watch it all right
often it offers a live stream and I'll
give you my face but basically the gist
of it is the solution to cryptocurrency
mining can you go out and buy a $200
shouldn't be 200 should be cheaper but
currently they're $200 a 10:50 TI
can you play current Triple A games at
4k at 60 plus frames per second average
can you don't you guys don't leave the
leaves and livestream and watch it yet
just yet don't leave because we've got
rumors now eight zero eight six K so
it's coming out anniversary apparently
5.1 gigahertz boosts for the guys who
want to get a prebend essentially looks
like a prebend 8700 K what's your
thoughts on this 95 watt TDP and so hang
on lemme poke to lick Oh 14 dat 6 8 8 8
0 8 6 k so the available six being for
x86 yeah celebrating x86 so yeah that
looks pretty cool I mean how hard at
overclocks it looks like it's Bend and
that'll be pro cool if they don't
publish the all core turbo the 5.1
doesn't mean anything to me
it does to me a little bit Mike I think
in terms of bidding even getting a
single core up to 5.1 would be
representative of a solid chip I mean it
depends like I'd love to see Silicon
lottery get a heap of these and then
you've got suddenly 5.3 gig guaranteed
chips so yeah this is rumored to come
out in June as well so we're looking at
a June release 8th of June that's
apparently man some of these rumors are
really strong right around Computex that
does make a lot of sense for this rumour
and of course 8700 K is a beast it's a
beast of a CPU there's no denying that
results are out any other thoughts
because we're gonna move on to
cryptocurrency as well but of a topic
that's sort of rearing its head up again
as prices before Before we jump to that
do you want to address that this is sort
of the last hurrah of the six core
before the rumored we talked about the Z
390 but we never really talked about the
eight core chip the 10 nanometre
yeah so we didn't really go into depth
on the Z okay so the Z 3 not until is
preparing ok we'll pull this up now it's
actually a good article okay so until is
preparing the 10 nanometre is ice lake 8
cores 16 threads
and it's C 390 and it won't apparently
work on a Z 370 though I have heard
rumors that it may work on a Z 370 I'm
not a whole I'm not entirely sure but
the Z 390 rumors are like concrete I
would say at this stage and the 10
nanometer is a little bit scary I mean
do you what do you think is gonna come
out of this do you think they're gonna
get lower clock speed with this eight
core 16 thread and essentially no IPC
gains what's your thoughts on this well
based upon the experience going to 14 in
a meter with Broadwell I don't think the
first generation of tendon and meter is
going to be impressive because it's I've
seen rumors both ways because I've seen
rumors that I mean it depends upon what
site you go to because you see fine
counter rumors the problem is you
remember we never got a k chip in the
5000 series in the fifth gym because you
know that's why we got Devil's Canyon
the refresh because they couldn't get 14
nanometer good enough at the time yeah
so I think it is entirely possible that
the whole first year to two years of 10
nanometer is gonna be like a sideways
improvement its power efficiency and
it's them working the issues out but I
think we're gonna get an 8 core 16
thread 14 nanometer coffee like oh I
just I do think we're going to I think
I'd be surprised if they do it on 40
nanometer that'd be hot like it's hard
ring boss is like already on the 8700 K
ring boss has been pushed to its limit
that's that architecture sort of thing
like look at them got what if they drop
me at a GPU even then I dare it wouldn't
like the the pinpoint of room there's
enough room on the silicon well though
you'll lose clock speed if they do if
they if if they knock three or 400
megahertz off and they used the die
space of the I GPU there's enough die
space to put eight cores on there oh
definitely possible I just think it's if
they do lower the clock speeds the
appeal of that chip is going to go down
a lot
I think the whole appeal of the six-core
this time around the 8700 K was it's 5
gigahertz that was the big appeal 6
cores 12 threads 50% more relevant than
the 7700 K it was a big deal though if
they're lowering the clock speeds a lot
of those people the 8700 Ches are a lot
of people who want to upgrade and they
go to the Intel route they probably
won't want to go with the 8th caller
probably say hey the sixth goal is good
enough it'll last for a few more years 5
gigahertz based IPC my bestest today let
me throw out a crazy idea when is the
last time they used the Extreme Edition
badge on consumer-level chips not the
high-end desktop whoa I mean what if
they came out with an i-9
8900 x8 core 16 thread coffee lake with
no I GPU but works in the consumer
platform and soldered it that would be a
big what-if but if they did it would
definitely make some waves if they
specifically label it extreme edition
for enthusiasts soldered meant for the
people who buy that kind of stuff sort
of as a maybe as an acknowledgment that
that section of the market is not the
the J I mean they use the cheap thermal
paste because they longevity and cheap
and price but I mean if they're gonna
sell this thing for you know 399 or I
can't see them making an 8-quart chip
over 399 at this point that they'd be
laughed at compared to rise it wouldn't
they depends on any PCIe lanes to
another argument people are willing to
like when you're talking you've got if
you've got the best product you've got
the best product you make to skews then
you make once the highest clock speeds
that's the X label you make the K that's
the more 399 so they definitely do it
into excuse until on that so that make
one for 600 bucks one for 400 bucks that
would be my thinking and so
yeah I just like I'm worried I want to
see if they are going through with 14
nanometer I really want to see what
they're doing with it
but I believe a 10 animated ship would
be very interesting that's the you know
looking at this transistor gate thing I
mean that's crazy how he noticed that
a.m. do you notice though that AMD is
skipping 10 and going from 12 to 7 yep
and Intel stopping at 10 when's the last
time they weren't on the same production
process together you'd have to remind me
man his details of 220 add 28 32 32 and
28 would it be glow fo no no the FX was
on 32 as well the FX was on 32 yeah now
they did a couple of odd chips on 28
they never did 22 though did they they
went straight to 14 they did 28 on the
on their on their low-end apu yeah that
was Ronde as Long's yeah was it yeah but
I mean if you go back before then if you
go back to Pentium 4 if you go back to
Athlon XP even if you go back to the old
k5 and k-6 chips they always basically
use the same nodes that Intel used maybe
one behind but they were yeah
interesting that so they're going
different all I'm saying is what's what
could Intel do that would give people
pause at fine rise and I'm just trying
to think creatively and I'm thinking
okay what what is people's biggest
complaint on Intel the past few years
the lack of soldering chips right the
heat the temp yeah I guess the lack of
soldering has been two big things I sold
ring and what did I just did it say hey
you know viewer pulled me up in one of
my reviews I said aluminum I should have
been saying aluminium see what are you
doing to me tech deals you know is a
little bit of aluminium aluminium let us
know and chat guys let us know what you
think it is as well so yeah the whole
thing that's is it actually and this is
what makes tech so exciting we're going
in different way we're going in
different tangents we're going in
different ways AMD's back on the cpu
lineup I don't know what this is
gonna spell but seven animate is gonna
be crazy I really look forward to that I
mean imagine a family could get the jump
on the Intel again wow that would be
actually have a faster chip well AMD was
the first to a Giga heard after all yeah
well back in those XP days they would
they were nailing it yeah so it's just
exciting times of course the GPU side of
things that is I've just got the knock
that just rocked up the intel knock that
is Wow like I'm testing doing a little
bit testing and it's and in ways it
makes me a little bit sad because AMD
spent so long putting R&amp;amp;D money into
their ap use and it seems like Intel's
just come along now yep cool guys thanks
for the R&amp;amp;D and we've got now one
awesome solution and like I don't know
that's just I was surprised
so AMD probably could use the money yeah
I know they probably back in the day
could have used made better decisions
AMD a few years ago I actually in 2016
when I did my sky like overviews all of
my cpu reviews back in 2016 were
basically on on Intel and my comments
regarding AMD were they really don't
have a very compelling product the FX
chips are hot and they're slower and you
know they they never really updated the
am-3 platform it was missing PCI Express
3 it was missing USB it was missing a
few other things and it just was it was
it was it's great to have that backward
compatibility but it ages when we get to
2020 the promised future of the am 4
platform and ddr5 and PCI Express 4.0
and nvme 2 and a bunch of other stuff
comes out the am 4 platform is going to
look really really old at that point and
if they don't have any m5 ready that'll
be a mistake but I am D if you look at
there's two I commented actually back in
2016 that Intel had more short term cash
in the bank than AMD's entire stock
market capitalization I mean Intel
could've bought double petty cash
yep but it yeah AMD has been struggling
just to exist and say you bring up I
bring this up because you brought up the
cpu situation with it with the NIC and
the and Vega going in Intel yeah
AMD can make the best processors in the
world but if they run out of money or
can't afford rnd for the next gen what
differences mike yeah it's terrible
they've definitely got their company up
to a bigger healthy standpoint and to be
honest that team now is amazing that
team's phenomenal I've met like their
team and in these events and they're on
their game now especially the CPU
division so what you're gonna see in
2018 is the return like the real return
of AMD that's what I think
of course the GPU side it's weird now
because Rajic Dury going over to intel
with that knowledge and this is the
biggest thing and this is what I think
the real reason for GT GPP is from
Nvidia I don't think the real reasons to
knock AMD out of the game I think the
real reasons to get a pre-emptive move
on Intel moving into the desktop
graphics scene I don't know why really
anyone hasn't talked about that yet
but they're doing like intel has a
massive amount of R&amp;amp;D cash they have a
huge budget and NVIDIA knows that and so
vraja' Kaduri going over there with his
knowledge and skills it's like yeah
Intel desktop dedicated GPUs you can
expect that that's coming so the TAC
scene is going to get exciting in the
next couple of years make sure you
subscribe to tech deals and take a city
for the latest for the real opinions and
yeah it's it's crazy so anyway we've got
some other topics we better move along
as otherwise we're gonna be here for
hours and hours we've got the next
article up here crypto currency it's
back up again ass back up to over half a
grand Zen cash is back up remember I was
watching the Zen cached I didn't think
this would happen so soon but Zen cache
is back up to 34 dollars USD so mining
in the states is still profitable at
least for now my mind you Zen cache is
one of those crypto currencies that's
sort of becoming like the miners
apparently all the miners are scared of
asacs going into a theory
and so these guys from this currency
here are moving on into this currency
here and anyway back to the nature at
hand here we've got I think we're going
to see new graph Scott's coming back in
stock anyway because that crash would
have given people a lot of a lot of
people would have got cold feet in that
crash for sure and so what you're gonna
see is I don't think too many people are
gonna be keen to start mass buying those
graphics cards out again because they
may have thousands of them already or
hundreds and thousands of them already
and what if it crashes again and they've
stuck with cold feet they now have
double the inventory of gravis cards
that they need to dump so I think
Graham's cards and you gravis cards
especially I'm not sure about the
current used gravis card market in
relation to ten sixty ten 70s but what I
think you're going to see is new
graphics card prices will be fine
they're not gonna be that as good as
they were because keep in mind these
guys will have their eyes peeled when
that price is as it is 34 bucks and if
they can pick up a ten seventy for cheap
enough they'll pull the trigger on it'll
be like yep give me that cheap ten
seventy let's make some money but I
think they've still got that cold feet
option where they will be like okay
we're not gonna buy a lot more stock
because of the risk
we've got cold feet before we're nervous
we're just gonna sit out and not buy
anymore grabs cards so that's yeah
anyway what you
and tents oh I love tent 280 bucks as
well and 630 bucks for today the only
cold water I would throw on what you
just said is I don't think you know you
are more of an expert on cryptocurrency
than I am because I don't actually mind
but I've read the news and I mean I
follow it from the standpoint of the
fact that it's kind of died mine
I'm sorry I don't mind anymore did you
stop that because I remember seeing your
video on that yeah I did just feel like
I said when I made that Breaking Point
video that was the point where yeah it
was just worthless term on me it's gone
back on but yeah well did you see the
news article about the Russian investor
who bought two power plants in Russia to
run his cryptocurrency mining operation
you showed me that on Twitter that was
incredible
it's not the guy buying six graphics
cards off of Newegg or Amazon or
whatever that is destroying the market
it's the companies I actually ran across
the company with crypto mine in their
name they bought to 1080 T eyes from me
about two months ago they're going to
the distributors and they're not buying
them from retail they're going to Ingram
Micro marisel the the big distributors
and they're buying 5,000 graphics cards
at a time that's that's what's destroyed
the market it's not the guys buying five
off of Amazon it's quite literally
they're buying thousands of them at a
time and that's part of why you know the
when you get to the point to where Greg
Greg from asan studio would disagree
with you
what about you mean about about whether
they're buying that many herbs or not
whether they're destroying the market
they're destroying the market from a
gamers point of view yeah I mean if you
want to buy 150 and a hundred and $49 rx
570s they're ruining match lubra this
way uh it wasn't that many months ago it
was just in the fourth quarter of last
year that I was seeing six gig ten 60s
for 209 on Amazon you could buy three
gig ten 60s for like 159 169 on Amazon
yep
that's gone yes the problem is they did
they did need to put in limits per
customer its limits per customer have
existed before this cryptocurrency boom
whenever a products been perceived as
being hot they want it to get into as
many individuals hands as possible so
that was my biggest graph with this
whole crypto thing is yeah you're
allowing corporation to by yeah like ten
thousand graphics cards at a time that
is killing the market literally and they
should be limited to buying it like they
should have a limit on that for sure and
that's all weight limits have been
placed in different retailers throughout
the world to per customer or whatever so
that was my base graph of the whole
thing yeah yeah little guys aren't
destroying the market you know doing
little Snipes here and there you know
making a little pocket then they don't
kill the pot killing the market you know
a guy's got 110 cm he's like okay I can
pick up with 1074 cheap I'm gonna go buy
that 1070 whether it's used or whatever
put it in my rig and have two cards
mining when I'm sleeping that guy's not
killing the market yeah it's the big
corporations buying five ten thousand
cards and to try and like I mean I watch
Greg's video and it was he's right like
in the perfect world is right but the
world ain't perfect
and I think there should have been
limits on those companies on how many
cards they should have bought they
should have definitely the companies and
the distributors should have been more
responsible for getting cards out to
individuals that's my opinion on here's
here's the thought for you because they
would build individuals yes but the
companies that are but that are ordering
5,000 cards at a time easy business you
are offering more per card
the only way they can buy that many
cards is they have to go to the big
distributors Inger micro is the largest
distributor of this kind of stuff in the
United States and if they go to Ingram
Micro and say we'll offer you $50 more
per card then Newegg is paying you if
you sell us 5,000 of them they're not
asking for a discount they're offering a
premium yeah if you were offered $50.00
times five thousand cards and they could
be shipped on pallets in one go mmm you
can make all the help the consumer
arguments you want but I think the bean
counters thing or micro would go yeah so
and that's well that's where it comes
down to consumer law because this I mean
this problem I mean I don't know what
the laws are but maybe this is a lesson
to be learned maybe some laws need to be
changed because you know like if you're
a policeman do you get paid enough money
to ignore it an offense you know like
where does the where does the buck stop
so you wouldn't like this but in the
United States our Supreme Court has
ruled the police have no duty to help
you Wow
thank you that's they have note you
cannot sue them and you cannot complain
if you call them and they don't show up
or if they stay back and don't come in
and help you they have no liability damn
and I'm sorry I that's totally unrelated
but I'm mentioning it just because so
check well TVs Alabama in the world the
world you brought it up so I thought I'd
toss I you mentioned the laws I think
the laws probably in Europe or better
but I mean are you kidding in America
the corporate friendly haven of the
world yeah yeah so that's I mean if it
lessens to come out of this is it needs
to be some laws that need to be changed
people need to be held accountable for
flogging off 10,000 graphics cards to
one corporation rather than trying to
get those cards into individuals hands
especially when they advertised as
gaming graphics cards for PC games I'm
looking I'm looking at Newegg right now
and there is a rx 588 gig MSI card for
325 after $20 mail in rebate that's
still over launched retail but that's
not so far over retail if you've been
sitting around going man I really wish I
could buy one 325 for an 8 gig 580
it's not bad yeah it's not bad that's
timing that's that's not look two months
ago that would have been a five or six
hundred hour card mm that's not I mean
look if you've been waiting and you want
a nice card go buy one that's my opinion
okay
okay so well I think that wraps up the
main topics we've talked about
everything from crypto currencies to
Verizon Plus we even talked about a bit
of a specter melt down there with the
x58 and yeah I should elaborate a little
bit on X 50 other Specter thing I like I
haven't found any problems with specter
and meltdown
I think the browser patching is the most
important thing patching the browsers so
you don't get malicious content via just
some random JavaScript or whatever some
random website I think that's the most
important thing of course it remains to
be seen the full effect of it is it one
of those things what was that old school
program where you got your friend to
open an exe file and then you started
opening up his DVD drive and he got
scared and all that
I forgot that one with those days there
was that program like it was gonna be
something like that all over again it's
nothing to worry about but again I spoke
to so many different people it seems
like some people like this is a massive
threat somebody like neh for the
individual it's not gonna really matter
it's gonna matter more for industries
especially cloud clouded cloud-based
storage and servers I I I know a couple
of people who still are involved with
large companies fortune 500 level
companies Fortune 1000 level companies
and they are from my former work and IT
stuff you know the consumer side is
actually much newer for me I mean I'm
much more used to servers and and and
that sort of thing
um there are quite a few companies that
are wholesale replacing anything more
than three years old and that have made
the internal decision that it's simply
not worth the risk or trouble if it if
it doesn't have a secure update now the
other thing is there's other
vulnerabilities besides just spectral
meltdown I mean the Intel's management
engine and some other technologies have
had their CPUs for the past ten years
really shouldn't have been there in the
first place or the
should have been disabled at the
hardware level and weren't if you go
back 15 20 years CPUs were completely
secure I mean you didn't have the fact
is a lot of people don't realize this
but as long as there's power applied to
your motherboard and CPU your CPU is
never actually often you can't turn it
off unless you pull the plug out of the
wall because or turn the power switch
because the management engine how do
people think their computers can wake up
at 3 o'clock in the morning when they're
off they're not they're never off you
have to unplug them and that I think is
a bad design I mean I get why they did
it but it bothers me so there are
companies that are just replacing them
in regards to consumers is the risk
large to consumers no but the day will
come when the script kiddie level stuff
comes out browser malware or something
comes out the problem with specter in my
opinion is that it bypasses all the
internal encryption and the CPU if you
get infected by it my understanding and
I'm not a cyber security expert but my
understanding is you could have
encrypted internet connections you can
be using local encryption you can be
using Drive BitLocker
you can have all of the security turned
on that you want but because it's
happening is an internal hardware design
flaw of the chip none of it matters
because Spectre bypasses all of it and
allows one program to read the
unencrypted part of another program yeah
no matter what I did here though erm
CPUs a virtually immune to it like even
though they can get the stuff working
like in theory it's really extremely
difficult for them to get actually
something you know usable out of an air
IM cpu that's what i heard so yeah
mobile phones are safe i guess and then
keep your minds a bit higher than intel
as well both both Samsung and Apple both
had to come out with firmware patches
for Spectre meltdown on their phones and
that's where I think it would affect and
uses the most would be on smartphones
I mean I lock my PC down I don't do
anything dodgy with it especially my
main ring I got ladies laptop for dodgy
stuff if you want to surf some website
you've never seen before just yeah a lot
this old-school crappy laptop yeah okay
didn't get a virus out of this I'm all
good to go I so we got a sin chat as
well so I'm good we'll start taking a
bit of Q&amp;amp;A I pulled up a live chat on
the stream here see I'm on my streaming
game now we've even got a light here
it's too bright though dims it out we've
got the live chat now up on so everyone
can see the live chat and we've got
input lag why is it lower on the 50 X 58
X 56 75 I don't know I've got to looking
at all this I've got to get apples to
apples input like hundred percent I've
got to rule out any variance so I will
be getting an LED light as well and I'm
gonna go on that tangent that's that's
the stuff I love I used to be believe it
or not a brood war competitive player
back when there was no money in eSports
so there's that side of me I'm gonna be
actually doing a lot more content with
that I absolutely love competitive
gaming I think it's awesome
so but that's a big passion of mine I'll
be looking at input lag over the next
few months I absolutely love it get to
the bottom of it as if there if it is
why my guess would be ddr3 and just sort
of a more less less registers maybe I
don't know less paths to go through it's
just it was or are you are we talking
about why the older platforms even
though the benchmark well aren't just
snappy we're now not snapping this by
actual input lag total like you click
the mouse button for instance in a game
you fire you pulled the trigger that
input the total inputs a lag time is
lower on an older school piece attack
than the 8700 K for example and I read
up a study about the oldest Mac or
something apparently like a Mac back in
1980s had the fastest I I've got to look
up more studies it's something I want to
go off on because I love going off on
these tangents I think the last time I
went on one of these crazy tangents was
with audio and I learned so much about
that that's why when you see my
motherboard comparisons now I cover
audio and I'm able to cover it
I feel like I'm able to cover it so well
because of that tangent because I went
off and learned everything about that
discipline input lags another discipline
I want to go down and I have a feeling
if blur bosses are out there I'd love to
have a chat with them they do phenomenal
work
I'd love to sort of be like the pad one
and get trained up from some of these
guys
I noticed game's Nexus he was ready to
go down that power supply route I'm
really keen to see what comes out of his
channel now so new disciplines are
always good what's your new discipline
do you want to pick up something you
well boy you know it's it's there's so
many different ways you can go I can sit
here and have a conversation about the
value of five to ten year old technology
and how capable it still is and then I
can turn around and talk about why the
brand-new stuff is such an amazing value
for the money the downside of the older
stuff is if everyone did that we would
never have new stuff but then somebody
has to buy the new stuff what the game
devs not really making a compelling
argument see some of these games that
are released they're so bad the
optimization is terrible I mean have a
look at the consoles I think the value
for the money in PC gaming today is
unbelievably if I had to say I want to
do a video right now I would love to
talk about how you can put together a
basic computer for very very little
money and if you don't care about
playing far cry 5 in Assassin's Creed
origins if you put those aside and
instead you go well there's all these
free-to-play games there's there's the
if you look at all the free
entertainment there's available online
you can basically entertain yourself
with the rest of your life for basically
nothing
I don't know about you but 1020 years
ago I don't remember all this free
content am I just miss remembering or
did it not use to again take a game like
World of Tanks hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of people a day play that game
and you can play it totally for free dad
different times different age not a nice
it feels like I don't know maybe we're
just in this did you play the original
counter-strike mod for the original
half-life yes years ago one point see I
mean it's not C's go CS 1.6 yeah I'd
love that
that was like free endless entertainment
I remember playing that for more hours
than I should admit and here's the funny
thing
Counter Strike global Offensive not
interested really figure I like go
better like I think it's just optimized
I think it's a great game in terms of
what demise I miss the simplicity of the
old days I guess I don't know yeah
you're too old-school I mean I love
old-school music you put me some 80s
music I'm like choosing that over
anything but yeah games I think games
have gone in the right direction some
I've caught some of them some of them
are just terrible I'm looking forward to
seeing I want a new like boulders gate
to like I want a new boulders gate to
I'm really hanging for that that was
like for me that was just one of the
best games of all time if not my
favorite game of all time ya know why
would companies want to spend this is
one downside why would companies want to
spend millions and millions and millions
of dollars developing this amazing story
content deep level immersive exploration
like Baldur's Gate yeah we're a people
we'll wait for it to be on a $10 Steam
sale be a bunch of people will do people
have been trained to wait for those I've
been trying to wait for those so you say
you wait for a $10 team sale or people
will just you know pirate it download it
or or they'll sit down and play it but
then it only has sales for a couple of
months and then it dies whereas you can
come out with a fortnight and just print
money for you
years to come how much money did it cost
to develop fortnight versus ballers gate
- if you wanted to make a baldur's gate
- today would that cost you a penny less
than 50 million dollars yeah exactly
right I mean yeah I guess we can kiss
those old-school games goodbye right and
sad so look I'm not endorsing what I
just said I'm just saying let's see oh
I'm endorsing what you said I think yeah
the new games now they're more just bang
straight into the action and I mean
that's a good thing right
especially for time poor people but like
I feel like I want to kick back I'm
actually going to go back to fight Final
Fantasy 15 is on the top of my to play
list
I just want to go through that so please
don't spoil it for me if it sucks or
it's good I just I just want to play an
RPG again and so yeah that's I don't
know that's like somebody in chat just
said bring back Wing Commander well
actually the good thing is GTA 6 when
that comes out I'll be Bobby
pre-ordering that GTA 5 was phenomenal
that was like for me that was the New
Age boulders gate I got so immersed with
that game GTA 5 was just incredible on
PC I and GTA 5 demonstrates that you can
make money but it's the online component
I think that has carried it I actually
read the other day GTA 5 has now become
the number one income entertainment
property in history it has now passed
six billion dollars and good I love that
because it was a good game that but it's
just but here's the challenge with GTA
online how in the world are they gonna
come out with a sequel and not destroy
in I'm going from memory here but I want
to say the fourth quarter last year they
made 263 million dollars from GTA online
yeah somebody tell me if I'm wrong than
that but I'm pulling that from memory
but if you're still making a billion
dollars a year on a four year old game
five year old would it come when it come
up 2013 yeah well thank you Miss I'm
sold on the consoles yeah and then it
came out PC let's see them 50
yeah it's three years old on the PC and
five years old on the consoles yeah and
they're making they're still making a
billion a year from it that's that's
what I mean can we get like a boulders
gay I guess if they do react a redo
boulders gate adding more pop culture
and stuff like adding a bit more homies
and gangsters and stuff and it has to be
online and you have to have
microtransaction oh yeah spell-casting
gangsters that's what we need
bring it on III don't care as long as
the story's good so digital valor and
chat just said Pokemon ghosts still make
some million dollars a day Wow okay okay
so yeah we got the questions as well
sorry completely ignored chat for like
the last five sorry guys any thoughts on
upgrading to the 2600 ex yeah I mean
it's way to the review but I'm gonna
give my whole opinion and thoughts on it
my review is gonna be my review I'm
gonna say though with what I've got so
far I'm very impressed and it's in I
guess it's gonna be a lot it's my
reviews gonna be a lot of different
other people's reviews I think that
already because it's going to go in
relation to what I've already covered in
the past and what I think they've
improved on anyway that's all I'm gonna
say I can't say about performance
figures we can't drop any actual
performance figures at all it's a strict
NDA I definitely can't I don't have one
yet I will ask a favor because yeah like
I think people would love to see your
rise into cars or as the second gen
sorry I keep saying rising - it just
runs into three it's all success they've
confused it with that yeah well like I
said on the thing rise in second
generation so me I just cut off the
second put it to there but you know
risin two will be next year I think and
then this is Verizon Plus yeah Zen plus
anyway so did you testing first yeah I'm
testing yeah of course I did test the
first gen on the X 470 as well that'll
be in the review
I've almost wrapped up on my review
results so got to start recording that
probably spend all tomorrow recording
the video and cutting it and getting it
ready for the lift and stuff but yeah
it's it's cool guys so it's awesome oh
yeah anyway this was the first pile of
the tech world TV hope you guys we're
gonna rap down the chat as well if
there's some dying questions as well
we'll of course we do give priority to
donations because our job to this is our
jobs so if you guys want your question
desperately answered even a dollar and
we tech world TV this is the new show
we're all good to go
I hope you guys enjoyed the first pilot
I'm a little bit sorry if I've been a
little bit complacent today first
livestream in a long time I've had to
dust off my microphone I've forgotten
how to live stream and I hope we did a
good job I hope the audio was pretty
balanced one thing it's always hard
getting the audio balance thing man tech
deals we had to run through a few
different times to get the audio
balanced hope it's balanced had to get
the chat ready and just so yeah had to
do that so yeah so we just had to do all
that so anyway anyway hopefully it'll
work out dinner and we got the judge our
mug so cheers yeah alright guys so that
yeah just about wraps it up and we look
forward to so if you guys have topics as
well topics for next week desperate
topics you want us to talk about then
drop a comment in the comment section
below as well top up voted topics will
be talked about next week stream as well
and of course thank you guys as well
this is just you know lately I've been
reflecting back on the channel it's
starting to do really well in 2018 and
I'm giving it my all starting to
collaborate with awesome people like mr.
deals here and it's just yeah
everything's coming along guys thank you
so much for the support everything
everything in between also got this as
well a goes your camera tech deals has a
back little backdoor camera there so we
can see what I'm doing live I got this
as well 36 hundred megahertz memory as
well looking forward to testing that on
rise and even though it's all gonna be
part of the official review
that'll be like the King ding-a-ling
stuff but risin and memory speeds that
are important and that's one thing we
can sort of reference off previous data
so anyway
closing statements mr. deals watch the
reviews on Thursday and do you want me
to give you some numbers do you want me
to give you some numbers and you can run
a launch day video here's the funny
thing
based upon the leaks that I've seen from
other sources based upon the clock
speeds if you don't already own horizon
if you've got a three plus year old
machine I almost would be willing to
recommend it without even seeing the
numbers because if it's better than
rising salary recommend Rises I already
recommend the first gen Rises thank you
this didn't exist you came to me right
now and said well I've got a three or
five year old PC what should I buy rise
in five sixteen hundred thousand seven
seventeen hundred that would be my
recommendation today these new chips are
faster and better and price competitive
with improved motherboards
and at least as good RAM support if not
better I know that a lot of people say
well what are the reviews say well it
just seems to me like I did I know you
know a recommendation without testing
sounds bad but I could almost recommend
it blind which sounds really bad cuz I'm
not an AMD fanboy because I love coffee
like and I love my sky like X render box
but 329 for a 4.3 gigahertz eight core
chip with a with with a wraith prison
cooler 320 yeah I'll take one 329 what'd
I say
you said 339 I thought 329 329 sorry
it's it's just the C that's a thing
anyway before we go you guys I don't
know first livestream we're getting
comfortable here
before we move out
I think AMD have a better product on
their hands then even they think they do
this time around but anyway stay tuned
for my review can't wait to release it
for you guys and we are as well am I
even meant mr. deals if we've got a bit
of time as well and might even do the
patron livestream as well that's just
where we shoot back talk anything
completely untaek related to so it
doesn't even matter and yeah we'll catch
you guys thanks so much for tuning in
first tech world TV hope it went well
hope it was smooth and tell us if you
like the new format as well and yeah
yeah thank you everybody
