settings and get some real high FPS for
competitive plays well today's bill will
do just that this video was brought to
you by skins dot cash start getting
instant cash now for your csgo dota 2 or
even Team Fortress skins all you have to
do is head over to the website drop in
your Steam trade URL which requires a
secure valve login to so it's completely
safe and then you can start getting
instant money for your skins today they
also have a loyalty reward program which
I'll put in the link in the description
below for so the more you trade the more
you get rewarded welcome back guys and
today with the 7600 K although it has no
AI PC games it is arguably still the
best CPU out there for gaming besides
the 7700 K so clocking this thing to 4.8
gigahertz and playing games in 30
degrees ambient heat was no problems but
what parts did I exactly use for this
build let's take a look
you
you
you
now before we hit the benchmarks I will
say if you want some higher graphics
settings in this build then you can
always just drop the gtx 1060 and go
with the gtx 1070 or a gtx 1080 though a
lot of the times competitive gamers tell
me that they have no desire for ultra or
even high settings so going with
something like low or medium settings
will stress the cpu heavily and as a
consequence you won't need such a
powerful GPU though let's take a look at
those benchmarks
so there it is the results of this beast
early man of a beastly red clock -
really high speeds it was handling all
those competitive titles at 1080p like
an absolute boughs csgo hit a one-stage
550 FPS and also overwatch get near the
cap dota 2 same story battlefield 1 will
send some real high FPS - so not only
does this make a really smooth
experience but it also draws the frames
as fast as possible to give those
competitive games that edge that they so
need to get one up on their opponents as
for the temps they are pretty well
controlled and even though it's some
here at the moment none of the parts
dropped out or anything like that and
remain well within their means also for
some of the parts in this build like the
memory for example it's RGB it looks
fancy and all that but it isn't the best
price performance so we'll put some
extra links in the description below if
you guys want to get better price
performance but as for the memory it is
3 gigahertz on the X and B profiles
there and it does have that RGB lighting
which does make it look pretty sexy
though you will need additional cables
which do splice off the 12-volt fan head
of that so keep in mind at that point
and also it is very tall too so if
you've got a cooler that's very thick
then you will have a very hard time
mounting this memory the u 12s just
managed you clear it in this build also
I wanted to take a look at the view 27
which was sent out as a review sample
from Thermaltake this is a case which
has a clear side panel but not just that
it does away with the top of the case to
get more of a view hence the name of the
case building was very straightforward
and easy and also the bottom off
enclosure made it so that your power
supply will remain hidden at all times
and behind that the enclosure there is
room for two 3.5 inch hard disk drives
and also an additional slot for an SSD
in the middle of the case at the back
there cable management is also pretty
straightforward and easy so that you'll
have no problem staying off cables and
also will say that although the top is
not there to support fans or a radiator
it did make the final part of the build
that much easier especially when it came
to plugging in the CPU eight pin and
also the u 12s fan headers inside the
main compartment you have support for
three 2.5 inch hard drives and there is
also the ability to mount your graphics
card vertically though that is an
optional kit and you will need the riser
cable in order to mount your GPU
vertically at the front of the case
there is room for three 120
fans though you can't mount a 360 Miller
out there and there's only support for
one 120 ml rat on the rear or 120 or 240
ml rat on the front and the inside and
you can also install an additional fan
down the bottom too so overall it is a
pretty solid case there there are a few
drawbacks to the view 27 mainly the
backplate for plugging in the GPU cables
seem to get in the way and also bigger
coolers will have a really hard time
fitting in this case the okie nose
cooler that I had here was almost
impossible to fit and the U 12s just
barely fitted that so keep in mind that
only small to medium sized coolers will
fit in this case the cooler master 212
evo should fit too and then lastly for
the price it costs $80 USD or 89
Australian dollar so it's actually a
better deal in Australia than it is to
the US I believe and it's also a good
option if you like what the view 27
brings to the table especially in terms
of cosmetics anyways I hope you enjoyed
this video and let me know what you
think of the high FPS gaming machine do
you like your settings down low or
medium or do you like your settings on
higher ultra at the cost of lower FPS
would love to read your comments as
always and I'll catch you in another tag
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
