down in Melbourne I am at the Huawei
booth and this is one booth that I've
definitely wanted to visit for a while
now joined by Mitch how you doing
hey hey done really good and we've got
the new phones on display here but first
time I will say I've been a big user of
Huawei for a couple of years now and
I've got the p9 I love it it's got the
dual camera the UI is really good I'm a
big fan boy to say the least is one
thing I'm gonna fanboy in tech it's
these phones so tell us what's going on
what's new at this booth here what is
getting released from Huawei what can
the viewers expect everybody so the very
first device I want to talk to is the
while wane over 2a
released last week this sits in our
mid-range at $4.99 into a JB hi-fi and
Vodafone what you're gonna get
5.9 inch screen octa-core processing
huge amounts of internal storage a
massive Ram and this is a device that
has flagship specs and is sitting in a
mid-range price point so that's
absolutely amazing
the two major devices that we have
brought to pax this year first one is
the huawei mate 10 this is coming to
stores on the 15th of November Vodafone
and JB hi-fi cool thing about these
phones is they're the world's first AI
embedded phones so they've actually got
inside sitting on the next to the CPU a
dedicated NPU which takes all of the
machine learning away meaning you can in
real time recognize things in photos
objects changes settings and it will
adapt to your usage now I've noticed
with these phones they will both have
the dual cameras yeah yeah yeah both got
the dual cameras that's awesome I can't
miss with that feature now especially
with the Instagram getting photos for
you guys but also with this screen here
on the mate 10 it looks extremely good
is there any news science to it yeah
cool so it's an IPS LCD 2k resolution
screen in a traditional 16 by 9 ratio
many it's fantastic for all of your
media consumption also on the Nova to a
you've got the Australia's first quad
camera phone so what it means is you've
got a dual camera on the front and on
the back so you're gonna get
unbelievable selfies as as well as
regular shots even in environments like
this so now we're back with the last of
the newest phones coming out from Huawei
this is the May 10 Pro Y and the screen
looks absolutely gorgeous do you want to
tell us a little bit more about this
absolutely so we've got a little bit
different with this one so we've gone
an OLED panel in an 18 by 9 inch ain't
saved by 9 ratio meaning that it's
amazing for all of your news your social
media you just get so much more real
estate on your screen you're also gonna
get double the internal storage at 128
internal 6 gigabytes of RAM it's an
absolute beast of a phone so now more
about pricing and availability on the
may 10 in the may 10 pro what can we
expect with these phones so you mate Sen
is gonna be available in Vodafone and JB
hi-fi from the 15th of November it's
gonna be eight nine nine mates empro is
gonna be exclusive to Optus from the 4th
of December at 1099 there is one more
things to make the deal a little bit
sweet up up until Christmas whatever
some struggling to find some gifts for
people if you want to preorder the mate
send from Vodafone or purchase it from
JB hi-fi or Optus you're gonna get while
stocks last a huawei 360-degree camera
which plugs directly into USB C port so
it's a it's a really cool piece of tech
valued at one seven nine so there we go
guys a free 360-degree camera I'm sure
there will be a lot of users I could
find some uses for this thing especially
in the daylight I'm sure the night time
performance wouldn't be that good but
it's still for free if your pre-order so
that's a cool bonus one more thing I
want to ask with huawei is what's the
direction with your comedy leh you guys
seem to be offering incredible value for
money that's the reason I got into it
first but also on that note is it like
is there something that makes your
company sets yourselves apart from say
Samsung and the competition what's the
secret sauce I guess involved I think
the one major thing is that we listen to
customers customers want big batteries
they want amazing cameras and they want
an easy-to-use phone and without mate
range and our Nova range we're doing
that we give you huge amounts of usage
time a phone that doesn't slow down an
amazing camera and I mean at the end of
the day that's what a consumer needs and
that's what they're asking for
so there we go guys I've actually been a
longtime user of huawei phones I'm gonna
keep using them they never let me down
and I just love the UI the features of
course that dual camera again if I'm
taking Instagram photos they come out
really well for a smart phone surprised
and with Instagram being mobile only
it's a bit of a hassle but anyway thanks
for your time Mitch for coming out here
