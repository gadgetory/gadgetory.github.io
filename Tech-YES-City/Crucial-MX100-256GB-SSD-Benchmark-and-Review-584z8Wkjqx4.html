welcome back to take a city this is
biryanis you coming back to you guys
today with a review of the crucial MX
100 256 gigabyte model this is recently
recently crucial have released their
value line of SSDs and wow they come
competitively priced out of the box I
mean we're talking 128 gigabytes of SSD
for $79 250 gigabyte 409 dollars and
then 512 gigabytes for 224 dollars this
is recommend retail pricing as well you
probably able to get them on a sale
maybe even cheaper in the future I don't
know but Wow straight away from
recommended retail pricing very
competitively priced
now these drives also not to mention I
mean their value minded but they still
Compaq with features they got trim
active garbage collection they've also
got low-power state support as well so
if you're putting this in a laptop and I
mean SSDs already use low-power as it is
but if you're really conscious you want
that most battery life in your note PC
then wow this thing will go into
low-power mode and save even more power
so that's really cool that it comes with
that it also comes with data loss
prevention as well or power cut
prevention so if your power cuts then
this SSD will pretty much save the files
and basically before it shuts off it'll
make sure that data does not get
corrupted so that could potentially save
you a lot of headaches as well and
that's what I had to remind myself this
whole review I had to remind myself wow
this thing cost 109 dollars
so anyway let's have a look first off at
the build quality of this SSD and then
we'll have a look at the packaging as
well and then we'll go on to the
performance and the conclusion so as
soon as I got the product I noticed that
it came packaged very efficiently it
came packaged in a hard cardboard box
encased in plastic now in the box you
get a bracket and you also get an
activation for some trial software as
well one thing to note though it does
not come with a 3.5 inch drive bay so if
you want to get one of them then you can
buy one of them for pretty cheap
however most cases that I've had come
through this year have pretty much
actually every case that I've had come
through this year and last year has had
support for a 2.5 inch drive bay so
that's not
a problem as well especially when we
look at the cat the hard drive itself of
the SSD sorry itself it comes with four
mounting screws on the top here and also
four mounting screws on the side so
you'll be able to mount this specially
if your case has a 2.5 inch driver
you'll be able to mount this SSD no
problems at all let's look at the build
quality now the front of the case comes
here it comes encased in steel on the
front of the case also with an MX logo
and minimal branding very nice and
subtle that's exactly how I like the
look of my products to be and matters is
impress I mean it's not a nice silver
finish all over the SSD the back of the
case here is actually plastic which is I
mean I don't I'm not too big of a fan
but it again $109 I'm reminding myself
here and I also think a crucial state
that the back of the plate is also for
thermal product properties as well to
keep things cooler so I'll take their
word for it as the whole build quality
does feel really impressive looking at
the connection points here it does also
they are very sturdy so I mean this
whole thing ultimately the build quality
of this SSD feels pretty good you could
probably take a drop or a couple of
drops and still work now let's have a
look at the performance of this drive so
the pretty much the first and only
benchmark I use is a s SSD especially
when we're looking at value minded
products because this benchmark will
give you a general easy to read numbers
especially if you're a gamer or if
you're a desktop enthusiast or if you're
just a general everyday user as well
this benchmark will give you the scores
that you need to know so looking at the
sequential read and writes we can see
here at 490 1.6 3 megabytes per second
this drive has really impressive a
sequential read speed so when you're
loading up those games you're loading on
those big files this thing will load
them up pretty much as quick as it gets
so for write speeds 328 megabytes per
second impressive as well I mean this is
a fast drive if you're writing files
transferring files or in general yet
writing the 2 gigabyte file or write it
in next to no time so looking at the 4k
read and write speeds very crucial
speeds here especially for everyday
usage opening up your browser browsing
the web doing everyday tasks this is
where the SSDs
gonna shine especially when we compare
it to a hard disk drive which I actually
had to stop the benchmark on the hard
disk drive because it would have taken
half an hour just to do one slot off the
4k random reads I managed to get through
the writes but then I said no I'm not
waiting another hour to do this
benchmark and finish it so as you can
see here the SSD is pretty much 50 times
faster than a standard hard disk drive
and that's why I stress for people
always that if you've got a new rig or
you're building a new PC make sure you
put an SSD in there because you will
notice the difference in everyday usage
things will load up a lot faster games
will load up the last five a lot faster
levels of load up a lot faster browsing
the web will be faster as well just
little things that you don't think about
the SSD will save you time now the 4k
read and writes are also at when we
compared to other set other SSDs they're
also among I mean they beat out the
Intel the Intel 240 GB SSD which was
priced higher this thing beated which
was really impressive also when we look
at the 4k 264 threaded speeds here it
impresses with 333 megabytes of
sequential read and then also 233
megabytes on the right side now another
impressive thing about this drive is the
access times 0.05 milliseconds and 0.059
milliseconds Wow these are some of the
fastest access times I've seen on an SSD
and then I had to remind myself $109
Brian okay
so a score all these tally together to
give you a score of 959 points in a SSD
one damn impressive score for a hundred
and nine dollars so with that being said
let's move on now to the conclusion so
in conclusion I don't want to say a
hundred and nine dollars you guys
probably heard me say it so many times
for the review but wow you're getting a
lot of product for your money at this
price when we look at say for instance
the SSD Intel for 240 gigabytes
both of these products they're mean they
both come this comes with a three-year
warranty as well this is priced at
pretty much 2/3 of the price that this
is and it performs better so I don't
know what to say here this drive gets a
high recommendation from me it's really
good value for money and as always
people I know you guys around here
love to see value for money and that's
what the MX 100 series of SSDs brings it
brings extremely good value for money I
can't help but have been nothing but
impressed with this product it hit all
the areas that I want it to hit for $109
and yeah it just performed really well
also one thing to mention before we go
if you have a sand force controller if
you're using an SSD with the sand Force
controller and say you want to get one
of these for a temporary drive if you're
making videos or something like that or
a temp dump drive and you need the fast
speeds do not mix a Marvel and a sand
force together so these this this the
crucial here uses the Marvell controller
this one uses the Intel uses the sand
force and when basically when I had this
is the primary boot drive it wouldn't
recognize the crucial drive and vice
versa when I had the crucial drivers of
the main drive it wouldn't recognize the
Intel drive are there sand forces
controller and this was done on the
intel's
on-board motherboard controller so
that's something to keep in mind these
two these two do not play nice together
also one thing to mention too before we
go is that crucial provided me with a
mobile kit as well this is a crucial kit
so if you want if you want to use an SSD
as mobile storage then you can get one
of these and you can plug it up into the
USB and you can just plug your hard
drive or SSD up to this thing and put it
into the USB port and it'll make for one
quick accessible drive if you need to
save time so that's pretty cool as well
anyway in conclusion I will say Wow
impressive product for the money if you
guys need an SSD and you're looking for
pretty much the best value money for
value for money SSD out there then make
sure you get yourself an MX 100 I'm
definitely going to be recommending
these things in future budget builds as
well the performance was impressive and
the build qualities impressive yeah
comes with a heap of impressive features
and a three year warranty well what more
can I want not much more so one of those
impressive products for 2014 and Wow so
if you liked this video please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions
about this SSD please leave a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can and if you
haven't ready to subscribe to tech acity
and become a yes-man to
anyway I'm gonna roll the outro and I'll
peace peace out for now and I'll catch
you guys with another tech video very
soon bye
