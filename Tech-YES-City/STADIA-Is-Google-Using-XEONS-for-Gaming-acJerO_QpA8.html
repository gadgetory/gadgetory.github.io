specs today's video is brought to you by
surf shark and if you guys need a VPN
that is very inexpensive coming in at
$1.99 a month and also has really good
features as well as over 66 locations
worldwide to use then this VPN is for
you I'll be using it for a few days and
it's very simple to use easy to install
especially for Windows users it's also
got a clean web feature built in which
is very powerful and the best part is if
you use the link in the description
below surf shark comm slash tech yes
city you can get this for as little as a
dollar ninety-nine a month what are you
guys waiting for links in description
below but let's get back to those Google
stadia specs and speculation cloud
gaming and Google stadia was a huge
announcement from Google but more so the
even bigger interest among tech
enthusiasts myself included was the fact
that stadia was going to use AMD
graphics cards we didn't get any
specific model numbers nor did we get an
exact model on the CPU being used but
since they did throw out hyper-threading
this left many to believe that Google
was going to use AMD graphics cards
mixed in with Intel CPUs for their
systems a friend of mine posted a
Twitter survey and this relates well to
market demand in that this is the least
used combination of hardware in PC
gaming and with that it positions Google
to get the best deal all other things
equal though as far as the hardware
itself what we know so far is that there
will be a custom GPU solution being used
however in terms of its performance it
resembles that of a Vega 56 very closely
where the vega 56 solution had 10.5
teraflops and 56 compute units HBM to
the google stadia variant has only point
to teraflops more performance and
everything else looks the same CPU wise
and just like the GPU hardware used
hardware is highly unlikely due to
obvious things like tax benefits
reliability warranty and maintenance so
the 2.7 gigahertz solution with hyper
threading that Google mentioned in their
presentation is what I believe is Z on e
to 170
M this as 6 cores 12 threads and the
cache matches up to what they have
stated and this is the cheapest parent
in a skew line and is also very power
efficient boosting up to 4.4 gigahertz
this enables single threaded games to
run smoothly and then having 6 cores 12
threads available would provide smooth
FPS in games the demand more CPU grunt
Google can also benefit from Xeon
reliability and also further the use of
ddr4 ECC registered memory or here's the
kicker low powered ddr3 memory which is
extremely cheap compared to that of
current ddr4 pricing so my guess is
Google has really thought this through
and got the best deals possible for not
only longevity but also performance and
matching up these specs seems like
gamers will indeed be able to play what
Google is promising so advertised is 4k
60fps with HDR now this of course will
depend on the title and the settings
games like Battlefield 5 and apex
legends for example max settings of 4k
would be a struggle to get this 60fps
figure on this near carbon copy of a
vague of 56 though lowering the settings
or playing something like dota 2 for
example wouldn't be a problem whatsoever
for 4k 60fps the next slide however is
interesting where they have Xbox one X
and ps4 pro pictured side-by-side their
GPU and the teraflop numbers are also
pictured stadia is in a position of
having more power though the massive
difference here is that with the
consoles you actually have the hardware
and not to mention they are console
optimized versus PC optimized now that
still leaves us with the biggest
question in the room relating to the use
of this hardware and that is how much
will Google stadia costs well based on
other models that already work like
Sony's ps4 Pro subscription one would
expect maybe a 20 to $30 a month
subscription fee given the caliber of
hardware that you don't need to own in
order to play the games and the fact
that you'll also no longer have to buy
games when they are released these two
services combined make this for a very
powerful potential service and
especially for those who don't use a
computer for anything but gaming and
mind using a streaming service for
playing these games furthermore another
big factor in favor of stadia is playing
your games anywhere in the world even
off potato-like devices compared to a PC
of course things like smartphones
laptops and even Smart TVs which does
make this a strong proposition then
another question on top of that is how
will Google make any money at only 20 to
30 dollars a month that will simply work
with economies of scale and the fact
that not one single person will use a
steady at PC 24 hours a day I think
Google is more relying on the average
three to four hours a use per day per
person and then from there essentially
reusing the same PC between different
people
hence getting much more value out of a
single system than any individual ever
could though the biggest concern by many
gamers myself included is how will
latency affect the individual gaming
experience Google assures that they are
on top of this and we will look at this
further in the future with tests and
analysis on how they could and couldn't
get it right though I feel this will be
the biggest make or break for stadia and
its success so far they said the
controller will bypass the latency of
the system altogether that you're
currently using and connect directly to
Google servers by built-in Wi-Fi
reception as for the amount of dedicated
stadia servers those details are still
unknown though Google currently has
roughly 2.5 million servers worldwide
and that was back in 2016 so it
definitely has the worldwide reach and
if any company was to get this right
from the get-go
it would be Google though as for the
release date and official pricing that
is definitely still up in the air though
I do believe Google will trial this
service out in the United States first
most likely in an area where there is
fast internet followed by an area
whether it's mediocre internet though a
worldwide rollout could be a dangerous
place so just like Australia being a
test pilot for eBay policies I believe
USA will be the test pilot for stadia
and its initial launch later this year
and of course whether it is the future
of gaming and whether it succeeds
depends on how it plays out in the real
world I'm sure Google didn't intend for
Google+ to be a flop nor do they ever
imagine
YouTube would be as big as it currently
is much like my channel here and how I
do things I believe Google will just
roll with the punches and hope they
don't get knocked out with that said
though let us know what you guys think
are you excited for stadia are you not I
honestly think it will have a big uphill
battle in Australia personally given the
quality of our internet who knows I love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and with that said I'll catch you
in the next video very soon and also if
you haven't already check out today's
video sponsor link in the description
below surf shark completely safe
internet browsing for as little as a
dollar ninety-nine a month and I'll
catch you guys another tech view very
soon
peace out for now bye and if you use the
link in the description description but
also don't need to break the bank bank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
