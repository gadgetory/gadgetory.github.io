sent in a lot of different products and
I've been meaning to do a review on them
but every time I went to do a review
there was another product that would
come up and something else that was more
important and I just get onto that but
today that's all gonna change and we've
also got a few new hot products that
have just been sent in as well
one being a new headset from Audio
Technica which we're going to take a
look at and also Corsair sent out a
massive box of goodies for Christmas so
there's a lot of different reviews that
are going to be packed all into one
video today and we're gonna go through
it pretty quickly so if you guys enjoy
this new format as well then please let
me know in the comments but let's get on
with it
welcome back to tech yes it is Branca me
to you guys today with a look at many
different products sort of like a mass
mini review all in one video and the
first of which we have is the BPHS one
from Audio Technica this is a headset
that's designed for streamers or people
who want a really good microphone built
onto a headset with really good audio
quality now I have tested out the audio
quality coming into these headphones and
it's extremely good bass and mids are
really present it's a warm sound
signature which I'm not used to with
audio technica headphones that I've
tried in the past so for me personally I
love the audio coming into these
headphones but also with that the
microphone is the biggest selling point
of this headset I'm actually recording
this piece here for you guys so you can
hear exactly what it's like dynamic
microphone so it will cancel out a lot
of the background noise but with that
you will need a USB audio interface with
the one I've got now as the edirol by
Roland this has a compressor built on
it's also got an XLR in and also a
quarter inch jack headphone out so out
of the box basically this headset won't
work with onboard audio and a lot of
sound cards too so you will want to get
a USB audio interface if you purchase
this it does come in at 200 USD so it is
a little bit expensive but for what
you're getting it is extremely good if
you want to stream or you want good
audio quality when you're playing games
with your friends or you want to do a
bit of broadcasting work on the side now
it's currently out in the US and in
Australia they're going to release it
locally in early 2018 so expect an
update with that and with that let's get
on to the mod mic
five now so next up now we have the mod
Mike five this is a microphone that just
attaches onto any pair of headphones
regardless of having that cable on your
headphones you now add an additional
cable which makes your headphones a
headset and with the mod Mike five
antol√≠n have told me that they've
improved it over the mod Mike four it's
got a better microphone but also with
that the cabling is much better -
they've included tubular protective
covering so you can put both your
headphone cables and the antlion mod mic
cable into one cable and sort of clean
it up they've also included an inline
mute switch and all this can be had for
50 US dollars shipped to your door so
next up here we have the Xiaomi mi 6 I
think it is and this is a smart phone
that essentially is delivering just pure
value for money in terms of the hardware
comes loaded with six gigabytes of RAM
64 gigabytes of internal storage and
also with that it's an all-glass model
as well so it does look very sleek the
screen is very nice however one thing I
did I did use this for about a good
month and one thing I found over that
period was that the phone itself
although it was fast and snappy it
didn't have problems with the apps
working on this particular phone Google
Maps for example when I was driving and
doing parts hunts I'd pull over and then
I'd try and get my Google Maps just to
quickly check where I was going make
sure I was on the right path and then it
would just quit to the phone top not the
desktop I don't know that's what you
call it the phone top but I'd go to the
phone top and suddenly I'd just by
myself frustrated also the battery life
and the UI was a little bit mediocre for
me as well as the audio coming out of
this phone so the hardware itself if
you're into a very sort of fast and
snappy phone and you need something
that's a workhorse this phone will
definitely be for you if you're looking
for value for money so if you're like me
and you want a little bit more from a
smart phone especially with the UI and
the experience then personally I'm with
Huawei and I've been with them for years
I went back to my p9 after I started
using this and I haven't looked back and
now I'm on the may 10 but if you're
looking for something that does kick it
hard for faith money then I'll put the
link in the description below this was
provided by banggood and it
come in at a pretty good price point
especially for the hardware that you're
getting also the camera was very
mediocre as well especially even
compared to the p9 so it's really got a
lot of just raw hardware that's the
thing that's going for in this phone as
well as the aesthetics so next up here
we have a very cool little LED light
it's called the literate torch and I
actually was surprised when I pulled
this thing out of the box it was very
small it charges up via a USB cable and
it's magnetic as well so you can stick
it to any metal object if you need a
light on the go it does work with a
GoPro as well it does have a GoPro mount
and there are three different levels of
brightness as well as a flashing mode
and you can turn it straight off by
holding the power button down one thing
I would have liked to have seen with
this little attachment would have been a
shootout as well a horseshoe mount so
you could put it on the cameras for
example like my Sony camera that I'm
using now that would have been a really
good addition though I believe you can
just purchase one of these off eBay for
like a dollar and it would fix up this
torch absolutely fine there for what
it's worth very cool little device but
with that said it's time to take a look
at some little keyboards and little
computers and first up here we have the
even PO III it's a mini wireless
touchpad and keyboard and it comes in a
17 US Dollars and so it's very cheap but
one thing I found was the keyboard was
just way too small I could not use this
thing and I would not like to use this
thing just due to how small it is but if
you need something in your living room
or for a Smart TV or something like that
then I can see how something like this
could be beneficial especially if you
don't use it that much and of course the
touch sensitivity was right on the money
it was very good in terms of the touch
sensitivity the keyboard did work well
for what it was and also the coolest
thing about it was you had the modes to
switch between keyboard and touchpad and
when you switch to the touchpad mode the
whole little keyboard itself became one
big Mouse so that was actually a pretty
cool idea and in practice the wireless
signal strong comes with a charging
cable charges via USB too so not a bad
little product for 17 dollars however
speaking of small and small computers we
have here the GPD pocket or gamepad
digital this was an IndieGoGo campaign
starter I think and now it's being sold
on gearbest.com for about 500 US dollars
delivered to your door and so they sent
this over and it does come with Windows
10 pre-installed and now of course
whenever I see a Windows 10 key I just
show you guys i'ma hook up so let me
know in the comments section below if
this Windows 10 key works for you but
with that said it comes with a small
keyboard that works very well and the
build quality is very nice it also has
an Intel Atom CPU processor and also has
eight gigabytes of memory installed with
a 120 gigabyte SSD and this thing really
when it comes down to it is very nice
for watching movies on the go or if you
need to send emails it's are very good
for that as well so it's sort of like a
mini little pocket device that you can
carry with you for quick business in
terms of gaming I don't think it would
do much of that at least I checked can
it run it on dota 2 and this thing
couldn't run it at all I mean it might
be good for some web browser games but
with that said I don't really think it's
a gaming device and more or less
functions as a mini business computer of
course just like the even Poe keyboard
another weakness with this device is
since the keyboard is so small it really
is hard to type on I think I got like 16
words per minute when I was typing with
this device though the little mouse pad
little digit thing that works really
well in practice and also besides that
charging this thing is a breeze and it's
very small both with the adapter
included too so next up with the list of
goodies we have here a box sent in from
Corsair of course there is a channel
sponsor and the reason I took a
sponsorship with them is because they
make really good products and they sent
us out a Christmas gift and inside was a
keyboard that honestly looks really damn
good this is the k70 rapid-fire special
edition or S II it's white key caps on a
very light silver aluminium brush
surface you've also got RGB backlighting
as well and out of the box the RGB
lighting is a really good color code as
well you've got the cherry MX silver
switches as well which are faster than
the Reds in terms of response times so
glad to see that was implemented on this
keyboard you've got your media controls
in the top right I think I have fell in
love with this keyboard already
sorry for the rude interruption I just
had to quickly go outside for a few
hours and start rendering walls with my
friend but back onto topic here we've
got the st 100 headset stand or
headphone stand
it's RGB can also power USB devices from
the included USB device and they also
sent over a hat as well and that's
pretty cool and there was a Christmas
decoration Christmas tree decoration as
well that Nvidia also sent over one as
well so I've got two Christmas tree
decorations now and speaking of hats and
swag and all that as rocks sent over
there hat as well and this one looks
really cool they've also sent over a
folder and a pillow and I'm not sure if
that's a message that they want me to
get more sleep or if they want me to be
more organized and or both so the next
product we got up here is a come eat
gummy robot they sent over two of them
but unfortunately the instructions
didn't work so my brother he just built
this in his spare time and we got it
working here and I decided to give it a
trial run and it works ok I mean the
controls are a little bit awkward it
doesn't move where you want it to go but
you can't control the speed from slow to
really fast and it does get pretty fast
as max speed it's also got different
modes like afraid of the dark and trying
to scare my cat with it my cat just
didn't get fazed at all so I think this
product would be one of those things
that would be really cool if you had a
five-year-old and you wanted to build
sign together and just control two of
these with smartphones each they are $50
u.s. each and I think this was done from
a Kickstarter campaign or something like
that so I wouldn't link in the
description below if you want something
to build with your kids or something
like that just something fun in your
free time but as opposed to just a
dedicated adult something like this I'd
probably rather like some really fast
monster truck or something like that but
with better controls so as I said before
the controls were a little bit awkward
do you have a mind of its own sometimes
and didn't really go where I wanted it
to but did manage to do some burnouts
sometimes which is weird but also with
that the battery life lasts about 20
minutes and you takes about half an hour
to charge off from the computer to so
now the next product we've got here is
the REO link this is a security camera
and it's wireless so it can connect to
your router or your smart
directly or you can put in an microSD
card now it does come with for lithium
batteries you can use a rechargeable
batteries if you like to and so you can
put this anywhere and just start having
a security camera on hand and now I
decided to check the quality of this
security camera and it was actually
surprisingly really good especially in
the dark and I guess that's where you
would want a security camera to perform
so when we put this in the room it
performed really well in the dark so
it's great for monitoring kids but if
you wanted to use it outside for a
dedicated security device and maybe
think twice about it because it does
come with an installation kit you can
screw it down and it is pretty effective
but it's so easy to take off like
they've got two options you can connect
it via a magnet or you can connect it
via screwing it down but both methods
are extremely easy to take this camera
off and just essentially run away with
it though it does work really well and
connecting and setting it up is
extremely easy - they last on the test
bed we have two different products from
Oris and gigabyte though I'm pretty sure
nowadays they're two and the same but
they have first up here the Auris ATC
700 which is a massive cooler with two
fans pre-attached and some RGB on the
top
and this cooler after testing it for 20
minutes with the ex 5670 which is a 6
quart 12 threaded Zeon at 4.3 2
gigahertz at one point 3 5 volt did
extremely well I mean this is an air
cooler it could handle a very aggressive
overclock with 30 degree ambient
temperatures and it did so while
remaining not too late I'll let you guys
take a quick listen to the noise and so
I was actually quite happy with the
performance of this cooler though the
installation was a bit tedious I'd like
to see them maybe rework the
installation on this thing but other
than that it's actually a pretty solid
cooler and if you like the look of it
then maybe it's for you as opposed to
the power supply I don't really have the
proper gear to fully test power supplies
yet but one thing I've noticed though is
I do look for actual voltage changes and
that's related of course not just to the
power supply back to the motherboard
itself and the power supply seemed to
check out it was doing a pretty decent
job at least with overclocking the Xeon
to 4.3 to gigas which again is not
actually bad for the dead heat of summer
so both these parts seem to be doing the
job of course with the power supply
we'll only be able to tell over time if
this thing is a solid unit or not but
with that both these parts will be used
with this x58 motherboard in an upcoming
comparison for you guys are going to be
comparing this X 56 70s Xeon at four
point three two gigahertz versus the
Rison chips which will be overclocked
and the coffee leg chips which will be
overclocked to give you guys an ultimate
showdown and also see how far we've come
in recent times or at least maybe in 10
years almost a decade now with a 1080 Ti
as well as the graphics card that'll be
overclocked too so hopefully this bounce
play will hold up in that comparison and
it won't blow up but anyway if you've
made it this far I have one more little
surprise this is a GeForce GTX USB drive
that Nvidia gave me at pax Australia and
they told me that I could do whatever I
want with it and I'm gonna be giving
away to one of you guys this will be a
flash giveaway I'll be announcing the
winners in one days time on Christmas
Eve so stay tuned for that giveaway link

stay tuned but anyway guys that's about
it for today if you enjoyed today's
video then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below
what was your favorite product in
today's video I would have to give this
slight edge and I say slight because I
did love that Corsair k70 rapid special
edition with the white and silver theme
that thing was awesome the keys are so
solid the silver switches are amazing
but the slight edge ghosts that
audio-technica had said that thing blew
me away the audio in and out quality of
that thing is just on another level
yes it's $200 yes it's expensive but you
generally get what you pay for them what
you're getting here is just one amazing
headset I look forward to using that in
streams and broadcasting with it for you
guys
and I can highly recommend it at least
after what I heard both coming in and
out of that thing but also with that
said if you guys are interested in any
of the products I've used in today's
video then I'll put the links in the
description below with the prices and
with that said I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
