a people and raise a headset I'm now pro
gamer welcome back to tech yes it is
Bronk I'm about you guys today with some
gameplay commentary over Call of Duty
advanced warfare now this video is going
to be a kind of a precursor to one of
the videos I've got upcoming and that's
about mechanical keyboards and which
one's the best for gaming and also which
one's the best for typing however the
point of this video is that I want to
stress that the keyboard itself
especially for gaming should be your
least concern or should be your least
priority when it comes to getting better
gear for gaming and this is from my only
personal experience I just find the
keyboard does not make much of a
difference if any at all when it comes
to actual games on the PC what makes the
most difference in my opinion is your
mouse and also your monitor these are
gaming peripherals here we're not
talking obviously your graphics card and
your CPU and stuff like that are gonna
make a big difference but when it comes
to actual gaming peripherals what should
I buy should I which Mouse should I get
which keyboard should I get which
monitor show get the monitor in the
mouth should be two of your top
priorities now with the mouse in my
opinion taking the first place there so
the reason why I want to talk about the
mouse first and in my opinion have being
the most important gaming peripherals
back when I was on the pro scene in
StarCraft brood was back way back in the
early 2000s where pro gaming just had
absolutely no money in it a little very
little and it kind of wasn't a good
career choice but at that time I
actually went to these Sydney finals in
Australia for a stock Radford Wars and
they had different mice there that I was
used to playing on so I was using a
different Mouse and obviously I I didn't
come first place or I didn't get in the
top three in that tournament which was
sad but I believe if I had brought my
own gaming peripherals there I probably
would have placed a lot higher than I
otherwise did not to mention the fact
that they had Samsung LCD monitors there
as well which was of you guys these were
like back early back you know back in
2000 these Samsung monitors they were
the first people there one of the first
companies to introduce gaming LCD
monitors and essentially the input lag
on those things was terrible like
compared to see our T's so they actually
should have had CRTs at the tournament
in my opinion so it was these things
that people just weren't aware of at the
time and now that I think back with me
having as much experience with tech as I
do now I kind of wish I did bring my
monitor in my actual mouse the keyboard
no it doesn't really make a difference
that would have meant wouldn't have made
a difference so much but the mouse and
the monitor would have made a huge
difference in my opinion so the mouse
you have to basically get it right you
know there's a lot of different mice out
there and it ultimately depends on what
kind of grip you use what kind of weight
you prefer and what kind of sensor you
prefer as well so these are things that
you have to decide for yourself but I'm
gonna say if you're looking for a gaming
keyboard the question you have to raise
for yourself is do I have a good Mouse
already and do I have a good monitor
especially if you're doing it for gaming
and you want to up your game so that's
just something I'd recommend to you guys
straight off the get-go but on now for
monitors let's talk about monitors
quickly so your mouse would be your top
priority but after that your monitor
definitely scores pretty high there
because I didn't realize this but I had
an ASA monitor here and it was my 1080p
60 Hertz monitor now I used this monitor
up until I got the 120 Hertz Samsung
monitor and on this monitor I got to
like I think 1,900 in heroes in you
earth so I got up pretty high in the you
know in the competitive scene there
wasn't I wasn't really on any teams is
just in the solo queue matchmaking but
essentially I got a hundred twenty Hertz
samsung monitor and I noticed my rating
had dropped a huge amount like I went
back into the high 1700s and I was
wondering to myself what is why is this
but now that I know all the recent
testing I did on the Samsung 120 Hertz
monitor I found that I had input lag
there was actually worse than the IPS
monitor that I'm using at the monitor at
the moment I didn't realize but the
Aysen monitor had like 15 good a good 15
milliseconds
over this IPS monitor I'm using at the
moment and this IPS monitor had even
less input light in the Samsung so the
Samsung was basically an input lag beast
so I didn't realize it but 120 Hertz
monitor that I was using actually
introduced a lot of
input lag so be careful with what
monitor you use it may experience the a
some monitors they're actually really
good bang for buck I mean sure the
colors might not be that good the this
and that might not be that good but if
you're a competitive gamer the input lag
on a a sub monitor is actually really
good so that's one thing I wanted to
share with you guys as well so anyway
those two things I mean if you're a
bunch of your gamer on a budget you
might want to check out some of the you
know decent mouse mice they got out
there and maybe get an Acer monitor as
well like I've got to actually test the
Zeus monitors as well I've heard they're
really good they got really low input
lag as well so I think in terms of
employee input lag for LCDs I think Acer
and a Zeus definitely score some high
points I've also heard Bank you look
pretty good as well so for my experience
though I think Samsung wow they got a
bit of input lag that they've got to fix
with their monitors so that's something
that I've noticed I mean this is 120
Hertz TN panel I mean so anyway those
two things I wanted to talk to you guys
about and I hope you enjoyed this
commentary over the gameplay here so
basically the moment I'm using a
Logitech G 302 for most make gaming and
I'm using an IPS 27-inch Korean panel
and the main reason I use the 27 inches
for gaming as well is that I'm making a
lot of YouTube videos nowadays for you
guys if I was pure gaming I'd probably
look into getting maybe there's Zeus
rogue 144 Hertz monitor or something
like that that's if I was actually
trying to go pro but unfortunately as I
get older I don't think it will the
amount of pro that's left in me slowly
diminishes so anyway if you guys are
young get what you can become what you
can before you get old anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this if you did please
give a thumbs up and I'll catch you with
another gameplay commentary or another
tech video very soon peace out for now
