nano which is from Blue Microphones
previously made the very infamous Yeti
which was the all in one solution with
the ADC and the DAC built-in and you've
got a condenser microphone that you just
plugged your computer via USB and you've
got really good recordings now that
model was a little bit heavier came in
at one point three eight kilos this is
under half the weight coming at six
hundred and thirty four grams it also
has a lower pricepoint as well coming in
at ninety nine USD versus one hundred
and twenty nine of the original Yeti and
then in Australia 158 Australian dollars
versus a hundred and eighty-seven so
coming in lower price it's also got
24-bit 48 kilohertz support so you've
got a wider floor there to play around
in post recordings and editing however
you do lose a couple of recording
patterns mainly being the stereo since
this is only got one microphone versus
the yetis - and also bi-directional they
still have omnidirectional and cardioid
cardioid being the standard style like
I'm just talking to the microphone now
very popular for streaming and standard
voice recordings but without aside let's
get on with testing out this microphone
which would be great for portability and
travel if it does check out to be of
similar sound quality to the yeti
original and I'm also going to be
comparing it to the MX l 770 and also
the bearing of b1 through my audio
interface let's get it on
so for this next test I'm gonna be
reading a passage from all for a king
shilling and I'm talking about 10
centimeters away from the microphone
itself here's what this sounds like from
about 30 centimeters back here's what it
sounds like right up so you can get an
idea of the proximity with this
microphone but let's get it on my luck
was in I could not believe my eyes all I
could see in the front seat were two
newspapers it looked as if they were
perhaps doing the crosswords or checking
the horses then as the taxi rounded the
corner I saw both Catrin and Karl was
standing on the pavement waiting for me
my luck was in I could not believe my
eyes all I could see in the front seat
were two newspapers it looked as if they
were perhaps doing the crosswords or
checking the horses then as the taxi
rounded the corner I saw both Catrin and
Karl was standing on the pavement
waiting for me testing proximity testing
proximity so we're testing from about 30
centimetres away from the microphone
testing about 15 centimeters away this
is where you ideally want to have your
condenser microphone then you can test
really closely if you want to my luck
was in I could not believe my eyes all I
could see in the front seat were two
newspapers it looked as if they were
perhaps doing the crosswords or checking
the horses then as the taxi rounded the
corner I saw a train and karl was
standing on the pavement waiting for me
sorry this is the M XL m XL m XL m XL
this is the MX l 6v 67 G my bad I should
have said that so my luck was in I could
not believe my eyes all I could see in
the front seat were two newspapers it
looked as if they were perhaps doing the
crosswords or checking the horses then
as the taxi rounded the corner I saw
both Catrin and Karl was standing on the
pavement waiting for me but really when
it comes down to a cheap little unit
awesome if you are traveling and you
need something that's compact sounds
pretty good and will get the job done of
course it doesn't have as much options
as the original Yeti and I thought the
original Yeti did sound just a little
bit richer of course the MX l7
and also debayering ab1 going through
the audio interface that's the edirol
with the compressor turned on sounds
really nice as well for voice work but
this thing will suffice it's a nice
little unit one that I can recommend
you've also got the option of listening
to audio through this device and
controlling the audio with the volume
knob of course this little unit here
what it's got going for it is its size
it's got the stand included and it also
has the ADC and the DAC built in over
one simple USB cable now you can also
listen to music via this the sounds
pretty decent and one thing though you
can't do is listen to music and record
your voice at the same time without
getting feedback of your own voice
through the headphones themselves so if
you do want to use these headphones to
listen to music but you want to mute
your microphone to yourself but not to
your audience then this can't
unfortunately do that so that is one
thing I'd like to see them implement
with the yeti Nano it's not really much
of a problem I mean listening to
yourself is actually good a lot of
people do it I'm actually doing it right
now just to check for feedback and the
noise is really low sound is really
crystal clear and I guess that's what
you want out of a microphone especially
if you're doing voice recordings and you
guys hope you enjoyed today's comparison
if you did the me sure to hit that like
button if you have any questions or
comments about the yeti nano then be
sure to drop a question in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
huh yeah yeah one two yeah it looked as
if they were perhaps doing the
crosswords or checking the horses then
as the taxi rounded the corner I saw
both Catrin and car were standing on the
pavement waiting for me by this time I
was tight into the corner of the taxi
and bent down so that I couldn't see
them and they couldn't see me recording
so this is the normal mode on it but on
the back II got a little switch and you
can change it to omnidirectional so
that's now an omnidirectional so it'll
be sound coming from all angles of this
