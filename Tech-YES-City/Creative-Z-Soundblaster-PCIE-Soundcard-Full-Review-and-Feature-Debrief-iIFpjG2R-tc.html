I'm going to be reviewing the Sound
Blaster Z from creative now there's two
models of this there's a creative Z well
there's also the ZX which just includes
some controller module and then there's
the zxr so the zxr has a different DAC
onboard
however this the creative Z which is the
$80.00 model includes a really good DAC
onboard I think it's a cirrus logic so
it's got a really good DAC on it anyway
let's look at what you get in the
package first basically this comes
packaged pretty damn well you know when
you first unbox it you know it's
packaged to a piece of plastic that sort
of strapped in and I don't see it really
getting damaged in shipping there was a
little bit of shake though in the
package so be mindful of that maybe if
the postman is overzealous and it maybe
it could get damaged in shipping but I
see it as highly unlikely
now I'm boxing this thing first of all
you comes with a CD drive for driver
installation you also pick up the unit
straightaway and you notice that it is
pretty damn impressive it also comes
with a beam foaming microphone which
honestly I haven't used because today
I'm not really going to be recommending
this product there's actually in my
opinion some design flaws and we're
going to talk about that soon but let's
talk about what you get I mean the
actual product itself it feels really
good it's a well-built product it comes
with a nice create Sound Blaster Z
shield it looks good it lights up red
there's a fancy red LED that lights up
and you know overall it's got a black
PCB so it looks pretty good on the back
as well it's pretty snuggly it's a nice
slim fit and the rear has all gold
plated connectors on it so the build
quality of this sound card is really
good
I'd say the LED would get a little bit
annoying which would leave me to give it
about a 9 out of 10 for build quality I
mean it does feel really solid it feels
like a good product however that's where
the good points kind of end for this
because when I'm going to get onto the
negatives first because if you're buying
this product it's important that you
know what is wrong with it essentially
basically it comes with a nice headphone
amp that's really powerful basically
when I was surprised I could only turn
this thing down I could only have this
at 20 when I was listening to my
headphones
it was that damn loud any
would be like deafening listening levels
for me so you know the headphone amp is
really powerful but it has a major flaw
and that is that when I when I was
listening through this headphone amp the
soundstage was severely not nullified
like it was just a is this like the
soundstage was missing
you know I tested this on games I did
some music and just that the soundstage
really just got bricked you know this
was on my Fidelio ex ones which have
really good soundstage even the onboard
audio sounded a hell of a lot better for
soundstage then the creative Z did now
if you're buying a flagship product this
shouldn't be happening I mean I did
correct it when I turn the volume up to
a hundred and I used my I'll show you
here I used the inline volume control on
the v-moda Pro boom Pro to control the
volume but not everyone will have a
volume control so a lot of people have
to use the windows volume control when
you do that it's really you know no I
don't know what's going on with the
sound card but you know doesn't do it on
the real take if I turn the realtek down
to 20 and put it on through an amp the
sound stage is still okay so it's not
Windows as Foulke I believe it's the
creative Z's fault so that's the first
negative of this sound card if you're
going to buy it
the second negative is that the
microphone in the amp like man it's a
flagship product you shouldn't be
putting a crap amp on the ADC it's just
like you know when I put it on I you
know did a mic test it sounded worse
than the onboard audio I mean what the
hell this is a flagship product put a
good freakin amp on the mic and I'm not
even going to do a test for you guys
because it was terrible just like
hissing and those noise coming through
you know the onboard audio sounded
better no an MSI onboard audio solution
had a better amp on the mic in that a
flagship creative Z product pretty
pathetic I mean a $30 DG acts from a
Zeus has a really good amp on the mic in
so I was just a little bit disappointed
with that I mean it doesn't now another
point is that doesn't share I mean it
they make the mic in and the line inch
the same port I mean I don't like that
but it was you know I knew that before I
bought the product if that was the only
flaw with this product I could live with
it the fact that that you know the
headphone out is is not that good like
it's got it's got a floor the mic in you
know the amp on it sounds crap you know
and then there's also another problem
with it so and that is that you know
there's also people who are getting
audio control modules and saying that
that reduces the sound quality as well
so if you're getting the ZX model just
be careful of that so I don't know if
this problem plagues the zxr I mean I
hope it doesn't but the creative Z just
has those two in my opinion flaws
fundamental flaws that just make them
don't make them that good I'm gonna say
a good thing about this though when i
hook this up to the objective - it
sounded phenomenal this sound card
really came to life the stereo direct
out it's got an option in the menu to
put stereo direct out and when I did
that through the objective to this sound
card sounded phenomenal it really did
sound crystal-clear it sounded better
than the onboard audio sounded better
than my M audio fast track it was really
good so if you want a couple this with
an amplifier even a Pheo X six then I
could recommend doing that but you
shouldn't have to do that on a flagship
product so I'm going to be saying that
again okay so let's move on now to a
point that I didn't like so when i hook
this up to the o2 amplifier even when i
hook this up to the amplify and using
the software suite the SPX surround
which was a reason why i bought this it
just didn't sound that good like i was
playing my games and it really didn't
sound that good you know when i watched
youtube videos of the cmss 3d which just
creative zone technology that sounded
better than the SPX surround I mean why
did they get rid of cmss 3d I thought it
sounded really good when I was watching
the YouTube videos and people showing
demos of it and then I hear SPI studio
and even watching the demos of the SBS
studio just to check if it was just my
unit or maybe settings it sounded bad I
didn't like it so I don't know why
creatives done that with the software
but anyway let's just get get onto the
good points about this card a it's built
well be the software suite is really
good it's lightweight will go
through it now with you guys I mean the
software is really good I like it we'll
go through here so here's the first
screen you got SPX pro shooter now in
here you've got a lot of options I mean
this program is lightweight it won't
affect your FPS at all so that's
something I like about crap that have
made a really good software package this
time around now the first option you go
into the menu have sbx Pro studio you
can select from surround crystallizer
and bass you can turn these settings on
personally I just left them all off
because they weren't that good I mean
the crystallizer was good I thought it
was like a fun setting the crystallizer
was a fun setting I did if it was one
setting out of the three that I really
liked and enjoyed it was the
crystallizer did sort of give it a nice
live sort of echoey echoey effect that
didn't distort the sound really the bass
did it distorted the bass a lot I didn't
really like that setting I was like an
echo a bass that sounded crap and then
you got smart volume as well which is a
good feature if you're listening to a
lot of music or a lot of things that
have you know very huge variances in the
volume so they've got some good good
things in there and the crystal voice
this is something I really like about
the software side I mean the mic the amp
sucked but the software was really good
you've got a voice enhancer where you
can change your voice into a munchkin
all this other kind of stuff so it's got
some cool features there so if you play
video games and you hear people sounding
like girls
high-pitched girls it's because they're
probably using this software and
changing their voice into a high pitch
girl now the monitoring type here you
can switch from the microphone you can
change it to the line in as well here as
well you can change it to the line in
and a microphone if you wish to you've
got the mic volume there which you can
set in the mic boost so just just
standard settings there you've also got
your standard settings which come in the
windows as well noise reduction that
stuff the scalp mode that's another
setting that I have mixed opinions about
I think in some games it did work well
like when I play Call of Duty ghosts it
kind of did emphasize the footsteps
which I thought was pretty cool
but in sort of games like here is a
newer that just sounded terrible so I
mean I think it's a hit or miss for the
game you're playing so scout mode can
work it just depends on the game
this is the speaker and headphone
section now this is pretty cool I mean
you got some good settings here you want
to select full range speakers that it'll
give you I mean it doesn't really make a
difference I couldn't really hear a
difference but I mean hey you want the
most
you know frequencies come in these
speakers as possible but you know you've
got options here a stereo direct you've
got here headphones and you've got
stereo just standard stereo so if you
use stereo direct you cannot use the SPX
settings on the output however you
change it to stereo you can use the
settings you know the core 3d processing
and you can get the fancy effects like
crystallizer you know DTS surround and
stuff like that
let's move on now to the cinematic so
this is a cool part as well I mean the
software is really good on this I'm not
going to like the software features on
this card are really good they are
indicative of a flagship product and
you've got here the option to encode to
Dolby Digital got here to code DDS
surround and you can do it in cinema
mode or music mode and both those both
the cinema mode music mode actually
sounded pretty good for gaming they
didn't really make a difference I just
preferred the normal stereo direct so
but you know they do offer a different
sort of feeling for movies it did sound
pretty good I watched a movie and it
sounded really good so the cinema mode
actually does work pretty well I like it
the mixer we move on to the mixer you
just get your standard settings on your
speakers here and you've got your what
you hear I'm sorry this is the bit where
you can change from rear into the rear
line in now if you like well I want to
plug to it at the same time which is
what I do you can just go up a front
panel audio and use that for your
microphone in and then use the rear as
your lining you can switch between them
so it's not really that big of a problem
the equalizer this is actually another
cool feature of this software software
package and you know you can select
they've got different EQ s here I made
my own EQ for gaming and that was just a
slight bump in the mids you know and
that was that that really worked well I
mean I think EQ is just for that little
enhancement I don't really like echoing
too much I think it starts if you go way
overboard with EQ it distorts the sound
way too much but this EQ software works
really well you can save your own
profiles in there and I really like it
let's look at the advanced features of
this card you know it's just
got here place dairy mix the digital out
so that was really all that was there
nothing to talk about much there you've
got the profiles as well so another good
thing about this sound card is you can
select from different profiles and you
can save one profile for audio file
maybe stereo direct out another profile
you know and the good thing is you can
say that stereo direct profile and have
it at 24-bit forty four point one
kilohertz which is most most likely all
your flax going to be ripped in and then
you can set the gaming profile on just
stereo and have it at 24-bit 16 48
kilohertz okay so in conclusion this
sound card I mean it has a lot of things
that could have made it a flagship
product I mean if it wasn't for those
two crucial flaws this thing would have
been a really good product I mean three
if you count the SPX studio not sounding
as good as cmss 3d so I mean those three
floors in my opinion just make this a
non not recommended by me
I mean creative I think they need to fix
the soundstage on the headphone out I
think they need to put a better mic amp
on the mic in and I think they I mean if
though they should also put a line in as
a separate port I mean I've got these
other freaking ports that I never use
you know if we're going to use surround
sound I'm going to use a freakin coax or
you know it's a digital out so I mean
come on creative get on your game this
is if you're labeling this is a flagship
product you should have it you know it
shouldn't have these flaws it should
have a good and on the mic and it should
have a really good headphone out that
works properly however I will say whiff
you want to get this as an audiophile
grade card to coupled with a headphone
app then it is a recommended by even if
you want to get something like an e6
from Pheo that'll make a big difference
so overall I'm going to recommend this
card if you know its weaknesses I mean I
just think that you know they could have
done these things and this card would
have been a 10 out of 10 it would have
been just so amazing because the DAC on
this does sound better than the realtek
LC 1150 I'll be doing a review comparing
a few different Dax for you guys giving
you my thoughts but yeah this
sound a little bit better the sub-base
is a lot better it's got a nice little
bit of warmth in there that makes it
sound really cool you know yes that's
the sound signature of the DAC I guess
if you want to know how compares to the
realtek 1150 but all yeah I just you
know I'm not going to test the
microphone the beamforming microphone
I'm just going to be selling this
because you know just keep that
microphone you and I'll just sell this
because I just wasn't impressed with the
product I mean I think if you're buying
an $80.00 sound card it shouldn't have
those floors as I hope you enjoyed this
review and if you have any comments
about the Sound Blaster Z please leave a
comment in the comment section below and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
