ultra-wide monitor from BenQ.
This is the EX3501R.
It offers a 100 hertz refresh rate.
It's also got 1440p ultra-wide
resolution, 21 by 9.
And it has an AU Optronics 8-bit VA panel.
When it comes down to it,
there's usually two groups
looking for monitors.
There's those who need good viewing angles
and color accuracy, whether
you're video or photo editing,
and those who are gamers where
you need high refresh rates,
good response times,
and also low input lag.
This monitor definitely
comes into that category
of a gaming monitor.
And so what we're looking at straightaway
is the response times.
And what I measured
here was a thousand FPS
on the different OverDrive settings,
where there's three different settings.
There's off, high, and premium.
And they call it AMA
in this particular OSD.
And what I noticed between
high and premium was
there was virtually no difference.
When it came to CS:GO and
measuring the response times,
it was about seven to eight
milliseconds consistently,
which is around that level of okay,
it's not the best I've seen.
I have seen five to six milliseconds
on different panels that
have come through here.
But it's certainly far from the worst,
where if we look at the
Viotech, for example,
that was rocking around
14, 15 milliseconds plus.
So this definitely has
a decent response time
with that VA panel,
at these response times
it will do a good job
of transitioning from
one frame to the next,
without showing more than two
frames on one image at a time.
(upbeat electronic music)
As for input lag, when it came to CS:GO,
the total input time from a mouse click
to the image changing on a screen,
was 21 milliseconds on average,
which is phenomenally good.
So the actual input lag
inherent to the monitor itself,
is very low, definitely under
that of 10 milliseconds.
Which classifies it as
a really good monitor
for low input lag.
Moving on with the BenQ monitor,
it supports FreeSync with a range
from 48 hertz to 100 hertz.
Which is very generous if
you've got an AMD graphics card.
The viewing angles on this handle both
horizontally and
vertically are exceptional.
The uniformity was decent,
not the best I've seen,
but far from the worst,
with a 12 percent difference from
the bottom right square
compared to the center,
which had a CCD level of 339.
The model has a rating of 300 CCD,
and so it definitely comes above that.
And out of the factory I do believe
it's just a little bit too bright,
if you're like me and
you want that sweet spot
of around 160 CCD to 180,
then the setting of 38
brightness will be best for you.
At these settings it uses up 36 watts,
at max settings out of the
box it uses up 60 watts.
Also, the monitor is
advertised as flicker free,
all through the brightness
range we noticed
no flickering in the studio here.
And also when it came to cross-hatching,
we pulled up an orange
background and there was
no visible cross-hatching whatsoever.
The panel itself has a semi-gloss coating,
which I do think looks really nice,
especially to help bring out
the colors a little bit better.
But it's still blocking
out lights quite well,
it is my favorite type
of coating if you have
moderate levels of sunlight coming in,
but you still use the
computer at nighttime.
Moving through with backlight bleed,
it was very well controlled
all through the monitor.
I noticed no visible backlight bleed when
it came to normal operation,
and even when pulling
up a black background,
it was very hard to
notice at 100 brightness.
Now, what about color
accuracy with this monitor,
say you wanna use it for gaming,
but also your main video editing monitor.
Well there is some really good news,
and that's when I put my
calibrator on this thing,
it was pretty damn close
to being color accurate
out of the box.
The low keys were a little bit off,
as well as the deep magenta levels,
but besides that,
everything was pretty
accurate and pretty close.
So indeed, you could use
this monitor for pretty
accurate video editing when
it comes to color grading.
Now, moving on to the
buttons on the OSD itself,
it's got seven buttons located
underneath the monitor.
If I had to critique
something about this monitor,
it would be these buttons,
I would like to see a D-pad,
which I believe in function
is a lot easier to use.
However, you do get
three custom key buttons,
which out of the box are set to Contrast,
Brightness, and Picture Modes.
In the OSD itself, it's
very easy to navigate,
you can change things like
Picture and Picture Modes,
as well as some HDR settings.
As well as backlight intelligence levels,
and there's also the option to change
the blue light levels if
you wish to lower them
for nighttime usage.
You can even set that to a custom key,
and change that around so you can quickly
change that on the fly if you wish to.
There's also the option to change between
DisplayPort 1.1 and 1.4.
As for display inputs and outputs,
you get two HDMI in, as well
as a Display and USB Type-C in.
All supporting 1440p
ultra-wide 21 by 9, 100 hertz.
However I will say that
the included HDMI cable
with this monitor was giving
some very odd flickering,
that was slightly noticeable at the
100 hertz, 1440p setting.
So if you are getting this monitor,
definitely use the included DisplayPort
or USB Type-C cables.
Now, moving onto the
the build quality itself
with this monitor,
this is where I think BenQ
have done a really good job.
It looks clean, it's
got a very thin bezel,
coming in at only a few millimeters.
It's also got a mirror
finish on the stand itself,
and at the back there's a
hole for routing cables,
for cable management.
So it will go well in
any modern 2018 home.
It's also height and tilt adjustable,
however it doesn't have swivel on both the
horizontal and vertical planes.
Though overall, very solid build quality,
there's no croaks or anything like that
coming out of this monitor.
The only monitor I've come into now with
a bad build quality, would
have been the Viotech.
All the other monitors
that I've come through here
have solid build quality,
the BenQ being no exception.
Last of all now, we're
gonna talk about the HDR
implementation of this monitor itself.
When I pulled up the HDR demo on youtube
it did look very good,
so they have implemented, at
least at a hardware level,
something that works quite well.
When it came to games and windows itself,
it was still washed out,
I do prefer to leave this
off when it comes to gaming,
and just get a real nice picture profile
out of the monitor itself.
My favorite picture profile for gaming,
was ironically the
MacBook, or MBook setting,
which I think stands for MacBook maybe.
But that did give better
contrast, better colors,
the standard was definitely
my second best pick.
And especially since it does give out very
photo accurate colors, those
are the two that I would pick,
if you were to get this monitor.
So now, our conclusion
time with this monitor,
and it currently comes in
at 770 US dollars on Amazon,
or, if you're in Australia, 1,100 AUD.
Does come with a three year warranty,
has a very good build quality,
and does have everything
that a gamer would want.
That being low input
lag, good response times,
and also great colors
and good viewing angles.
When it comes to photo accuracy as well,
this is another benefit of this monitor.
Comes in with very photo
accurate colors out of the box,
so if you wanted to only have one monitor
on your desk to do it all,
this definitely ranks up
there amongst the best.
In terms of critiques
itself with this monitor,
there's not a whole lot
they can improve on.
The OSD, I'd like to see them change that
to a D-pad function, but again,
once you're set up and running,
you're probably never gonna
touch these buttons again.
And also, when it came
to the response times,
I have tested other monitors
based on similar VA panels,
and they have come in with
five to six milliseconds.
So, I would like to see
them perhaps update the
premium setting on OverDrive,
and try and drop down the response times
just that little bit, that would really go
a long way in my opinion,
especially if you're
a hardcore FPS gamer.
But ultimately, the EX3501R from BenQ,
is a very good implementation
of an ultra-wide monitor.
I can definitely recommend it if you're in
the market to one.
Also, a big thanks to BenQ for
sending this in for review.
If you guys enjoyed today's video,
then be sure to hit that like button.
Let me know in the comment section below,
what monitor are you currently rocking?
And also, have you ever tried an
ultra-wide monitor before?
Some games don't natively
support 21 by 9 fully,
but a lot more games as we go on,
are supporting this resolution,
and it does look gorgeous
when you sit down
and play in front of it.
It is a sweet spot for a single monitor,
for sitting down and enjoying your games.
Anyway, all that aside,
I will catch you in another
Tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye!
