something that I've never done before
and that was not only going overseas and
buying good deals and getting used PC
parts in that particular area but I
decided eight for some odd reason I had
to prove to myself that I could not only
get PC parts on the road but I could
also build a whole PC and then flip it
and make a profit while I'm doing an
event and honestly this is probably
gonna be the first and last time I
attempt to do something like this
because this time around we went over to
California I think like I'm looking at
you guys over in California I think it's
like that way over there so I'm looking
at you now and then I'm pushing the
camera back and looking at you again and
so I started off in California and first
up I got a rent-a-car and I was looking
for deals and the good thing about
California is there was just deals
galore I didn't even have to look that
hard I think I limited myself to face
book marketplace only because there was
just deals popping up all the time on
that application this is the face book
marketplace I was also told and shown by
a good friend Vic who lives in
California as well that using offer up
is a really good option too so if you
guys are in America I think face book
marketplace offer up and also Craigslist
are your three best choices for getting
deals now back to the story in
California basically we got the deals
first off we made that hundred and
thirty five dollar PC and that consisted
of me getting an Acer inspire with a two
terabyte hard drive and pulling all the
internals out for a different build but
then still using that case left over as
well as the power supply and the reason
I did this was because we couldn't fit
the original components in the
coolermaster half case that we picked up
for $20 and so I'll put some of the
videos up here the original links for
the way we started off with the first
deals hunt and then we built the PC and
we started off with the second deals
hunt build the second PC but basically
in a nutshell when it came to building
these pcs and then going to flip them
again I came into some good and bad luck
and so that's what we're gonna talk
about here today we gonna talk about the
differences at least with the small
sample size that I have of Australia
versus the
u.s.
so starting off this journey I was in
California for four days and in that
time I just couldn't help myself I guess
I love doing the use price-performance
hustles so I said about getting the
parts for two different builds one of
which I actually completed in California
and then we had to take off to Las Vegas
in the Renault car and here's where the
first problem came in and this is
probably why I'm going to shy away from
building pcs while I'm doing events and
traveling because I had a massive
suitcase which had all my gear for
filming and also my clothes needed for
the trip and besides that we didn't just
have one that we had two and three cases
that I had to cram into a sports car
because we rented out this Camaro
which we got on a really good deal and
it was just an absolute nightmare doing
this and then to complicate things it
was just such a hassle moving around
with a suitcase and then having to lug
three different PC cases around you know
the concierge and everyone at the hotel
for example they were just looking at me
with the weirdest looks and I'm just
thinking well guys you know passion
always comes first but also on the way
out of LA that's when we'll pull on a
Snake Plissken there was the guy who
sold me the Acer is inspire and he told
me I've got four of these machines that
have no hard drives would you be
interested and I basically asked him I
said what do you what do you K'naan for
one of these each and he came back and
said $50 and I said well I'm not gonna
pass that up so I then went and got all
the motherboards the RAM the CPU and the
cooler just the motherboard combos out
of those cases I said to him you can
keep the cases and power supplies I'm
not gonna have room to fit them and so
then I took off to Las Vegas where as
soon as I got there I listed the 135
dollar PC that we put together in LA and
here's the ironic thing here's where
things start to get a little bit weird
because after that I put together the
iBUYPOWER red LED PC and I put that up
cuz I built that two days after I put up
the $135 bank job and I was starting to
sweat because there wasn't much interest
in that one hundred thirty-five dollar
bank job PC it actually was actually
took me about a week to sell and I just
sold it before I was leaving
Vegas I was lucky and I only made $15
profit on that PC I ended up selling it
for $150 but the iBUYPOWER specie when I
put that together two days later I put
that off a sale and it instantly sold
pretty much within an hour I had a heap
of people messaging me and I had one guy
just come over and pay asking price he
just came over paid $600 for the build
and it was out of my hands and now this
is where things get tricky when you're
on the road you have to sell in a
certain amount of time because I can't
be taking these pieces on planes and I
can't really really offloading him to
people like Christopher you can't be
like hey dude just sell my PC and give
me the profits and so I suddenly had
this stress of having a time constraint
placed upon me where I had to sell these
pcs otherwise I was pretty much faced
with the consequence of either
forfeiting him or letting him go with a
loss and so thankfully when I sold that
red LED PC straight away that gave me
some confidence but I also learned that
I think in America aesthetics matter
even more than they do on Australian
like I joke on the channel about LEDs
but there's a lot of truth behind that
LEDs sell pcs and that's the whole
bottom line if you're in the flippin pcs
you definitely want to take a look at
aesthetics and make sure it checks out
with a certain price point in the case
of the L a bang job that thing just it
took ages to sell and it was the worst
performing item even though it was
packin some pretty good value I thought
in Australia this thing would have sold
like for that price I was asking 200 us
it would have flew off the shelves
like I could have got 300 Aussie for
that PC like that but in America it just
took ages to sell in Vegas and I don't
know if the Vegas population I think
it's the same as the Gold Coast where I
live I don't know if that's a factor but
one thing I did realize that in America
ascetics are king but of course how much
did I make on each of the parts or
builds or flips that I did well we start
off with the LA Bank job so in total
that was $15 now I wanted to get an
extra $50 for it but again as time went
on no one was really interested in this
build it just wasn't happening and then
we move on to the next build the Snake
Plissken escape from LA build we made
$30 on this build and again I would have
liked
to have made more money on this build I
would have ideally like to make an extra
hundred dollars so $130 but because the
LA bang job was doing so poorly
I literally just wanted to clear this
stock out and sort of stick to that
whole oK we've proved the concept here
and that was that you can get really
good deals in California and also really
good deals in Las Vegas or pretty much
anywhere in the world if you live in a
city with a pretty large population but
honestly the easiest and best moneymaker
that I came across in terms of flipping
was the ddr4 I 5 6400 motherboard and
Wireless combos that I pulled out of the
Acer inspires I was getting these for
$50 a pop and I was reef lipping them
for $100 so he sold two of these combos
for $100 then I used one in the build
and then I also had that motherboard and
combo left over - the RAM and I sold
that for $70 so even though we only made
$30 on the Snake Plissken build we
pretty much covered that $50 for the
memory in that build so that extra flip
that this makes any sense
was pretty much a pure $70 in my pocket
and then of course we used that last
combo in the build versus Christopher yi
which also still got a flip that build
or Chris has to flip that build and also
flip his build for me which I'm looking
forward to taking those profits thanks
Chris
but the did ER for combo has ended up
being the easiest and best moneymaker
for me on this trip so that's a
difference big time between the US and
Australia in Australia you usually get
more money by flipping a gaming PC
because you're spending a bit more time
and you're doing something that a lot of
people I guess in the general population
don't want to do and that's have to put
together a PC install windows and
possibly troubleshoot any problems in
between but I found in the US like out
of the small sample size again that I
had was that the parts were selling a
lot better if you got them for really
good deals and then reef lip them and
just made a quick buck the gaming PC's I
noticed it was saturated as spare
in Las Vegas how do I put these pieces
up for sale in California I believe I
would have got the profits that are
intended to get a lot quicker because
Vegas has a population of around I think
700,000 but during CES there was just
like a hundred and eighty thousand
people on top of that crammed into the
strip and that was just insane the whole
event also put on a lot of extra stress
in terms of me being sick and then
having to go to cover booze especially
places like Corsair where they sponsored
the event out so I had to go to them and
give them coverage as part of the
contract but also coupled with the fact
that I'm now lugging around these pcs
going from the REO which I initially
stayed there for one night then changed
over to Treasure Island then went to I
think it was the link hotel so between
changing all these hotels I'm carrying
around pcs and the good thing was over
time they were diminishing so we sold
that ibuypower PC straightaway and then
essentially I just had a half case and
the LA bang job and then the LA bang job
went some of those combos went and then
I was just left with the half case and
then after CES I had an extra day where
Christopher Yee challenged me and I said
look man you know I've got this case on
me I've still got one more combo I'm
gonna use this in the competition
because I don't want to be wasting money
and then carrying things or losing
things when I don't need to so it's
great that Christopher and I met up and
then we agreed to the conditions where
he had the home-field advantage I got to
use those two parts from LA and they
added on bonus on top of that was that I
would then be able to leave Vegas
without having to worry about flipping
the PC because Christopher was going to
do that for me and whether I made any
money off it was up to you guys in the
comments section on who win or loses the
competition and so in total in my little
endeavor in the u.s. I made an extra two
hundred and fifteen dollars side hustle
by just doing all this stuff and having
a bit of fun in it it honestly is a lot
of fun for me I really enjoyed doing
this but at the same time I did notice
some big differences and that is the
power of the aesthetics in the u.s.
seriously guys if you are flipping
Pacey's in the
yes make sure you have a really good
case semaj EB bling or even just some
LED bling in there it really goes a long
way in terms of just hooking people in
and saying yep this builds quality the
LA bang job yeah that thing was just it
it was sad and he has good experiment
but also another thing that I noticed
big-time in the US was there's no
suppliers of at least in California or
Vegas was there was no suppliers of
cheap cases with LEDs in them the
cheapest case I could find with good
bling was I think the cooler master
master light and that had three RGB fans
at the front but they wanted like sixty
or sixty-five dollars for that even at
micro Center so if you guys know what
the sort of RGB or bling special cases
on a budget in the US I'd love to hear
your thoughts and opinions in the
comment section below
maybe there's one on Amazon that can get
shipped for cheap but I didn't check
that out as I didn't have time changing
between hotels and having the risk of
losing something out on shipping's so
all that aside most importantly I hope
you guys enjoyed the vlogs and the
videos that I put out while I was on the
road in the u.s. it was certainly a lot
of fun besides me getting sick but even
then powered through that and still got
the competition done first Christopher
that was honestly a lot more fun than I
thought it was and I'll probably be
making a follow-up video where me and
Chris do a collaboration and talk about
that because man that was actually the
first time I've actually done something
like that on the road versus someone who
knows how to hustle as well so that was
a lot of fun I really enjoyed that one I
hope you guys have enjoyed that one if
you haven't seen that video already I'll
put the link up here but besides that
there's the differences between the US
and Australia I'm in Australia
I guess people want I guess they're
looking for a graphics card and the cpu
foremost and then ascetics comes sort of
close second best but in America I guess
the aesthetics is probably number one
and that was sort of like the difference
that I found out as well as actually
just reselling parts themselves is
probably
more profitable than reselling the
actual gaming pcs who knows anyway guys
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
then be sure to smash that like button
and also if you enjoyed the storytelling
all the tech videos and you want to see
them as soon as they're released be sure
to hit that sub button with the
notification felt turned on and if you
want the inside scoop before it gets
inside of YouTube's weird 360p loop then
be sure to check us out on check yes
City on Instagram and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now babe
