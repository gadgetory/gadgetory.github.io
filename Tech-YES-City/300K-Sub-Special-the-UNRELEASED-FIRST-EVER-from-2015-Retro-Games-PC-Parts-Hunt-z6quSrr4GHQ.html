this is going to be a little vlog for
you guys sort of you get to see a bit of
Japan and you get to see some of these
junk stores or secondhand stores where I
also picked up that recent $40 rig that
I built so let's get on with it
welcome back guys today I'm going to be
on the road and we're going to go to a
place called wonder exits this
secondhand store in Japan where people
essentially just trade in their used
games or they trade in all their use
stuff and now the place how it works is
they generally give you like 1% of what
the stuff is worth so like fear friends
and someone trades in a Super Nintendo
game these guys will give you like
literally ten cents for your game if
that but of course the thing is the
catch there is a lot of people just want
to get rid of their stuff and so the
basis behind it is that instead in Japan
you have to pay to dump your rubbish and
so a lot of people just dump it at these
secondhand stores and you know they get
a couple of bucks back so it's kind of
like an avenue for them just to dump
their stuff but nonetheless it can be a
little gold mine and so today we're
going to go there and hunt for some
bargains and see if there's any old
school nintendo or Super Nintendo games
now recently when we came to Japan my
brother he got this retro fever and he
got it because one of my friends were my
best friend and one of the best friends
in real life Tokyo gumbo put his channel
in the description below and he armed he
collects a lot of retro games and stuff
but then my brother saw his channel and
he got into this retro stuff and it's
really good like it's a lot of fun and I
thought I was immune to it until I
played Mega Man 3 and I realized wow
this game is the you know the
soundtracks amazing the game's amazing
and this is for an 8-bit Nintendo game
so we're gonna go around and look for
some stuff all right so we're just at
this place now it's called wonder X and
it's in the middle of a country town so
yeah you can see but this place is great
because it's got a lot of secondhand
stuff as I've seen before in the car and
I'm just going to go head in now and
we're going to check out some retro
games and some retro consoles and also
check out some junk pcs and see if
there's any bargains to be had though
keep in mind though that we have already
cleaned this place out so and we've
cleaned out the one in my hometown as
well so this place is about 25
it's from my home but anyway let's go
inside and take a look alright so here's
the junk section and you see they just
got like down there they've got make all
the games that they just don't care
about or they haven't tested or they
didn't work properly so you can scavenge
through that and see if there's any
bargains men up here you've got all the
games that actually a guaranteed to work
and you see that they're pretty cheap
some of them are like a doll awesome the
three dollars depends on the total then
go up to around about ten dollars or
even like forty dollars though there's
ones are usually in the case so it's
pretty interesting though they got a lot
of good stuff here i'm personally I'm in
the market for Mega Man series in Japan
they call it rock man and I'm also in
the market for DS elders as well so they
kind of like the two series that I'm
really want to collect I managed to pick
up all the super nintendo rock bands of
the Mega Man X series there's actually
four games on the Super Nintendo but I
still have to pick up extra men I mean
Mega Man 1 and 6 on the Nintendo and
also zelda 1 and 2 on the Nintendo so
I'm in the hunt for them though I don't
think I'll find them today but i just
want to show you guys like they just got
so much stuff here and you see here
there's like a nintendo i think for like
that's five bucks so that's a super
nintendo there they call it Super
Famicom I'm actually in the market for
the original one of these the original
family car mats the Nintendo
Entertainment System I was actually
going to pick up one of them for my
personal collection as I've got some
kind of off market junk brand at the
moment that doesn't work properly anyway
we'll keep looking through but you know
i'll show you guys what else is here
they got controllers and stuff for all
the other retro stuff and yeah so they
got a lot of stuff here i mean if you
guys are looking for anything then you
can definitely pick it up here i see
there they got the controls and stuff
behind this is in the case so usually
the stuff in the case is pretty
expensive so
you can rest assured that I gets to stop
people from stealing it or whatnot but
anyway let's move on to the actual
computer section where there's all the
junk computer parts moving on now to the
junk pc section these essentially the
pcs that aren't guaranteed to work or
something's wrong but this is the
section where you can pick up a bargain
it's a section where I actually picked
up one of the ten dollar rigs though the
other rigs I did pick up a different
stores so there's many of these stores
scattered throughout Japan but this is
the one where I picked up that fried
upon opening it but I did manage to pull
out some little parts on it but this is
like just scanning through here i'm
really going to take a look inside this
as we see here five dollars and it's got
nothing on it like it just got ji tun
which is a custom japanese pc maker and
they actually make decent in future so
i'm going to open this up see what's
inside i'm hoping there's some good
bargains inside this everything else
kind of looks mediocre I can't really
dime just quickly scanning but I'm going
to take a look at some of the custom
pieces because usually the dells they're
the ones that they just check the prices
on the internet and they're like okay
this is what it's going for on yahoo or
the auctions like ebay kind of thing and
then I'll price them up according to
that but these are where the bargains
are to be had these custom pcs where I'm
guessing they don't know anything about
so I'm gonna open this up and check it
out about open this up and there's
absolutely nothing inside it so this is
a fail I fooled this one open and
there's really just nothing in there
this just looks like an ancient like
2000 for something really old pc that
they're asking like fifty dollars for
this one so really looks like it's a bit
of a drought today or a bit of a bust
it's really just nothing here today that
would be worthy of even purchasing to
pull apart they keep in mind though this
is the store that i had the least
success with so i will maybe try another
store in the near future but i've
already built the forty dollar pc which
i'm really happy about but we'll take a
look at what else is here i mean there
are some other bargains i'm sure to be
had in other areas of this store so i
really take you guys through and take a
look and see if I find anything they got
some really old school motherboards but
even then they're like asking twenty
dollars for something this old like damn
man I think it really is a bust here
today it's a PlayStation section and
like they've got a lot of PlayStation
games here they got PlayStation 2 games
they've also got some premium titles
over here but like as I said before
we've already cleaned this place out so
when we get back to my place I might
actually show you all the games that
we've got so far because they're pretty
much got nothing good left on these
shelves here's a pretty nice pick up
here it's a street fighter zero and
that's a dollar like it says junk that I
mean you just pretty much all you have
to do is open it up and testing I just
have a look at the disk and see if it's
any good and actually that looks pretty
bad but uh I gotta know if it will see
it on cam but there's some pretty heavy
scratching on that but uh we already
picked up a copy of this for a dollar so
we actually picked up the good copy here
so the crap copies left on the shelves
but yeah so that's kind of like what you
can get if you look around you get some
pretty cool games for a dollar if you're
in just sort of that retro stuff but
let's say yes if you guys want we can
take a look around and see what we've
got in the card as well this is what my
brothers found he's found a super
WrestleMania which is a pretty cool game
found street fighter 2 and this is
actually called a second densetsu too
but in our english this was secret of
mana which a lot of you guys might know
Super Nintendo I share a really good
game one of my favorite on the Super
Nintendo so we found these three games
we might add them to the collection so
that's only like three blocks but it was
let's take a look what else is in this
store sure you can alright so you got
like furniture here and stuff and like
all kinds of different stuff here but I
mean I'm really you probably tell by my
voice I'm really not interested in
looking at furniture especially after
completing my recent set up so nothing
really much to see here except yeah I
mean they've also got used clothes over
there as well but kind of not my kettle
of fish but some of you guys who like
music they've got like arm keeps the
guitars and drums and all that jazz so
if you're into playing jazz and you
probably pick up something here other
than that yeah I mean I'll quickly go
through a little other section of the
store and there's some things you guys
might be interested in then I'll quickly
take a look before we get back in the
car and get home and see what we've
scored so far and now this is pretty
random I picked up an ocarina so I got
this for a dollar I just saw it haters I
haven't found nothing here that I like
and I like that it's an ocarina so I'm
gonna get my zelda on other thing here
is that they've got one dollar keyboards
and it's actually pretty good as a lot
of them do work I've really picked up a
few keyboards that are like a dollar and
network so if you're on a budget you
need a spare keyboard if you need a main
keyboard if you're on an extreme budget
then picking up a dollar keyboard isn't
a bad option alright so if you're
looking for a mice however generally you
might want to steer clear of the mice
for a dollar because I usually find it
they're in more ways than one so
I know from personal experience I tried
one for when I was doing input lag tests
and like the left and the right click
were like intertwined and whenever I hit
one it did the
action it was weird I know tripods and
stuff if you're a video ugh refer but
they ask top dollar that's the problem
they're asking 350 dollars for this
tripod and it's kind of like well like a
probably get brand new one that's even
better for like 300 so some of their
prices here they kind of hit and miss
actually really hit missed so I guess if
you come to these stores generally have
a price in mind and know what you be
paying for it but generally the the more
dirty it looks the cheaper it will be
and if you can clean stuff up that's
where you'll pick up a lot of your
bargains so anyway that's about it for
now we're going to head in the car get
home and take a look at what bargains
we've picked up here
do we just got back from the retro store
and yeah this is kind of like our
collection here at the moment well
mainly most of its my brother's has just
gone ham on the junk store sort of retro
store raid there and he's got so many
titles me personally I've just got that
Nintendo over there it's got Turtles two
in there at the moment which is a pretty
popular beat-'em-up game I'm also as I
said before I'm just collecting mainly
the rock man series and also the Zelda's
they're the ones that I've got my eyes
on I'm very keen to get the whole like
all of them so when i get them hey i
mean i might make an update video with
my whole retro setup if you guys are
keen on seeing that so that's pretty
much a look into the junkyard and sort
of retro things today i mean i was
actually more stoked about getting this
ocarina more than anything so that's
just me i'm not i don't get too addicted
to this stuff but i will say that the
Mega Man's are a lot of fun i really
enjoy playing them so i'm going to get
back into them and try and clop all of
them especially the Mega Man X ones that
I didn't get to play on the Super
Nintendo anyway guys that's about it for
