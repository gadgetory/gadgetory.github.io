asking me to take a look at some of the
scams that are going on nowadays and now
we will get onto the ebay GTX scams
later on in this video but this first
one is a real new metaphor the scammers
I've never heard of anything like this
before and this one will show you the
lengths that scammers will go to now to
rip people off or in this case I believe
they're ripping off retailers because my
good friend over in the he bought two
coffee lakes CPUs and when he got them
in he unboxed one of them and basically
the dye fell off the CPU as soon as he
took it out of the packaging and then he
was shocked he was like wow this does
not even look like a a Theon or even a
seventh or sixth gen CPU since they do
share the same a socket it's just the
eighth gens will only work on the z3 70s
but what happened was after that he told
me about this and I took a look at it it
looked like a seller on from way back in
the day I'm actually not even entirely
sure what CPU it is but regardless it's
a ridiculously cheap CPU that you can
get for like one or two dollars and then
he said can you just watch me unbox this
second CPU live so I've got some proof
in case I send these back to the
retailer and they think you know full of
crap and I said definitely so I watched
him unbox this CPU and then the second
one again the same thing happened that I
fell off the CPU and basically at that
stage I asked him I said you know
because I can't look at it closely from
my side of the world he's over in the UK
I'm over in Australia and he said it
looked everything looked brand-new like
the seal sticker the white sticker is
well sealing the other side of the box
and for me this really showed that
because those stickers especially those
little seal stickers they're really as
soon as you take them off they're stuck
on the box so what these scammers must
be doing is buying off the retailer's
8th gen coffee Lakes CPUs somehow
unboxing it in a way that they can then
reseal it but they're getting the CPU D
letting it taking the actual PCB off
with the dye on it which is the most
important part putting a really cheap
CPU back on
and then they are shipping it back to
the retail in the retailers probably
just gonna look at it and say oh wow
this still looks brand new the lid says
it's an 8700 K or 8th gen CPU let's put
it back on the shelves so the retailer
in this case I don't think they've got
anything to really be guilty of I mean I
would not know in a million years how
you could reseal these boxes so
perfectly so basically the scammers have
some method of getting the CPUs out and
then reselling and then sending it back
to the retailers that's my belief of
course there are other possibilities
some of which the retailer is doing it
themselves which I highly doubt they
could get fined and go and imprisoned
for a long time for doing that crap as
well as Intel doing it from the factory
but I really doubt that as well so what
we've got here is a scam of a new kind
of nature and you really have to be
careful of this one because I think once
wind picks up that you can do this and
there is some technique for doing it the
underground will let other people know
other scammers and then they'll start
doing it to retailers so maybe this is a
heads up if you guys are friends with
retailers who have an honest business
maybe there's some other way now that
they'll have to check if the CPUs if
they get returned they are legitimate
coffee like CPUs and I'm not sure how
they would do that so now one thing I
wanted to do was also these first gen
here I would absolutely love them you
can pick them up for seven bucks
Holi Express I've been talking about it
for a long time but I've heard that they
are deliverable them in the i-57 50s so
I mean besides this being like a video
sort of informing you guys about
scanners I sort actually wanted to test
if you could actually deal it one of
these so let's quickly go down and do it
so just got back from the hardware store
and you can indeed deal it'd your ex 34
30s or the i5 750 these are the first
gen Intel iSeries chips so I believe
you'll be out of deal in the x34 70s and
also the i7 860 s as well which it comes
as a bit of a shock to me because I
thought the Ivy Bridge Series was when
they first started putting paste on that
overclockable skews I guess not this is
definitely proofed to that and this is
still a very popular CPU especially for
budget builders in mind who like to get
cheap ddr3 like to get a cheap 855
motherboard I finally expressed for
example so definitely gonna be deleting
a few more of these and testing that out
but anyway Coffee Lake CPU scammers
aside and they're probably using
something like this for a base what
about GPU scams and what are some tips
to avoid and look out for scams like
these let's find out
welcome back to tech s it is brand
coming to you guys today with a sad kind
of video but at least the outcome of
this video should give you some pointers
on how to protect yourself against the
crap going out there at the moment and
the first one we're gonna pull up here
is a gtx 960 4 gigabyte edition going on
ebay for a price of 83 dollars
australian now it looks great right
they've got the photos up there you've
got oh wow 4 gigabytes of vram buffer
gtx 960 it's gonna play pub g that's
what you're probably thinking and then
if you buy one of these GPUs you
probably gonna put it in your computer
and notice that it won't play
practically anything at all because when
we look at this auction closer they've
even included their own gpu-z screenshot
and it shows you that this isn't a gtx
960 at all they're looking at the
shaders and it says 192 now the gtx 960
didn't have that many stream processors
or cuda cores whatever you want to call
it that's the name for it and it had way
more than that when we go on google we
look at 192 cuda cores we get a gtx 550
ti especially when we look at those
clock speeds as well 782 megahertz I
believe the 960 was clocked over a
gigahertz on its GPU cores so this
straightaway indicates a big crack in
this auction and so this should be a
guide that if you see a crack or if you
see something that's fishy about an
auction then the first step would be to
stay away don't buy that auction even if
the price is too good to be true
Hey look not a TV studio Josh sorry
about that interruption let's get back
to the video so the first crack will
show itself something's wrong with the
auction now the price if it's too good
to be true then that's generally another
indicator if especially wipe the listing
says these are brand new cards this is
another reason why when I got asked to
look into these auctions I told my
viewers just on Twitter to completely
stay away from these auctions especially
another thing is you'll notice that the
brand names on these gravis cards are
brands is not even a brand something
you've never heard of it's just some
generic crappy cooler that comes out of
an OEM manufacturer and everyone's using
them for their scam gravis cards so
that's another sign as well but let's
have a look at some other listings here
we'll pull up a few more and see what we
can suss out
so now I've pulled up another seller
who's selling practically the exact same
gravis car the problem this time is he's
sold two hundred and ninety of these gtx
960 s and the thing is like i went to
check his feedback and there was only
two people who left negative feedback in
regards to nvidia graphics cars as this
guy's selling now I remember back in
2007 when I first started selling a few
things on eBay and I had a friend who
was a power seller and he told me one
thing he said if you're buying on eBay
always checked the feedback and if you
even just find one person who has
something negative to say read that
negative comment and sure enough there
was one guy who left negative feedback
on this auction and said it's a copy
it's a fake don't buy it even though I
had to translate it but if you guys are
unsure then definitely check around on
some of the feedback that some of these
sellers have and even if you find one
that says it's a fake or it's a copy
then that's another clear warning sign
to stay away from auctions like these
this time around this guy hasn't
included a gpu-z screenshot he's just
put there the unified shaders so instead
of putting their cooter cause they've
sort of changed the wording around to
make it look like you wouldn't notice so
I'm surprised at how many graphics cards
this seller has sold honestly and I'm
surprised that he's only received two
negative feedback one of which said he's
never received the item which that does
happen especially if you're selling a
lot of items in your posting
internationally so it's really only one
feedback score there that says hey this
is a fake so that's pretty surprising I
wonder how many people have actually
been hosed from these graphics cards on
eBay so let's pull up another couple of
sellers and see what they've got
so now the last one we've got here is a
seller who is promising you a GTX 1050 a
two gigabyte model for ninety three
Australian dollars which would be
something in the likes of 70 something
US dollars extremely cheap and again the
price is too good to be true but when we
look at it closer it's got all those
checklists that were ticking off before
some crappy cooler you've never seen
before price is too good to be true then
we look at the listing and we've got
straightaway some warning signs a core
clock which is under that of a 1050 or
1050 is clocked much higher than 900
megahertz you've also got the memory bus
which says it's a hundred and ninety two
bit wide that is already signs of a fake
the GTX 1050 has a 128-bit wired memory
bus so there's straightaway you know
these things are fake you know this
seller is selling non legit products so
one thing I have with this those I've
heard of other youtubers who have bought
these gravis cards and indeed just
started them up and shown that the
performance is really lackluster they've
even went on PayPal and got their money
back sort of scammed the scammer which i
think is a good thing I think what more
people should be doing and then these
guys have stopped selling this crap but
another thing is - I don't know why eBay
doesn't police this and doesn't say hey
these are gravis cards that are not the
original product they're not even copies
that perform similar they're just
completely scams in my opinion why are
these sellers allowed to still sell on
eBay that's my biggest problem eBay
should police this crap and say to these
sellers look you're getting a temporary
ban you can't do this anymore but of
course it still goes on and when I check
some of the feedback some people are
leaving positive feedback on these
graphics cards I guess because maybe
they just want something to play youtube
videos and they put it in and it works
but I'm sure there's guys out there who
have got these graphics cards that put
them in they wanted to play something
like pub G because they heard a GTX 1050
or a GTX 960 will play pub J and they
indeed will play a 1080p but if you get
a fake GTX what is really a 550 ti and
put that in you ain't gonna be playing
pub G at 1080p at all in fact you might
even be barely lucky to play 720p
70% screen scout I don't even know if a
550 ti would actually be capable of
doing that maybe that's a test for
another video but anyway guys there's
some examples I've showed you of what is
going on with the scammers and what
they're doing nowadays and basically
I'll recap it for you guys if the price
is too good to be true and especially
there's a lot of those to sell and
they're brand new then it usually is so
that's a clear warning sign price is too
good to be true
number two feedback if you see even one
negative score on this graphics card
then definitely go get a second opinion
on it number three if you see it has a
crappy om cool that you've never seen
before something that's not from a
company like gigabyte MSI Zeus or gal
acts or EVGA for example then that's
another big warning sign sure enough
there are some decent OMS that are
coming out from China mainland that are
actually legit products but generally
you'll find that they're priced a lot
higher than these fake graphics cards
are and now point number four is there's
cracks in the actual specifications of
the listings they're listed as a hundred
and ninety two shaders for example and a
quick Google search will show you that
that actual graphics card for instance
the 960 has a lot more CUDA cores than
that's saying in that listing there's
also the core clocks try and match them
up and even the memory clocks if your
aren't sure
and then the last point I'll mention
before I get on out of here and the most
important thing is if you've bought one
of these graphics cards and you're not
sure if it's a scam you think hey maybe
the sellers legit the last thing you can
do of course is put this card in your
computer and just run a 3d mark
firestrike score there'll be a graphics
score in there and that'll simply tell
you how well this card performs I've got
a list on my website of all the graphics
cards that are listed out there so for
instance if you've got a gtx 960 you can
run the firestrike score check the GPU
score and then match it up on the
website and if it matches the score
that's shown on the website tech CD TV
then you know you've got a legit gtx 960
if the performance of that GPU score is
far below the score listed on the
website then you know you've got a fake
or you know something severely wrong
with your computer but i'm guessing it's
the former anyway guys hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like
and let me know in the comment section
below have you been scammed before if so
what happened also if you've got some
tips and tricks of your own they haven't
been listed in this video then be sure

below to help out people especially
newcomers who are getting into the game
of buying PC parts even off eBay that
how they can stay away from scammers who
are just trying to steal their money
practically and without aside I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
if so what happened let me know the
deeds and also if you are a scammer
yourself then maybe you can put some
tips in to help people stay away from
scum like yourself oh yeah sorry I just
read it I'm just in the middle of
recording dude I just got back now sorry
