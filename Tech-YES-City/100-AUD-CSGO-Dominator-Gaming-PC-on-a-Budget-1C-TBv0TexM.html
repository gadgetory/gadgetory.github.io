they said he was finished
then Gangotri
welcome back to check yes it is Brian
coming to you guys today with the first
used build with all the parts being
sourced from down under in Australia
here instead of what I usually do it in
Japan and I got to admit today is a
pretty damn good build with the value
for money actually probably coming in
better than what I've done in Japan so
with all my builds we're going to go
through the parts list the prices and
then we're going to go the cleanse then
the build then the benchmarks
my obsession I just want you in my
possession never get up no fly not
letting you out of my side never giving
up this time for
wait
never been good I show discretion it's
not my thing on my profession never
giving up no
not letting you out of
never giving up
so with this build I wanted to compare
it to the csgo potato because that was a
bill that passed but I sourced the parts
for around about 70 USD now this coming
in at a hundred AUD is kind of in a very
similar price point maybe being around
70 something USD though the good thing
is about this build is it performs
better than that bill did back then and
it's got an a3 Sandy Bridge in there
that goes up to around 3.1 gigahertz and
the temps were absolutely fine I think
the max temp I recorded here was around
about 50 something degrees on that stock
Intel cooler another thing is you guys
are probably wondering the sponge and
hairdryer it actually works pretty well
and it's free you don't have to pay any
money to clean your parts like this
though do I recommend it probably not I
would recommend having all the parts
being absolutely completely discharged
before you attempt to do anything like
this as is the case with desktops is
very easy to do so with the benchmarks
we could see there that counter-strike
csgo was playing absolutely fine at
1080p on really good settings there I'm
pretty much hi across the board we're
getting around 100 and something frames
per second then we contrast with
overwatch actually being playable as
well with a good 40 to 50 average FPS
there on high settings at 1080p so this
build is very capable with those popular
multiplayer titles there and I'm glad
that I got something like this for the
money and it goes to show that if you
look around you can find really good
deals where you are willing to take a
gamble with some of these things that
don't work then I guess you can pick up
really good deals the deals that I got
here today I mean I just literally think
the power switch was busted on this case
and that was about it really the power
supply I wasn't too keen to try that
since there was another power supply
that looked a lot better had a bit more
power on the rails there so I decided to
use that instead of the one that came
with it especially since the symptoms
pointed to a faulty power supply so
regardless it all works now and it is
running spectacular when it comes to
games I also even got a free copy of
Windows 7 thrown in there though I did
have to bust the password to get that CD
key so they could then reinstall windows
and have it all fresh what about this PC
and what am I going to do with it well
I've actually already sold it to a
friend so booyah I make a little bit of
money and they get a really awesome
computer and I get to make the content
for you
this is the best part so we're going to
be definitely hunting for more pieces in
the future wherever I'm at in the world
doesn't matter we'll hunt for those
deals this time around it happened off a
gam tree anyway that's all from me today
if you guys like this video be sure to
hit that like button if you have any
questions or comments about the csgo
Dominator then be sure to drop a comment
the comment section below and I'll catch
you in the next tech videos very soon
Garen ready hit the sub button too why
not
there's going to be a lot more juicy
content coming to you he's up a now way
oh yeah break that password baby get my
free copy of windows 7 pro Brian what
are you going to do when you get back to
Australia you just can't get the deals
that you did in Japan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
