easy coming back to you guys today with
a review of the titanium HD now this is
a sound card from creative and I got two
of them for like $160 on special so I'm
gonna be keeping one maybe I'm gonna let
that I'm gonna let you guys decide
whether I should keep it on because
there's some things that I got to talk
about with the sound card there's some
things that I love there's some things
that I'd annoy me let's get on to the
bill quality first of this sound card
and essentially I really like the build
quality of this sound card it's cased in
a nice hard plastic here attached to
metal and it really does feel like a
solid well-built card I thought it felt
more solid than the creative Z I'm
looking at the front of it it's just all
black looking at the back of the card
it's got a black PCB which looks sleek
as well and over to the rear of the card
we have a mic in a headphone out a line
out and also a line in so it's got that
mic in and that line in which I really
want from a sound card I currently have
it on my own ball audio and I love it
because I use a condenser and I use a
boom mic for gaming now the headphone
out so the line in let's talk about
quickly about the line in line in has a
phenomenal clear signal going to it I
noticed no noise the mic in is really
strong as well this is something that
the created Z didn't do and something I
was not impressed with on the crazy but
the titanium HD has a really good mic in
with no noise I'll quickly do a test for
you guys on the boom mic so I've got my
ghetto highs is on and I've got them
attached with AV mode of boom Pro so
those guys have been following me and
know that I reviewed the V mode of burn
pro and it was a really good microphone
it basically turns any headphones into a
gaming headset but this is what this
microphone sounds like on the creative
titanium hd's mic in with no noise so I
mean yeah I think the mic in does a
phenomenal job of just yeah getting a
clean signal so anyway let's get back to
the review okay so what did you think
did you think it was good I thought it
was pretty impressive I thought it was a
little bit better than the zone on dgx
and which is a $30 sound card and that's
excellent value for money but I thought
yeah it did a good job I mean as
expected from
one of the best sound cards you can get
currently on the PC so I thought that
was good let's talk about that on the
line out and the headphone out because
something there's something weird going
on here anyway but it basically is if
you have the headphone out hooked up you
can't use the line out so that's kind of
like a design flaw a lot of people are
annoyed about it for me it's not that
big of a deal you can get by by using a
stereo splitter I use the headphone out
to stereo split it to an amp from a
headphone and split it to the 2.1 analog
sound now essentially I'm gonna make
another video as well comparing the
audio interface to the titanium HD to
the onboard audio but essentially the
difference between a sound card and the
other two is that a sound card and I
forgot to mention this in the created Z
is that a sound card will do a
phenomenal job of powering analog
speakers so my creative Z when I hooked
it up to my created I'm sorry my
Logitech Z 4 speakers 2-point ones Wow
did they come alive this thing really
pumped those 2.1 speakers is that two
point one speaker system to life the
base was just thump and so damn hard the
mids and the highs were just coming out
really well I mean people will be like
where's just allowed a signal yeah but
it's a loud clear signal that that
speaker system needs the onboard audio
just sounded nowhere near as good for
the 2.1 speakers if you've also got a
5.1 speaker setup then you may wish to
go up to creative Z something that I
thought sound cards did really well over
the other on the onboard audio in the
m-audio interface was that they powered
analog speakers really really damn well
not to mention the 5.1 up mix and the
thx and dolby digital settings that
these things have now let's talk about
headphones though you want to know how
these things sound for headphones and
obviously I'm using headphones a lot of
the time practically all the time when
I'm on the computer so the headphone out
of this thing had an interesting thing
that I did really start to fall in love
with and that was cmss 3d and in 5.1 up
mix so essentially what this sound card
does and the crazy does up makes the 5.1
as well but this thing has a setting
called cmss 3d which basically makes
your games feel
you're in a room and I'll put a link in
the description below when I'm testing
cmss 3d against stereo sound but I
thought it sounded really good and I
thought it did a good job I mean some
games that just really started to
immerse me and I was really good but
that being said something that I noticed
about this sound card was that the
soundstage on the headphone out sounded
better than the line out this was with
the 5.1 unmixed now when I searched on
Google to see if anyone else had this
problem there was only one guy who said
he noticed a difference and then
everyone said it was in his head it was
placebo but not trust me when I was
switching back between my objective 2
and my and the line out I noticed the
difference the headphone out did a
better job of up mixing to 5.1 than the
line out did so I was kind of surprised
to find that out so it was a little bit
of a lie in the end I'm kind of sitting
here gone what's creative doing why are
these problems like plaguing this sound
card don't they fix these things before
they ship them out I don't know like
there should have been some extensive
thorough testing done on these sound
cards but anyway there you can work what
work around that by getting a stereo
splitter on the headphone out so that
was something that kind of annoy me
about soccer but ultimately I'm left
here and now let's talk about another
negative the headphone out when I used
the headphone out directly to my
headphones which was on which what I was
doing initially was doing doing that I
noticed that the headphones
hurt my ears after like a few hours of
listening my ears became blocked and
maybe an audio engineer wants to chime
in or someone who knows a lot about
audio but when I hooked it up to the
objective to even from the headphone out
it wasn't hurting my ears anymore so
there's something weird going on with
this headphone out on this particular
titanium HD but yeah hurts my ears and
so I can't use I need to use it with an
amp so something weird going on there
but ultimately the sound card I'm left
sitting on the fancy in conclusion for
you guys I'm sitting on the fence as to
whether I should keep this sound card or
not I mean I love the 5.1 up mix I also
think without CMS s3 3d on it's fun for
music as well
when you go into games you turn cmss 3d
on it sounds really good so I'm kind of
sitting on the fence here as to whether
I should keep this thing what do you
guys think and I mean ultimately I can
recommend it if you know the flaws of
this thing and I would recommend if you
have sensitive headphones like I do then
you may wish to get an amp say a Pheo e6
or an objective 202 to hook it up to the
headphone out to spare your ears from
getting damaged
so yeah just something weird going on
but ultimately I'm left here like why
can't something just work perfectly why
can't I just use the headphone out
directly the lineout works at the same
time so I could hook that up to my
analog speakers and why can't I just do
that and you know have everything
working from the sound card that's kind
of what annoys me about it because my
onboard audio I mean my onboard audio is
good enough as it was you know I thought
if it wasn't for the bass roll-off the
on velour would be perfect but that's
something I don't see being overcome
anytime in the near future because the
fact that you know motherboard
manufacturers have to fit so many things
on a motherboard so they kind of got a
cut on costs when they can and one of
those things is the coupling capacitors
and that's why you get the bass roll-off
and something they don't do on the sound
cards or any other I guess thing where
you're spending money on audio so I'll
turn it on left sitting on the fence of
whether I should keep this thing and I
probably won't I mean it's just another
negative also when I came up with
testing when I was overclocking my GTX
780 to the max this thing also
introduced a little bit of noise as well
so ultimately yeah I'm just left here
confused because I love the features of
this sound card and I mean I love what
it can do but at the end of the day I'm
not really an audio enthusiast and it's
250 dollars because I got a couple it
with a headphone amp and I'm sitting
there gone hmm okay is that bass
roll-off and that you know 5.1 up mix
and that you know better signal to my
analog 2.1 worth 250 bucks because if
you guys don't know I can't really
listen to music that loud in this house
so that's why I've got a headphone
so I got a baby and I've got neighbors
close by so I'm just altima I'm just
yeah I don't know you guys decide this
I'm on the fence I'm sad I'm suffering
now let me know what you guys think
anyway peace out for now I'll catch you
guys soon with another video and I hope
you enjoyed this review of the titanium
HD and I'll catch you guys soon with
another tech video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
