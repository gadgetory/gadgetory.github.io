the gal acts overclocking carnival I
couldn't help but notice the new designs
of our TX cards they're Galax was
bringing to the market and in particular
the RT x 27 te x OC caught my eye and of
course there has been controversy pretty
much every our TX card that has been
released so far in particular in
australia i've liked the 2070 the most
out of the bunch even with the release
of the RT x 2060 which i think in the US
is probably hitting the best out of the
RT x 2003
vellieux for money which you haven't
seen already i'll put the link up here
for the review but in australia the RT x
2070 is in my opinion the better play
not just in terms of having more
performance than the RTF 2060 but also
better value for money coming in
currently at around 750 Aussie dollars
and in Europe I believe they call this
the KF a2 we should also do a good job
of coming in the lower end of the
pricing of RT X 2070 cards but of course
the question remains does this card live
up to its name does it perform well
whilst providing that value well today
we're gonna put it on the test bench and
we're also gonna be comparing it to the
likes of the RT X 27 t20 80/20 atti
from Oris as well as comparing it to a
1080 TI 2 so what are we waiting for
let's get this thing on the test bench
and see what it can do
so I just spent some quality time with
this r-tx 2070 graphics card right here
testing out things like the thermals
acoustics and also the fan speeds
themselves so what we had here throw up
a graph for you guys this was while it
was overclocked as well and another
thing I've been testing recently is in
hotter ambient temperatures so the
ambient temperature in here is 28
degrees at the moment and this cooler
performed phenomenally well 60% fan
speeds is just like the r-tx 2060 review
I did recently seems like it's the sweet
spot and not just out of the box but
also if you want to overclock as well so
overclocked we're getting 44 decibels of
noise and 67 degrees of temperature now
the auto fan speeds ironically came in
at 59% and that got a little bit quiet
at 43 decibels one decibel quite a bit
also one degree hotter and that's
because the PWM itself starts
fluctuating a little bit you're not
staying at a constant 59 percent you're
actually fluctuating a little bit
staying under the magic number of 70
degrees but also looking at 80 percent
things start to get a lot louder a lot
quicker 61 degrees temperatures max then
100% the fan speeds are simply
unbearable you get a 60 decibels and
noise but you do get a good temperature
of 58 degrees so really only 30 degrees
above load at 28 degrees ambience but
one thing to mention that this cooler is
going through the extra features that
put on board they've instead used 100
mil fans this time around and as we saw
with those thermals they're doing a
great job of keeping this graphics card
cool but also quiet as well with that
magical 60% fan speed at the rear of the
car they've included three DisplayPort
outs HDMI 2.0 and a USB type-c as well
measuring up the card in terms of length
you've got 285 millimeters that you'll
need for clearance if you wish to mount
this in your case you're requiring 8 and
6 pin connector as well as having RGB on
the side and on the front which you can
change with the extreme tuner software I
couldn't find anywhere in the NVIDIA
GeForce to turn these LEDs off but with
the software itself you can download it
it looks pretty simple and pretty
polished I was impressed you do get an
extra 25 millivolts extra Headroom to
play with with overclocks as opposed to
M
after burner which only has the hundred
millivolt but you also get a power limit
of a hundred and eleven percent which on
an Archie X twenty seventy especially a
value proposition like this one is
actually not a bad thing now actually
one of the coolest features as you can
see right beside me here is the complete
silence of the gravis guard unless
you're loading up video games and
putting a strain on this gravis card
then it will stay quiet
however the cool thing in the extreme
tuner software is that you can
individually control the fans so if you
only want one of the fans going you can
do that I mean the practicality of it
isn't really there but it's just one
cool thing that I noticed in the
software but anyway guys I'm gonna get
back to testing and finishing up the
rest of the test with these graphics
cards around here at 1440p ultra wide
then come back with some solid scores
and we can present a conclusion for the
r-tx 2070
so we just finished up doing all the
benchmarks and the r-tx 2070 EXO si
managed to overclock an extra one
hundred and forty mega Hertz on the core
and then on the memory we've got a
whopping eight hundred and thirty
megahertz this led the effective speeds
on the memory about 15.6 gigahertz and
then on the core clock itself we got
around two point zero seven gigahertz on
that this enabled it in the benchmarks
and will throw up some numbers for you
here with shadows of the Tomb Raider
first to score pretty high now I tested
at 1440p ultra wide for you guys and the
numbers were very impressive coming out
of this graphics card it was slightly
edging out the auras 2017 and that has a
pretty big cooler on it so what this
proves is that this card and the cooler
that Galax have implemented are
perfectly fine for handling a twenty
seventy both out of the box and even
during summer heat when it's overclocked
but ultimately what we see with the
numbers here is that the 2080 ti that's
in another league both in performance
but also price and then the twenty
eighty s coming out ahead of even an
overclocked 2070 and that's coming out
ahead of a 1080 TI and that's actually
coming close to the 1080 TI which is
then well ahead of the 1080 moving on to
the next game we're pulling up here is
Far Cry 5 a little bit in favor of the
previous generation cards in comparison
to other games but still showing a
difference there with a 2080 kind of
matching the 1080 TI 2080 ti pulling
ahead but this resolution is definitely
a sweet spot for all these cards in
terms of maxing out the performance
except for one title and we'll pull that
out next that is Rainbow six siege where
in the case of the r-tx 2080 ti that's
starting to get a little bit CPU bound
so the other scores here are starting to
push a little bit closer to that gravis
car but the 2070 exo c is edging out the
2070 or s ever so slightly in some of
these titles it's a very close battle
but that's ultimately because it comes
with higher clocks out of the box but
also when it's overclocked to now the
next time we're pulling up here is
hitman two and a very similar trend is
following with older graphics cards
being where they should be and those 20
70s coming very close to one another but
still showing that this card when it's
overclocked
can get some pretty closed
others to that of not just the ten atti
but also the 2080 itself and then moving
on to the last title here we've got
battlefield 5 we're at 1440p ultra wide
with ultra settings on max here we saw
that this card was performing very well
getting over 80 FPS but if you were to
drop the settings down to high with this
gravis car with a 1440p ultrawide
monitor you'd be having a great gaming
experience at a hundred Hertz with this
grave scope being able to push those
frame rates and to be honest high in
ultra settings
I love playing on high your able to
extract extra frame rates without taking
pretty much any of a hit to the visual
fidelity in the game itself there
running through some of the synthetics
for you guys 3d Mach 5 strike shows that
the 2080 Ti is pulling well ahead of the
other cards here but the 20 80 and the
1080 TI coming very close and then the
20 70 beating the 1080 both overclocked
and out of the box but moving on now to
the power consumption figures because
these pretty much relate to those scores
that you saw before with 3d mark
firestrike just changing things to
what's where the 28 ETA is using the
most power here but the 2070 exo see it
is doing pretty well there's nothing
outstanding about its power consumption
but it's not that bad either you would
like to have a good 500 watt power
supply running this thing day and day
out but then the last synthetic we're
gonna pull up for you guys it's time spy
extreme where the RT x-series cards do
better in relation to 3d mark 5 strike
then their 10th series counterparts and
so we saw here that the 2070 is edging
closer to that 1080 TI it's actually
very close and then the 2018 the 2080 ti
pull well ahead in this benchmark but
something crazy happened with the 2080
ti speaking of that this horas card here
is my first time running into an
artifact ting card you've heard stories
on the web of cards failing having
problems
this card started to exhibit that
artifacting behavior on stock out of the
box settings and I've heard rumors about
what it could be I've spoken to other
people in the industry I've spoken to
confirmed sources about different things
so I may be making a dead
catid video on to what I think exactly
is the problem with the higher failure
rates on some of these higher-end r-tx
cards because I was able to fix it like
relatively quickly it was nothing at all
in terms of fixing it so stay tuned for
a video on that that was actually very
interesting something to come out of
this but anyway back to this graphics
card right here
the e^x OC from gal axe and this thing
I mean Galax know what they're doing the
10 series cards that all came through
here on the channel I was impressed with
every single one of them whether it was
the value for money play like this one
here or was the whole of fame that just
went absolutely over the clouds and hit
every single mark but also costed a
premium this one right here is two
sticks true to that package of
delivering good value for money in that
graphics card segment I think it's going
for 760 ozzie dollars of retail at the
moment but if you can pick this thing up
on ebay for example to 20% off sales
it's gonna be a really good buy I'm
actually personally waiting for some of
those sales so I can pick up a few of
these myself but this card it's got at
all it does it all acoustics thermals
over clocks and it overclocked quite
well at least the sample we had here
it's got the RGB bling it's got good
display options at the back it's got
great software support very simple very
easy to use but I guess there's not much
else to say except Galax really know
what they're doing when it comes to
making a graphics card and as we said
with the GOC the galaxy overclocking
carnival one of the hardcore
overclockers who actually competes in
world competitions mad he's actually on
the galaxy design team so that's awesome
when they've got a pro overclocker
designing these cards personally so
that's the galaxy touch and I'm really
impressed with his graphics card can
definitely recommend it to you guys out
there in the audience if you're thinking
of getting one whether it be the gal
expanding or the kf8 2 they're
essentially the same company just Galax
have to rebrand their company in Europe
due to trademark issues but anyway guys
that's that I don't know about America
and the availability I'm told these will
be coming out in America on the Galax
store when they hit there I'll update
the description for you guys being car
get them in Australia for a pretty good
price and that's about it for today's
video guys if you enjoyed this one then
be sure to hit that like button but also
let us know in the comments section
below what you think of the exo see I
mean the sample I got here it just looks
amazing that's just my personal opinion
on it I really like what they've done
with it
the RGB is not too in-your-face and you
can turn it off if you wish to you've
also of course with the RT x-series got
the ray-tracing and dl SS support so if
you wish to use those in games then good
luck and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon also if you want to see
the inside scoop before it hits
