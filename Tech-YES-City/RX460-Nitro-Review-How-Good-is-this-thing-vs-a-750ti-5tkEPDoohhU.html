card there from the RX lineup from AMD
though how does it compare against
something of similar price today I'm
going to put a head-to-head against the
750 Ti welcome to tax City this is brian
hitting home with a graphics card review
one that involves a newcomer the Nitro
rx 460 from sapphire which was provided
as a review sample and another which
I've actually had around here for a
while and I put it in a budget build in
the past the galaxy gtx 750ti though
without wasting any more of your time
let's dive straight into the benchmarks
so before we get into the results I'll
quickly talk about the overclocks the RX
460 I managed to get an extra 100
megahertz out of the core which is
pretty healthy and the temperatures were
very well controlled this particular
model didn't even go into the 60 degree
mark and this was on the stocked fan
profile which was really quiet at all
times the 750 gr ironically overclocked
like a beast I mean it's the smallest
fan and heatsink I've ever seen on a 750
Ti before yet it's the best overclock
I've ever seen on 750 Ti there was for
those games at 1080p both of these cards
handled all those popular multiplayer
titles perfectly fine titles like csgo
wild lesion overwatch and dota 2 with
either max or high settings no didn't
test League of Legends because in my
experience if a graphics card can handle
dota 2 at 1080p max settings then it'll
have absolutely no problems handling
League of Legends and max settings at
1080p and most likely 2 K or even 4k
though I was kind of surprised though
the 750g I did score minor victories in
three of the titles that I tested here
those being overwatch well lesion and
also dota 2 the VXR 460 did give the
750ti a big ass-whooping when it came to
Deus Ex mankind divided fire strike and
also doom on Vulcan
with those benchmarks really showcasing
that whole v8 versus 4-cylinder debate
going around with AMD vs and video at
the moment they're looking at the RX for
60s from sapphire comes in two different
flavors you get the two gigabyte variant
which I can currently see priced around
about 116 dollars then there's the four
gigabyte variant which is the nitro
Edition and this comes with LEDs and
also a six pin power connector there
where as opposed to the two gear but it
only draws from the PC
power connection oddly enough though I
found myself liking the price of the two
gigabyte variant a lot more as it comes
close to that $100 price point which I
would like to see it sitting at a flat
$100 if possible as for an entry level
gaming card if you couple it with a
cheap $70 eBay used Oh a MPC for example
a quad-core then you could have yourself
a pretty impressive 1080p gaming PC for
under $200 there's a 4 gigabyte flavor
currently sitting around about $140 is
pretty high I'd like to see that at
around about 120 dollars because of this
current price it currently starts to
step into that RX 470 territory or even
a used gtx 970 or r9 390 which all three
of those cards will handily beat the RX
460 without a problem not to mention the
gtx 1060 coming in around about $200 on
all those solid card from sapphire the
build quality and the cosmetics are
really nice on this card temperatures
are low noises extremely quiet thanks to
those dual Nitro fans even on the stock
fan profile and even overclocked to the
max it still didn't creep over 60
degrees and it remained very quiet also
an idle the fan stops spinning
completely which on this graphs card is
really nice since it's got a low-power
draw to begin with the temperatures
didn't really creep over 40 degrees even
with the fans not spinning at all the
ultimately the RX 460 from sapphire is a
nice little card for 1080p gaming
especially on those popular multiplayer
titles that I can recommend if the price
is right which for the 2 gigabyte
variant is getting close though the
foggy boat variant like the Nitro here
today I think it needs to come down a
little bit in price to really make it a
solid card in the market but that's just
my opinion anyway guys if you liked this
video then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know what you guys
think of the RS 460 in the comment
section below
love to hear your thoughts and as always
I'll catch you in the next Tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
