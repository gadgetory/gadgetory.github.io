anything enthusiasm in eh eh Riga built
was like a home theater PC with a penny
kind of sucked up again but from today
all that has changed with my new mini
ITX rig called the roadie welcome to
tech city this is brian coming to you
guys today with my new mobile gaming
slash video editing PC which I actually
decided to build when I was in America
on the holiday four packs and the
reasoning behind this is because I went
to Micro Center and I just couldn't help
myself some of those deals that were
incredible now this PC would have been
done a long time ago except I actually
had problems with the motherboard
actually got a faulty motherboard on the
road and I couldn't return it to my guru
center because I was in Vegas when I
built this thing so there was a lot of
hassle and that's one thing that will
guess will come out of this video is
don't buy parts on a trip unless you can
test them out and return them quickly
though anyway getting back on track
let's take a look at the prices of all
the parts in this build and then we'll
put it together and benchmark it on some
games
even though things were tedious at times
in space was very limited in this case
the bill was pretty straightforward I
would however highly recommend at least
getting a semi modular power supply
because if you have all those extra
cables there and on non modular you will
have a tough time getting everything to
fit in this rig so now with the PC built
out the way I was kind of disappointed
with my 6600 k it didn't go as high as I
liked especially the one that I had
beforehand which went up to 4.6
gigahertz this thing had a tough time
and it struggled at four point three
gigahertz even when I put over 1.3 volt
in it I managed to find a balance
however at four point two years at one
point two four volt so that's the
silicon lottery there are kind of lost
and no it's not the temperatures or the
motherboard I know this motherboard has
a decent vrm and the temperatures aren't
even going anywhere near 50 degrees with
that course at age 60 which is really
good for temperatures and also
PowerSchool
you
you
you
so anyway there we have it games at
1080p absolutely got mints by the scraps
card except for Deus Ex mankind divided
I really don't know what's going on
there I mean I think it's just horribly
optimized for PC but besides that this
card will handle 1440p absolutely fine
as well if you don't mind taking off
some of those really taxing settings
like for instance 8-speed MSA a so if
you know my turning a few settings off
you'll get a really high frame rate with
this PC even if 1440p in even 4k if you
want to micro it down to like high and
take off some of the anti-aliasing and
stuff like that so there we have a guy's
absolute beast of a PC and not only that
I decided to put 32 gigabytes of RAM in
this thing so I could video edit on the
road in 4k and it does a phenomenal job
of that as well
like I can work it around 90% of the
speed that I can at home on this little
rig and it's just phenomenal absolutely
love it and I can highly recommend it
though one thing that I would sort of go
with if you wanted to save money was you
could go with a h1 10 and also a 6700
nan overclockable CPU and you'll get the
fan with it and then you can save money
on the cooler and you'll still get good
performance out of that CPU I mean
you're taking the gamble with the 6600 K
on the silicon lottery and in my case I
kind of lost I think of 4.2 gigahertz it
wasn't that much and if in hindsight I
would have taken it back I would have
got H 110 and also a 6700 so there we
have it the s G 13 absolutely love that
Mini ITX case it fits everything in
there it's pretty cheap you can also
carry it in a duffle bag and you can
still pretty much have full-fledged
enthusiast parts in there
ready to go so I can highly recommend it
and if you ladies videos and please give
it a big thumbs up if you have any
questions about today's mini ITX ring
let me know in the comment section below
also have you got a mini ITX Rick I'd
love to hear that if so what did you
pack in there and what case did you use
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
speed MSA hey that thing just really
taxes the gravis got a lot
hello
yeah Oh what you know won't you
Thank You Nani atone Anika hits you know
