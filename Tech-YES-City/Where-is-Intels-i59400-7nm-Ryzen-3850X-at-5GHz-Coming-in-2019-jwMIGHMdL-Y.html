I've been putting together
some guides for you guys
as well as building PCs,
and at the moment when I
look at the new PC parts,
especially at CPUs,
I see no other choice
but to buy AMD Ryzen.
And this got me scratching
my head thinking,
where is Intel's offerings
to compete against AMD
even before Christmas,
and we're not even going to talk
initially about the Ryzen 3000 series
until later in the video.
We're going to talk about right now,
because there is no i5-8400
at a reasonable price.
Over a year ago,
I bought this CPU for $187 U.S. shipped,
and at these prices it
represented what I thought was the
best value for money from Intel.
You had six cores, six
threads, you had that IPC,
you had the power
consumption being pretty low,
and you even had an included cooler
and then you can put that on a budget
motherboard like a H310
and get some really good value for money.
However skip forward to
the end of this year,
we now have
no i5-9400
released.
We don't even know when Intel or if Intel
wants to release this CPU.
And furthermore to compound
the problem for Intel,
Ryzen 5 2600 that's their six core,
12 threaded, overclockable
CPU with an included cooler,
is currently being had for $170 U.S.
And if you're in Australia
it's 208 Aussie dollars.
So let's talk about the
dominance that is AMD in 2018
and what looks like
it's gonna be 2019 too.
♪ I can dream about you ♪
♪ If I can't hold you tonight ♪
- Welcome back to Tech Yes City
this is Bryan coming to you guys today
from the hot af Vietnam Ho Chi Minh City.
We've also got a part
time drop in as well,
and I gotta go out in
few hours but before then
got some spare time to record this video
and what we're looking at
in the market currently
with AMD versus Intel,
is complete dominance where
reportedly in Germany,
from mindfactory.de,
AMD outsold Intel in November,
two CPUs to one.
And you can see in those
graphs that the Ryzen 5 2600,
more specifically is taking
up a huge chunk of those sales
which is great to see AMD not
only being back in the game
but actually outperforming the competitor.
If you asked I guess anyone
in the tech scene in 2014
if this scenario today
was likely possible,
everyone would've just said no way
back before they announced Ryzen,
everyone thought AMD was done.
And what we're seeing now in the market
is a scenario where
AMD's putting their foot
on the pedal and going full speed ahead.
And Intel on the other hand
seem like they're backing off.
And when we look at the data,
it looks like Intel in ways,
maybe they've got those 10nm problems
which we know about.
But also the 14nm production is limited
where they had to at
least revert back to 22nm
in some of their production assemblies.
But I guess to further add fuel,
or I guess rub sand in the wound,
from AMD to Intel
is that in 2019 the leaks
for the Ryzen 3000 series
are in the wild now,
where we're looking at
16 cores and 32 threads
in the $400 price bracket.
Not to mention they are making the main di
in those chips 7nms
so we will see higher clock speeds
reportedly to go as far as 5GHz
and in some cases higher on
a single core turbo boost
but also better power efficiency too.
So these chips will run cooler.
And looking through
some of the rumored SKUs
I do have my doubts,
and this is coming from both AdoredTV,
who says he has an inside source,
as well as Reddit and the main flagship
looks like it will be 3850x coming in with
16 cores and 32 threads.
And I do in ways a little bit doubt this
that AMD would go mainstream
with 16 cores, 32 threads.
For starters it would kind
of alienate their 2950x
almost immediately and maybe make users
who bought that platform
feel a little bit left out.
But also on top of that,
that don't need to bring
16 cores, 32 threads
quite yet I believe.
I think if AMD were to go with
the 12 core, 24 threaded CPU
that would really add value to the market.
Especially when you look at
the ThreadRipper lineup series
where their 12 cores aren't
exactly selling too well,
especially when you look at
them compared to the 16 cores
both on the 1000 series and
2000 series ThreadRipper chips.
But also looking at the
entry level Ryzen 3000 series
low-level chips,
they are looking like
they will be six cores,
so AMD does look like they wanna phase out
four cores altogether.
But this would still
lead to the fact that AMD
may be using a six core di,
as opposed to a four core
in the previous generations of Ryzen.
So when we look at what
the leaks are saying,
and then we compare that to I guess,
maybe just thinking about it logically,
if AMD were to go with
the 16 core part in 2019
I think it would be too much too soon,
to the point where
they'd kind of alienate,
even further 2020 releases
because they have hinted
that after 2020 it is going
to get difficult for them.
And also when I was at events previously,
I kind of got the hint that it would be
a 12 core, 24 thread as opposed to
a 16 core and a 32 threaded
chip on the mainstream.
Not to mention,
what are they exactly gonna do
with the memory controller as well.
That remains to be seen
because what we saw
with the ThreadRipper WX chips,
is that they were being
a little bit starved
in terms of bandwidth.
Regardless of the leaks
and what the contain,
I will leave some links
in the description below
where you can go watch AdoredTV's video.
Or you can go check out
the Reddit leak itself,
where there's sort of pretty strong
on suggesting that
there will be a 16 core,
32 threaded part.
I'm sort of leaning more conservative,
in that I think AMD won't
push that hard in 2019
when they don't have a reason to,
because when we look at even Intel,
they're rumored to have
a 10 core part coming out
and they're going to use 14nm
and if it's any suggestion from the 9900k,
this chip is already
running at the max capacity
for the ring boss.
I mean they got 8 core,
16 threads at 5GHz,
and that thing is seriously
having a tough time
handling the heat.
Not to mention the
issues surrounding that.
So going with 10 cores with Intel,
is kinda like up in the air
on what they're gonna do about that.
Anyway all CPU things aside,
AMD have a very healthy
future coming out of 2018
and also going into 2019
with that 7nm design,
they're definitely gonna
hit some home runs.
I can't wait to test these CPUs out,
and who knows exactly when
they're going to be released
into the wild.
But apparently we're going
to get more news at CES
so I'm really looking forward
to giving you guys that.
But also they've got the Navi GPUs
which are going on 7nm as well,
and this is a great time for AMD
not just in the CPU lineup
but also the GPU lineup
because we've seen with the video,
they've actually stagnated
when it comes to their RTX series.
And yes they offered these features,
which I feel in my opinion
were kind of useless
for the market at the
moment where they just
tanked performance so much.
But also when we look at the efficiency of
the RTX architecture itself,
with traditional DX11 titles,
and pretty much any title out there,
it's burning up more power
and you are getting more FPS
but really when it comes down to it,
the 10 series is really holding its value,
compared to the 20 series cards.
So AMD in 2019 definitely
have a chance to come back
and hit home runs in the GPU lineup,
just as much as they are
hitting home runs currently,
in the CPU division.
Anyway with the Ryzen 3000 series
I'm banking more on the
fact that we will have
a 12 core, 24 threaded flagship part.
As well as they probably will
phase out those four cores,
I think the market is ready for six cores.
It will segment them in a new field
they will be ahead of Intel,
especially in multithreaded applications,
and the single-threaded performance
if they can get those single
core boost up to 5GHz,
Intel is effectively going
to be left in the dust.
And of course they've
still got a dominating hand
in the server market
but value's value and
when that value starts
to creep in to the server industry,
I really see a good future ahead for AMD,
especially with their current design
with the Ryzen chips.

Anyway guys let me know in
the comments section below
what you think about the competition
between Intel and AMD,
especially for the new parts.
I don't think the Xeons
and their use field
are going anywhere.
If anything if these chips are as good
as they say they're gonna be,
which is possible,
then Xeon's are only
gonna get cheaper too.
So everyone's pretty much gonna win
thanks to AMD and their Ryzen design.
And I love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always,
so make sure you do drop a comment.

peace out for now.
