lounge this is brian from tech city
joined by kev showdown hey you don't
care i know good brian how about you man
I'm pretty good did you like that name
keV showdown uh yeah Hey look at that
when I miss the next time well it just
matches everything I don't know let me
go let us know in the audience do you
like the name keV showdown shirk we call
you Brian city yeah Brian city that's it
I see well I guess a lot of people want
to come to Brian city now sir cuz I
gotta judge our mug oh yeah so I hope
you guys in the audience are doing
really well we've got a show for you
guys today with not a lot of topics but
we're going to go in depth and then we
want to do a lot of community stuff
today and just talk to you guys about
things that you want to talk about so
hopefully the Q&amp;amp;A can be bigger than
normal today and with that being said to
use there anything that happened in the
last week anything special mmm nothing
that i can imagine i'm just being
channels as being humming along like
normal been doing a bit more peripherals
review since i've been doing so many
GPUs but um yes or when free normal how
about you man I saw you a $35 mechanical
keyboard video yeah the thing was
actually surprisingly good when I first
got it in like they didn't tell me the
price when I first got it in I was like
oh whoa you guys gonna like us seventy
or eighty dollars for this like mmm that
ain't gonna be right and then I like
looked at the prolly Oh $35 that changes
everything ok so those she's pretty
surprised with it was really cool so for
a $35 keyboard it is really damn good
other than that you guys put my notice
wearing the new shirt oh yeah I'm gonna
plug the shirt right now come on man
come on there we go if you don't want to
ever again want to get the money at the
truth hurts shirt hottest shirt out
there in the tech community the moment
self-proclaimed okay go to shop dot
spreadshirt com / tech city go get
yourself the truth hurts because it does
it does hurt so I get and we'll do that
we gotta give away coming too so there's
a lot there's lots going on this show so
you guys gotta stay tuned but
unlocked are you and also last I'm still
reeling from the wendell hangover from
last week man that show is just awesome
like I just got we just got so much
positive feedback from the community
that sure was really good like we just
had to make it the extra mile as well
because those are so many things that we
wanted to talk about with Wendell you
know he just knows everything so I was
like just as the knowledge is just
unbelievable yes general knowledge when
it comes to tech is justice I guess I
guess that comes from him being an
enthusiast for such a long time as well
you could tell he's been enthusiast
before you know me and you were whatever
you know building our first pc that's I
think that's pretty clearly obvious
there's just knows a lot about
everything so we got the first topic
here though the I 373 50k now this is
really interesting this is the first
time we're gonna see an overclockable I
three I besides the old school you know
550 550 or whatnot which you could
overclock but sort of like the first k I
three that we're seeing and I like the
product I like where it stands right
it's coming in around I think at one
hundred and seventy dollars 150-180 the
price isn't confirmed yet but I think
it's going to hit the market pretty well
in that you know it's going to offer
those sort of entry-level GPUs in the
mid-range GPUs a good cpu to go hand in
hand with you know yeah i'm sort of a
little bit dubious because it's a
dual-core processor and if you remember
back to the pentium k which technically
you're still correct that it wasn't an
i3 but intel has released and unlocked
dual core processor which was the
nicknames pentium k and or the what was
the proper names that is breathe 438 are
the thirty to fifty eight thirty to
fifty i love it i love that yeah man
that was an awesome cpu because the
thing about that cpu was it could
overclock on the cheap h81 motherboards
now that's something we're going to
raise but i'll let you finish you go
yeah i just i was going to say that it
was really good um and i remember when i
tested it originally i really liked it
but the bing a dual-core in this day and
age is actually going to be quite a big
of a drawback because a lot of these
games now actually require not all of
them and obviously not know old games
but a lot of new games now are requiring
quad core cpus and that's an issue for
some people out there so yeah that is
true like a lot of those games are like
there are games so not a lot but there
are games are coming out there with the
prerequisite of four cores but something
that I've noticed is a lot of games that
are very popular layered we're talking
popular multi type player titles like
overwatch they would never pull that
right because they know a lot of people
are using dual cores so any game that's
going to be really really popular you
can bet your bottom dollar it's going to
support a dual core hello could probably
even run on a single call you know I
think you can still run over watch on a
pentium 4 just it runs terribly that's
all but you know I think that
prerequisite is not going to be there
for really really popular titles due to
the fact that you've got in a lot of
third world Asian countries that have
these real cheap computers and they want
to capture that market as well you know
because they want to sell their two
dollar you know costumes on their
characters in the game and stuff and
people can afford the a/c so they they
know how to bring people in really
popular multiplayer titles that nowadays
a geared in such a way that you won't
see four cores being a prerequisite if
they want to have a really really
popular multiplayer title on their hands
so that's all in one point of the thing
yeah that is true and when someone wrote
um it does have I hyper-threading yet
which is true so that will um sort of
help although I hope you guys understand
that hyper threading is to do with the
threads not to do with it doesn't make a
dual core into a quad core it just it
makes it horrified quad core essential
it makes it it's yeah yeah it's sort of
like a it's like a virtual sort of um I
don't know how to put it really that
would be very simple for everyone to
understand the non enthusiast I should
say but yeah it that is a good point but
it still might have run into some issues
that's not going to mean that it's full
workaround but I'm still impressed with
us and I think it will definitely have a
market I think until I sort of seeing
that
could probably make a lot of money here
I think that's mainly probably the big
factor of why they can release this
overclockable I three yeah well I mean
hyper-threading does do really good
things though it does utilize more of
the cause that is proven you know yeah
it is true I'm not against it yeah you
know and a lot of people put it down to
around about a figure roughly that is
thirty percent and I tend to agree with
that if it's utilized properly fiber
threatenings utilized in perfect world
it's around about thirty to forty
percent depending so you know that's a
really good thing so you know an i3 over
a dual core is always a better things
it's going to have those extra two
threads also at the same time I mean I
wonder with this the I 373 50k right I'm
the biggest thing that gets me worried
is of course do you have to go and buy a
Z 270 board because yeah that's
obviously it's going to be expensive
much more expensive than H whatever 210
are they going to do h 2 10 boards
because I think with the eye through the
entry-level overclocker they should be
out they should allow it to overclock on
entry-level boards but the thing that
does make me a little bit happy is that
there but they bring this thing out with
a boost frequency of 4.2 gigahertz which
means is there going to be any
overclocking Headroom anyway that's
that's something that I'm worried I'd
imagine it would be here I'd imagine
you'd probably get I mean that was the
big thing with the thirty to fifty eight
and one I test I got up to 4.9 and that
thing was out of the box was clocked at
3.2 cu yeah you could take that thing to
the moon so um yeah I think I think
it'll be a right isn't k be late on I
don't know where I read it all though
they haven't confirmed it have they I
thought it was going to stay on the Z
170 others new motherboards is
definitely new motherboards being
released you're just not sure I'm not
I've the socket should be the same so
yeah it should work i mean the cabbie
lake cpu should work on a-z 170 and
whatnot it's just they're bringing in
new motherboards I know that already so
they're doing yeah well they did that
with Broadway Lydia with XP I I mean it
would work in an old x99 board but they
brought out new ones because you know
whatever its new yeah and you cpu they
may as well bring out a new boards for
it and people buy the new boards but
fresh boards i should say so i was
thinking that was the case so we're just
going to refresh the z1 70s yeah i know
that well essentially yeah i mean that's
what you're looking here that you're
giving it the title of Z 270 so the
thing is that hide that high boost
frequency of 4.2 gigahertz that does
sort of that is pretty cool because yeah
yeah it is you will get a bill to buy
well that's the thing is it going to be
worth it to get that cheap motherboard
as opposed to the more expensive
motherboard you know aimed at that price
it depends on how well it overclocks on
average you're not i mean yeah so when
you when you throw it when you throw out
a 4.9 how indicative is that of the
general populace you know how indicative
I don't know I'd like 4.9 s man they're
rare I mean I had a what was at the
haswell's fork or 5th 4670k yeah I got
one of those men they went 25 gigahertz
I could get that thing to five kickers
on air and I was just show how because
yeah that was and that was a initial
release I got the golden of golden
samples with that cpu you know d loaded
it what not deleted it did the whole
nine yards on it but it was an amazing
cpu and I remember people just like
Rajon at me my cpu only goes to four
point oh how dare you how dare you have
a cpu that goes to 4.8 and leg whatnot
filing is not my problem i know i mean
why is your one planning man they should
get on board well II like you know what
broadwell a man oh boy there's not much
Headroom they are you at 6,900 case I
mean like you're you're lucky if you can
get I mean I got line to 4.3 yeah that
was that okay that that was it and then
I put it down to 4.2 because it requires
so much an extra voltage data to 4.3 and
4.4 is just impossible see ya I've just
said to 4.2 but um now there's not a lot
of headroom on broad well II which
pollutants surprise a lot of people
because the gaming chips are always the
ones that will go to the moon and the
enthusiasts chips generally don't go as
high but yeah
unless you get a real good one or
something but I yeah I mean what did you
get what Broadwell eat chips did you
overclock I really get 100 da I got CC
on Enrique and uh go two to four point
three gigahertz now this one goes to 4.4
so it's kind of like you're not getting
a lot over 58 20k I mean there's gonna
be people out there like I just got it
because I got the new I got the
motherboard sent him from MSI you know I
mean there then sounds like okay well
got to match it with the CPU wise will
go out and get at 6,800 k the e I
wouldn't have done that had I'd not got
that motherboard you know what i mean so
I I don't recommend if you got a 58 20k
there's no point upgrading to a 6800 k
like absolutely no point at all so you
know one thing that did surprise me
though the the 6800 k out of the box the
performance was really damn good like if
you're one of those guys who does not
like to overclock hates overclocking
everything overclocking in general but
you still you know building a computer
is easy enough then that's when the 6800
k kind of makes a bit of sense because
you start to extract a lot of value out
of that auto staff like old surprises
the sooner bench was like 1150 out of
the box or something and then when i
overclocked it was like only thirteen
hundred and eleven or something so you
can see there's not a big increase as
opposed to 58 20k there was a massive
increase so that's something that i
guess i guess yeah the 6800 cake would
be good to say video editors who just
they know how to build their own
computers they just don't know how to go
into the bars and overclock and all that
so i guess that's the edge it concerned
that's where that and I me yeah and I
mean you you had it didn't was for
people like us Broadway Lee is very
appealing because um coming I mean
looking at the difference between what I
was using before Haswell 4770k at 4.4
gigahertz I'm seeing very little
difference in terms of gaming
performance it's always very very
similar and to what i was getting with
the 4770k it's more that once i start
doing productivity stuff especially my
rendering times when I'm editing videos
it makes a lot of sense then because my
rendering times have been cut in half or
better so for people like us that are
again
is plus you know creators youtubers
we're doing a video editing heavily it
makes sense to have that but if you're
just purely a gamer unless you're doing
something very specific I would say you
just want to step to the k-series gaming
CPUs the enthusiast ones will just it
wouldn't be worth it for you I would
imagine to go up to them so that's what
I I like about it that they're good for
for those people out there and there's a
lot of people out there who do both
productivity stuff and gaming stuff and
they want to CPU that does both
extremely well even then even if you
were a game on even if you were a game
on I would say try and pick up a cheap
5820 k and a cheap x99 board because you
know I've seen x99 boards go you know
low 100's I've seen the 5820 KS go now
for around about 200 or 250 wow you see
that well I mean Joker Joker Joker sold
me his 58 20k for like 250 shipped like
as he when I go out and get the 6800
cows like hell yeah I'll take that off
your hands no problems man so like I'd
like he was like yeah well he was
desperate he just want to get rid of
that's on me pick up a deal go get
yourself a deal if you can just sit
there and know that it's an option I
would recommend it to a game any day of
the week I mean the 5820 k's of beasts
ah you know absolute beast if you cannot
pay too much of a premium it's going to
give you that future proof you know
there's going to be a lot of future
proof out there so really good cpu what
am I probably my favorite of the last
few years from intel would be the 58 20k
easy so yeah I would I would tend to
agree i def actually have to say that
the one I had the most fun with um would
be the like I said the G 3258 the pentam
k as it was called yep I had a lot of
fun with that cpu even though it's
probably not the most practical now back
when it came out probably what was that
like two years ago type thing um that
was a lot of fun and but we they were so
cheap man it companies are just giving
them to everybody all the reviews to go
play with see
seeing everybody going crazy with them
and it was just a lot of fun i really
enjoyed that cpu i just want a random
midstream moment just wanted to say
something random midstream signed up for
the gym again boys you nice bro alright
yeah so yeah i'm gonna go today after we
finish the stream to gonna go to the gym
oh yeah get back on and get back on that
hell yeah i'm going to be a life
derogatory term so I'm gonna be one of
those guys you know you meet those guys
in real life and they're just so pumped
up on life that's what I want to be now
you know what I mean like you just like
see them and they're just life's flowing
out of their body I want to be one of
those guys yeah just i remember back in
Union I'd meet some of these guys that
just step out of the gym you know that b
roll around on campus hey man how you
going I'm like why is this guy so
enthusiastic just I realize he's just
yeah it's just full of life so I want to
be that just pull it yeah juice me yeah
they're so that's what they call it
juicing when you get all pumped on that
depends arguments and everything maybe
if your juice in that way usually you
have those real like and I've seen
people have you know what they call roid
rage or whatever man that's scary yeah
yeah yeah hey whoa no way that stuff at
all costs but we've gotten video in
video with the 1080 TI Tang gigabytes of
a ram this is the latest coming out of
the rumor mill here with the I guess a
screencap of the shipment here so we got
here 384 bits on the memory boss and
then we got a tanker you bunch of GTR I
think yes they don't want to say if it's
5x or five I guess that's out in the air
they don't want to sort of put that
money right out there at the moment but
this is this is kind of like a curve
ball a little bit what are they doing
you know where first of all we're
hearing that it's non 5x you know it's
not 5x now we're hearing that it's okay
it might be 5x but now they're dropping
it down to 320 bits or even they're
using 384-bit I mean if they use 384-bit
I think they're going to have to drop
two of the memory modules down to one
gigabyte it from two gigabytes so it's
going to be really weird but if
I drop it if they drop 64bit memory
controller off there then they can still
get away with just using five to you by
memory controls you know flash banks
instead of six so yeah this is
interesting what they're going to do I
mean there's are so many rumors out
there now where I'm just sort of at the
stage where I'm like just just let it
come out just let it be what it's going
to be now because there's so much stuff
flow now there now but I mean 10
gigabytes again this would make sense as
well looking at this this kind of makes
sense as well they don't want something
that's going to cut sales of Titan X to
drastically you know they don't want
that coming out they don't want to just
you know completely obliterate their
higher echelon card at the same time
they still want something that's in
between and so that's why i thought the
fight that 9x was the perfect solution
because it would put it in that segment
where people would still buy it but
people be like well the 1080 is still a
good buy as opposed to tennis yeah yeah
exactly i'm see where you're coming from
and your approach is extremely logical
when looking at Nvidia's lineup of how
they're going to market their cards in
each segment their cars will fill what
I'm curious about is Vegas influence on
this and given that how much vram Vega
will have um actually how powerful is as
well yeah and I think in video will be
sitting on their hands waiting till
vegas released and then they'll release
the 1080 TI about a month later and it
will probably help do it and yeah the
majority of ways although you know might
not out do it in every way um maybe in
memory wise i would save a go Andy
generally has had higher memory
capacities on the graphics cards if you
look historically than nvidia that just
consistently had basically more than
needed at the time of when it was
released well then they had it they had
then they arguably had an inferior
architecture to with the memory
compression rhyming video had memory
compression so that enabled them to use
a smaller memory bus and whatnot so yeah
there's something that this is something
that's sort of I'm
little bit worried about is either you
know on a 10 ATT I would they nerf the
memory bus that like late the 660 those
you know this article points out here
especially or like the 660 ti right that
thing you know at 1080p it was fine but
if you even stepped it up to 1440p it
started to have a lot of problems or if
you put you know a load on the memory it
started having problems now since the
1080p I is a fork a card like we're
going to make this I'm going to put a
bold statement out that this card is
pretty much a 4k gaming graphics card
you do not want any hindrance on the
memory bus side of things at all so the
moment you start doing that you know the
movie start doing you're gonna have a
lot of problems I don't think nvidia
will do that that's why I thought it was
logical to have you know the pool 384
bits there I don't think they're going
to cut that yeah and I imagine
performance wise it won't be higher than
the time necks um and yeah I think
you're right it'll be definitely for 4k
gaming I just started Gears of War for
and and with my gtx 1080 and i can tell
you from playing it already and playing
with the settings i cannot get away with
4k on ultra in Gears of War for with my
g1 gaming gtx 1080 i'm getting about an
average of i would say it feels like
about 40 ish if i drop it down to hi I'm
getting about 60 to 70 ish so I think
this will be the card that will be like
4k Ultra settings filters max you know
good for type thing and anything Vega
they get the highest in Vega chip will
also be trying to attain okay the same
thing a very high-end super high-end and
type thing too I imagined that that will
be the case there'll be two Vega chips
I'm almost assured there'll be a 49 c
and like a for 90 x or something like
that they'll have something that needs
to go against the 1070 and then they'll
need something to go against the 1080
slashed in a TTI and i would imagine and
he is going to deliver a cut-down vega
to go against the 1070 and a full power
very good to go against oh yeah well
Devon the vagal they should have any way
up but I got one question with the 1080
did you try statically
shocking it you know just charge
yourself up and give it a bit of a shock
that might have given you an FPS Bush
you know she's like I don't think so man
we don't want to whatever Ian 80 well
you never know nowadays everyone's doing
everything apparently if you've got
gaming on the card it gives you extra
AFVs you know so i was thinking away
baby yeah run your socks on the carpet
and give it a bit of a shock and it
might give you a bit more FPS you know
yeah i mean like this is the this is the
most powerful GPU I've behind the most
plain one I've ever got for myself so I
think I don't think it would be ideal to
do something like that but no yeah I
think I think that that will be the case
but historically that has been what ah
NVIDIA has done before so I imagine
there will be there will be lots of
rumours to do with the 1080 TI they'll
probably even ship them out to some
places but they'll make them sit on
their shelves for a while until AMD of
showing the hand and then though release
it and adjust their pricing accordingly
if it's actually tied with Vega in terms
of performance they'll probably just try
undercut aim deal they'll do some other
sort of funny business well speaking of
undercutting they're definitely over
caught it over cutting their stocks I
mean wow they had this massive surge it
was huge so following their earnings
which was was it like two billion or
something there their stock prices just
went over the over the roof so you know
I guess this has got to do with as I've
said before and in the past i said this
ages ago and videos going places why
because their CEO loves the company is
then the founder of nvidia everything
this is his life like when you got
someone leading a company like that
they're gonna want to grow this company
to kingdom come you know he like wakes
up each shits and sleeps and breathes
and video that's what jen dogs when you
see a guy like that leading the helm
he's going to go in not just gaming
graphics cards look at the deep learning
virtual reality everything he's getting
his hands in everything cloud services
driverless cars I mean a video I still
think arguably they have got a long way
to go yet especially if they're going to
delve into new
markets and use their technology to get
gains out of that so they're just in
there in a position where they're just
completely seeing past the eight ball
and the end game and they go on a step
further and then you're saying look this
is what we can use our performance for
let's do it and I think that's coming
out now and stock analyst is sort of
like a we didn't see this coming
and you know you know these guys have a
lot more potential I thing I think these
earnings are starting to untap the
potential of what invidious cards can do
or even that matter what GPU GPU compute
can do you know ah yeah you know so
that's they're starting to utilize that
it's not as they there's this power out
there that exists and it can be utilized
a lot more or a lot faster a lot better
than CPU power again so yes why not use
it you know search it exactly right i
mean they're saying that a lot of the
growth has come from pascal and that is
very true as far as the big jump up goes
Pascal has jumped up a lot but I think
what a lot of people in the community
are missing is in the gaming laptops I
mean Pascal powered gaming laptops are
really impressive on compared to last
generations 970 m and end all that sir I
mean they were saying you know with let
the 1050 TI gaming laptops I mean
they're just taking off they're so
powerful they will you know be 297 TN so
yeah very impressive and I think a lot
of that is down to how good Pascal is
not only for their desktop discrete GPUs
but also for the gaming laptops because
it's made a big wave in the gaming
laptop market and a lot of those
manufacturers are loving the fact that
Pascal is so powerful and game like we
are breaking down the numbers of mean
gaming revenue increased sixty-three
percent holy moly I mean everything just
everything increased I mean they're
cloud platforms and tripled dribbled
yeah you could just see the auto revenue
climb 61 percent they're just doing
they're going above the bar man they're
just really nailing every market they
touch I guess and then they've got that
new deal with the Nintendo switch you
know I was like yep effort how's that
going to fare for them so I think just
you know the green Goblin's really
coming in and he's slaying everything
you know I guess it's spider-man losses
to the Green Goblin this time I don't
know maybe we got to rewrite the
spider-man storyline yeah I don't know
like but on that note you know md's
there as in I just wanted to you know
people like what about AMD stocks
they've climbed tremendously and yes
they have but that's based off I guess
more speculation as opposed to this as
being a reaction with the good yes from
a new do you know people are speculating
that zens gonna kick ass it's gonna
really hit the mark hard shake things up
there on the graphics cards as well
Polaris you know we're waiting on Vega
but people think that that's going to
really shake them out and yes AMD have
grown as well but are they going into
new markets like a video is are they
doing everything and everything like a
video is so I mean ready to be seen how
Nvidia AMD stock prices will go on xen
hits I think that would do well I think
they'll do really well but at the same
time a little bit cautious because again
as I said before it's based off
speculation as opposed to reaction with
nvidia this time around so we've
actually got to see something out of
yeah exactly i think that's I really
want I mean I've only ever run intel
cpus it's not because I'm biased it's
just because every time I've gone to
upgrade at that time until have had the
best CPUs to go for so and I generally
like to stick with high-end you know I 7
yeah um but I always want Andy to do
well and so should you even if you're
the biggest Intel fanboy imaginable I
you want Zen to do well because it's
going to bring down the price of Intel
chips if it's really starting to make
Intel stop having like almost a monopoly
it's going to be good for you because
they'll bring down Intel will cut prices
to make their at cpu is more competitive
and then you the consumer will benefit
we'll be able to go out and buy your new
Intel CPU for cheaper so um I think with
that night events ready but where does
it break down though with that argument
where when does a break down Roman this
is the thing that I've argued in the
past about this you know where does it
stop like you know until have the better
chips out of the moment and so for me
I'm going to be recommending my friends
get in tell you know like I can say here
and say yeah guys we go to support AMD
on this CPUs go out and buy an FX 6300
but I wouldn't do that to my friends you
sort of me so now at the same time where
does that sort of think okay I don't
know you I don't care about you go buy
an FX 6300 keep am dear life that's not
what I'm about around my channel so
that's kind of like no no I'm not saying
that it's yeah i know i'm not saying
that but what do we get to where do we
come to a ground with this Oh guys we
got to support the competitor even
though they got the inferior product at
the moment like I'm this especially on
the GPU on the GPU side of things is
coming a different kettle of fish I got
to admit the artist for 80 in the RX 470
are really good cars and especially with
what AMD Nvidia is doing with the
software at the moment like their
geforce crap experience that things just
terrible at the moment you know md's
definitely going to see a lot more sales
there but one the cpu side of things
right I just can't recommend an fx cpu
to anyone at the moment you know it's
nice and for sure you're 100 missing
correct and I I I would never recommend
an inferior product my thing is always
what's best comes first and then brand
doesn't even really come into it so much
for me but the thing is it was in its in
is going to be good for probably
specific users and in that case I
wouldn't use blanket statements to go
ahead by auntie to support MD but say if
zing comes out and it's battling against
Broadwell e which their highest ends in
looks like it's going to be trying to
hit say the 6900 k 6800 k and it's doing
it at a significantly lower price and
you still get all the benefits of the
chipset on the a.m 4 + x would say to a
lot of people hey maybe consider this
look into that and it's a if the product
is better or at least on even ground um
then i would tell people maybe to take a
look into it but that's the thing right
now we're just saying this is what could
happen but we really need to see but I
I really hope that AMD don't overhype it
I really really hope that and i hope the
community also doesn't over hoping to
say like look like you were so stupid
getting a broad well a cpu i'm going to
get us in for like a quarter the price
and it's going to like blow your 6900 k
out of the water and then it comes out
and everyone gets disappointed let's
keep it realistic let's go off what
they're saying let's hope Andy does it
the same and let's hope Zen comes out
and it is does hit a lot of those
markets not just the very high end which
I think md really shouldn't be aiming it
I think they should try gets the i-5
crowd and go go hit that market
coalition they should hit every penny
they should had every but if there's one
they hit the hardest I would say it's
that because they already dominate the
very sort of i would say very line but
you know the entry the apu market is
they've got that very much for
themselves so now they need something in
the midst here and the high tier two
really arm set them off but the thing is
like with AMD i gotta say this straight
up and i never sugarcoat anything but us
to show that showed up again you know
let's just get it up there like look the
bottom line is if aimed is making the
inferior product i'm going to be
recommending the better product so if at
the time as n comes out as crap at zen
comes out in this crap of course i'm
gonna be buying i'm going to be testing
it but if it comes out as crap i'm just
gonna say go by and tell because i just
that's what I just call how fine you
know and where do you draw that's the
thing where you drawn the light if
they're really close and this is the
only scenario where I would be
recommending it over the other if they
were really close i'd say hey guys go
support the underdog because we need
them and they're only a little bit
behind that's the only time i would
support them but if they're making crap
products then you know it's straight up
you know if they're going to make crap
products that i wouldn't support them
you know and yeah at the same time you
know you're like you're saying you know
go go sup like they've got to hit the
mid round with the i5s and stuff but
historically it's always been those
enthusiasts processes that have really
made the company's a lot of box you know
back when AMD was profitable they were
selling those $1,000 cpus i remember
or selling those flagship FXR CPUs they
were making a lot of bucks people were
buying them over and tells flagship
that's where md made their money and
they know this so i would say if if they
want to be top dog if they want to start
being profitable again they've got to
start making the better product end of
story you know not just you know just
not just the one that comes close to
competing they can't trail the market
anymore they have to lead now so I said
if we go back on all this is like a
repeating you know broken record that
just repeats itself they need to get
cash in for rd they need to start up in
their game for rd and coming back into
the market and hitting hard it's the
only path of them or just sell the
company to more capable hands you know
yeah so the same thing that's why I know
for that I yeah yeah it could happen in
the future but I mean judging by who
designed as n as well it does bode well
for them but I'm yet yeah I think it'll
be very interesting but yeah it'll be
something to talk about more in the
future when we have some more details to
go off because right now we have very
very little to go off yeah that's true
that is true and we got here on that
note we got a cannon lake like you take
a V Lake hasn't even been released yet
we're pumping up 300 series motherboards
cannon lake CPUs now the thing about
Deanna lake is it's going to be the node
shrink this time around so you know I
think from what we've heard cabbie Lakes
gonna give us no I pc gains basically
and cannon like with the node shrink is
going to give us no gains again so just
so like we're looks like we're looking
at no gains for like another year and
half so yeah of zen-like agains and then
has the perfect opportunity to come here
and shake things up like really shake
things up so you know do we want to go
into the details of cannon like I mean I
didn't even really want to bother as 10
nanometer sencha Lee the same skews as
cabbie like he said is going to have you
know tena it's gonna be on 1000 meter so
yeah out of that now I'm just not
looking forward to it at all I don't hit
laptops before it hits desktops of
course due to yields um yeah it seems
like he runs skipping over coffee lake
as well which will be I hang out in bit
k be like and I'm like latte chocolate
caramel fusion lake yeah good come on
until they gotta get more creative I
want to see coffee fusion camera latte
like it's like it's like AMD with the
radio and i should say naming all the
GPUs after on volcanic islands and that
so um that's been going on so eventually
that'll and just keep keep going and
going but be you know I'm it should be
interesting that they do really need to
get I had that they've got to give more
reason for people to upgrade professor
right now even with kb like it's looking
like there's it's gonna be a hard sell
for their marketing department well but
as a joke from Wendell though the
current microarchitecture is done like
that's where windle's the news saying
last week is really good at that insight
on loss last week's episode but do you
want to get on some good news sure huh
infinite warfare sales are like down
like half about a black ops 3 fantastic
news like you know to be honest I've
been over the cod series like yeah they
just keep rehashing the same old crappy
Angeles and you know like and just time
around I just said I'm not buying it
this time you know I love my car I lied
I've been a big fan of cod I love just
jumping into a game stuff ragging team
deathmatch whatever it's just jumping in
there as such a good picker and I said
this in the past such a good pickup game
if you got 20 minutes to spare you can
just jump in your straight away in a
game uses fragging like it's really good
you know what you can do in Carden I
like the style you know twit shooter but
it's just the same crap they just keep
rehashing it with this new broken engine
and it's like please give us something
entirely new we're all waiting they've
got they've got the money to do it they
just you know they've got the money to
do it they just don't want to it's all
that profits and this is a big you know
this is I think this should be news to
them to say hey we're sick of it you
know we're getting rehash the same crap
you've got the money if we're gonna pay
good money for this game give us
something good instead of giving us
something that's just rehashed sure the
storyline might be amazing and whatnot I
don't really care i'll wait till it
comes down in price
then I'll check the story out you know
ya know the pricing is ridiculous that
just over price their gains for so long
well it's just they have not done
anything they just keep reusing the same
crappy anjiri using it yeah so I think
they're get it I think another reason
why is battlefield of one has done
probably a lot better than a lot of
people expected it to do especially me i
was really unsure of having a world war
one game and given that world war one is
sort of quite a difficult one to do but
um will make entertaining anyways
because in real life it was just trench
warfare the whole time so because
they've made it pretty good but and i
played battlefield one a decent bit and
I do I I like it in some ways I dislike
it another and others I would say it has
some of the best audio of a shooter game
that I've ever played like the
explosions the gunshots just everything
the the atmosphere creates is extremely
good and I think that's one part that
people tend to overlook when they check
it out but um yeah it's it's a quite a
good one so I think that maybe that will
make the you know the next Call of Duty
there'll be changes because of that
bursts they might end up just doing the
same thing oh yeah probably the next at
least the next year probably the same
thing unfortunately because it takes a
while to revamp the whole thing that
this should be news to them that hey if
you want to start bringing releasing
these games then start rehashing I mean
I haven't got console sales up which I
say would be their best selling markets
by far I wonder how console sales are
doing but at least you know like black
or buy black ops 3 launch sales was six
hundred and thirty-five thousand time
versus time infinite warfare was that
for the same time frame 328 thousand
yeah so you gotta see how many less and
you know the gaming market is a market
that's actually growing it's one of the
few markets that is growing in pcs and
you know technology mmm so you know this
would be doing actually worse that 48.4
percent drop because of the you know
because
more people out there buying games
arguably so yeah yeah good on use a cod
series yeah stop rehashing crap I guess
that's just the message that comes out
of this just stop rehash in the crap you
know and speaking of this so we got
Dishonored 2 and it's running poorly on
PC so you know they're using the old id
Tech 5 engine apparently that's got some
of the reason to do with it but at the
same time it's running a lot better on
in video gravis cards a lot way better
way way better so I'm ready ash so that
may be a glue at ten-fifty TI it's
almost matching like the RX 47 which it
shouldn't be yeah exactly edible what
I'm looking at is the 480 versus the
1060 well that's that's actually not too
bad like they aren't you know the rs4
6480 is a good card like look at it go
man it's actually hammer in those
benchmarks I think a oh it's doing
alright I'm just being black comparison
um I would have liked to see it may be a
little bit closer than that but I mean
you see the high-end ones that's in
sydney in the 1080 just absolutely take
off yeah that's it I mean but yeah those
cards are kind of like 1080p cards kind
of thing like so you want your 470 you
know look at 1080p vs 1050 GI it's sort
of it's it's a hand actually you know
the RX 470 is a nice card and it's a
head by a giftable margin but we look at
the RS 460 down there poor little guy
you she's struggling strong yeah that's
not even yeah he's struggling poor
little guy thinks gonna be there yeah
but but yeah this will probably be
something that'll be fixed with drivers
in the future on the AMD side i would
say particularly there'll be good
optimizations yeah but i mean the games
like the games poorly optimized in
sensor you can't even get h bao anh on
AMD cards which in the past you have
been able to sort of feature has been
enabled but yeah it's kind of like it
makes me wonder you know why they're
releasing these games and you know the
sort of bug you to begin with like
that's where you have a beta testing
phase you know and if it's not ready for
release and just hold it back why
release games like mafia 3 for example
it just had such negative reviews when
it came out as like as this game just
run
they complete ass I can't recommend you
buy it as you just just hold the game
back for a few months I mean yeah gaming
nowadays it's just so profit driven and
that's the problem rather than releasing
wanting to release a really polished
product which back in the day a lot of
game developers did then now the game
developers unfortunately are forced to
push these games out due to the company
the overhead you know saying you have to
push this game out after we got profit
to go profit deadlines whatnot and it
says turning into a big business where
you're getting this as a result you're
just getting gains at a sloppy yeah
exactly do you want to mention the Mafia
3 update yeah so we got a mafia 3 update
and you know that's not looking too good
it's still not looking good but
apparently there's some performance
fixes I haven't actually tried these but
you know people have got mafia 3 and
they're like it just ran like ass I
haven't played it then this update may
improve that experience so you might
want to go back and update the game and
see if it still works there's also some
big news on the Facebook thing as well I
forgot to bring that up the Facebook
launching their own games platform now
yeah so do we want to go to QA will go
to Q&amp;amp;A now we had a Q&amp;amp;A we also tech a
cab showdown tax showdown is holding a
giveaway as well so i'll put the link in
the description once the videos up in
the archive and you head over there and
you get this whole list of steel series
gear to give away siberia 350 headset
apex and 500 keyboard rival 300 mouse a
quick Dex mousepad as well so and
there's also some goals in there pretty
cool goals Oh keV do you want to talk
about the goals yeah yeah so I just
checked it in a check for you guys but
so what's going to happen is it's
because it involves obviously my channel
Brian's and playtech TV what we're doing
is once we reach a certain amount of
entries you'll be getting different
video rewards so once we get over a
thousand entries Greg from playtech TV
will do a video where he's going to take
an older cpu or GPU whatever he can get
his hands on and then he's going to try
blow that thing up like make it so
pretty million catch fire first is going
to be trying to do it straight through
software when that does
work which would probably won't he'll do
physical things like taking heat sinks
off while going and torture tests and
other things so he's going to try blow
that up for you guys ah then at five
thousand entries once we get 5,000
people and I will do a video where I'm
going to shave my beard off and also
probably get a like a number to haircut
or something so my head actually drying
levels that's it patek City cut I see I
thought that would be that would be
funny because a lot of you guys have
been telling me I should do something
like that and then at 10,000 entries ah
brian is going to be going out and doing
a public unboxing so once we get over
there Brian will be going out and doing
an unboxing at a cafe or a mall or
something with whatever product he has
so you guys really want to get it right
over 10,000 entries because that was
yeah then you get to see all three and
also we're going to be doing random spot
prizes so even if you enter and you know
you might not win the big steel series
with like full peripheral set but you
may win our spot price as we go along
which will be quite cool and we're going
to begin giving out a few of those so
someone said for you to clean up the
hipster look my VA the tech city card
might be the best way you know sir so
yeah we'll go to QA we'll head over to
Q&amp;amp;A now and I'll actually pull up this
facebook games platform thing but as the
last yeah sort of yes so unity and
Facebook team up to support game
developers now let's get something I
mean this is just yeah it's in the early
works but apparently this has been in
this has been out for a while so it's
not it's not really um it's not really
new users ver just coming into effect
now I think so it's been sort of hot
around their tech community at the
moment of what do we got here so i'll
try and paste this in we get this up so
is only Q&amp;amp;A is what would bring in QA as
well bringing the questions yes I'm
you're watching you watch the questions
I'll start talking about this so
essentially now with Facebook right
with Facebook they want to come in and
do what's teams doing the problem is
Facebook's renowned for just taking data
mining and whatnot and taking it to
another level so I think that's I made
me as an enthusiast I am really weary
about this because you know I don't want
to plan a Facebook freaking platform
because they'll just be ads popping up
everywhere that should be data mining me
to crap so you know really not a
negative before we even do any research
and go into the topic I'd be like no
thank you facebook I mean hey steam can
take a little bit of information here
and there but me and steam have already
built up this trust you know based
relationship and it works you know it's
just to add to one of the questions
someone said as they cover a worldwide
yes to this so yeah there for you guys
yeah you guys want to get on board
someone also us what keyboards we are
using I am using my old trusty razer
blackwidow from this this is the
old-style one the which still features
cherry MX blues which are my favorites
which if you are aware i'm a big fan of
cheery makes such as and the blues my
favorite how about you Brian what are
you rocking yeah i got this side this is
my travel keyboard the philco pick it up
three dollars that's what I love about
it's three bucks pick this thing up for
three bucks so that you know the only
thing wrong with it I think is the tab
key doesn't work yeah the tab key so I
was like never use the tab key accepting
counter straighten that was funny
because I only discovered that when i
was playing CS go on and I'm like trying
to check the scoreboard and I'm like hey
this tab key doesn't work I guess I
guess someone else was a CS go play and
you can change that you just change the
hot key to something else so I just
changed it to caps lock absolutely fine
so but at the moment my main keyboard
i'm using the azio is I can't really
pick it up because it's got um I drilled
a hole through the desk at school cable
managed and stuff but see as your RGB I
really love the back plate and the way
the keyboard is design it's got blue
switches of course you know i'm a big
blue fanboy I've said it for a long time
massive blue fan
it's got blues on it it's amazing
keyboard RGB backlit and I was just
shocked because this is just like when i
first tried it I just fell in love with
the keyboard now I do arguably I want to
try the top Bray capacitors as well I've
tried them before and I love those
switches as well that's something I've
got my eyes on at the moment is the top
r a capacitor so if you tried them the
thing is the Coulomb asked the Nova
features them hmm I don't think so ah no
I don't think I have okay yeah well you
got to go and try because they're
amazing yeah I've just been i've been a
bit behind really with all my sort of
peripheral stuff I'm just sort of
getting because it's just been a GPU
sort of crazy season so yep um I mean
getting through all that but uh no I
haven't quite yet just reading through
so yeah cross-platform facebook at home
and I'm not really looking forward to
anything out of face now I mean yeah if
you play bejeweled it's fine like
bejeweled fine that was actually a
pretty fun game you can pick up on a web
browser but when we come to serious gay
if they're talking serious gaming I'm
just going to stick with the platform's
you know in origin arguably origins
gotten really good over the last year
especially so you know the origins steam
work pretty well for me you know that's
what I use at the moment so I guess so
also green hand gaming as well we have
we've been talking a lot off in off cam
and whatnot up in twitter and skype and
stuff like that we're going to make
something happen around christmas time
should be around Christmas so we're
going to make a collab it's going to be
absolutely off the chain it's gonna be
yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be crazy
so looking forward to doing that with
the viewers and the fans as well so
they've been requesting it for so damn
long as like you know you got to do a
collab with green game you gotta go to
collab it like yeah sure you know so
I've been speaking to him for a little
bit and it's really really cool guy
really nice guy that's why I like to do
I like to work with nice people and
awesome people from here on in like you
know especially off at recent things
that happen I just want to work with
awesome people regardless you know
regardless of if their contents not as
good as person X or whatnot I don't
really give a it's like I just want
to work with good people now and a story
so yeah and you know I I would say the
contents better so yeah man we got a
question here for you Brian how much do
you bench ah bench press man I'd like I
got like I got done with arm benching
hard like doing heavy weights because I
like now the moment I do you know 30 kg
like you know just basically barbell and
you know yeah 15k on one arm and stuff
like that I just do like pretty much a
lot more reps now because yeah like I
don't want to tear attendance you know
it's the worst thing if you go so hard
you're just going to tear tendance and
it's a pain in the ass like yeah you put
too much strain on your body and said
like now I just been getting to the
rhythm where I do cardio two times a
week or and then I go and do you know
weights the other two days a week so no
gym four days a week and i'm really
loving it you know so that's just my
regiment at the moment so yeah now that
makes sense man I think that when I was
gyming hard out before I was going to
try out for the army um all I was doing
was just endurance men low lower weight
and just heaps of reps so just you know
like five kg dumbbells and just do heaps
of curls and stuff like that hit that
rowing machine heart out and do stuff
like that be I would see guys man at the
gym this is you'll get a kick out of
this guys at the gym that would come in
go you know over to the bench and then
they just bench some huge amount and
then that would be it man just bench
about you know a few times get up man
and then we just walk straight out you
know look like a boss you know yeah
you're that doing giving up on that look
and then and then yeah and then they
would just leave we're always I would
stay for a good you know our two and
just do heaps of you know high reps no
wait i mean i can do is i can do three
reps of 1050 oh yeah it's it's our I
it's not like the best but again needs
to see a like afterwards you know you it
takes a toll man yeah you know I want to
keep my shoulders in good Nick as well
so yes I'm just reading the comments we
got some comments um a little be gone
when we got so sit here to stay
Christian it I just one thing I just
want to answer wait
you have to try out for the army art was
for the reserves you have a they have
physical like requirements you have to
be able to run a certain amount you have
to be able to things like that you know
do you have to meet the requirements
that someone someone said can you knock
me out with your GPUs like you come over
here will test the broken 7970 that'll
be the first one if that doesn't knock
you out we got the strict sium and this
thing's got some way behind it or the
arctic cooler so we can test either all
that's what I guess that's what the back
plate was designed for now back leg was
designed by knocking out knocking out
your viewers who I request you to knock
them out on your stream so come over
come over and get a nice hefty back
plate to the face ah we got a few few
others why did what how kind of comments
that I say what do I know about the
giant phobia radiator 44 x 200
millimeter fans for 60 euro I mean if it
works if it works well the results are
out there and it shows to make a
difference and it's quiet and it's got
everything you need then arm yeah go for
a day I mean everything in Europe's a
little bit more expensive otherwise in
other places in the world so 60 euro
might be a good deal too so but honestly
I mean like a lot of these radiators
like I've got a 360 mill radiator as
well it's overkill I mean and you know
the best thing is to balance if you got
a water cooling setup the best thing is
to balance it so you know have a good
block have a good pump and maybe have a
240 ml rad with two good fans on there
so I rank and see us go at the moment
I'm the one above silver elite at the
moment I just got into that note I think
it's no overall what it I don't know
they're these I got the one star there
so I'm on the level above silver elite
now so I'm feeling pretty good at the
moment oh yeah so someone that someone
said a crunchy or creamy peanut butter
crunchy for me what about you right uh
creamy yeah I'm a big fan of cream and
whenever I go get a coffee from a place
i'll be layered chuck cream on top
now the peanut butter you know you
there's two types at the supermarket you
have the crunchy one which is lots of
less the rougher and then you have the
smooth one which is like your butter or
yeah I did the bottom a jury yeah ah but
I won by a oh yeah creamy bro creamy
creamy all the way here someone else
said Kevin have you heard about the
social network for gamers and tech
enthusiasts called gaming tribe maybe
you want to check that up Oh like a I've
heard of that but yeah I just haven't
yeah i mean i've been asked for a while
I just always been on the back of my
mind unfortunately I shall take a look
into that over the next week we're to
talk about that yeah because I'm Oh a
few people have asked me for a while and
I've kind of like been lazy and you know
for that like yeah I'll check it out
I'll check it out I was like oh I want
to get on to building this computer so
yeah that's the truth there so i will
check that out gaming tribe yeah I've
actually get look really nice people
have asked me to join and stuff so yeah
now let's go we got another one here is
a zoo protoss or Terrance so when I was
playing starcraft two heavily I was a
diamond league Protoss player and then I
switched to zerg and then I got up to
the top of platinum but I never got into
diamond as zerg but yeah so that's
that's how I did dude did you ever play
a starcraft 2 a stuck-up one gameplay
both thought broodwar man i play that
religiously i was like i went to wcg
back in two thousand men back before
they did the pre they had the first one
yeah so you know I got flown over to
Sydney and stuff I was a Protoss and
taryn it depended on who my opponent was
because I Terran you note and it's funny
because in the original brood war
Teheran ended up being good against
protoss i love that matchup TVP um and I
liked pvz with psystorm and so I ended
up playing those two races and then
starcraft 2 came out it was just a
different feel man it like it just felt
different the game felt different how so
much better to me that around small to
me I was more of a macro
and in starcraft 2 you make one mistake
you're gone like is it's on ya starcraft
2 is a lot unforgiving as opposed to
starcraft broodwar it's a lot more
unforgiving you make one mistake you
gone you know and i think like start up
the original brood war you make a
mistake whatever it is you know you send
a couple of vultures in they die you're
still in the game that's what that's
what I'm prettiest grab a starcraft 2
was just unforgiving and you lose one
battle you've got to be on point the
whole time and it's way more micro
intensive in my opinion like raw food
wherever was so it's kind of like yeah
like I don't like that aspect of it but
same time I still are the same i play
terran protoss depends i'm not a big hug
player I love playing Protoss a Terran
and got it so next tech pick up next
tech up be cases I actually picked up a
few cases back here I've got to Tessa
Raptors I didn't build a heber pcs so
there will be a few more pc builds
coming got this Panther stuff here
through a pace it's actually pretty good
stuff you know 3d gear gigahertz memory
ddr4 memory so you're stuck there going
to review that and other tech like the
next technically other really look
forward to him won't know i don't know
maybe i'll keep that a secret keep that
a secret so okay there can be a secret
for now someone said is it worth
spending extra sixty dollars for the i5
6500 k over the 6400 k what do you think
the was to say that again the the is it
worth spending the extra sixty dollars
for the i5 6500 k over the 6400 k i
would probably say are the 21 6400 k
what is what cpu were talking about
there there little I fives from there's
no there's only one k Varian isn't that
and I'm not the case I mean I'm sorry I
said that wrong just a normal 65 are
absurd yeah I've got it now yes sorry
sir ah no wouldn't be that's huge if
they're both high fives that's a huge
difference there i wouldn't spend the
extra 60 box on that i just save you
money yeah for sure son also said did
you guys both go to the University yet I
went to
unitech the bachelors and engineering so
specializing in automotive how about you
Brian to do you yeah went to whether my
local griffith university is funny
because I high school man i bombed out
like I just got into University under an
IT degree and I thought yeah i started
doing programming and i hated
programming man it was like as like as I
love gaming I was like oh you know I'm
naturally going to love programming and
no they did two different completely
different things like gaming and
programming man yeah yeah so like anyway
I found out this is the way you do it
but I don't know nowadays if you can do
it but back when I was at university you
could um you could take on a different
course and get credits for that and then
just switch it over like say for
instance souls in an IT degree starting
business and then after six months it
just boost my ratings up and then I was
just legitimately able to transfer my
degree and then bring those courses that
I'd previously did from the IT degree
and get credit for him in my new degree
so I was just like it was like hey high
school didn't even mattered so I was
actually in hindsight I was glad I did
all the partying you know rocked up till
the exams after all nighters at high
school because it didn't matter in
hindsight because I still got away with
it so and then you know in university I
ended up jumping up into the top five
percent of students in the last year so
I was really stoked about that because
you know university is like I want to be
here I want to study this you know in
high school I'm starting all this crap
doesn't even pertain to my you know what
I want to do so ignored half of it so
yeah it's awesome and so that's how you
do you neyo guess just a wing right wing
high school and then when you get into
University try really hard that's my
advice to you guys sir plus you know
plus high school incorporates a lot of
bias as well even university to a degree
right even university if the teacher
does like in high school or in high
school sorry in high school the teacher
doesn't like you you're gonna get a bad
score regardless I had proof of this my
sister was a journalist like she you
know she was working at a newspaper
company
I was in year 12 and we were like shits
and giggles because like from my english
essay i didn't try it all and i still
got to see and then the next time i
tried really hard man like did my yards
got like a sea again so my sister my
sister I just said to my sister Jay this
is a joke you know can you write me up a
whole article she wrote it up the whole
thing just head to toe man and I got a
b-minus and like yeah we just love like
I showed it to other people in the
classroom and they just laugh they're
like dude I can't even barely read this
it's like that good like because they
know all the words and stuff and all the
terms and it was like my mom went into
the teacher interviews and pulled her up
on it and yeah she just admitted like
she barely even read through it she read
the first like paragraph then just gave
me a b-minus loss lands disgusting him
because least she fessed up otherwise
believe it's just in a general it's
thats how it is high school Hilda you
know you need to take it somewhat
seriously but goodbye by comparison to
uni and that's what you do but but you
need just the environments better
everyone takes it way more seriously
it's more fun the people you meet there
you know you're usually a great great
people that you do with and see there's
that said it was really good so are you
will take a few more questions guys and
then round out the show just whatever
any other questions you guys have left
now I got a question for you get Brian
what's the what cpu or GPU are you most
looking forward to that's coming out
well it should be coming out in the next
I 12 months from now we go yeah easily
easily Vega and then I'm really looking
forward to both those Zen probably the
most the most thing I'm really looking
forward to Zen out of anything yes you
need to menu platform new platform
completely new architecture from AMD
it's going to be exciting right that's
something that everyone's looking out
for myself that's probably the most hype
thing i'm looking now for Vega as well
the high-end AMD cards I'm really
looking forward to that too you know
like really looking forward to it so
hopefully that comes out and it's really
good so yes they're the two three how
about yourself how
yourself I would say is in probably I'm
more curious to do with Zen but in terms
of what I'll actually test it will be
vaguer there's probably the one I most
look I'll put it this way i'm looking
forward to vega the most in terms of
making a video review about Vega but i'm
looking forward to zen the most just
because i have much more curiosity to do
is then you know to do with you how
powerful it's going to be everything
else so I think I'm probably most
they're probably even into in terms of
what I'm most looking forward to i would
say probably what I'm least looking
forward to out of all the main sort of
hype think's going on right now would be
key be lake is just i know i think i'm
glad they are really excited for it
honestly I'm I mean it's still cool you
know and i'll check it out for sure on
my channel but I just I mean how you
really super psyched for it or am I am I
alone in this are you super psyched I'm
not super psyched but I'll be excited
for any new tech handing you just
anything new oh yeah well I mean eating
should be honest me just me just getting
a new cpu in and overclocking it is
exciting because it's a different cpu to
the one that i previously overclocked so
yeah I mean that's in itself as fun so
you know are people in the comments yeah
2500 k in the 2600 k there they're two
of the best CPUs out there ever like
those two CPUs were just phenomenal you
know 2500 k was just the cpu when it
came out and still is amazing cpu you
know people get number 4.6 4.8 they're
just incredible super use the Sandy
Bridge overclockers they're still
relevant to this day to sodium yeah yeah
exactly yeah it was not why did it down
start one down the show unless there's
any pressing concerns from you guys in
the comments one concern was where was t
and he's right here so you guys know
chill out yeah sir Brian what would make
this the last question ah Brian what's
the difference between the e 50 for 50
and the X 54 oh okay yeah they're the
arm they're the LGA 771 right there the
two variants now one has a higher
multiply that's the x
for 60 but it uses it has a higher power
rating so people say that the e 50 for
50 is you know 80 watts I think it's 80
watts versus 120 watts gdp by that i
mean real world you'd have to get the
power meter out and test both these cpus
to see how much real world power
consumption of it or how much of a
difference there is ah but people say
you know because the EV 5450 has that
low power draw it's much better for
overclocking that's valid but it still
has the low multiplier and you still
have to you know hammer up the
motherboards northbridge more so to get
a better overclocked out of the e 50 for
50 so they're both good CPUs I mean if
you've got a really powerful motherboard
I'd probably go with the year 5450 you
know what I mean if you got a really
really powerful motherboard there with a
really good cooling on the Northbridge
and whatnot I'd probably go 350 450 you
know you can overclock it to you know
kingdom come I mean it'd be you're still
going to be bound by that silicon
lottery how high can those four cores go
the X 5460 just has that higher
multiplier so for me personally it's a
lot easier to work with with cheaper
memory yeah on the ddr2 side of things
so it's up to you guys I mean yet
they're both good CPUs I could recommend
them highly recommend both of them I
think you can pick them up both of them
for like twenty bucks at the moment so
that's the difference one's got a little
bit of a low multiplier and adds got
better power drawer and then the others
got the higher multiplier but it you
know draws more power so yeah there you
have it so it's up to you which way you
want to go you know me spending time
with both I would know actually haven't
I don't know if I've got a new 50 for 50
year but I'd hazard a guess that you
know depends on your motherboard if you
got a weak motherboard I'd go at the X
5460 because you know drop drop it up a
little bit get the most out you can out
of it and you know there's those caps
and chokes and MOSFETs they're generally
designed to you know put out a lot of
power before they blow so just depends
yeah but oh yeah maybe maybe the e 50
for 50 is the better pick up hmm I got
to try that we're going to get one in
and maybe compare them cuz yeah yeah
that'd be interesting yeah i think i
love you would like that I see you guys
that skinny run out the show it seems
like
I put the link there again in the
lecture for you to enter the go away
don't miss out guys you could get
yourself a full set of peripherals great
steelseries peripherals these are all
ones that I recommend as well we're not
giving you bad stuff this is good stuff
that you're going to be getting so
you're definitely going to want to
intern there because I mean why not man
I mean you know why wouldn't you it
doesn't cost you anything you might get
yourself a full set of peripherals that
works out pretty nicely yeah i c'n and
thanks for tuning in everyone thanks for
tuning in today and really cool stream
awesome and we'll see you guys in next
week and hopefully it'll be a special
guest on maybe I'll see a special guests
will check as it comes we'll check it
out and get it going yeah yeah thanks
for tuning in y'all and we'll catch in
the next one see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
