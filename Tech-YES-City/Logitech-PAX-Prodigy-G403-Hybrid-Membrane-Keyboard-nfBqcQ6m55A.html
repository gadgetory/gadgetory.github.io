PAX west and I'm joined by andrew how
are you I'm doing very well how are you
man very good lovin the event so far and
I've noticed that logitech have just
released some new products here do you
want to talk a little bit about these to
the audience I would love to so thank
you for asking by the way I know there's
a lot of cool stuff out there but you
know obviously a Logitech G we're always
making great new products and actually
just a few nights ago we unveiled the
brand new series called prodigy prodigy
consists of mouse keyboard and headset
and the mouse comes in two different
versions that's what we're looking at
here on the products you getting a 403
wireless and wired gaming mice the
successor to the g 402 on not really
actually they're different shapes but
the numbers are similar so prodigy is
all about giving uncomplicated
performance to gamers that don't need
all the extra crazy features that you
know like 11 buttons and five different
weights and all that extra stuff so it's
all about uncomplicated performance just
bringing our best technologies to
something simple and easy to use so I've
been actually a big fan of logitech
gaming minds for a wall this one
actually on the left here as sparked my
interest a lot this is the Logitech G
pro gaming mouse now I'd say the weight
83 grams that's looking like a g3
successor from the olden days you know
it's it's very similar it's basically
the mx300 shape which was translated
into the the g 100 then g 100 s so it's
a classic shape it's ambidextrous
everyone everyone is very used to this
form factor in shape but really what the
story about this product is we work
directly with our eSports partners and a
lot of our direct pros to create the
exact combination of features this mouse
has so that means it's got a mechanical
scroll wheel which is a very particular
feel that a lot of our eSports pros
wanted it uses our best sensor on the
market the PMW 3366 as well as what they
call the good buttons which are
basically you know it's our advanced
spring tensioning buttons from
which were originally released with the
G 303 Devils apex so that was a G 302 as
well had the spring tinge yeah exactly
so very similar mouse there on those two
but yeah so the Logitech G Pro mouse is
really just very simple and
straightforward professional product for
people who want the best features in the
same boat there because I did a test on
the G 302 very impressive figures with
the response times there with a thousand
FPS camera i mean this mouse was pretty
much up on top so is that something you
guys strive for a logitech to get the
most responsive mouse not only one that
feels good in the hand in performance
and whatnot but also one that will give
you the lowest sort of input lag if we
were to talk about those figures yeah so
I mean I look at it a little differently
I think I mean input lag is an
interesting term right because that can
mean that could be interpreted in
different ways but what we look for is
efficiency and getting getting anything
out of the way between your input and
the pc obviously getting that latency
down to the low as possible and we're by
far we're by far the fastest combination
of sensor MCU USB output on the market i
mean our wireless mice are two and a
half times faster than the competition's
leading wired mice so if that gives you
any indication of how fast this product
is the father thousand FPS camera
doesn't lie ladies and gentlemen so
those mouths are actually gonna when are
they officially going to hit the market
so I believe September first they're
available don't quote me on that but
there they'll be available very soon to
buy online and I think you can actually
pre-order on logitech gaming logitech
com but yeah check that out logitech com
and for more information on those
products so that's what the myself we're
gonna move on out of the keyboards in
the headsets which is also got some new
products coming out over there so we'll
move over to that and talk a little bit
about that what the Andrew more take a
look at their new keyboard here you guys
are releasing this at 69 99 is it that's
correct yeah this is the brand new g 2
13 prodigy gaming keyboard and what's
great about this keyboard is it provides
a huge performance benefit to you know
that regular old HP or dell keyboard
that you've been using for a long time
you know and first build a pc or like
you do a build you know you spend a
bunch of money and you get everything up
and running and then all sudden you
realize that you forgot to get
peripherals yeah so we want to be able
to offer a great a great performing
technology
peace with the 213 gate prodigy keyboard
excuse me and what that means is you get
the you know 500 polling rate which is a
benefit over a regular standard keyboard
you get great feelings response time
from the keys as well as all the
programmability RGB lighting that kind
of stuff you'd expect from Logitech so
one thing I noticed was it did have the
RGB lighting be also going with an
in-house membrane switch here that
actually when i was typing on it before
felt really good you've got the feedback
there though you eliminating the noise
so i mean even though those memories are
cheaper to produce then cherry MX
switches or whatnot the mechanical
switches or even the in-house logitech
switches you do have that benefit of
that reduced noise yeah that's
absolutely accurate yeah and like you
said we basically took the rubber toe
membrane technology and we updated it to
make a little more modern so has a four
millimeter actuation distance and 50
gram actuation force which is very
similar to a lot of other products on
the market so I think like you said you
know a lot of people are going to feel
this and feel right at home so it's
actually surprised when I saw the typing
on it really love to fill this keyboard
absolute when I think they've got a very
nice look here as well the simple satin
black plain look there on the front then
you got the matte black on the keys
which it looks like that and then the
text is very simple and you've got the
RGB g logo there on the top left so
definitely digging these products from
logitech and you've also got a new
headset here yeah let's see g 231 that's
correct yeah so the g 231 prodigy gaming
headset is awesome it's very simple it's
the iconic gaming headset you know we've
done a lot of research and we find that
with almost all gear that you actually
put your hands on and use on a
day-to-day basis comfort is of them the
most important thing basically so we
wanted to make a comfortable lightweight
durable headset it's got removable
washable ear pads it sounds great it's
got a full frequency microphone for
broadcasting or streaming or anything
like that as well as having a four-post
cable so it's compatible with consoles
as well as pc which is awesome so not
only a logitech providing competitive
gamers with products they're also
providing the market with competitive
prices from what i see so expect these
things to be a hit availability we're
talking September for a lot of these
products so just this month hitting the
market not too sure about us pricing and
release dates just yet but I will keep
you guys updated on that in the near
future so I'd like to thank Andrew big
