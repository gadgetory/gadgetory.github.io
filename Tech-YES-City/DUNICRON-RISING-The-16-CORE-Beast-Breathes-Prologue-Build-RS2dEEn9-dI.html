does it come in under $1,000 yes of
course is this tak yes City yes of
course well then we have ourselves my
new workstation
you
ladies gentlemen welcome back to check
yes City this is Bryan coming to you
guys today finally with the detailed log
of my new project here this is the 16
called 32 fred threaded beast that i'm
going to be calling project Juno cron
after Unicron you know Unicron and
transformers heels that big badass
transformer that took like everyone to
combine to beat him this thing we're
going to unicron's and I love
transformers to write the anime stuff
the old school stuff not the new Michael
Bay stuff anyway today is going to be a
long-ass vlog about this whole build I'm
using a lot of used parts especially the
CPUs the memory this case the even the
power supply graphics card they're all
going in and they use parts there will
be some new parts though getting thrown
in there and I will detail those so
first up here we have the CPUs the main
component of this build this is the e5
2670 now these things I've got these for
$70 a pop that's right eight cores on
Sandy Bridge with 16 threads for 70
friggin dollars I knew this build was
going to come about as soon as I saw the
price of these CPUs now for the
motherboard I decided to go with the
asrock server rack this thing supports
both these CPUs and it's overall got
everything that I'd need from a
motherboard and it would only came in at
$300 which for a new motherboard that
supports two CPUs isn't bad at all
next up here we have 64 gigabytes of
memory from crucial this was another big
sweetener in the deal this Ram came in
at 110 dollars that's right the 64
gigabytes of memory this stuff was
incredible value for money now the next
component of the builds are the drives I
managed to use my 500 gigabyte SSD from
my old rig that's the bx 100 and then
also purchased two new three terabyte
western digital blues for backup and
also for storage and also for temporary
storage for games and i put them in a
raid 0 array so it could speed things up
now for the case we're going with the
corsair 650d which is actually from
around 2011 2012 I think now picked this
up with a junk store for 30 dollars and
it came with all the fans was a little
bit busted up and dirty so that's fine
for me because I'm going to be modding
this case anyway to fit this motherboard
so great bargain there so next up we
have the graphics card I'm going with my
GTX
970 since I've already sprayed it I can
spray it up again for this build and
it's still a great card for 1440p and
also got a lot of display ports there
and it will be fine for editing in 4k
therefore the coolers we're going with
two cool master 212 since I already had
one of these laying around I decided to
use another one we'll purchase another
one and then spray them up white so I'd
have the whole white and black theme
going on so some more components used in
this build isn't as Rock 3.1 USB add-on
card a zone RDG sound card from a Zeus
and also a super flower 850 white golden
King which was from my ex 99 build and
I'm actually going to hack a cable in
there to fit in an extra 8 pin CPU now
lastly we've got some fans which are
optional these were provided to me from
deep cool for free they're going into
the build these are the TF 1 20s and
mind you I could perfectly get away with
not using any additional fans the
corsair case already came with 2 200 mil
fans already came with 120 on the rear
and the CM two twelves already came with
their own 120mm fans which would have
been adequate for this build however I
decided to add in four of these and
replace all the existing fans and also
the front they were using a bit Phoenix
Spectre Pro which I got from a friend in
America when I was there
SC be good to go sir
keep filming away
so now we're just going to get onto
respraying a few pieces here this this
and this and this these four pieces are
going to get resprayed white these two
here actually these three will get a
metal undercoat so can just the paint
can grip a lot easier and then this here
I'll just be spraying over the top of it
because it's going to take too long to
strip the paint and shouldn't really
make a difference I mean the temps are
already really good on the GTX 970
anyhow and then after that we're going
to be replacing these fans with the
gamer storm 120 Miller made of white LED
fans
so we've got a bit of dilemma here when
we try to put the hard drive cage back
in it's a little bit off-center now I
could get our hack it in but I thought
to myself well since there's already
like a ton of 5.25 inch drive bays up
here I can just get some adaptors and
then utilize these slots up here and
also keep the clutter out of the case
and keep things more towards the top of
the case now currently inside there
we've got a B X 100 so I'm going to be
taking that out and then putting this in
this is the BX 200 is I'm going to be
selling the X 99 rig so I'm going to use
a deeakron Asst true clone software to
do this and just clone the OS
so first up we're going to use the metal
undercoat on even though this is plastic
it doesn't matter it's still good stuff
I'm going to use that on this and the
Coolermaster heat sinks
so there it is the older coolers and the
fan are all sprayed up and you can see
here I'm actually leaving them out in
the Sun because it's very cold in winter
and the paint's white and despite
popular belief it's actually okay to
leave them out in the Sun depending on
how much bite the Sun has to it so be
very careful with that but as you can
see here it's a cool day though out in
the Sun it will dry a lot quicker than
it would if it wasn't so not a bad idea
we're going to take the power supply out
of this this is the super flower 850
watt platinum and then we're going to be
installing this here this is the deep
cool 700 watt bronze rated power supply
and that way we can use the super flower
in the main rig so here it is guys the
golden King yet it's platinum I say to
that off with thee
so this is going to be a pretty tight
fit as we can see here however want to
take this off and the other side it
should fit in fine but what we're going
to do now is actually put some of this
stuff on it's really kind of like hard
rubber we're going to put that down on
where the holes are on the mountings on
the sides here and I'm going to use self
tappers to screw this in and also going
to silicon gun it down to the case so
that's kind of like the next step in
this whole process now
so it's time to test out the super
flower power play with my ghetto PCIe 2
CPU 8-pin converted so I've got a
feeling it should work absolutely fine
yeah so we got the beep there that means
everything's pretty cool also this
graphics card it's the first time using
this graphics card as well and this
power supplies got one of those smart
fans that doesn't turn on unless it's
using power maybe a cable doesn't work
wait yeah works cool awesome awesome
awesome sweet so our ghetto power supply
cable is working perfectly fine
mr. rose never rehearsed
s-see be good to go sir
three hours every yard
we're slowly to any City
street art was never yours
it was never yours
I'm about to drop the hammer
absolutely
the Atlantic - sir
every night
bet it already know ready to roll down
discriminate justice
for the watermelon side I'm sorry if
your chatter to fraud
see me can't go sir
can't build it some live away
you
ready ready ready to roll out
I can't
there's a lot
their Charter has arrived
has arrived
major carrier has arrived
you
you
Robert
so anyway there we have it guys the 16
core 32 threaded monster is complete and
I had a blast building this thing it's a
lot of fun and I can highly recommend it
though I will be coming out with another
video once I get the cables in and
finish the complete build off I'll
showcase it with all the benchmarks and
not just productivity but gaming but for
the meantime I'll give you guys a little
taste this thing is scoring over 2,000
Cinebench points there which is a big
step ahead of my x99 rig it even beats
out the 59 60 X and these CPUs cost one
hundred and forty dollars in total so
you can see the amount of value you're
extracting there if you are going from
workstation productivity now another
thing I'll mention is even in single
threaded performance is not that bad at
all this thing will still do a great job
of gaming especially with the GTX 970
since it does turbo up to three point
three gigahertz on to cause when your
other cores aren't in use so for gaming
it'll do an absolutely fine job and then
power consumption since the CPUs are
running at one volt anyway they're
staying relatively cool and they're not
juicing up a lot of power despite being
eight cores and having two of them on
there and then some last-minute things
this did take me a long time to get out
because I had to reinstall my whole OS
had to actually change from Vegas back
to Adobe Premiere Pro because I've got
the cloud thing could actually get that
on a teacher's license for a lot cheaper
than the standard fee and so I'm just
getting the whole thing streamlined
techy air city is going to come out with
a lot more content for you guys very
soon once I set up the whole progress or
want to set up the whole station here
but I hope you guys enjoyed this vlog it
was a very long one and I hope you
stayed with me until now
and that's about it for me today guys if
you like this video then please give it
a big fat like if you have any questions
or comments about the 32 threaded Beast
then be sure to drop a cone to cone
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can and also if you want to
