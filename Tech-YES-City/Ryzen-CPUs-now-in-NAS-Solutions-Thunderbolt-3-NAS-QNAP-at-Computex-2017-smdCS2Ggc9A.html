here at the QNAP booth and before you
say I know I know
NASA's and whatnot but this is a NASA
with a Rison CPU in it so let's take a
look guys
2017 s Computex coverage but tech yes
City was built by MSI and Corsair
for a limited time only you can get a
free copy of Ghost Recon wildlands
deluxe edition with any purchase of an
MSL product click the link in
description below to find out more so
here we are the QNAP booth 8 Bay NASA
luciene with a rise in sea rise and CPU
why did we put a rise in CPU in this we
have an existing AMD line of models
already for IMD fans in in Australia New
Zealand and today we are bringing the
new rising octa-core into the family as
well so the performance and pricing
would be better even better than the
previous generations and it's every
right because there's a lot of AMD loyal
fans out there and especially this time
with Verizon we've got better price
performance and we've got of course
performance per watt included so why not
include it in a nice solution so I'm
absolutely loving the fact that there's
a rise in CPU and these Nash solutions
now what else is special about this
model I was it's actually not just an 8
Bay so if you look here we have a 3.5
inch but at the same time we have for
2.5 inch SSE and then in this little
drawer
there are actually four m2 SSD slots
available for use so you got a lot of
expansion and you can run essentially
eight drives and to drive four drives at
the same time so you could run twelve
drives in total total yeah and the best
part is that we have actually an auto
tearing feature so whatever data you're
using every day will be pushing to ssese
for caching and those who are archival
will be pushing to the 3.5 inch hard
drives and we also get audio and video
out like we do on the TS series with
audio since it's an enterprise more like
a higher level SMB Enterprise models so
this one does not have an HDMI port but
audio is available so now also with this
nice we have USB 3.1 built in
and also with the PCI expansion and the
ethernet you tell us a little bit more
about that these days comes with three
pcie 3.0 expansion size and two tank
ports built in well so that is a big
Daddy not just with the rise in CPU but
also with the expandability and now also
what are we looking at in terms of
pricing and availability it's going to
be available soon in q3 this year and
pricing is around 2000 ish now I'm
joined in a different kind of product
this is an add-in PCIe expansion slot do
you want to tell us a little bit more
about what this is and what it features
so one of the key features that we would
like to push this year is actually the
expandability of just a single unit of
mass so with a qm2 add-on card it gives
you the flexibility of adding m2 SSD for
caching or 10 key ports for the speed
Wow so we're getting 10 gigabits per
second on this board added in with this
add-in slot card exactly now what are we
looking at in terms of pricing and
availability with this expansion slots
around $200 there we go guys $200 and
you can get multiple of these if you
wish here yes so here we are now with
the new lineup of Thunderbolt 3 nass
solutions can you tell us a little bit
more about the t vs 1282 and the TS 4 v
3 we have a key nap has actually the
world's first stander bonus so before we
have Sun about two and now we're slowly
progress into this and about three and
with this one is the same design concept
as the Rison one so it's got ultra
tearing feature but at the same time for
Sun of all three ports for diuretic is
editable wow that's impressive okay so
now we've got Thunderbolt added in on
this nice for those people who want
those extra speeds and features and
functionality that's looking really good
do we have any pricing and availability
on this model it's actually available
already in Australia so around two
thousand and five hundred dollars so
here with the TS 4 5 3 the main focus
right is that we usually save
thunderbolt for the more expensive
lineup the big boys with the 8 bays and
whatnot but this time we've got ace
a solution that's ready for the home
users and it features Thunderball right
yes that's right so we are catering more
to our home users right now who are
looking to have fundable features well
that looks very impressive so it's
pretty similar to the one that I
reviewed on the channel with the options
the applications the HDMI out and it's
also got for base and now funderbolt and
a no LED readout yes yes it's pretty
good at all I would say future so what
are we looking at in terms of pricing
and availability it's going to be
available soon in q3 this year and
price-wise it's around 500 to 600 so now
here behind me I am looking at the Q IOT
software is this something new coming
out from QNAP and what is it and what
does it feature for the home user I see
most of the QNAP users we know we have a
very big large application center that's
available inside of QT s and this is
something new for our users who would
like to try hands-on with the SDK and
sensors Wow so basically if you are into
programming and you've got the right
senses and you want a program how those
sensors work and what they can do for
like for instances you start
automatically recording or if something
triggers then you can do that with this
software right yes that's right so it
would provide a Rose ng and the
programming part would be visualized and
we provide a dashboard afterwards for
whatever that are you accumulate and
okay so basically this software's for
wendell from level one text yeah exactly
well I'll point it on to him amazing
what can we expect for in terms of
availability of this software so it
isn't included with all your products or
only certain products it's available for
x86 anything above 4 gig and it will be
available by the end of q3 this year so
there we go guys thanks for your time so
now I'm joined here by Miguel from
xsplit how you doing man hey what's up
Brian and um not much just a looking at
the QNAP booth and loving it so we've
got the xsplit application being
integrated into the QNAP naseous yes so
basically what we've done is we've
introduced a built-in native plugin for
the QNAP DJ to live so DJ to live is cue
naps new addition to their app sensor
for their NASA devices it basically
creates a personal live streaming server
inside your home or wherever if it's a
big corporate server than great what you
can do with it is you can broadcast
using xsplit or any other broadcasting
software but I prefer xsplit obviously
you can broadcast to it and then people
can watch it from the browser by logging
into the queue nas device another cool
part here is you can broadcast in full
quality like recording quality to the
QNAP it gets saved in the QNAP and then
you can ask it to transcode that
recorder that broadcast for viewing in
twitch and YouTube and Facebook so you
can essentially live transcode higher
quality and sort of get that downscaled
quality up in 1080p sort of things so if
you want to do that and then of course
you've got the original recording in 4k
if you want to use that so it does save
time it does saver you know people time
mainly in that they can get this done
with the xsplit software on the QNAP
Nass however I will say that I do like
xsplit I personally use it
I tried OBS man I I just had headaches
it didn't work on my computer properly
so I just uninstalled and installed
xsplit thanks so no problem and there we
go guys we are finishing up at the Q nap
booth thank you for watching and tuning
in and thanks for being up for taking
your time and I'll see you guys next
time if you like this video be sure to
hit that like button and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye bye
so here we are guys we are at the QNAP
booth 8 Bay Nast Aleutian and this time
it has a rise in CPU and now I'm joined
by Bianca how you doing good very good
are you enjoying copy text very much
let's get back to this router I mean
this nass sorry nass I messed up that
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
