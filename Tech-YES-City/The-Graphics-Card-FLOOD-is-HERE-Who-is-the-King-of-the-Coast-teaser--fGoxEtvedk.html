of the coast and he's telling me that
our graphics cards left right and center
just gone for discounted prices it is a
sale out there where miners are losing
money because about a year ago they were
paying about double what they're letting
these 1070 eyes go for and also GTX 1060
s so we've got some deals here I'm
looking to get 10 gtx 1066 gigabytes for
about 250 Aussie dollars a pop which
makes them very cheap and then I'm also
looking to get the gtx 1070 t is for
three hundred and sixty-five Aussie at
pop as well so deals are here now and
they're to be had in this flood season
so I'm here to tell you guys right now
this is the flooding of mining graphics
cards so get ready let's talk about if
you should buy one or not in this vlog
I guess so I just landed into the king
of the coast secret operation here we're
just gonna do a quick interview with him
and find out what's going on also guys
wanna check your seat well I don't
really want to do 809 for tonight like
man this guy he wanted 800 first 1080
articles like not max the hopin I hear
650 caching hands come get it today he's
like yeah man like you
a bit of an update here guys the GTX
1060 s deal has fell through so we got
1070 TI's but we're gonna be hunting
some more mining cards there is a
listing that's popped up that I could
potentially swoop on so I'm gonna see
how that goes
the wrote a Neum case unfortunately that
was just so quick I didn't even have
time to film it that's how hungry people
are for gaming PCs at the moment so I'm
gonna see if I can put something else
together but there's also a gtx 1080 TI
then i'm gonna be swooping on as well so
hopefully i get that for under 800 AUD
so now here we are at like day 3 or 4
I've kind of lost track of this mining
vlog but good news is we've managed to
pick up another 18 1066 gigabytes and
this was off a person off eBay they had
a couple of for sale I saw that they're
obviously selling more than one and that
generally indicates a miner especially 3
gravis cars because no one does triple
SLI with 10 60s and I put them in an
offer I said how many cards have you got
and then I asked king of the coast do
you want to come in harms with us and he
was like yeah let's get those deals so
240 Aussie dollars a pop for 1066
gigabyte models custom OC editions this
is really good value I mean it does
matter what part of the world you're in
guys if miners are selling these cards
for real cheap pick them up and then you
can put them in gaming pieces and create
some serious value for yourself and also
the gaming community as well mined cards
there are no problems I've had not one
issue with these graphics cards and as I
said in previous times so many times
these 10 60s and 10 Series cars are
still under warranty with a healthy
amount of warranty left in a lot of
cases two years and we talked recently
and address that yes where the mean time
before failure on the fans is a good
50,000 hours on most cards even more
it's usually 50,000 to 150,000 hours so
that's over five years and if they've
only been run in a lot of cases for nine
months they've still got a massive
amount of life left in them especially
when those fans were run at a hundred
percent speeds and that's going to keep
the grabs card cool keep everything else
cool so now with the cheap stock I'm
getting on hand 365 AUD a pop for a 10s
MBTI 240 a you do pop for a 1066
gigabyte these are bargains the
ix 2000-series I'm like I do not know
how this thing is going to perform at
all also here is a thing about these
graphics cards it's a flood at the
moment it's going crazy a lot of people
bought these graphics cards in droves
and the thing is they paid way too much
when those graphs cards were going
literally over double the price that
they were retailed for you knew that was
just a crunch time people were paying
stupid prices thinking they could make
ridiculous amounts of money and if
anything in this world money does not
grow on trees and so when I saw that I'm
doing the opposite I'm selling some of
my cards here when I saw these stupid
prices that these cards were going for
it's all about a balance and now the
balance is it's time for you guys to
pick up some cheap stock trust me the
miners have already been burned they've
been burned really hard to the point
where I don't think they're too keen to
go get back into cryptocurrency any time
soon and I told my viewers if you guys
followed us in January I said then now
was the time to sell and people mocked
me saying you know you've been in crypto
for like six months and suddenly you're
an expert on it know what I'm an expert
in is buying low and selling high it's
that freaking simple when something's
cheap snap it up and something's
expensive sell it now people may be
wondering how much should you pay for a
10 Series card and the answer is as
cheap as possible always get a deal for
as little as you can and I doubt any of
the 10 series cards you're gonna get
hosed on but of course do suss it out
beforehand because one of my viewers was
telling me he did pick up a dud GTX 1060
it's telling me met the person at and
out of house spots so if you're going to
pick up some of these cards especially
we're gonna pick up a bolt deal at least
go to someone's place and pick it up
from their place so you're not gonna get
hosed or at least take a photo of their
license or something I don't know when
the 20 60 or 20 50 cars are gonna be
released but I know one thing at these
prices they're just such good value for
money for ten series cards and I don't
think even if these cards come out on
the twenty series I don't think they're
going to beat the value of these cards
at this price point because what we're
seeing with the 2000 series is that
Nvidia is kind of creating a new market
they want to add a different kind of
market because I think they still want
to sell ten series cards that's just my
got feeling that's how I'm interpreting
the market but also with the king of the
coast I will reveal in due time who
exactly he is but we've got some things
going on besides YouTube that's going on
behind the scenes when I can share more
information about it I will it's just
really a cool sort of new experience and
of course I want to keep up the content
for you guys I love doing YouTube but of
course YouTube I feel in ways it's kind
of the sake in the yes and when I'm
forsaken I still got that ethic I still
got that hardwork protocol down pat and
I'm just gonna keep on going
it doesn't stop and I hope you guys
enjoyed this one if you did then be sure
to hit that like button let us know in
the comment section below if you've
picked up any 10 series cards for
bargains because I know on Twitter a lot
of people have been messaging me with
Ted deals and they're getting even
better deals than I am it's crazy some
of the deals some of the viewers are
picking up you guys let us know and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
