brand easy coming back to you guys today
with an unboxing and review of the intel
gigabit CT desktop adapter now this
model number is exp i-93 zero 1 BLK now
the BLK stands for bulk packaging so if
it doesn't have the ball its dozen of
the BLK code on it it's the retail
package which will come with the driver
CD and the manual this is the bulk
packaging so it doesn't come with a
driver in the CD driver CD and the
manual and that's good because it's
saving me money I think it's like five
dollars cheaper than the retail version
which is great I love it the fact that
in telling this I just you know when I
buy products nowadays I just want
product and this is what intel's
delivering so it's really good now first
thing let's say i get into the actual
box itself so this is what we get here
just product open it up straight away
you get the NAC itself now i will say
first off that it does have the green
PCB i mean this is a pretty outdated
stuff i mean this is like 1990s a wish
intel would kind of get in with the
black PCB theme and make the NAC look
really good that's probably my only
thing that i don't like about this n IC
but straight away let's look at the
product the product itself it feels
really well-built its sturdy for what it
is
it comes with a ATX bracket standard ATX
sized bracket there it also comes with a
small form-factor bracket if you wish to
install this in a smaller case which is
great i like that so they're giving you
those two things there now in terms of
connectivity this port here is really
solid your actual lan cable will go
right in there so it's really good fits
in and really solid firm connection
there
now with the on board it's got a lot of
circuitry on board i was actually
surprised it actually it is a little bit
smaller than I thought it would be I
think it's about 12 centimeters in
length here and it's overall I mean it's
just a well-built product it comes with
a lifetime warranty so for those people
who want reliability this thing will
definitely deliver it's a really good
product with the lifetime warranty so
make sure you keep the receipt now this
was this product is aimed at people who
want a reliable desktop and I see I
guess if you're in you know if you've
got a small business in a server market
you've got your own server you want
reliable and ICS to get this high
transfer speeds this thing will
definitely deliver now I did test this
and the transfer speeds are
and they're just consistent basically
that's the way to describe this thing it
delivers consistent speeds at one
gigabit per second it also has the
option of autonegotiation so it can auto
negotiate the speeds based on your
current connection if you you know if
you only need 100 megabits per second
it'll negotiate that if you only need 10
megabits per second it will negotiate
that now it does support these three
speeds at full and half duplex which is
great I like that you're probably
wondering why why would I need 10
megabits per second you would probably
need I mean if you are a cert if you
have your own server and you want to
throttle down the connection
deliberately you can do that by just
setting 10 megabits per second so it's a
great feature I like how they're doing
Intel are doing that which is really
good so I will say moving on now to the
drivers itself the drivers are amazing
this product comes with a full-featured
driver set you can have the option of
installing the Intel processor Ivers the
advanced drivers or just the standard
drivers
I recommend installing the advanced
drivers it gives you a lot of options to
do things like autonegotiation
has power saving features wake-on-lan
has all these power saving features
which are really good they work the one
thing that I particularly liked about
this is the adaptive floor moderation
rate control it has a setting called
adaptive so basically if your CPU is on
full load this thing will automatically
recognize that and will take the load
off the CPU so it's a great feature now
for the gamers people who are wondering
Oh should I get an ni C for gaming I can
if you have the money I do recommend it
as I did put this up against the killer
on board ni C and I thought that this
especially in games like black ops 2 I
thought you know every bullet was
registering with this MSE I thought it
was a great ni C I had no doubts you
know whenever I was firing in black ops
2 was like yeah every bullets hittin
this is awesome so I will say that I
thought this was as ever so slightly
better than an on board and I see for
gaming because the on board ni C's are
getting a lot better nowadays so you
have to keep that in mind now also with
in terms of it also has I forgot to
mention it has a full Diagnostics sort
of application in the drivers itself so
this will test your cable it will
actually test your cable so your LAN
cable and
how good it is mine came up with a good
score and it actually accurately
detected like 25 meter cable even though
I'm using a 50 meter cable detector that
I had a long cable so it also has a self
Diagnostics to test the lat the N I see
itself to look for problems which found
no problems it also can test the
transfer speeds which it did accurately
so it does a really good job if you guys
are worried about us something's wrong
with me and I see this thing has the
ability to test itself which is really
good I like that Intel deliver these
full feature driver sets so that's about
it it mean it's a good product is well
built comes with a lifetime warranty
it's PCI Express as well it works
flawlessly it's a good product I can
highly recommend this I will give it
overall four and a half stars I just
think the color could use an update I
don't not particularly keen on the green
PCB even though it's kind of like a
graphite sort of look that they're going
with here but it is a good product you
