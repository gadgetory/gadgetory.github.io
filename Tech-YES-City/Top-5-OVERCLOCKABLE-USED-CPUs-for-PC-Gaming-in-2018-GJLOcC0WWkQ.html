the top five CPU recommendations we
looked at if anon overclock as people
who just want to get into the market
slap a cpu in a motherboard slap some
memory and and install Windows and start
playing games but today's a little
different today is a guide or a top five
list for those people who want to get
into gaming they like overclocking and
they also are on a budget and they want
the absolute best price performance
money can buy so with that aside let's
get on with this list
welcome back to check yet city this
Brian and when it comes to overclocking
I am not too sure how many people
exactly overclock their CPUs me for one
I always overclock CPUs when I can and I
highly recommend it to anyone who just
wants to get extra performance at the
expense of a little bit more power of
course when it comes to overclocking
there are some implications to
overclocking versus not overclocking the
first thing you generally need a better
cooler than the stock cooler nowadays
you can generally get away with a $25
cooler from aliexpress which will do a
great job of finding a sweet spot
overclock on all the CPUs I've listed
here today the second thing is you will
generally need a better motherboard than
a really cheap generic board the third
thing of course is you will need skill
to overclock these CPUs with that aside
let's get on with number five so making
the list at number five is the e5 1650
this is Sandy Bridge IPC comes in at a
hundred and twenty eight US dollars
that's shipped to your door so you're
getting six cores 12 threads and you can
overclock this thing it does get to
around four point four four point five
gigahertz on a decent x79 motherboard
now the CPU would have definitely made
it higher up the list if it wasn't for
those x79 motherboards because with
overclocking especially on this CPU
you'll generally want a pretty good
motherboard now I have ordered in
someone and motherboards but I don't
know how well they'll overclock only
time to tell I do have some high hopes
for these boards because if they are
good and they come in at $100 then I can
highly recommend this CPU even more than
I'm recommending it today though in
terms of gaming and the CPU once you
overclock it this thing will play even
the latest titles absolutely fine you
can even pair it up with something like
a GTX 1080 and not get a CPU bottleneck
also the $25 VT g5 cooler will do an
absolutely fine job of keeping this
thing under wraps and also another
benefit is you can utilize ddr3 memory
even in quad-channel so you don't have
to worry about overclocking ddr3 memory
you generally put inexpensive ddr3
memory on this board and you'll get away
with some very good performance so now
coming in at number four is the i-5 2500
K this CPU is phenomenal especially at
75 bucks you can couple it with a cheap
z6
motherboard get that cooler as I
mentioned before and you can get this
thing generally the 4.6 gigahertz on
even the cheaper z68 motherboards I
haven't had a 2500 K yet that hasn't
gone up to 4.6 Giga it's even in the
dead heat of summer now some people will
say that the four core four threaded CPU
the 2500 K is dated but I haven't ran
into one instance where the CPU couldn't
get up and boogie in the latest titles
even games like pub G I was getting well
over 80 fps when this thing was
overclocked so it is a really good CPU
if you're on a budget but you want a
little bit more power than some of the
other budget options that I'm gonna
recommend here today now coming in at
number three is the W 3670 this CPU is
currently going for forty-one dollars
6 cores 12 threads Westmere architecture
32 nanometers this thing even in today's
games is such a beast you'll generally
expect with a decent X 58 board to get
this CPU to around 4.4 gigahertz now in
the past I have tested this on a lot of
different motherboards I find on X 58
you'll generally want to go with in the
Zeus motherboard as rockport they're the
two boards that I've had a lot of no
problems or no headaches with as opposed
to some of the other boards out there I
generally find there are some weird
settings the new d3 I even though as
much as I love the hardware on that
board I sometimes get some BIOS bugs
that prevent me from getting that CPU to
a stable 4 plus gigahertz so ultimately
the W 3670 is awesome value at 41
dollars however it would have made it
higher in the list if it wasn't for the
x58 boards being generally more
expensive than other motherboards
they're also getting rarer to find
however there are some generic x58
boards out there but I haven't tested
them yet I am ordering them in so I will
get the verdict on those as soon as I
can for you guys especially when it
comes to overclocking but of course as I
said before try and snap up and as
rocker and reduce board and you'll be
having some good days if you want to get
an msi board or a gigabyte board I
generally find their higher-end x58
boards are really good but their
mid-range and low range boards
especially the MSI low range x58 boards
I would avoid them like the plague also
another thing like the W 3670 is it has
a qpi score of 1 so it'll generally work
on any x58 board ever knows brands that
you really haven't heard of before there
are a few of them out there
on the x58 line and so the w 3670 will
practically work on any x58 board as
opposed to the x 5670 which has a QP i
score of two so sometimes it doesn't
work on particular x58 motherboards now
before we move on to number two another
benefit of the x58 lineup is that triple
channel memory so you can get some cheap
ddr3 memory whack it in triple channel
configuration and you'll be getting
better bandwidth then you would on dual
Channel this makes this motherboard much
more relevant in today's games than it
ever did in the past so coming in at
number two now is the X 30 430 I've
covered this CPU in the past it's only
seven dollars it's a I five equivalent
is the i5 750 so for seven bucks you can
generally whack this on any page 55 and
P 55 motherboard overclocked it to
around 3.8 gigahertz even sometimes
higher it does depend on the CPU since
it does have a low base clock and you'll
be getting some really good performance
Pub G for example on this CPU when it
was overclocked to three point Hankey
goats was running absolutely fine not to
mention that's an i5 without hyper
threading so won't put as much of the
strain on your motherboard as say the
next CPU that we're going to mention
also on that note with this CPU does
utilize ddr3 memory and it'd be great to
couple with something like a GTX 1060 of
course if you can pick one up in today's
current market and coming in at number
one for the top five used overclockable
CPUs for early 2018 is the x34 40 so
it's only 10 digits higher than the x34
30 but of course you get a higher base
clock multiplier and you get hyper
threading so it is the same architecture
same IPC but of course that hyper
threading makes it a little bit more
relevant than the x34 30 and it only
cost $16 so again you can couple it with
those cheap age 55 or P 55 motherboards
and you've got yourself one phenomenal
gaming experience honestly you can go
out and get the X 30 470 it's a little
bit more expensive you will get a bit
more flexibility I find but I've never
ran into a case where next 34 40
couldn't go to 3.8 gigahertz with the
right settings for cooling this thing
will stay pretty cool the $25 cool
highly recommend this because you do get
a bit of future proofing out of this
thing if you want to upgrade to a six
core 12 threaded CPU this cool will do
an absolutely fine job
and of course for 25 bucks ship
worldwide it's a no-brainer in terms of
cooling now what you can do with the CPU
for gaming table G dota 2 all those
popular multiplayer titles this thing
will handle it with these you might want
a couple with a gtx 1066 gigabyte model
or something with the equivalent power
set for instance a 780ti or a gtx 970 or
even an r9 290 or 390 if you can pick
them up and you'll just have as I said
before a wonderful gaming experience
also in regards to overclocking with
that steam survey what we were seeing is
that the numbers indicate that more
people are actually overclocking their
CPUs to date especially those AMD
numbers with the 3.7 gigahertz and above
it's great to see that a few more people
are starting to overclock their CPUs of
course those percentage figures are
still really low when you compare it to
the total number of gamers on Steam but
of course a big stigma out there at the
moment with overclocking in one in turn
that I would like to help overcome is
that overclocking can damage your gear
it's really hard to do and it's not hard
because there's a lot of guys out there
today I've done a lot of guides in the
past where I've helped people overclock
I'll put some links in the description
below also if you want to see in 2018
maybe some updated higher quality guides
then I'll definitely get them done for
you especially p55 LGA 1366 and even
Sandy Bridge where currently there's a
lot of value for money also on that note
with overclocking of course like
anything in the wrong hands it can be
dangerous and of course you can cause
damage to your components if you either
run them too hot or you run too much
voltage through them it's usually a
combination of both that does kill
hardware but of course if you get a
really good cooler you monitor your
temperatures and you just lock in some
pretty safe settings that I'll usually
mentioned in a lot of guides then you
should be absolutely fine of course once
you get your head around it and it's now
a new skill that you can learn and then
apply to future overclocking in the
future you guys hope you enjoyed today's
top 5 eueu CPUs for overclocking in
early 2018 if you did - be sure to hit
that like button if you have any other
CPUs that you want to recommend
and be sure to drop a comma in the
comment section below also for the
motherboards I will put some links in
the descriptions below for you guys just
so you can check out what you can get
that's readily available now also
another thing is with all these CPUs
that I've recommended here today they
are readily available so you can go on
Aliexpress there's heaps of them in
stock and if you want to get into PC
gaming on the cheap you can definitely
deal with today's guide rather than
recommending someone off CPUs
indefinitely I'm a big fan of the
one-off deals I highly recommend looking
in your local listings trying to find
those deals if you can because in the
past as I've said in the previous video
you can get some really good deals that
it'll eclipse all these top 5 CPUs if
you're on your game and you're looking
for bargains just mainly from people who
just don't want they used Hardware
anymore and especially if they have an
overclock that they'll be like wow my
new gear is so much faster than my old
gear but when you get that old gear and
you overclock it and you tune it up and
you clean it up change the thermal paste
you'll have a really good gaming
experience honestly as I've said in the
past if all's I had was a couple hundred
bucks and a 1080p 24-inch monitor I'd be
absolutely home and hosed when it came
to PC gaming especially with a used PC
hardware and something like a GTX 780
I'd have no problems enjoying PC gaming
in 2018 anyway guys I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
