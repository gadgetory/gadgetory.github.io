this one for quite a while,
and here I have all these
eight core behemoths,
right here on the desk and on my head,
so we've got the Ryzen 7
2700X at 4.2 gigahertz,
going up against the 9900K at 5 gigahertz.
And then we're going back to 2013,
taking that Xeon, which is the 1680v2,
and we're clocking that to 4.6 gigahertz.
We're gonna be testing these 3 CPUs
with the RTX 2080 Ti Aurus.
Now I did set the fans speeds
to 100%, up the power limits
to 122%, and it's an even
apples to apples to apples test.
As for the motherboards,
we've got the ASRock Taichi
Ultimate across both the
Ryzen and also the 9900K.
As for the Xeon that's got the
Rampage IV Extreme, X79 motherboard.
And what are we waiting for?
Let's do this.
That was the 8700K box by the way,
I was just gonna pretend it's a Xeon box
but there's nothing in the box.
(&quot; I Wish That I Was a Mad
Man&quot; by Staffan Carlen)
- Welcome back to Tech
Yes City and right here
is part one of three with
the ultimate showdown.
The whole purpose of this if
you haven't guys seen already,
I did a prelude where I talk about X79,
is that we're looking at
2013 versus now, 2018.
And we're gonna see how far teach has come
in the last five years, at least for
a single end power user or
someone that plays games.
In other words, I guess the majority
of my audience and myself included.
And so we've tested seven
different games here
at 1080p ultra and also 1440p ultra.
This will be part one, we're looking at
the gaming performance
and then in part two,
we're gonna take a look at the input lag,
and then in part three, we're gonna be
taking a look at the productivity.
So let's have a look. First up,
pulling up CS GO for
you guys, 1080p we saw
that 9900K coming out well
ahead of the pack here.
558 average FPS, 1% low of 141.
Contrast that to the
1680 v2, that was getting
430 average FPS, with a 1% low of 122.
Then we look at the Ryzen 7
2700X, that was getting 358 FPS,
so I think in CS GO this was
probably the weakest showing
for the Ryzen CPU. But
moving along now to Dota 2,
and we saw here, 211 FPS with Vulkan.
And this time you guys
have been telling me,
look I wanna see the Vulkan
API tested in Dota 2,
So I decided to switch things up
and test Vulkan across the board here,
and 211 FPS, 98 1% low versus
191 and 78 on the Xeon.
And then going to Ryzen 162 and 61.
So the intel variants were pulling ahead
of the Ryzen in this game,
and moving over to 1440p
showed a similar scenario,
with 151 on the Ryzen
versus 206 on the 9900K versus
194 on the Xeon 1680 v2.
Moving over to Far Cry 5,
the game that still loves
the single core performance, as well as
the higher clock speeds.
So, it was a no surprise
to see the 9900K coming out
at 1080p with 154 average FPS
and a minimum of 124 and then
looking at the Xeon 1680 v2,
it scored 116 with a minimum of 88,
and the Ryzen 7 2700X at 4.2 gigahertz
scored 107 with a minimum of 83.
And then stepping over
to 1440p saw the FPS drop
on 9900K to 138, on the Xeon 113
and then on the Ryzen it scored 107 again.
So pretty much plateauing
out at that resolution.
But one thing I will say
with the RAM as well, memory,
quick interlude here before we move on
with more of the benchmarks,
DDR4 memory, Sniper X G.Skill,
at 3600 megahertz, CL18,
and then looking at the Xeon
that was using 1600 megahertz at CL8.
So from the Xeon also use
that in quad channels,
since it can support that, so that brought
the total bandwidth of the memory roughly
that of the same of the
9900K and also the 2700X.
Anyway, back to GTA 5 at 1080p we had
some engine busting
performance here on the 9900K,
scoring 167 with a 1% low
of 3. That's right, 3.
So this test I decided to
take off MSAA completely,
and just let the CPU run to the hill,
moving over to both
the Ryzen and the Xeon,
we scored very similar scores here,
133 with a 1% low of 111
versus 132 on Ryzen and 104.
Then stepping over to 1440p,
the 9900K actually did better
scoring 171 average FPS,
but again a 1% low of 4,
so it was still a horrible experience.
And then, the Xeon did
130 and the Ryzen did 126,
so both the slower CPUs
did do better in GTA 5
because they're not breaking the engine,
and if you go 9900K and
it's clocked at 5 gigahertz,
you may wish to manually cap the frames
to around 160 in this game in particular,
I find after that really just starts
going crazy and breaking the engine.
Moving over now to the latest
and greatest Battlefield V,
we've got 177 average FPS
at 1080p with the 9900K
with a 1% low of 118 versus
168 on the Ryzen 7 2700X
versus 165 on the Xeon.
So the Xeon actually surprisingly
got the highest 1% lows here.
And this is actually a
trend that I'm noticing
through a lot of these
benchmarks, was the 1% lows.
And interestingly enough,
the Xeon has 25 megabytes
of level three cache on-
did I just say cache?
Cache on board the CPU. So
stepping things up now to 1440p
saw the 9900K 136, the Ryzen 7, 134
so really closing that gap,
and then the Xeon scoring 128.
And then the 1% lows were in
tandem with the clock speeds
in this particular benchmark
from 5 gigahertz to 4.6 to 4.2.
Moving across now the latest
reiteration of Hitman at 1080p
242 average FPS 9900K, and
then moving across to the Xeon
we scored 201 FPS, and
then the Ryzen 7 2700X 191.
And the stepping things up to 1440p
on the Ryzen saw 182 average
FPS, the Intel scoring 233,
and then the Xeon scoring 192.
All the 1% lows were
really well controlled,
very smooth experience in
this game on all three CPUs.
And then moving over to
Assassin's Creed Origins
we're using the in built
benchmark but I still used
MSI Afterburner overlay where I can
capture the 1% lows during this benchmark.
And we saw were 1080p on
the ultra high settings,
so this is max the slider
will go with the 2080 Ti
we saw 112 average FPS
at 1080p on the 9900K,
59 1% low, stepping across to the Xeon,
that got 96 average FPS
with a 1% low of 33.
And then looking at the
Ryzen 7 2700X 84 with 41.
Stepping things up to 1440p
we got 83 and 39 on the Ryzen,
100 and then 58 for the 1% lows on 9900K,
and the for the 1680 v2,
9900K, 90 and 32 respectively.
So this game pretty much scaled along
those clock speed numbers,
even though the IPC
and the architectures are different,
we had the 5 gigahertz coming out on top,
4.6 in second and 4.2 in third place.
And there it is ladies and gentlemen,
there are the gaming
results with the 1680 v2,
the 2013 Xeon at 4.6 gigahertz versus
the Ryzen 7 2700X at 4.2 gigahertz and
then the 9900K, the latest
and greatest at 5 gigahertz.
But the thing is, we'll look
at the power consumption
results and I'll probably show this in
the other two part series
as well, this is getting
over 200 Watts usage
when it's at 5 gigahertz.
The idle power consumption
is pretty good at
just under 40 Watts, but
the Xeon at 4.6 gigahertz,
which is five years old,
using around 180 Watts,
and then the Ryzen's
close to around 140 Watts.
So when we look at what
came out in the 2013
and we fast forward now to 2018,
not a whole lot has changed.
At least for someone
like me, who plays games
occasionally with a CPU like
this or someone out there
who's maybe looking for a
bargain X79 motherboard,
don't be deterred from
getting the X79 platform.
If you can get a really good deal on it,
or if you're an enthusiast
and you wanna travel
back to the future and get
something that you can enjoy.
Because what we saw in today's video
was a 9900K that's pushed to the brink,
and when we look a that out of the box,
that's getting 4.7 gigahertz,
you can only really get
that thing realistically an
extra 300 megahertz higher.
The Xeon's coming out of the box
with a 3 gigahertz base clock speed.
We're taking that to 4.6 gigahertz,
that's over a 50% overclock.
Then we look at the Ryzen
7 2700X, that's pretty much
boosting to 4 gigahertz out
of the box automatically,
so we're getting an extra
200 megahertz on that.
So there's something that we can see here,
with these three CPUs. The one from 2013
had a lot of headroom,
the two CPUs from both AMD
and Intel in 2018, are being
pushed higher to the brink.
I guarantee you if you got this CPU,
and you got a really bad power supply,
and you got a really bad,
or just a really entry level
Z390 motherboard and you tried running it,
even out of the box you might
have problems, it might crash.
You take that Xeon 1680
v2, you chuck it in with
the crapest power supply money can buy,
chuck it with the crapest
X79, even a Huanan board,
and I think that thing will boot
and work at its base clock speeds.
And that's a big difference
between 2018 versus 2013
with these CPUs I think the
envelope is being pushed
to the brink and so we're
not really seeing true gains.
When we look at the 4.6 gigahertz CPU,
it's beating the Ryzen in pretty
much all those benchmarks,
Battlefield V being the exception.
And I believe maybe that
has to do with some coding,
using FMA3, which is an instruction set
that's not on the Ivy Bridge-E
CPUs, the 2013 release.
AVX is still there and so
a lot of the other titles
are doing very well, Hitman included.
That was beating out the Ryzen 7 2700X,
but of course, the 9900K
is still coming out on top,
it's got 5 gigahertz clock speed,
and it's got a slightly
better IPC than the 1680 v2.
But really, when it comes
down to it, in five years
I'm surprised, not a
whole lot has changed.
And that's the shocking truth
of what's going on here.
And as we said in the previous
video with the prelude,
if you haven't seen already
I'll put the link up here,
for what use the 1680 v2 for, I don't need
all those extra like the DMI 3.0,
I don't need the reduction
in PCIe lanes from 40 to 20-
(laughs)
(bleep)
I also don't need USB 3.1, I don't need
ThunderBold 3, but what I do need is
the best IPC, the fastest clock speeds
so I can get the snappiest
experience known to man.
But in this case, I think
that snappiest experience
could've been five years ago.
And you're gonna find out
in part two of this video,
where we're gonna be
testing the input latency
with 1000 FPS camera.
And one thing I will say
it is that we did try to
keep this as apples to apples
as possible, so we used the same monitor,
the Asus XG35, we used the same SSDs.
We did use a better
power supply on the Ryzen
and also the 9900K machines, the AX1500
and we did use 3600
megahertz G.Skill memory,
and I slightly tuned that to tighten
the timings up, just ever so slightly.
The 1680 v2 we're using
real, just run of the mill
core set 1600 megahertz memory.
And of course, I've tuned
that down a little bit
from CL10 to CL8, and
that of course, is one of
the many benefits of X79, even in 2018.
Anyway, there it is.
(bleep)
Anyway, guys I hope you
enjoyed part one of three
of the epic X79 showdown versus the latest
and greatest in 2018 from AMD, from Intel.
And I'm pretty shocked
at how well this CPU did.
It beat out the Ryzen 7 2700X
with its really good memory,
and its 4.2 gigahertz overclock
and of course the 9900K
that's using more power,
so it's really crazy how far tech
kind of hasn't come in five years.
But anyway, love reading
your thoughts and opinions
as always, drop a comment in
the comments section below.
And also Steve if you're watching this,
don't have the viewers believe otherwise,
unless of course, you
wanna get X79 for yourself
and that 1680 v2 and
run it at 4.6 gigahertz.
And I'll catch you in
the next one very soon.
Peace out for now. Bye.
