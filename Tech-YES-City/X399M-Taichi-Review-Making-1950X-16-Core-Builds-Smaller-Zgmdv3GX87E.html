stands for micro ATX with the recent
release of as rocks Tai Chi motherboard
pretty much the fully featured tai chi
but now cut off at the bottom to
accommodate micro ATX builds now the
first thing that comes to mind when I
think of a motherboard like this is that
John's very small micro ATX case the um
x3 what I love to put this in that and
make a build and I've just ordered that
case right now so maybe stay tuned for
that bill but today we're gonna focus on
the Tai Chi and motherboard what it
features and of course is it worth your
money let's take a look
welcome back to tech yes City this brand
coming to you guys today with the Tai
Chi M motherboard here the X 399 version
and it's got the 1950s Red River CPU in
it however this time around there was
one big problem I ran into and that was
with the previous h100 v1 cooler that I
had the hose busted off in between
moving some things so out of all the
coolers I have around here and I do have
a lot I could no longer get a cooler to
fit the tr4 sockets so I had to
improvise a little bit get a bit
creative and I mounted the CPU cooler
down with a monitor arm and it did work
it did work pretty well however with
that I didn't really want to overclock
so today's tests will be on the stock
3.4 gigahertz which is already very
impressive for 16 cores 32 threads and
we're gonna take a look at the vrm
temperatures now the vrm on the Tai Chi
and motherboard features a 11 phase but
with eight phases dedicated to the CPU
itself and these are IR 3 5 5 v 60 amp
dual stage MOSFETs so you got the high
side and the low side integrated into
one of these chips and you get eight of
them dedicated towards your CPU also
you've got 60 amp chokes and the best
thing is you got tantalum pause cap
capacitors these are pretty much the
best in the biz so asrock have went full
ball with this VRM and the results show
in the past and I'll put the link in
description below when I tested the x3
9i motherboards the asrock fatality
board which reaches the same vrm had no
problems at all getting a 4 gigahertz
stable in less than ideal ambient
temperatures so this here when I put the
thermal imaging camera on it the vrm on
the heatsink wise had got to around
about 60 degrees and then on the actual
MOSFETs itself was reading up to about
90 degrees this was in about 28 degrees
ambient temperatures during the dead
heat of summer so the temperatures on
this vrm are really good for handling
anything you throw at it especially on
air or everyday water overclocks and now
with this motherboard we did mention
eleven phases and we've only mentioned
eight dedicated towards the CPU the
other three are dedicated towards the
system on chip or otherwise known as the
stock voltage this is important for
getting your memory overclocks right
with the course on Rison and thread
ripper your memory overclock being
important for your overall system speed
especially if you're a gamer and so
you've got three phases dedicated
towards that and the memory itself
now you notice probably with this
motherboard there are a few little
compromises in making it smaller that's
the ddr4 Ram slots you'll notice that
previously on the tire you had eight
you've now got four but you actually
have these same amount of phases I think
you've got four phases dedicated towards
the ddr4 memory on this so you'll
accommodate up to 64 gigabytes of
standard ddr4 storage but I believe with
thread Ripper since it does support ECC
memory you can actually have up to 256
gigabytes if you have the right memory
chips and then to the right of those
four dimm slots you've got the dr. debug
LED readout this is important for
diagnosing problems for instance if
you've got like I did a pre-release bios
version then you can read the codes and
see if for instance you maybe need to
only put one stick of memory and update
the BIOS or try a different stick of
memory up this debug LED will tell you
that on the fly you've also got the
power and reset button included although
there are smaller buttons of course to
accommodate this smaller motherboard
though you do have three slots of nvme
and got two storage available you can
raid these within the bias itself so if
you wish to make a raid 0 array on the
already incredibly fast m2 you can with
this motherboard now the heatsink as
well I forgot to mention the heatsink
that weighs in at 300 grams as well so
if you want to put a fan on this thing
for higher overclocks you can indeed do
so I have heard of people getting these
things 24.2 even 4.3 gigahertz on water
since your 1950 X's are indeed in the
top 5% of been rising chips on top of
that your power delivery for this board
you've got the standard 8 pin connector
we've also got an additional 4 pin now
the reason for this is of course for not
just higher overclocks
but in case some ATX power supplies only
support the minimum 115 watts per 4 pins
so essentially on your standard ATX
power supply you could only have 230
watts of deliverance and now when I've
overclocked these in the past the 1950 X
it has gone over 230 watts but having an
additional 115 Watts available just in
case your power supply for instance
doesn't have thick enough wires is
always a great peace of mind to have
moving further down the board you've got
2 USB 3 front out headers and also to us
two front outs there's also an RGB
header as well if you wish to control
your RGB lighting from the motherboard
itself and on that note of the RGB
control you can control it from the bars
or as rocks own software program which
does update itself as well automatically
which is a great touch the heatsink the
Southbridge heatsink also has its own
RGB lighting underneath that heatsink
which again can be controlled via the
motherboards bios or the software in
Windows now going further through the
important headers on this motherboard
you've got five four pin pwm controlled
fan headers as well this has enabled you
to control your fan speeds in the BIOS
itself and then you can save that to a
profile I've been using this since 2014
on Azeroth boards does a phenomenal job
never once come into a problem as
opposed to some other motherboards in
the past I have come into problems with
the PWM control mainly in the fact that
it was an annoyance this motherboard you
set the profiles in you're gonna get no
annoyances with fans dynamically
changing at certain temperatures they
just stick to that profile and they work
really well now moving further along the
bottom of the motherboard you've got the
clear CMOS button which preferably I'd
like to see move to the back of the
motherboard is you do have to open up
your case if you want to reset the BIOS
in that regard great if you're an
overclocking so I'd like to see that
move to the back if possible but of
course with the EM motherboard there is
that excuse of the space limitations
you've also got two front audio outs
here one that's shaped or ninety degree
angled and another that's just your
straight fan header out sort of approach
I don't know why they've included this
maybe because people like cable
management nowadays but they've got two
of them there and that's connected to
the purity sound for now when I've
tested this sound and I always do audio
tests when I look at motherboards the
crosstalk was pretty good on this
motherboard but it still does suffer
from that same problem that I've
diagnosed in practically every single
motherboard that's come through here on
the channel and that is passed a volume
level of 90 it introduces some crosstalk
in this case some bumping crosstalk on
the right channel and you can see that
in the testing software itself also on
this motherboard specifically there was
about five decibels higher crosstalk on
the right channel than there was on the
left
though the results were still phenomenal
if you're using a mid-range can for
example you're gonna have a great time
on this onboard audio I don't really see
the need or reason to upgrade to a
higher decamp combo unless of course
you've got higher in headphones but on
the note of the frequency response
absolutely phenomenal extremely flat all
the way from 10 Hertz up to 20 kilohertz
if we look at the low range below 10
Hertz they're still only literally like
a 2 or 3 decibel drop off this is some
of the most impressive figures I've seen
coming out of a motherboard to this date
so a great job on the frequency response
and going through the back of the
motherboard you get 10 USB slots 8 of
which are USB 3 one of which is USB 3.1
a and another which is USB type-c you
also get dual band wireless appears -
combination port and also a bias flash
back button there's also support for
optical out on your audio or 5.1 channel
manual surround sound and last but not
least you get dual one gigabit per
second Intel NICs
integrated into this motherboard of
course the fatality series of these
motherboards have that 10 gigabits per
second solution if you need that so no
you guys there it is with the x3 99m
Taichi motherboard from my testing this
thing is just as good as the x3 99 Tai
Chi motherboard of course you get that
shorter distance however making it a
great solution for people who want to
fit it in a micro ATX motherboard of
course there are some compromises the
ddr4 slots being the main one you do
lose a 2-1 speed PCIe slots but you do
still get three PCIe speed 16 slots and
they are still reinforced to make them
stronger although I've never had a
problem with the normal pre steel
solutions the sila ports itself you do
get eight solder three ports and two you
dot two slots to sew expandability and
options are here on this motherboard
especially for a micro ATX solution the
x3 99 it does get the approval from me
of course though with the x3 and I know
other words they are quite expensive on
average I do believe they are the most
expensive motherboards out there at the
moment at least to the high-end desktop
consumer market I know guys hope you
enjoyed this review if you did then be
sure to hit that like
and let me know in the comment section
below what you think about this
motherboard I love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon so
stay tuned peace out for now bye
I know that's a bit of a marketing term
but you do get 316 speed slots on the
Tai Chi M so you're one speed slots
being something like a naturally
aspirated engine four-speed turbocharged
you're getting three supercharged turbo
PCIe slots
now looking at the rear of the
motherboard you get h 9 10 9 now look at
these it's coming through stop fighting
me in okay ha don't really isn't it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
