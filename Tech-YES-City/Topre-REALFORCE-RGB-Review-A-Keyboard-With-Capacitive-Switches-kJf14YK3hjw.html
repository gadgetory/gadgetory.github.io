that I've only ever heard stories about
but never tried until recently and
ladies and gentlemen today I present to
you the grand master of the mall the
rook to e5 checkmate
game over Bobby Fischer finale of
keyboards or Yoshi how to hover if you
play shogi that is the real force RGB
from Top Rank welcome back to tech city
this is brand coming to you guys today
with a premium keyboard one that
features the top rate electrostatic
capacitor switches and RGB backlighting
now if you thought it didn't get any
better than cherry MX blues clears or
greens or any other switch you are using
with feedback then you would be mistaken
ever longed for better feedback and less
noise on a switch than blues well this
is what you're going to get with the top
ray real force capacitor switch the keys
are simply phenomenal to type on and
putting the keyboard on my desk and
running a typeracer test they hit 114
words per minute on my first turn not
only this but this was on the fastest
actuation setting - and with that I will
run a quick noise test for you guys I
quite literally could feel the tacks
coming up on the screen before I was
even bottoming out on the keys something
I haven't even experienced on a cherry
MX red in other words this would not
only be awesome for people typing for
long sessions and streamers wanting to
keep the noise down but also competitive
gamers looking for that extra edge on
their opponents as I alluded to before
with the fastest actuation setting the
new top rate capacitor switch allows you
to change the actuation points on the
fly from three millimeters to two point
two millimeters it's all the way to 1.5
millimeter with the 1.5 mil setting
being suited for gamers who are at the
Atmos top of their game and need the
fastest actuation as possible and of
course the 3 mil setting being for
savages like myself who need forgiveness
and make a lot of mistakes when typing
though with this innovation I've never
heard of this from a keyboard before and
as things like this the set-top ray in a
league of their own when it comes to
keyboards though it doesn't just stop
there they have all
implemented 1,000 Hertz native polling
rate and I've included an easy-to-use
software suite the program not only
allows you to utilize extra lighting
settings but also control individual key
backlighting and moreover control
individual actuation points on every
single key then after that you can save
everything to a custom profile and
change it on the fly as well really
straightforward and simple though even
if you don't like the software you can
still control the lighting and actuation
points still manually from the keyboard
itself lastly another cool feature
related to the lighting was that you can
change the colors on even the little num
cap scrolling key lock keys to anything
you like now on to the hardware itself
where things only get better it features
double shot PB T key gaps for that extra
durability and slightly heavier feel
when typing knowing that the stability
of the keys are incredible
the consistency across every key is
spot-on and the rugged matte gunmetal
gray look just looks pronto I mean I
quite simply can't fanboy this switch
and keyboard enough and even then I
wouldn't be fanboying I'm just being
honest with Jo
though I will quickly point out that
there is no included wrist rest and no
included key cap puller which I would
have liked to have seen both included if
possible though after pulling off the
key caps you can see that the
electrostatic charge membrane Keys work
a little bit different other switches
that you may be familiar with I like to
think of it as combining the best of
both worlds to give you a key that is
quite simply awesome also the full hanky
roll over claims seem legit to which
when I did a spam test that did indeed
work really well at least for my 10
fingers running over half the keyboard
at one time I quite simply couldn't
press anymore and the keyboard held up
perfectly fine looking at the
construction of the keyboard it is rigid
and weighs in at around twelve hundred
and sixty-four grams with a combination
of metal and hard plastic use throughout
the keyboard moving on to the bottom of
the keyboard it features four grips on
the corners and an adjustable lever to
give you two different levels of height
looking at the RGB backlighting from a
hardware side of things the lights have
an aura type lighting effect that
reflects off the metallic coated back
plating which also helps contribute to
that consistency when typing the keys
have a very subtle serif font and
there's also volume keys included at the
top right of the keyboard next to that
is the actuation key to make this a 1:08
cap keyboard in total so everything
sounds perfect thus far there is that
little price factor that is lingering in
the room and that is if you are in the
US then this keyboard will set you back
about 289 USD or if you're in eyes you
can currently get this keyboard for
around 330 AUD which comes in cheaper
than the US pricing relative comparison
also the keyboard is about 28,000 yen in
Japan and is interestingly enough
currently the number one selling
keyboard in Japan online above any other
price keyboard so I guess I'm not the
only one that shares this same sentiment
about the top rate keyboard so expensive
it may be but it will probably be the
best keyboard you would have ever have
typed on and now game on if you're a pro
gamer you guys hope you enjoyed this
review and if you did then be sure to
slip us a like and let us know in the
comments section below have you ever
typed on a top-rate keyboard before if
so what was the experience like and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
back about a bit a little bit a keyboard
then let us know in the questions or
comments yeah so most difficult review
ever cars cars and more cars not equally
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
