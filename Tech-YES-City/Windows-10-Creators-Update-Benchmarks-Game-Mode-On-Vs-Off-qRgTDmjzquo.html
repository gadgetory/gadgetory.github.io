released for over a good month now and a
lot of people are benchmarking the
update versus the previous version the
anniversary update and finding that
there's pretty much no difference or
they're getting better results on the
previous update however they are testing
on high-powered machines today I'm going
to be testing the creators update on my
semi potato laptop and the results may
surprise you welcome back to tech city
this is brian coming to you guys today
with the creators update comparison with
game mode turned on vs. game mode
disabled versus the previous anniversary
update additions on doing three
benchmarks across three different games
on my medium specter laptop now this
laptop includes a fork or a threaded CPU
which is costed around 2.8 gigahertz and
it's on the Haswell architecture the GPU
is also quite fairly old it is a gtx
860m with two gigabytes of vram onboard
and now the three games that we are
testing are GTA 5 dota 2 and csgo and
now with the Windows 10 creators update
which was released in April last month
it brought a lot of issues where people
were having a lot of problems myself
included however I recently did an
optimization guide where you can enhance
the performance and also eliminate a lot
of the problems I'll put the link in the
description or up here for your ease of
use and also with that being said the
creator's update introduced a new mode
called game mode where a lot of people
liked it or they disliked it and a lot
of people who liked it said the gaming
felt smoother especially on an outdated
machine such as my laptop here and now
with Windows game mode in the creators
update edition to turn this on you just
hold the Windows key and press G and
then go to the mechanical wheel and then
you can turn Windows game mode on for
any different game especially triple-a
titles this will definitely work and now
digging straight into the FPS figures in
csgo and I used a community-made
benchmark map so this is completely
apples to apples
and with game mode turned on we scored
150 average FPS with a minimum of 14
comparing that to game mode disabled
with also game DVR disabled in the
creator's update we scored 142 average
FPS with a minimum of 14 and then
looking at the anniversary update
edition with game DVR disabled
we scored 154 average with a minimum of
15 so it looks like in this csgo
benchmark the anniversary update did
score a victory for raw FPS and now
looking at dota 2 where I went middle on
all three occasions and I did benchmark
this numerous times with the character
learner and with game mode turned on I
scored 120 for average FPS with 117
minimum and with game mode turned off
I scored 116 average with a 110 minimum
and the anniversary update Edition
scored a 118 with a minimum of 111 FPS
so it looks like in dota 2 game mode
turned on did score the victory and then
the last game we have up here is GTA 5
with game mode turned on we scored 108
average FPS with a minimum of 103 with
game mode turned off
we scored 106 average FPS with a minimum
of 100 and then the anniversary update
we got 109 and 103 minimum so the raw
FPS figures show that with this laptop
which is more sensitive than a high-end
desktop gaming PC there was no big
differences between the creator's update
with game mode turned on versus the
anniversary edition which was tweaked
however the one thing that came out of
the raw FPS numbers is that having the
creator's update with game mode and game
DVR disabled scored the worst out of all
three so now this is where things get
really interesting I've heard a lot of
people in the comments say the game mode
turned on especially on an older
computer gave them a better or a
smoother experience than the other two
options are displayed here today and I
have to agree after playing games on
this laptop with game mode turned on
especially GTA 5 when I started looking
at all the individual frame times with
see the game mode turned on did indeed
provide the smoothest experience and we
started looking at dota 2 and csgo and
they weren't much of a difference in
those two games but it did still feel
smoother in all three games that I've
tested and this is something that
ironically enough to 0.1% and 1% lows
wouldn't have pointed out as they would
have actually have shown that the
anniversary edition scored the best in
all three examples so anyway guys that's
what the creator's update can do in my
opinion it does give the smoothest
experience and it's an experience like
this that my old potato PC is going to
be happy with so with high end desktop
gaming pcs I'm sure it wouldn't make
that much of a difference though if you
are on an older PC or if you are on a
laptop then game mode can definitely
help out and give you a smoother
experience in my opinion at least in the
testing that I've done here today anyway
guys would love to read your comments as
always let me know in the comment
section below if you've tried the
Creator 10 update if so if you've had
problems if you haven't or if you have
had a smoother experience on it and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
