now these things you've
probably seen them before
if you've come into used PCs.
I've pulled out quite a few of these,
and sometimes people
just even give me them
and they say I've got completely
no use for these old potatoes.
On that same note, however,
when you guys have seen
one of these in one of my used parts signs
you've asked me to test them out.
So, today we've got a heap
of different Quadros here.
I think this one is a 2000
and this one is a K600.
We've also got an AMD ATI hybrid.
So I'm guessing that's
from the 5000 series era.
So it's very old as well.
And then we've got this
here which is an FX 4600.
So we're going to be running
some tests on these cards
to see if they can game in 2019,
or just check if you should
just chuck 'em in the rubbish.
However, before we do that,
and these things do have these
cool little handles on them,
today's video sponsor is
Wix dot com slash go slash techyescity.
We'll talk about them later in the video,
but basically you can build
yourself a free website.
No strings attached.
Link's in the description below,
but let's get back to the testing.
So the first card we're going to be
putting on the test bench is actually
the newest of the bunch and the cheapest.
Coming in at a 199 USD when
it was released of March 2013.
Uses the Kepler architecture and also has
192 CUDA cores clocked at 876 megahertz.
However, it does only have one
gigabyte of DDR3 video RAM.
I believe I read that right, one gigabyte.
So, I don't think this thing is going
to be up to the task of performing,
but let's whack it on the test bench
and see if it can play
some easy to play titles.
So the results actually kinda
surprised me for this card.
It comes in with a Fire
Strike score that's worse
than that of Intel's HD graphics,
but it still managed to play Dota 2 at
1080p low settings with a hundred
percent screen resolution.
But as we can see with
the 1% and .1% lows,
this DDR3 memory and its memory bandwidth
is clearly bottle-necking this card.
I believe if it had a better subsystem
it could give out better FPS.
And when we played CS:GO
that was a complete disaster,
getting just over 30 FPS,
so it was really stuttery
at 1080p low settings.
I mean, sure you could lower
the settings even more,
but we've got some other potato cards here
that we want to check out and see
if they can game any better than this.
But of course what about Apex Legends?
It did manage to boot, but, yeah,
we got like a 19 FPS
on 720p lower settings.
So this one's kind of a no-go.
Next up here we've got the Quadro FX4600.
Now this is the biggest card I have here.
And it's also the most expensive
when it was released at retail,
coming in at 1999 US dollars.
It was released in March of 2007.
It supports up to DX 10.
And it has 768 megabytes of GDDR3,
so it actually does in
my opinion, I believe,
have better memory than the
K600 which was released in 2013.
In terms of its architecture,
they were using the Tesla architecture
with 96 shading units.
I don't know, however, if they called them
CUDA cores back at this time.
But regardless, let's whack
this thing on the test bench
and see how it goes.
So the results was
actually really interesting
with this card compared to the K600,
and mainly in a couple of ways.
First off, Fire Strike didn't boot at all.
It just didn't flat out work.
And that's because it doesn't
again have DX 11 support.
But Dota 2 gave us some
really interesting results.
This one here got 61 average FPS
and a 1% low of 41 and a .1% low of 17.
So it did in fact did a
lot better than the K600
due to the fact that it
was using GDDR3 memory
as opposed to the K600
which was using DDR3.
Even though it had roughly
250 megabytes less VRAM,
it still performed better
because it had faster VRAM.
However, I will note that one of the cards
that I put on the test bench initially
didn't work at all, so it was a DOA card.
But this here, the second one I put in,
actually worked okay.
Next up here we have the in-betweener.
This is the Quadro 2000.
This was released in December
2010 with an MSRP of $599.
Now it features a 192 CUDA
cores on the Fermi architecture.
This is that one that we all know
that got hot and hungry for that power.
Yet this card itself
doesn't require a six pin
and uses all it's power
from the PCI-E bus,
and has a clock speed of 625
megahertz on those CUDA cores.
With one gigabyte of GDDR5 VRAM.
So in terms of the memory being used,
this one does have the
best of three Quadros here.
But with that said, let's
see if those Fermi CUDA cores
can outpace those Kepler ones.
So we just finished up
testing out the Quadro 2000,
and I got to say I'm pleasantly
surprised with this card.
Moving through the Dota 2 numbers
we were getting over a hundred average FPS
and the 1% and .1% lows
weren't bad at all.
Moving on to CS:GO as well,
the numbers were very playable,
and not just in the dedicated benchmark,
but also playing some multi-player games.
It was pretty smooth.
So for 1080p on CS:GO and also Dota 2,
this definitely hit the mark.
And then we ran a Fire Strike benchmark
and we're getting over a thousand points.
Very similar, off the top of my memory,
to that of the Intel HD graphics.
But of course there is
one more test to run,
and that's Apex Legends.
Yeah, we're still quite not there yet.
But what about Fortnight?
Yeah, we're still quite not there yet.
So last up in the stack
we've got the ATI AMD card
that I don't even know what it is exactly
because there's no identifier on it.
But we'll quickly put it on the test bench
find out what it is and
then run some benchmarks.
So it's saying is an HD 5700 series
but there were two models,
5750 and also 5770.
So opening up GPU-Z showed
that this was indeed
a 5770 due to the amount
of shader units of
800 versus 720 on the 5750.
So firstly with this card right here,
it didn't do well at all.
Fire Strike refused to boot.
CS:GO refused to boot, even when I put in
a subcommand of DX nine and
tried to force it to DX nine.
And then Dota 2 did end up booting
but we got like 18.9 average FPS
and surprisingly though,
the 1% and .1% lows
were similar to that of the K600,
so I'm guessing that, yeah, the K600,
that's a pretty bad card for gaming.
This thing is pretty bad,
but at least this things got an excuse
and that is it's older than the K600.
However, I do really like
the inputs and outputs
when this card was released for its time.
I think it was 2009 and you're getting
a display port, HDMI,
and also two DVI ports.
One thing, however, the
cooler on this is really loud.
This was back in the day when jet engines
on your graphics cards
were actually pretty cool.
But in terms of the actual drivers.
(card clicking)
At least the actual
cooler's still plugged on.
Look.
Hey.
At least the cooler's still plugged on.
Anyway, with relation to the cards
that we tested here today,
the Quadro 2000 surprised me.
The other cards I
wouldn't bother with them.
They're going to give you a
suboptimal gaming experience
even with the lower
settings possible in 2019.
This 2000 series card here, however,
especially on games like Dota 2 and CS:GO,
it gave out a very solid experience.
I mean if alls you wanted to do was
get into these competitive
multi-player titles,
you've got a few friends
that are playing them,
and you just want some some decent FPS
and you don't care a whole lot
about the graphics settings,
than if someone's giving
one of these away,
which I will be, I've
got four of these here,
so if anyone's on the Gold Coast
and they want one of these
I'll gladly just give them away.
It's not a problem at all.
Then this card here
will give you decent FPS
in those titles that we tested here today.
I mean Apex Legends is
out of the question,
but I think if they dropped
the graphics settings
with a 50% screen resolution scale,
this would be able to play 60 FPS
at 720p 50% screen resolution.
So if it's any feedback for Apex Legends,
they can get these old cards like these
working in their title, they just have to
sort of let people tweak
the settings even more.
So now in a nutshell after
analyzing today's results
and whether or not
these cards are any good
in gaming machines, I think one of the
quickest and easiest ways to identify
if one of these cards, and especially
if you get it for free, is worth keeping
is to just simply check if
it has GDDR5 VRAM on-board.
Because I guess Nvidia would have gone to
the lengths of putting
this decent VRAM on-board
if it only had the power
to perform well in games.
The rest of these other cards,
they may be worth keeping if you just want
to build a cheap home theater PC too,
just to watch movies or do something else.
But anyway guys, before
I get on out of here,
and talking about free graphics cards,
I want to talk about today's
video sponsor, Wix dot com.
Which is a free to build website service.
And basically what you do is just
use the link in the description below.
Wix dot com slash go slash techyescity,
and you can build yourself a website
so quickly so easily and
it will look really good.
There's all these tools in place
where you can just find
out an easy template,
and Wix will pretty much
help you to the point
to get something that looks
really good and functions
extremely well and when people can just
search you up on Google and find where
you're at and what your service is about.
For, instance, I made a
used local value PC site
in next to no time.
I think this took me
about 20 minutes in total.
And that's even with
recording the whole process.
And now I've got a little site, of course,
I do have to get stock back in.
I've got absolutely no
stock at the moment.
But I've got a site ready to go
if I want to help people out locally
getting good value on
some of these systems.
So if you use the link below
Wix dot com slash go slash techyescity
then you can get started
on your own website today
completely free and the
best thing is it will
really help out with your side hustle,
and one day if you eventually want to make
that your main hustle,
then this is definitely
going to be a tool that
you will want to utilize.
Anyway guys, if you enjoyed
