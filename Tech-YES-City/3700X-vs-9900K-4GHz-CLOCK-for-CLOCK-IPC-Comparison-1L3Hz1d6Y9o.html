the Zen 2 reviews out there and at least
around here the studio I could really
only get my 3700 X and also the 3900 x2
4.3 gigahertz all call clocks the 9900 K
it does go to 5 gigahertz but for a
while you guys have asked me to clock
these CPUs at the same levels and check
out performance and today that's exactly
what we're going to do we were putting
the 9900 K at 4 gigahertz and also the
3700 X F 4 gigahertz to see how they
perform in both productivity and gaming
numbers now for the memory I am using
3600 CL 16 memory then for the GPU we've
gotten our TX 20 atti there let's pull
up some benchmarks for you guys though
before we do that a quick message from
today's video sponsor wins if you guys
want to make a professional looking
website they cost absolutely nothing
then check out the link in the
description below for me personally I
started using this it's so easy to build
a website whether you're a professional
or a beginner who hasn't built a website
before using the integrated tools that
they have available simply drag and drop
things in that you like and don't like
and pretty much the Builder will do all
the heavy work for you and then leave
you with a final product that looks
professional and more importantly
doesn't cost you anything at all if you
guys are anything into desktop PCs or
even informational for that matter then
you can get building today using the
link in the description below Wix comm
slash go slash tech yes city with that
aside let's get back to the video so
getting into the gaming benchmarks first
I thought it would be a one-way
landslide in terms of Zen to since we
saw in my initial review that I did that
AMD had an IPC advantage over Intel so
putting these CPUs both at 4 gigahertz
at least in the case of Tom Clancy's the
division 2 will pull up the first game
where we saw that the Intel even at 4
gigahertz was scoring slightly higher
FPS than that of the 3700 X the 1% in
point 1 cent loads we're looking
perfectly normal though moving over to
csgo here is a game that sort of makes
this whole thing a lot more interesting
because we see here that the 3700 X
she came out with the victory here when
both these CPUs were four gigahertz 475
average FPS 114 one percent load 92
point one percent load their movie over
to Intel they got 451 average FPS
scoring about 25 fps lower than that of
the 3700 X and now here's the kicker
with csgo I've done a heap of latency
testing here on the channel with a
thousand FPS camera and this game is a
very responsive engine so if anything
looking into the latency situation Zen 2
has definitely made a lot of
improvements in terms of reducing the
latency on their CPU architecture and
this means that it's showing through in
a game like csgo where AMD have gone
back to the developers and re optimized
that title for their CPU architecture
and it's showing with the victory that's
relating to the IPC gains that we saw
and say for instance the Cinebench ah xx
which will pull up later but this was
the one title that showed the true
potential in my opinion of the 3,700 X
over the 9900 K but moving on now to GTA
5 here we see the swings slightly in
favor of the Intel scoring 162 average
FPS and then going over to the 3700 X
158 average FPS very close but again
this is a game that is quite a few years
old and I don't believe that AMD have
gone back with the developers and
reoptimize this game for their
architecture but it is good to see that
Zen 2 is keeping up with the 9900 K next
up is dota 2 with the graphical settings
Mac's completely and we see here we've
got 207 average FPS on the 9900 K versus
200 on the 3700 X both at 4 gigahertz
the one percent and point one percent
lows are looking very similar to so it's
pretty much an even match in this game
and to my knowledge and II have gone
back and reoptimize this title but of
course just going back and reoptimize in
a title may not show the true potential
of that CPU since the game at least in
previous testing I've done on OpenGL on
Linux actually runs a lot better than it
does on Windows 10 regardless of the API
in Windows 10 next up we got shadow of
the Tomb Raider dx11 1080p high settings
we see here 109 average FPS 57 minimum
and then over to the 3700 X 95 average
40
I find this one the most odd out of the
bunch since I do believe AMD did work
with the developers of shadow of the
Tomb Raider to make it optimized for
their gear but maybe that was just on
the GPU side of things but let's pull up
the next title here at farcry new dawn
where the Intel scored 131 average FPS
95 minimum then over to the 3700 X 119
and then an 89 minimum and this is one
of those titles that I do believe they
are reusing a very old engine that they
haven't updated for quite some time so
again what we're seeing here with the
trends is the games that are optimized
and especially when they pay attention
to AMD focusing on csgo and also dota 2
we see that either comes very close to
the 9900 care in the case of csgo it's
beating the Intel CPU and and as I said
before csgo
that's showing the Zen twos potential
can be really good if the developers do
optimize their titles for their CPU
architecture but now moving over to
productivity here's where the 3,700 X
starts to flex its muscles a lot more
than the gaming benchmarks are pulling
up v-ray for you guys first up we've got
sixty eight seconds on the CPU score
versus 73 seconds on the ninety nine
hundred K scoring a five-second
advantage and then the GPU scores were
the same using that twenty atti then
over to Cinebench are twenty the
multi-threaded the scores were heavily
in favor of the horizon 3000 3700 X and
then the single core speeds also showed
a big advantage to move at a geek bench
for however we saw the single-threaded
score actually beat that of the 3700 X
on the 9900 K then the multi-threaded
score did go to that of the 3700 X move
over to 7-zip we saw a victory for the
then two CPU both on the compression
side and the decompression side and then
next up we had koruna 1.3 I like to call
it Corona just after that special beer
that I usually like to drink once in a
while and we saw here one minute and 50
seconds versus one minute and 49 seconds
so very close battle in this particular
rendering benchmark then over to Adobe
Premiere Pro a 4k video render file 50
megabits per second bitrate with a
maximum
150 we score 6 minutes and 2 seconds on
the intel side vs. 4 minutes and 52
seconds on the 3700 x side of things so
this was a big victory for the Zen - CPU
then / - da Vinci resolved showed a
similar trend with the AMD CPU pulling
out by almost a minute in this
particular benchmark then the last
benchmark to pull up for you guys is the
power consumption figures where the 9900
K was scoring around 93 watts and then
the 3700 X was scoring 75 watts during a
night of 64 stress test idle power
consumption at least the initial hold
state was 23 watts versus 21 watts and
then the temperatures 66 degrees versus
61 degrees so very similar scores except
the power efficiency of course does go
to the 3700 X so pretty similar scores
on everything but the power consumption
onload where the 3,700 X did score a
significant victory
so now summing things up I know there's
going to be a few people that are going
to ask why even do these benchmarks
they're not realistic of what the
average person is going to do with these
CPUs I thought it'd be a great
opportunity to see the way aimed is
going at a raw clock for clock
comparison and show the differences in
IPC where it really came through with
the productivity numbers but not so much
the gaming numbers and that has to show
that gaming side of things needs a lot
of optimizations and the engines in fact
for gaming a lot of those engines even
coming out in 2019 are outdated and that
is of course showing with those fps
figures but another reason I did this
comparison is mainly because Intel's not
going to be on 5 gigahertz forever in
fact I'd argue that their next
architecture is not going to be anywhere
near 5 gigahertz so it's great to see
that AMD delivered big time with their
IPC gains as well as giving much better
power efficiency with the latest sent to
CPUs and now that does put the onus back
on Intel to now pick up their game and
get competitive and start bringing
something to the market that's gonna
bring better value than the 9900 okay as
I feel at its price point the $329 3,700
X is much better value for money for the
average person it's got better power
efficiency comes included with a really
good stock cooler and actually testing
this in a
from video if you want to check that out
I'll put the link up here for you guys
where the Wraiths prison from pretty
much extract the maximum performance out
of the 3700 acts without having to go
out and buy a water cooler but more
importantly one of the best things about
the 3700 ex is the backwards
compatibility with the motherboards you
can go out and buy a cheap be 350 or be
450 motherboard and then couple that
with a 3,700 X and you won't be missing
out on a whole lot compared to the x5 70
chipset and you'll still be getting
phenomenal price performance on Intel
side you need a z3 90 to get the most
out of the 9900 K and that's something
that I don't think a lot of enthusiasts
like because in my opinion enthusiast
Tech has always been about getting those
budget CPUs and extracting the most out
of them via overclocking or tweaking and
then having them compare against the
flagship CPU traditionally I mean times
are changing now but at least that
element of getting the most out of your
money
AMD still rings true to that and it's
showing in these benchmarks and even in
the initial review where I got the 3700
X up to four point three gigahertz all
clock anyway with all that out of the
way I hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button for us also stay tuned where I'll
be testing out the six core horizon 5
3600 look forward to giving you guys
some benchmarks on that if you want to
see these videos the moment they dropped
sub button ring the bell it's down there
and I'll also catch you in another tech
video very soon but on your way out be
sure to check out today's video sponsor
wicks where you can build a
professional-looking website for
absolutely nothing
links in the description below with that
aside I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
