has been released but it doesn't even
matter because today we are going use PC
parts honey on gantry and we're gonna
try and find some bargains but as I
hinted in the thumbnail someone on
gumtree
has called me out they said Luke Bryan I
have a GTX 1060 just for you so we're
gonna actually give him a call and see
if we can spin such a bogan voice off
that he doesn't recognize that it's
actually me at first so we're gonna do
that and already before I started this
month on the PC parts on a bargain came
to me I was selling a laptop and when I
sold it the person said would you take
any of these old PC parts I have here
they don't work and I took a look and
two of them were just old dinosaurs but
one of them was an i7 3770 with the
motherboard cooler had a refurbished
power supply so I figured straight away
that the parts inside probably worked
really well and you've probably seen
that video already on the channel so we
got that for 50 dollars which was
absolutely amazing
and then also this month two subscribers
have given me PC parts already so I've
got 2 X 56 70s which got given to me at
the EB Expo games conference which I'll
talk a little bit later in today's vlog
so big thank you to rob and also I met
with Madden today and he dropped me off
some ddr3 memory actually quite a lot of
it and an i5 750 so I'll be sure to put
those to the test in the next can yes
fix it episode and also a subscriber
over in the states is sending me over an
EVGA sr2 so there's a lot of used PC
parts coming in guys thanks for
supporting the channel but with that
said let's get on with this used PC
parts huh
so the first thing we have up here is
from a user called Kalani he is calling
me out specifically with a GTX 1063
gigabyte he's paid two hundred sixty
nine dollars for it and he wants two
hundred Australian dollars so I'm gonna
give him a ring and see if you'll take
one set but the trick here is I'm gonna
put on a tough bogan accent it's gonna
be so tough that hopefully Kalani won't
recognize it so let's give this a call
okay so Kalani did not pick up the phone
we're gonna try and call again later so
the next deal we got up here is a whole
desktop PC it's got an i3 in it so it
could be at the very worst a gen 1 i3
and in that case we can put a Xeon X
3450 in this thing it's got 8 gigabytes
of RAM 1 terabyte hard drive of course
you get the case you get a Quadra with
it as well so it does look like a pretty
good deal for 150 though I'm gonna go in
and try and offer $100 and see if they
will take it okay that way you mate
yeah I saw you had a gum tree for a
computer desktop yeah no I three eight
gigabytes of RAM
it might I'm in Highland Park - I could
come pick her up for a hundred bucks if
you're all good ya know why I just do if
you want to just text us the address and
the time you're ready and I can come
pick her up no worries mate thanks he's
Matt Mike so we just got off the phone
with Matt nice seemed pretty keen to
take $100 I don't know if he actually
heard that properly but he's gonna text
us when he gets back didn't actually
sound too promising but hopefully we can
get this deal for $100 because it looks
really good we just slap a GPU in there
in a bed of CPU and we've got one really
good price performance gaming PC so the
next thing we got up here is a GTX 780
for gigabyte I don't believe they ever
made a GTX 780 with 4 gigabytes of
memory I think was only 3 gigabytes on
the 780 so not exactly sure what's going
on there at best if they did have one it
would have been 6 gigabytes but he's
asking $160 so I'm actually gonna ring
him up and question him about this 780
and actually find out if it's not a 770
and if it's actually a 780 I'm gonna
drop in an offer of one hundred and
thirty dollars and see if he'll take it
and then we will go pick it up if we're
successful
okay so Daniel didn't pick up the phone
so that's two people who haven't picked
up their phones on a Sunday what's going
on guys this is like the day to pick up
your phone and sort of do bargain
hunting two out of three
not picked up their phone maybe they
know I'm trying to call them and they
don't want the bogan hunting the deals
so next thing we've got up here is a GTX
970 for $300 we're gonna give them a
call and see if they'll take 200 for
their lovely g1 GTX 970 you were trying
to call does not have an active voice
mailbox hi Glen hey y'all mate yeah I
saw you add on gumtree for a GTX 970
yeah you got 300 oh no but would you
take 200 yeah no I'd made I'm just on
the Gold Coast still up in Highland Park
over 250 are yeah I made it's just a
visitor you go get the I you go get
those own what they call them the ten
60s and they're about the same yeah
pretty much rubbish though oh really I
just wanted me mate said they were about
the same as a 917 but you can pick the 9
seventies up used
save a bit of money you know yeah well
the G ones especially they're the best
of them 9 70s and they'll smash the pen
sixties ah so you want about 250 and you
won't go any lower for 70 bit up nine
months ago so you know again they know I
was looking I lower than 250 yeah I'll
just give me made a call and I'll get
back to you and see if that's a good
deal made no worries Glen thanks for
that mate buddy so Glen wanted $250 for
his g1 GTX 970 now the g1 is actually a
really good 970 I will give him that
they were bend over the typical 970 S or
at least a lot of people were getting
really high over clocks on the 1970s but
calling the 1060 trash or rubbish is
really not that valid of a comment I
mean the 1060 even the 3 gigabyte is
roughly the same as a 970 performance
the B Rams roughly the same too so yeah
I'm pretty strong on that 200 Australian
dollar price point I won't go for 250
it's not worth it especially when you
can go and get a 1060 brand new with
warranty for year round 270 Australian
dollars so to hundreds loss I'll go and
9 months ago I believe that 10 60s were
out before then so paying for 70 for a
979 months ago was really a bad deal on
Glen's behalf but anyway let's go for
the last deal we've got up here and then
see if those other people will call back
as well so lots of the deals that were
gonna call for is the r9 280 he's asking
150th Street which is a little bit too
much for an online 280 I believe they
perform somewhere similar to like a HD
7950 so we're gonna come in at around
$90 as it is the vapor-x model it is
really nice if it is working and $90 I
think he might take it if I try and
convince him enough
oh Jesus so no one is picking up their
phone today it's frustrating because it
is a Sunday and I want to hunt some
deals so we're just gonna drop in offers
on all these parts that people didn't
pick up the phones for and hopefully
that guy with the i3 desktop PC comes
back and he's actually keen to follow
through with that deal because I've got
to get some deal this month there has to
be something I can pick up otherwise
we're gonna have to postpone this
because I can't do a use parts hunt
without hunting anything so he's
actually an interesting deal here that
they haven't put a number for but
they're asking for $75 and they are
negotiable so that's an online 270x
which is similar to a 78 70 I think an
offer a $60 would be pretty fair because
this looks like a decent card for 60
Australian dollars so I can definitely
use this in a budget build so while
we're not so busy waiting for the people
to get back to us whether they want to
take the offers or if they just want to
call us back for the deals I thought I'd
talk about what happened yesterday here
on the Gold Coast which is my hometown
and that is the EB Games Expo now EB
Games is a company in Australia a
retailer of games I believe they're
owned by Game Stop in the US and now
they held this big event at the
Convention Center on the Gold Coast and
it was just awesome except for the
horrendously long queue times if I had
to complain about one thing it would be
those queue times they were actually
pretty bad but besides that I got to try
out the new Wolfenstein 2 and that was
just really good it comes out in the
next couple of weeks I'm definitely
gonna be buying it it reminds me of the
new order just that story is just there
it just really sucks you in from the
get-go it's awesome I can't recommend it
enough
I'm definitely gonna be playing it very
soon and also my brother bought me a
tickets so you're probably wondering
like why would I be going to like a
console games event my brother bought me
a ticket he absolutely loved console
games he was like begging me to go and I
was like sure I'll tag along and while I
was there I met a subscriber from coffs
harbor as I said in the intro Rob he
brought us some Zeon's some X 56 70s he
brought us two of them
was just really I wouldn't call it weird
it was just awesome it was just really
unexpected gave us a couple of Zeon's
and man you guys know me I'd love my
Zeon's and in this case it was kind of
like giving an addict a fix and of
course it doesn't matter if I'm an event
or if I'm used PC parts hunting I don't
really care I'm always on the hunt for a
deal and when I was at the EB Games Expo
they had this mega store which was
really cool and inside that store they
had t-shirts gone for four dollars a pop
a strand also my clothes shopping is
done for 2017 I filled my whole wardrobe
with new threads 26 Australian dollars
in total actually wearing one of these
t-shirts right now and actually another
funny thing happened I bought a t-shirt
for my brother and this is what happened
when I went to give it to him and why
did you take the t-shirt so when all the
event was a lot of fun though it was
really busy and also thanks to all the
people who came up and shook my hand and
said hello love you guys thanks for
watching the content really means a lot
to me but also the last deal we got I
forgot to talk about was farm simulator
2017 I got this for 19 AUD it's a
collector's edition so it comes with
some few extras but I was going to do a
gaming PC on this particular game but
when I looked at the minimum system
requirements it runs on a 2 gigahertz
dual-core and 2 gigabytes of RAM so
basically you could run this thing on
mashed potatoes and you'll be absolutely
fine so if you guys want to see a PC
like that let me know in the comments
below I'm thinking something like a
minesweeper PC solitaire and farm
simulator 2017 on this rig
some of the guys I just got back from
picking up the i3 system will actually
go back a little while ago and met up
with Matt he was actually a subscriber
of the channel and watches my content so
I dropped the bogan act of course when I
go pick up all these PC parts I do drop
that bogan voice whether it's the tough
bog and all the surfy bogan and people
aren't surprised I think in Australia no
one really cares like as long as you're
not attacking someone everyone's pretty
easygoing and I was like I really loved
the culture especially on the Gold Coast
so yeah just I dropped the act no
worries about that what we picked up
here the i3 system it was really
surprising because the motherboard is
literally brand new like I'm pretty sure
this motherboard is brand new it's a p55
UD 3r from gigabyte and now the UD 3 are
on the p55 line and also the x58 line
they were just when gigabyte we're
getting it right in terms of mid-range
motherboards they were hitting the VR em
hard the motherboards were made so well
the BIOS was awesome I'd like to see
gigabyte bring this formula back in
there New Age motherboards I think
they've sort of like lost focus and
focused on things like RGB when they
should be focusing on AUD 3 our formula
I absolutely loved it so I took this
motherboard out I cleaned up this PC and
then I looked at the multiple I was like
this is like brand new so I took it out
I'm gonna be using it in a future
comparison so there's a little hint and
that's gonna be one what I'm using with
a Xeon gonna be comparing it to some New
Age CPUs so it can't wait to do that and
then we replaced it with a z68
motherboard and this is actually another
video idea that's coming so two video
ideas came out of just picking up this I
three so crazy thoughts are going
through my head at the moment and we put
in the zip tie cooler on the z68
motherboard with the 4 pin connector
2500 ke Beng job power supply this thing
is like 25 amps never heard of the brand
before so this is gonna make for a
really cool video I think you guys
already know where I'm going with this
and the other parts what about the
people with the other offers the guy who
called me out on gumtree he responded
and said he was actually at work so he's
gonna get back to me but it's already
like 8 p.m. at night so I'm still
waiting the other offers one guy came
back and said he already sold the
to 80 and some of the other offices just
haven't come back at all so don't know
what's going on there but at least they
got this deal here the i3 machine was
pretty good we got a really good case
awesome motherboard like brand-new
motherboard got these stock cooler in
the i3 which weren't that good but eight
gigabytes of RAM one terabyte hard drive
that's always a pretty good deal for
around about 80 USD but guys I hope you
enjoyed today's video and if you did
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know actually don't don't let me
know in the conversation below because
we only got one deal today so I was
gonna ask let me know the favorite deal
of the month but yeah there was only one
deal so kinda sucks that we didn't get
more deals but I was pretty happy that
at least we got something and also that
deal earlier before this video the i7
3770 that was a really good deal the
charger as well the things as months and
- really bizarre things happen in the
same day and one was like this charger I
bought off eBay for these batteries it's
like combusted or imploded I've never
seen anything like it before
and then also the monitor that I was
using on my Sony I bought both these
things off eBay and it was like a ville
trucks and it just switched off and it
doesn't work anymore so I've requested a
refund on both those things I've only
been using I've only had them both for
like a week in ten days or whatever so
really crazy I mean you gotta be careful
with some of that stuff you buy off on
eBay especially if it's like a no-name
brand that you've never heard before but
yeah that sucks I'll get them replaced
so I get ready for packs and I'll have
the gear ready to give you guys some
awesome coverage anyway I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
