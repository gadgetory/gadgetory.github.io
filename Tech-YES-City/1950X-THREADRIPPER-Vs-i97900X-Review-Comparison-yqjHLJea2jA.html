and intel announced their high-end
desktop architectures named Li the X 299
and X 399 architectures now Intel have
already introduced their $1,000
7900 X CPU which I've already reviewed
here on the channel and despite all the
drawbacks and flaws of that CPU it still
did have a place in today's enthusiast
market however this brings us today to
the 1950 X which is a CPU that comes in
at just under $1000 999 u.s. to be exact
it features 16 cos 32 threads and I've
found that this CPU that I have here was
able to be overclocked to 4 gigahertz
across all those cause not only that the
CPU out of the box comes clocked in at 3
point 4 Giga so it is pretty decent out
of the box for 16 cores 32 threads
especially for those guys who want to
come from a dual Xeon workstation for
example and are thinking about upgrading
to a platform such as X 399 however I'm
going to roll those benchmarks for you
and then we're gonna talk about the main
differences between these two CPUs
looking at the test bench specs used for
this comparison we have the X 399 gaming
professional from asrock this is a board
that worked perfectly out of the box and
without this motherboard I wouldn't be
able to do this comparison so big thank
you to asrock for this model water
currently cost around 440 dollars or if
you're in astray around about 670 AUD so
put the links in the description below
for that and then lastly for the cooling
solution we're using the H 100 IV 2 from
Corsair now we had to actually change
the bracket around from the stock
bracket to the included bracket for
Rison and since this is an ace tech
based circular model it was able to fit
with ease however keep in mind that
other coolers may have problems fitting
to the X 399 platform and the H 100 was
the only cooler that I could use
so the benchmarks as always do all the
talking and what we saw with the 1950 ex
was a cpu that kicked a lot of ass when
it came to productivity and when we go
through the list we had 7-zip Cinebench
pros onus Adobe Excel pov-ray all these
situations showed that the 1950 X was
beating the 7900 X both at its stock
speeds and it's overclocked speeds and
that was really good because there were
a thousand dollars if you're spending
this amount of money on a CPU then you
probably will want it to perform really
well and productivity I'd imagine
someone who has the money to spend both
on the CPU and the more expensive
motherboard costs which we'll get on to
a bit later in this review I'd imagine
if you're spending that amount of money
you'd want to be saving time where the
absolute performance and that price
performance premium over something like
arisin 7 1700 and the be 350 motherboard
for example is justified because that
amount of time you're saving is going to
be worth more than the additional cost
of the 1950 X however another thing I
decided to do with this review was
throwing gaming benchmarks and also
streaming benchmarks and we can see with
a streaming benchmarks that the 7900 X
does have a place in today's market if
you're a streamer in your life revolves
around streaming day in and day out and
the 7900 X is probably going to be the
best cpu for you however keep in mind
you can still stream and game on the
1950 X it's a perfectly playable
experience and if you guys watch my 7900
x review you realize that that didn't
pull ahead really of they even liked the
Verizon 7 1800 X which is under half the
cost and similar to the Verizon 7 1700
and also the 7700 K did score a lot of
victories when it came to gaming so if
your only experiences with gaming and
all you want to do is play games then
the 7700 K is going to be a better buy
for you than both of these CPUs and
another thing to mention is the Verizon
7 1700 can be had for under $300 and a
be 350 motherboard can be had for under
$100 and together that makes just one
absolute kick-ass performance PC for
streaming and even doing things like
Adobe Premiere Pro 4k video editing so
really when it comes down to it the 1950
X is one of those CPUs
you will want to get when you need to
save time and of course that is an
absolute must on your priority list it's
also before I get on out of here I
wanted to talk about the 1950 ex and
some of its behavior of traits
especially overclocking which I know a
lot of you guys will probably want to
get this CPU and maybe even put it under
water overclock it and see how it goes
so for this testing I did use a H 100 i
from corsair it was really the only
cooler I had around here that fitted
with the bracket I believe it's a stock
ace tech circular bracket that you can
put on and it does need a new mounting
system so x3 99s alignment of bolts are
different to any other architecture out
there so keep in mind though if you are
buying this CPU and you want to get a
cooler for it just keep in mind that it
does come with a bracket but if you are
using one of those coolers then you will
need to go find a cooler that supports
this bracket or you will need to go get
a new custom water block for horizon X
399 of course you can use an air cooler
as well which will work out of the box
but keep in mind the power consumption
is considerable even at stock settings
so we had a hundred and seventy-three
Watts out of the box with Verizon when
it was stressed in i-264 so of course
that is a lot of heat to keep onto the
hood but one thing to remember is of
course again 16 cos 32 threads at 4
gigahertz now one thing I will talk
about as well with the overclocking
behavior of the CPU is the actual extra
millivolts needed to get this to 4
gigahertz for instance 3.9 5 gigahertz I
was able to boot up and run all my tests
at 1.31 volts when I went up to 4
gigahertz I needed an extra 30 milli
volts in order to get that overclock
stable and running and of course with
that was a lot of extra power
consumption and a lot of extra Heat
so if you guys are buying this CPU I'd
recommend tuning it to its sweet spot
and finding out where those diminishing
returns really kick in and in the case
of Rison that's usually between 3.8 and
4 gigahertz
the 1950 ex of course being no different
as the other smaller variants and
another thing that was interesting is
the pricing of both these CPUs the 1950
ex is coming in at at suggested retail
price which is great
these 7900 X's coming in $40
I guess that's due to less demand
possibly than the 1950 X that's coming
in at 960 us and in Australia this
pricing is kind of following through a
little bit as well with the 7900 X
costing thirteen hundred and forty
Australian and these 19 50 X costing
fourteen hundred a strain there is the
cheaper 1920 X which is twelve calls in
twenty four threads which is going for
eleven hundred AUD and in the u.s.
that's going for around eight hundred
u.s. but one thing that interests me the
most was the motherboard costs the X 399
chipset variants were actually it more
expensive on average than the X 299
variants I'm not sure why this is
perhaps that massive socket does add in
extra cost to the board manufacture
costs because in America the cheapest x3
9 I'm bored I could find was around 360
u.s. the cheapest x2 9 I'm bored I could
find was about 260 u.s. and in Australia
this was the same deal with 400 a UD vs.
500 AUD respectively also two pretty big
factors to consider when buying a 1950 X
versus a 7900 X is the fact that the
1950 X has 64 PC a 3.0 lanes available
and the 7900 X has 44 lanes available
also with the x3 99 chipsets a lot of
the times ECC memory will actually work
on this platform as with X to 99 it
actually won't work I believe you have
to get the C for 4 2 0 and chipset and
that of course with the ECC memory will
only work with xeon cpus so now it's
time for that final verdict where i'm
going to tell you guys which i think is
better in what scenario in the 1950 ex
is for that person who needs those cores
and needs those threads you can get it
up to 4 gigahertz and as you saw in the
Cinebench the max theoretical
performance out of this thing is
absolutely incredible so if you need the
cause you need the threads and you need
it for those workstation or productivity
applications then 1950 X thread Ripper
CPU is going to kick a lot of ass
the 7900 X however of course it doesn't
perform as well because it only has 10
cores and 20 threads though it does have
better IP scene it does clock higher and
I found that someone like a streamer it
still does have a place in the market of
course though I will stress this before
I go out of here
both these CPUs are very expensive
investments so you will want to know
which one is best for you before you
pull the trigger on either these CPUs
and also another thing with the 1950 X
and it's gaming performance
it wasn't bad at all you could still
play games perfectly fine with the 1950
X and get a very enjoyable experience
and even today's GPU the 1080 Ti is
geared up towards higher resolutions I
just deliberately tested it at lower
resolutions for people of course that
want to know everything about these CPUs
however if you're into 4k gaming or
1440p gaming and you're getting it with
a high end GPU like a 1080 TI then the
game of performance is gonna be
completely fine so you guys hope you
enjoyed today's review of the 1950 X and
the comparison against the 7900 X if you
did the me sure to hit that like button
and let me know in the comments section
below if you had a choice between
getting a 1950 X and a 70 900 X which
would you get and why love reading your
comments as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
