CPUs especially the 1950 X which is a 16
core 32 threaded Beast the motherboard
manufacturers had to bring out something
to match that power so today I'm going
to be doing a comparison between three
different motherboards from three
different companies that is the gigabyte
or as gaming 7 the X 399 as raw
professional and also the Zeus zenith
rogue extreme and the differences
between these motherboards are actually
more than meets the eye and there's also
some little bizarre problems that we
encountered when testing all these three
motherboards out not just simple things
like included Wireless and RGB lighting
but also going into the bar and checking
out the overclocking settings vrm
temperatures after stress test and also
audio crosstalk levels so let's get into
it
welcome back to Jack yes it is brain
camber to you guys today with a
comparison of three behemoths
motherboards now before we get on with
this comparison I will say that all
three of these motherboards
are quite expensive they will definitely
set you back a little bit but they are
AMD's top-of-the-line X 399 high-end
desktop enthusiast motherboards that are
designed mainly for people who
definitely want to utilize 16 cos 32
threads and overclock them so what we
have here is three different boards the
VRMs on all three are very good eight
phase power design on the gaming seven
also the asrock professional and the
azouz rogue zennith the stream for the
MOSFETs how of the as rock and the Zeus
motherboards are using a true eight
phase design so they're not doubled and
they're using ir35 560 amp MOSFETs now
in practice these did a really good job
of providing all the ample power needed
for overclocking the 1950 X on all three
of these motherboards I managed to get
four gigahertz quite easily on a Corsair
h100 I coulis so that's not the best
all-in-one cooler especially if you're
using a 16 or 32 thread you may even
want to step it up to a 360 mil radiator
on that thing then we look at the gaming
7v RM that is also a true 8 phase power
design however they're using slightly
different MOSFETs so using the ir35 v 6
which is actually 50 amps as opposed to
60 amps however with that they are
reported to be slightly more efficient
which we did see in the test when we
overclocked all these three CPUs to
around about four gigahertz that's 1.3 4
volts we saw that the power was slightly
better on the gaming seven averaging
around about 257 watts direct power draw
in I to 64 and we compare that to the
azuz and the asrock
they were leveling out at around 270
watts
there was a slight benefit to the gaming
sevens vrm however that all three of
these were providing clean stable power
at 4 gigahertz on the 1950 X now what
about the vrm temperatures which is
equally as important as the actual
overclocks themselves if you have the
RMS that are running too hard you could
blow up your motherboard for example
which has happened to me in the past so
looking the vrm temperatures this is
where I will give the nod of approval to
the Zeus rogues zenith extreme which has
an active cooling solution which is a 40
millimeter fan actually stuck on to the
left side of the heatsink this actually
reduced the temperatures of the vrm
heatsink down to a whopping 52 degrees
versus the as rock which had 64 degrees
and in the gaming 7 horas which scored
at 71 degrees this is all after a 10
minute stress test in i-264 at 4
gigahertz at around 1.3 4 volts though
on that note of overclocking when it
comes to getting the settings right we
have to look at the bios and the
features included in that bias all three
have a great interface to choose
different settings for I will say that
the Zeus is just loaded with so many
extra features that I couldn't even
imagine myself using however the asrock
and the gaming 7 they also get the
feature set right and always look at
things like load line calibration
control phase control and also face
frequency switching and all three did
provide these settings and also all
three had great controls when it came to
setting the fan speeds I like to put it
on full speed of course when I'm
overclocking to get a great apples to
apples to apples in this case comparison
so all three the biases of
feature-packed also with the Zeus and
the Azeroth boards you can update the
boss within itself with an internet
connection so it does save a lot of time
very easy to do no all three motherboard
manufacturers with their motherboards
featured here today do advertise audio
very strongly on the boxes so I did put
all three to the test and what I found
was on the Zeus and also the asrock
motherboards the frequency response was
exceptional very close to being
perfectly flat and this is what you want
if you're editing videos the gigabyte or
seven however did have a bump in a weird
strange line going from around 200 Hertz
to 2 K so that's where voices will be
strong in this area so I'd like to see
that rectified in the future however
what about crosstalk levels which is
something for me that makes the audio
experience really good especially when
you've got headphones on and this is
where all three motherboard
manufacturers did score really well
extremely low crosstalk levels though
one really bizarre problem on the asrock
and also the Zeus zenith extreme was
that after the volume level was over 90
so 90 and unders actually okay crosstalk
is gonna be amazing
though after 90 as you went over the
volume level of 90 there was actually
the left channel leaking into the right
channel in little bursts and it's
something that I'd like to see fixed in
the next revisions of these motherboards
however for you guys using headphones
what this means is if you're on either
of these motherboards just simply keep
the volume 90 or under and you'll be
absolutely fine now another thing that I
have been talking about with
motherboards and especially in 2017 is
cosmetics and it does weigh a very
important role when purchasing a
motherboard and especially at this price
segment I'd also imagine people are
doing custom water loops and just
wanting to display their motherboards
and show them in the best light possible
and this is where I will give the nod to
the gaming 7 from Oris I thought this
thing looked absolutely amazing even
when the RGB LED lights were off but
when you turn them on especially at
night it gives off a really nice effect
and you can change the settings in the
software as well you can change the
lighting to whatever color you like also
has different effects as well so it's
great to see that the aura 7 was really
doing well in the cosmetics department
and then we move over to the zenith
rogue extreme which is a little more
subtle but it had aura lighting on the
right side of the board also the bottom
heatsink and also on the left shield
there was RGB lighting in all three
locations but you can change via the
software you can change these settings
to different effects to suit your needs
and then last up on the asrock
professional has the fatality branding
and on the south heatsink
you've got RGB lighting that again can
be controlled in Windows via software
you can also control the lighting in the
boss
self change the colors and also change
the effects too so all three
motherboards feature RGB and you can
control the different colors though talk
to you a little bit more about the
cosmetics all three of these boards
looked really nice out of the box the
ozu's rogue zenith extreme is actually
more extended and bigger than the other
two boards and also on that note I will
say that I do like the color coding on
the DIMM slots with the Zeus wrong it's
one thing that I prefer especially when
I'm working and I've got to switch
around parts and change things I really
love it that it's color coded you can
just whack in your four sticks of memory
and you're good to go without having to
read those little symbols and worry
about which slot switch so I do like the
color coding even though it's subtle I
think it's the way to go in 2017
now what about augmented benefits and
other features that come with these
motherboards this is where the azouz
rogue and also the asrock definitely get
it right as rock and Zeus have included
10 gigabits per second Ethernet
solutions the asrock has it onboard the
motherboard itself which is really cool
and then the azouz adds it in with an
option as an add-in n IC card that you
can install into a PCIe slot and of
course everyone loves integrated
Wireless added into their motherboards
and all three solutions have 802.11 AC
but the Zeus also has an extra ad
solution which does allow the speeds to
go up to four point six gigabits per
second which is insanely good in small
areas because the frequencies are higher
they do last in a shorter range but you
can get higher speeds because of that so
great if you're using networking at high
fast Wireless speeds as opposed to the
other two which will do great as
internet solutions moving on to other
things like onboard features all three
of these motherboards have power and
reset buttons installed
there's also mem test ok buttons and
BIOS reset switches on all three
multiple tower with the azuz I love it
how they've put them on the rear of the
motherboard so once you have your
computer installed especially in a
difficult case you don't have to open
the case up again and press that boss
reset switch there's also the BIOS
change button located on the back of the
Zeus rogue zennith extreme as opposed to
the as rock and the gigabyte
motherboards they have it inside the
case so I would like to see this on both
those two motherboards like the azouz
added to the back of the motherboard and
now another thing that really set the
azusa rogue apart
from the other two motherboards was
there add-in SSD m2 storage card that
works as random access memory you can
put in 2 m 2 drives put this into the
DDR slot and then after that you can add
a fan on top and you've got essentially
a lot more memory at your disposal so
this is great for someone for instance
editing a documentary with really high
bitrate footage I'd imagine those people
would use up a lot of random access in
memory so it is cool to see that a zeus
have added that feature in and i thought
something like this even though it's so
niche it is a really cool feature that
I'm sure will benefit people who are
looking to go to productivity on X 399
so many guys it's finally that time of
the video to talk about the most
scariest thing of all and that is the
price tags associated with all three of
these motherboards the Auris gaming 7
it's currently 390 USD off Amazon and if
you're in Australia 580 Australian
dollars so it is the cheapest of the
three solutions that I have mentioned
here in my opinion it is also the
cosmetic King I really like the
cosmetics the overclocking was good
however it was lacking a few features
that the other two motherboards had and
also the compatibility with Corsair
memory just wasn't there yet and Corsair
they make very popular memory and it
should be compatible with pretty much
every manufacturer out there so I was
surprised to see that even to this date
it wasn't compatible just yet though I'm
sure it will be in a future bias
revision now it's time to talk about the
asrock X 399 professional which comes in
between these two motherboards in terms
of price coming in at 440 USD or 615 a
UD in Australia you get the tang
gigabits per second Ethernet you also
get really good overclocking and
stability I've been using as rock boards
for years now I feel right at home this
is no surprise everything works
perfectly and it works really well I
also like the subtle features the simple
but yet intricate BIOS has a lot of
features available again overclocking on
this thing took me next to no time just
to find that stable 4 gigahertz
overclock and it's one of my personal
favorites with asrock I really love what
they do with their motherboards they
really give you the feature set the
sound the ni C everything's there and
honestly if you're looking for a fee
japax motherboard this is definitely the
one to get though you don't need the
tang gigabits per second Ethernet you
can go for the Taiji which is $100
cheaper so that is a big factor if
you're looking for a motherboard and a
savings of $100 for virtually the same
thing - $100 - Tang gigabits per second
Ethernet now it's time to talk about the
last solution the azuz rogues zenith
extreme which I call it the all options
included this thing had everything I
could want from a motherboard even that
MDOT to add in card to use as random
access memory that was really impressive
got 10 gigabits per second Ethernet
adding card if you need it and also on
that note it comes in at 500 USD or if
you're an Australia comes in at 867
Australian dollar side kind of like to
see the Australian pricing fixed more
relative to the US pricing bill if
you're in the States it's a really good
pick up if you can utilize those extra
options included I really like the BIOS
I really like the vrm and also if you're
going for extreme overclocks it's got to
eight pin connectors with very thick
pins so we'll do a good option for
people who want to take it to the next
level want those manual controls with
sensor probes which are also included
there's a lot of different features I
was just amazed by what this thing was
offering also looks really clean also
all three motherboard manufacturers have
done a really good job here today so if
you enjoyed this comparison then be sure
to give it a big thumbs up and let me
know in the comment section below if you
were going for X 399 or if you're
already on X 399 what motherboard did
you get or would you get love reading
your comments as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
