Australia 2018 this is absolutely off
the chain just like last year and we're
at the Coolermaster booth and I am
sitting in I don't even know what to
call this thing the Coolermaster hermit
pod it is just taking gaming to the next
level if you want something that's
comfortable but you want sort of that
relaxed watching a movie feel while
you're playing games this thing is
definitely going to give it to you it's
like the gamer lounge you've even got a
cup holder on this thing you can swivel
the arm in and out luxury at its best
now this is a prototype product
Coolermaster are definitely looking at
bringing something like this to the
market in 2019
they're actually trialing the product
out here at PAX to see engage whether
it's going to be received well from the
audience and at least they've got a plus
one vote for me and also plus one vote
from YouTube who's behind the camera
this thing is really cool but also what
else do they have on display here at the
booth let's take a little shindig and
look at these cool products
so here we are now Coolermaster are
releasing some of these new keyboards
they're coming to market in quarter 1
2019
now pricing an AUD really good thing
with Coolermaster price at least down in
Australia is they're pretty much priced
equivalent to the US pricing so means
you're not getting ripped off in that
translation like we see a lot of
companies doing when they release
products down under here in Oz so we've
got here 10 keyless low-profile Cherry
MX switches they're essentially the red
versions but cut down a little bit so
you go that linear switch you got the
low input lag and now we got the low
profile Cherry MX red switches so it
will reduce the travel time as compared
to standard Cherry MX switches just a
little bit I mean it doesn't make a
whole lot difference if you guys are st.
rocketjump ninjas videos when he's
tested low profile versus normal
switches does make a couple of
milliseconds difference I mean if that's
something that you need and you're at
your top of your game maybe again
marathon argument songs versus shoes
marathon run is still going to be good
but essentially they're implementing
that in this keyboard with a great
acidic RGB design metal backplate as
well as USB C connectivity so you can
just plug it in plug it out with these
travel around with this keyboard it's
also pretty lightweight as well and it's
coming in with a price tag with a 10
keyless 169 AUD or 199 AUD for the
numpad included so they do tell me the
key caps will be changed a slight
curvature when they released in 2019 so
stay tuned for that they do have some
feedback saying that there are a few
missed keys so the curve keys will be
fixing that but if we move over to the
left of me here we have RGB soft mouse
pads and the funny thing is they're
actually coming in with a decent price
39 ad for the full extended size that
will fit all across your desk the
material feels really good your mouse
isn't going to skip it all and of course
you've got to be the RGB bling because
previously all we saw was RGB on hard
mouse pads and a lot of people didn't
like the hard surface me included I do
prefer a soft surface mousepad
over a hard one so they do have
different sizes
it does look very clean it is coming in
with a good cost but also let's take a
look what they got for cases so beside
me now here we've got the SL 600 M from
coolermaster we took a look at this at
Computex but it is now officially coming
to market later this year they're
looking to release it before the end of
this year 299 AUD coming in a little bit
cheaper if you're in the US now the
front panel touch sensor so if you're in
the nighttime you like to keep things
dark these will light up the closer you
get to them also they've got two 200 mil
fans from the bottom pushing it all the
way to the top so it is a different
design in itself on the top here you've
got aluminium it's actually stamped so
it has a very soft pressed feel to it
really good in terms of quality the
build quality all round feels great then
you go the front of the panel that's
just completely enclosed to help with
that airflow coming in a different kind
of direction so now going inside the
case you've got the ability if you want
to vertically mount a GPU sideways but
with radiator support as well up to 360
mil rad on the top or the bottom if you
wish to remove those fans included as
well as 280 Miller Ed's and on top of
that you've got the ability to mount
extra large power supplies there's the
extended ones that go longer than others
so 1500 watt for example with the
included bracket and it actually goes in
an unconventional type of way at the
front of the case instead of what you
used to with the top or the bottom at
the rear of the case so this case will
be coming in around the middle of
December now another cool thing a pax
here if you guys are at the booth and
you're in the event then you can get
some seriously good discounts on some of
the peripherals here so stay tuned we'll
take a little shop for you if you want
to check it out but let's move over now
to a conclusion and here we are pretty
much coming out of the cooler monster
booth I'm behind two custom modded pcs
one being the Counter Terrorist one
being the terrorists for csgo these were
actually shown off earlier in the year
and since then they've had a bit of an
upgrade with the Auris RT X 2000 series
cards they definitely look a little bit
nicer in my opinion than the previous
series Oris cards but on top of that
you've got that blue and orange
aesthetic on both sides really cool
booth to check out definitely looks like
cooler monster have been listening to
your feedback my feedback and everyone's
feedback and bringing
some really cool products that are
actually not only aesthetically cool but
also have some functionality so if you
like that then be sure to hit that like
button for us and let cool and ask to
know that you're diggin the products of
course if you don't like the price as
well drop a comment in the comment
section below love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
