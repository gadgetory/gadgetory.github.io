there's a promote XP hey free if I get
that of the otic silver 5 will I get
some better temperatures like it will I
get a 1 2 degree drop maybe
welcome back to take us it is Bronco my
back you guys today with a video about
thermal pace however this time it's
going to be one year on so after buying
thermal pace
how does it perform one year or even
more time after you've bought it so the
contenders here are arctic silver 5ku
Laboratories liquid pro polymer tech pk3
some Animax stock heatsink paste with
their Animax e-40 and then we've got
here some I didn't even or this is
bonbon this is some bottom-of-the-barrel
stuff I mean seriously I don't really
recommend using this unless you're just
putting on an old junk CPU however let's
go and test these thermal paste or
thermal Pie
okay so first up here we have a coup
laboratories liquid pro I mean this
stuff's pretty expensive so just drop a
little bit on here painted up on here
okay so there's cool laboratories liquid
pro for you guys looks pretty good one
year on this stuff still looks as good
as it did when you first bought it okay
so next up here we've got the nm acts
Dow Corning TC five one two one let's
give this a hit
Oh hold on
okay so we can see that this stuff is
okay I mean it's not the best but it's
certainly not the worst I mean it still
looks okay after one year in a bit so
basically the Animax dow corning stuff
is mediocre okay next up here we've got
some bomb bond this is some just cheap
stuff bb10 that's what it says that type
let's give this a hit
falafel problem okay so there's the bond
bond you can see that's not bad actually
it's still spreaded okay despite being
the application or the tubing being
quite weird initially didn't do a bad
job okay so next up here we've got our
Tex silver five one of the most renowned
thermal pastes in the business by far
and I guess that's mainly because of the
fact that it's just reliable and so
anyway let's just drop a little bit on
here and see how good this stuff is
okay so there's onyx silver five Wow
look at that hands-down the best result
of all these thermal paste so far I mean
look at that you just see the thermal
paste is just spread it really evenly
there there's no holes or anything in
between where the paste has been well
pressure has been applied so anyway RT
silver five so far is definitely a big
winner anyway let's move on now to the
last contestant here okay so the last
stop here we've got prolene matech this
is PK three there's some of their fancy
fancy Dancy stuff that they're marketing
as one of the best thermal paste out
there now when I initially tested this
stuff it was certainly the best out
there but see here well man I got to gut
this stuff out that's some real hard
pressure I've had to apply just to get
this stuff out of the tube anyway there
it is on there
you can see there just looks like rubble
but anyway let's apply some pressure
here and let's see what we get
okay so there's the pk3 this is one half
years on this stuff is by far the worst
of all these thermal pace here this
stuff is just absolutely horrid I mean
you can see there hardly any of it even
stuck to the cooler and then you can see
most of it is actually still on the test
plate here and it just like it's
literally like rubber
I mean it's so bad this is this was the
main reason I had to make this video for
you guys because this stuff it just
turned into rubber not like it wasn't
really working as a thermal paste
anymore it just turned into pretty much
rubber so anyway let's move on now to a
conclusion
so in conclusion I'm going to pretty
much reiterate what a lot of us longtime
tech enthusiasts are already known and
that is that artic silver 5 is trusty
Arctic silver 5 for a reason I mean you
throw it for yourself this stuff worked
like it does on day 1 and I noticed this
lately because I've been testing a lot
of hardware I pulled out some hardware
out of my PC and I try to use some
ProLiant primatech pk3 recently and this
is the reason for doing this video this
stuff was just completely unusable and
so I got my arctic silver fiber like hey
this stuff works like it did on day 1 so
kudos static silver 5 so when people say
I'll get this thermal paste over this
summer base and you say look now I'm
just getting some artic silver 5 you can
show them this video and just say look
it's trusty stuff it doesn't matter if
it's this one performs one degree better
on day one this stuff's going to perform
better for two years and you won't have
to probably you won't probably have to
change it out you saw a lot of the other
thermal piece here even though primatech
PK 3 was the worth and you guys should
work on this and redo this thermal piece
because I think it's a bit of a joke but
you know you saw here the Animax that
sort of did degrade a little bit so you
know you'd have to change this stuff out
maybe after a year but the end you know
the Artic still of 5 it didn't do a bad
job and so I don't see yourself really
if you're an enthusiast you probably
have to change this stuff out for a long
time so that definitely needs today's
winner the cool water is liquid pro as
well that performed really well just
maybe a little slight degradation over
when I first got it so that was
definitely get the worthy mentioned and
that was pretty good stuff as well but
the bonbon as well that wasn't too bad
this was the wild entry card so
like I'm laughing because it's not
wasn't too bad I mean it's I wouldn't
recommend it for an enthusiast builder
but for someone maybe doing a lot of
work because this stuff's dirt cheap was
like $2 foot you know 10 grams of this
stuff I mean one dollar fifty actually
so but someone building views all the
time and not overclocking them this
stuff would be fine but anyway all in
all guys I hope you enjoyed the video
take what you will out of it but yeah be
careful with what thermal pace you
choose there's a big difference between
day one and two years on just keep that
in mind I found that with mitotic silver
5 and especially with the PK 3 the
article 5 was amazing
the PK 3 was a loser so anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this video if you have
any comments or questions then put a
comment the comment section below and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
and I'll catch you with another tech
video very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
