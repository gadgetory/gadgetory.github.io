msi booth they've got some really cool
new products on display we're taking a
look at the laptops today if you guys
didn't see the r-tx 2060 announcement
they're actually showcasing some of
those r-tx laptops with those graphics
cards going inside now two of those GPUs
will be max-q designs we got the 2070
and the 2080 going into a really small
form-factor we're talking 2.25 kilograms
in weight and msi makes this happen
because they're using the trinity 3
cooling solution which they say has 47
blades and ways really lights really
thin and it's also got three different
fans making sure that these graphics
cards don't overheat in a small
form-factor
and this is in an aluminum chassis so
it's actually high-quality they're using
for the key switches
SteelSeries membranes but what else is
going on with this laptop let's take a
look and then we'll move on to another
laptop that they got then after that
another laptop again and it's the last
day of CES so even though my voice is
blowing out these laptops are definitely
in
welcome back to check yes City and right
here is the GS 75 stealth that's the
official name for it it's a 17.3 inch
laptop it has a 144 Hertz a you
optronics 1080p monitor inside they're
claiming a three-second millisecond
response time it does look very sharp I
think they're using an HV a panel
because the viewing angles are pretty
good on top of that now starting prices
for these laptops we're talking two
thousand and ninety nine dollars with an
Archie X 2060 and that's actually not a
max Q design for the CPU getting in I
78750 H which has a six core 12 threaded
processor it's quite a beast CPU for a
laptop now with the SSD is 256 gigabytes
starting there's also room for
expandability so you can add another two
SSDs in there whether it be a 2.5 inch
form factor or another nvme SSD on top
of that so you've definitely got room to
expand the storage and since they aren't
putting hard drives in your typical
bigger hard drives they have only left
room for SSD expandability since the
thin bezel is coming into play and this
laptop does look very sleek now a little
bit onto the lighting itself they did
make a point of showing me a demo of a
new technology going in and if you guys
don't remember from last year's combi
decks they had the mystic lighting which
was all this synced up lighting that can
be controlled via software now behind me
they got some nano leaves and they're
playing a game that reacts to the
ambient going on in the game so if
things change the lighting condemn can
also change colors depending on the RGB
lights you're using and this is linked
up to the laptop itself so it can help
give you a more immersive feeling as
well as all the individual backlight key
lighting controls on the keyboard itself
so very fancy laptop with the GS 75
stealth I like the look of this thing I
like what they're doing with the
hardware and of course it's playing a
demo right behind me with good fps and
the noise is really low it's quite some
of the lowest noise I've heard coming
out of little laptop so far behind me
now is the P 63 modern they're taking a
different approach as opposed to the
gaming GS 75 stealth laptop in that
they're making it more for video
creators with expandability of memory up
to ddr4 32 gigabytes they're also
putting an i7 85 65 you in that does
help with the power consumption a lot
with the G
seventy-five stealth gaming the battery
life isn't a whole lot somewhere over an
hour to two hours depending on the
settings you use and the idle times on
that just using the desktop was about
eight hours
this however sixteen is the magic number
sixteen hours battery life one point six
kilos or sixteen hundred grams and also
sixteen millimeters thick so it's got a
very slim bezel it's very small it's
very lightweight and it's also coming in
with the specs that you need to get work
done but also not use a whole lot of
power now for the key caps they're still
using the SteelSeries special membrane
switches that they've collaborated with
SteelSeries for and that indeed gives
you a better typing experience than a
mechanical keyboard and for the screen
they're also going with a 1080p IPS 16
Hertz solution I just got you there it's
actually 60 Hertz 16 being the magical
not but we've also gone on this a new
extended mousepad they're calling it a
glass surface and it's as big as a
phablet so it's quite a big size if you
are into touch pads and you want
something it's very smooth very easy to
use then this laptop is definitely going
to deliver that now in terms of asking
price it's starting out with $15.99
price tag it is released into the wild
from today as opposed to the GS 75
stealth which is coming on January 29th
but just like the GS 75 stealth it's
also got extra room for expendability on
SSD drives being as the base model comes
in with a 256 gigabyte solution if
you're a content creator you may wish to
add an extra 2 terabytes or one terabyte
drive this allows you to do that but
other solutions have included on the
modern is a fingerprint scanner as well
as a web camera that goes up the top of
the laptop allowing you to communicate
without looking up at your nostrils same
as the GS 75 stealth which is quite a
common complaint on laptops that is not
happening with the modern or the stealth
either and then the last thing that
featured on this laptop that they make a
pretty point of is the Qualcomm charging
point to quickly charge a smartphone in
as little as 35 minutes and that's about
all for the laptops here at the msi
booth as those two new models coming to
the market they're very excited about it
if you are into laptops this is
definitely going to deliver something
that's small easy to carry and has the
goods to deliver now behind me they do
have a console
that is in the making it's slated for an
April release but that is a 4k screen
IPS Ultra High Definition in a 15.6 inch
form factor just like the modern pretty
much similar specs but it's got a big 4k
screen if you need that especially for
video editing that is very useful for to
get that extra screen space in Adobe
Premiere for example anyway guys I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon if you enjoy this one - be sure to
hit that like button let us know in the
comments section below what you think of
these laptops and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can
peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
