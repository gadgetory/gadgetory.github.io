city's Barone's coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing and review of the
audio technica to 0-3 5 now it's been a
while since I've unboxed the product and
done a review for you but for you guys
so I'm going to enjoy this and you're
probably wondering already you've
already got a condenser microphone why
do you need to get another one well this
actually doesn't mind I borrowed it from
work for a week and I wanted to test it
and I wanted to see how it compared
against my bearing and b1 so today I'm
going to be quickly unboxing this and
then I'm going to be putting it
head-to-head with my bearing of b1 birth
on flat and tweaked settings and then I
want you guys to tell me which sounds
better that'd be awesome so let's have a
look unboxing this thing really quick to
unbox it I love it really well packaged
everything it's tightly packaged down
it's really a pleasure to unbox this
thing because as soon as you pick up
this microphone it is solid it feels
really solid it's a black microphone
with a metal casing covering the
microphone and it's also the speaker
looks like it's a one-inch diaphragm now
the old spluttered maybe I don't know
but it looks really good the quality of
them the speaker they put in these
things is really good or the mic is
really good on the back here we've got a
-10 DB attenuation switch if you need to
record at lower levels on the fly that
you can just hit that switch and it will
it will change the level so yeah as you
can see there the click feels nice on
that too so everything feels like pretty
good quality there so there's the logo
my school's slapped the logo on it so
not going to show you guys that but
anyway it's got a low cut or a high-pass
filter aka high-pass filter which if you
turn this it'll it won't record any
frequencies below 80 Hertz so if you've
got a lot of bass then you can just hit
that low-cut filter and it won't be
picking up those really low frequencies
anymore but for the purposes of this
video I'm going to leave it on this
setting since there's no bass guitars in
the background so that's the microphone
let's move on what else do you get in
the package you get a shock mount now
this is it feels really lightweight and
it also feels very very durable as you
guys know the bearing er
a lot of the barium Pro specially the
products I reviewed you guys probably
know by now the Antonine debayering err
is durability
I mean barring a products just don't
last I mean the shock mount that I got
with my bearing of b1
the you know these little cables here
they're already starting to break I
think it'll break in a few months so
this one looks really solid and this
shock mount looks like it will last so
that's a good thing so lastly but not
leastly they give you a leather pouch
with audio technica printed on it as
well so that feels pretty good and it
looks pretty good as well anyway let's
get on now to the microphone we'll do a
test on flat and tweaked and then I will
compare it to the bearing of b1 and I
want to on a note let you know I want
you guys to let me know which one sounds
better anyway let's move on so here is
the audio technica 2 0 3 5 let me know
what you guys think this is on flat from
about 2 inches from the microphone also
this so there's no tweaks applied to the
mic preamp there's no changes in the
video rendering software as well so or
video editing software let's move back
now to 5 inches so this is from about 5
inches this is what the microphone
sounds like let's move back into 2
inches this is where I guess the sweet
spot is for these microphones if you're
doing broadcasting or commentary so
let's move on now to my tweaked settings
and see which you guys like and then
we'll move on to the behringer b1 all
right this is the audio technica 2:03
five on my tweaked settings on the mic
preamp and this is also a little few
little adjustments that have been made
in video editing software so let me know
what you guys think does it sound better
than flat and also let me know I'm going
to test the bearing of b1 from now here
on also I'll move back to five inches
for you guys this is from 5 inches 5 4 3
2 1
let's move back in now to 2 inches the
nice sweet spot for these condenser
microphones also what do you think about
the look of this microphone as well do
you think it looks better than the
bearing of b1 keep in mind that I have
resprayed the bearing of b1 so maybe
this needs a respray to read as well
then it might work a bit faster read
goes faster baby but anyway let's move
on to the bearing and b1 for you guys
so this is the BAE ring of b1 and this
is flat so no settings on the pram have
been changed no settings also in my rent
video editing software haven't been
changed either so I'm going to give you
guys a chance to listen to this thing
flat this is about two inches from the
microphone if I move back this is about
five inches from the microphone so you
guys be the judge which sounds better
flat versus flat now I'll move on now to
tweet so let's move on now the tweak
settings so here's the bearing of B one
on my tweaked settings so I've asked
that play a little few tweaks on the
preamp and this is what it sounds like
from about two inches I guess I'll move
back for you guys this is about five
inches so I don't know let me know what
do you guys think do you think the
bearing of b1 sounded better than the
audio technica or did you think the
audio technica sounded better than the
barrier b1 I'd love to know personally I
don't know they both sound pretty damn
good they're both a little bit unique
honestly ivory sprayed this red and I
liked it however I do like I said before
I do think this shock mount will give
out in the near future so I'm scared of
that day but in the meantime yeah a
really high-quality product from Audio
Technica that I can recommend for you
guys if you want a nice solid mic for
recording guitar for recording your
voice tell them whatever you want to do
you guys I hope you enjoyed this review
if you did please give a thumbs up and
if you haven't already hit that sub
button yeah yeah because every sub
supports tech acity and when I get more
subs and I get more support I'd do more
reviews I do also do a lot of requests
so if you got requests please send me a
PM as well and I'll see what I can do
anyways bizarre fan-out Barone's bait</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
