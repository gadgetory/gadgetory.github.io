pcs for five kids good got this right
here it's my blue card that enables me
to actually give these PCs away in Oz
and so we're gonna go around the schools
and ask who wants these pcs if there's
underprivileged kids that are in need of
them but if we come into a lot of
hassles and honestly we have come into a
lot of hassles just trying to give them
away just it's crazy in 2018 that it
there's so much effort just to give
something away for free and if we do
come into some troubles again then I'm
gonna ask you guys the audience to see
if you know anyone on South East
Queensland that is underprivileged and
could use these pcs because last time I
went to the schools they were kind of
like trying to pass me off to a high
school and in a high school if this is
my sort of personal opinion if someone
can get a job and sort of make their own
PC than they should because when I was
14 years old as soon as I was able to
get a job I went out and got a job and
built my first PC and so I kind of
believe in that maybe if someone's under
privileged and they're a little kid and
they can't work and their parents are
doing a tough they're the kind of kids
I'm looking forward to give these pcs
away - without further ado let's go
around and see what we can do
so we went into the local school just
down the road and they said I got to
come in for a meeting tomorrow at 11:30
so it sounds like we might be able to
give away one of these pieces tomorrow
finally but now we're gonna go around to
a couple more schools and just see if
they will accept the PCs now this is
kind of looking good let's go so we just
finished up at the second school and
they took all my details again but it
was a different person an administration
desk this time and I showed them the
blue card so it seems like it's a
smoother process now that I've got this
little card here which I think makes all
the difference
but regardless we're gonna head to the
third school now and this will be about
all the time we'll have because it's
getting closer to 4 o'clock and then all
the schools shut down then man who wants
a gaming PC but they don't know it yet
and they're underprivileged let's find
out
so we just made a stop at the third
school now and this is almost near
closing time and they got all my details
again so I think they're a little bit
more receptive now that I got the blue
card so there's hopefully going to be
some good news finally because these
five pcs have been sitting in my studio
collecting dust and I want to give them
away I want to give them away so it's
pretty late now I just finished cutting
the ninety nine hundred Kay review that
was a lot of time and basically that the
school today I spent a bit of time there
and I was helping them with the video
work and I had a little bit of an
in-depth discussion about the gaming
PC's and I kind of found out I guess the
real reason why people haven't really
been replying to my emails I guess
around all schools and in general why
they didn't really want the gaming PC's
to be given away to kids at primary
schools and the reason for it is because
there's actually a big problem with
especially game like fortnight where the
kids aren't doing their homework
essentially and fortnight is sort of one
of those games to blame for that and so
they kind of see me maybe giving away
pcs is probably fueling part of the
problem and sort of when I took a step
back and thought of it that way I was
like hmm maybe this isn't the best way
to go about this but that being said
they are trying to guess convinced me to
give away a PC to one of the high
schools which I'm sure on that I'm sure
I'll come through with PC and give it
away to someone who's needy and a high
school but this is where I'm gonna call
on you guys in the audience do you want
to find underprivileged kids around
southeast Queensland I do want to give
these pcs away so this is what I'm gonna
say drop a comment in the comment
section below send us an email because
we're gonna find some underprivileged
people to give these pcs away to but on
that note I ended up finding out a
really good solution where I can help
these schools at least the one that's
local to me they've been very
cooperative and super friendly and nice
to me and they just said they really
needed a more camera gear the budgets
that they had to sort of put towards
these things were very small and it was
kind of sad when I heard some of the
numbers I was like damn okay I'm going
to start donating some stuff so I've got
a microphone that I'm gonna
I'm also going to donate a camera and
sort of set them up with an SLR camera
and microphone and then teach them how
to use that and start recording better
videos for their school and so that was
something that's cool it's coming out of
this whole thing I do want to help the
local community where I grew up in and
it's sort of not the way that I intended
starting out this series but one thing
for sure is the end of this series
there's gonna be five people who under
privileged and they're gonna get these
PCs and they're gonna be enjoying them
and I just don't know where the tangent
is going off now in this whole series
it's a bit of a journey it's a lot of
fun and also I just want to thank each
and every one of you guys for watching
the videos and supporting the channel as
well and all the people who have donated
PC parts thus far and that's kind of
another big reason why I wanted to
actually give away a lot of these parts
because they get donated to me and I
don't need them all like it's too much
guys so thanks a lot guys I appreciate
the support thoughts I love each and
every one of you and if you enjoyed this
one that be sure to hit that like button
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye if you
guys didn't know this is my Toyota 86
not Shannon's the person who actually
owns it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
