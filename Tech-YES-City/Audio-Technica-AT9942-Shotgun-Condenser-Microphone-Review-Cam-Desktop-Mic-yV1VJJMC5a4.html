brandy's you coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing and review of the
89 9 42 so this is the audio technica
condenser microphone so it's for it's a
supercardioid which means it's like a
love have super like real narrow love
heart shape that picks up the sound end
and it's for a camera so basically you'd
mount this on top of the camera I'm
actually using my new camera now to
review this product so hopefully it
looks good and now it comes with this
little stand is very easy it's a very
solid stand the microphone itself is
very light I mean when you buy this
microphone you like hey I really bought
this it's literally you know like I'm
really this is what i got for $45 so it
is pretty like it feels a little bit
cheap but it does feel solid in that
there's no if I rattle it there's no
clicking noises or no shaking noises now
does come with a windshield as well
which I've installed and it does work
pretty damn well so I'll give you guys a
quality test after this and it comes
with a little short cable so if you put
it on your mounted to your cameras not
the cable is not going to get in the way
really I'd like to see this a little bit
shorter maybe just to hear I think it's
got an extra like five centimeters of
cable length that you don't need it also
comes with an extension cable so if you
wish to use this as a computer
microphone you can very well do it and
they'll produce decent results as well
it's a modern microphone now the reason
I went with the mono microphone is
because I'm as you guys can see here I'm
doing a lot of narration type voice work
I do not need stereo so if you need
stereo may wish to go with an 89 9 41
which is a different model so these are
the Japanese these r JDM products
japanese domestic market products and
these frequency response let's get on to
that so it picks up from 17 hertz to all
the way to 1,500 hurts and it's the
quality is actually pretty damn good so
i have tested this thing so far and it's
pretty good so I'll give you a quality
test soon it's a very sensitive Mike and
it just works really well so it comes
with a leather leather pouch as well so
that's a little bit of a qualitative
feel to the product so it comes with
this nice audio technica leather pouch
for you to carry it around with and it
also comes with a little stand so if you
guys wish to use this so you just put it
in there and then you can sort
screw it down with this system so it
really works really mounts to a horse
shoe mount pretty easy and you knew that
as a sort of desktop condenser
microphone as well now it's not not a
true true condenser microphone I don't
think because it doesn't need any
batteries so I guess that's a bonus so
it's very sensitive and it doesn't need
batteries so for me it's perfect because
I'm going to be using this my got this
for you know general use with my camera
and it's going to be good so the
microphone i'm using now is like this
clip-on microphone which check out for
like five dollars so hopefully it sounds
alright though because my new camera
allows me to control the audio input so
they're recording volumes which is great
you guys here's the product $45 let's
get on to a quality test now okay so i
will just quickly test the onboard
stereo microphone at the moment so you
guys can hear what that sounds like and
i'll just quickly change to the external
microphone right now okay guys we're
coming back to you with the 89 9 42 now
this is plugged directly into the camera
it does not need a battery and I'm gonna
say first up is I do not like this
microphone the more I use it the more I
get to know it the more I don't like it
on a canon camera and I don't tell you
the reasons why I don't like it and as
you guys know I don't give you any
fabricated crap reviews I just give you
the truth this is the truth about its
microphone it's too low it's it's too
low to the lenses and so these Canon
lenses and the cabinet lenses and the
camera are amazing by the way the it's
so low that it picks up the stepping
motors noise in the Canon lenses which I
mean is really hard to hear I took those
like what was going on what's this
little errant errant noise and I put the
lens right up to my ear and I could hear
it like right up to me otherwise I
couldn't hear it this microphone is
picking up that noise now if you guys
listen really carefully you can probably
hear you didn't hear it in my canon
canon review because the autofocus
wasn't changing at the time so yeah
that's that's the first point that I
don't like about this microphone also
the second point that I don't like is
that it's a high impedance microphone
it's actually what I've researched is
that the can
cameras do not like high impedance
microphones so yeah if you want to buy a
microphone for your canon camera or your
Canon video camera canon DSLR make sure
it's a long periods microphone that will
give you the best results this is just
what my findings are presenting and yeah
so the start of the review if you're
going back to the start of the review I
was actually using a five-dollar clip-on
mic and that was low impedance by the
way it was amazing i'll show you guys
quickly it was just this little mic here
it's a buffalo microphone this is five
dollars and yeah i plug this straight
into the camera and didn't change
anything at all no no attenuation just
put the recording level on halfway no
effects nothing changed in the rendering
process as well and it got that and be
like i thought the sound quality was
amazing for a five dollar microphone so
i will be giving away these in the
future and stay tuned like maybe when i
do a big giveaway it's going to be
coming trust me and i do a giveaway i'll
be giving away like five of these at
least so i'll be giving away heap of
these i'll be giving away another
condenser so stay tuned for that also
yeah if you have any questions about
this microphone please leave comment the
comment section below also i'm going to
be returning this microphone as it's not
in my opinion it's not worth forty five
dollars in buyer i didn't spend forty
five dollars and a microphone for it to
his and pick up motor noise from a some
of the quietest lens of it i've ever
heard in the world so yes sir gonna
return this microphone i'm going to
order a rode videomic which has low
impedance and I'm know works well with
Canon cameras hey guys that's my
recommendations do not buy this Mick
Kjar canon camera if you have a camera
that can utilize maybe a video camera
that likes high impedance microphones
and by all means by this microphone for
that camera so the reason why this
sounded so good in the canon review was
probably because the autofocus did not
move at all and I actually had a ten
uation on in that too so attenuation
actually sort of nerfs the quality of
the audio bit so I don't like to have it
on I mean even though it's probably the
best way to utilize this microphone but
the bottom line is my phones too close
to the lenses and it's picking up that
lens noise hey guys i'm going to be
reviewing this soon the 240 you bite s
intel souls day drive 335 one hundred
and seventy dollars amazing look at this
comes with a factory seal like you know
that no one else has touched your drive
in the you know what since when it was
shipped from the factory to hear that's
how good that is and also I'm going to
be coming back to you guys with memory
cards on cameras how to tell a fake
memory card from a real memory card
really easy it takes five minutes any
memory card you do not have to worry
about comparing oh this is one the fakes
got this writing on it I got the easy
way i'm going to show you guys soon so
it's a really solid method so i'm really
i want to share that with you guys very
soon so I guys if you like this video
please give a thumbs up and also stay
tuned for more tech videos they'll be
coming soon and if you haven't already
subscribed echo City and I'll catch you
guys soon peace up and out brain easy
