Buran as you coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing and review of the
89 942 so this is the audio technica
condenser microphone so it's four it's a
super cardioid which means it's like a
love hat super like real narrow love
heart shape that picks up the sound end
and it's for a camera so basically you'd
mount this on top of the camera I'm
actually using my new camera now to
review this product so hopefully it
looks good and now it comes with this
little stand it's very easy it's very
solid stand the microphone itself is
very light I mean when you buy this
microphone you're like hey I really
bought this it's literally you know like
I'm really this is what I got for $45 so
it is pretty like it feels a little bit
cheap but it does feel solid in that
there's no if I rattle it there's no
clicking noises or no shaking noises now
it does come with a wind shield as well
which I've installed and it does work
pretty damn well so I'll give you guys a
quality test after this and it comes
with a little short cable so if you put
it on your mounted to your camera it's
not the cables not gonna get in the way
really I'd like to see this a little bit
shorter maybe just to here I think it's
got an extra like 5 centimeters of cable
length that you don't need it also comes
with an extension cable so if you wish
to use this as a computer microphone you
can very well do it and they'll produce
decent results as well it's a mono
microphone now the reason I went with
the mono microphone is because I as you
guys can see here I'm doing a lot of
narration type voice work I do not need
stereo so if you need stereo may wish to
go with an 89 941 which is a different
model so these are the Japanese these
are JDM products Japanese domestic
market products and the frequency
response let's get onto that so it picks
up from 70 Hertz to all the way to 1,500
Hertz and it's the quality is actually
pretty damn good so I have tested this
thing so far and it's pretty good so
I'll give you guys a quality test soon
it's a very sensitive mic and it just
works really well so it comes with a
leather leather pouch as well so that's
a little bit of a qualitative feel to
the product so it comes with this nice
Audio Technica leather pouch for you to
carry it around with and it also comes
with a little stand so if you guys wish
to use this so you could put it in there
and then you can sort
screw it down with this system so it
really works really mounts to a
horseshoe Mount pretty easy and you knew
that as a sort of desktop condenser
microphone as well now it's not not a
true true condenser microphone I don't
think because it doesn't need any
batteries so I guess that's a bonus so
it's very sensitive and it doesn't need
batteries so for me it's perfect because
I'm gonna be using this my I got this
for you know general use with my camera
and it's gonna be good so the microphone
I'm using now is like this clip-on
microphone which I got for like five
dollars so hopefully it sounds alright
though because my new camera allows me
to control the audio input so they're
recording volumes which is great you
guys here's the product $45 let's get on
to a quality test now okay so I will
just quickly test the onboard stereo
microphone at the moment so you guys can
hear what that sounds like and I'll just
quickly change to the external
microphone right now okay guys we're
coming back to you with the 89 942 now
this is plugged directly into the camera
it does not need a battery and I'm gonna
say first up this I do not like this
microphone the more I use it the more I
get to know it the more I don't like it
on a Canon camera and I'm gonna tell you
the reasons why I don't like it and as
you guys know I don't give you any
fabricated crap reviews I just give you
the truth this is the truth about its
microphone it's too low it's it's too
low to the lenses and so these Canon
lenses and the Canon lenses and the
camera are amazing by the way the it's
so low that it picks up the stepping
motors noise in the Canon lenses which I
mean is really hard to hear I took I was
like what was going on what's this
little errant noise and I put the lens
right up to my ear and I could hear it
like right up to me otherwise I couldn't
hear it this microphone is picking up
that noise now if you guys listen really
carefully you can probably hear you
didn't hear it in my camera okay kind of
review because the autofocus wasn't
changing at the time so yeah that's
that's the first point that I don't like
about this microphone also the second
point that I don't like is that it's a
high impedance microphone it's actually
what I've researched is that the can
cameras do not like high impedance
microphones so yeah if you want to buy a
microphone for your Canon camera or you
can a video camera Canon DSLR make sure
it's a long period microphone and
that'll give you the best results this
is just what my findings are presenting
and yeah so the start of the review if
you run back to the start of the review
I was actually using a five-dollar
clip-on mic and that was low impedance
by the way is amazing I'll show you guys
quickly it was just this little mic here
it's a buffalo microphone this is five
dollars and yeah I plugged this straight
into the camera and didn't change
anything at all no no attenuation just
put the recording level on halfway no
effects nothing changed in the rendering
process as well and they've got that and
that good like I thought the sound
quality was amazing for a five dollar
microphone so I will be giving away
these in the future and stay tuned like
maybe when I do a big giveaway it's
gonna be coming trust me when I do a big
giveaway I'll be giving away like five
of these at least so I'll be giving away
keep of these I'll be giving away
another condenser so stay tuned for that
also yeah if you have any questions
about this microphone please leave
coming the comment section below also
I'm gonna be returning this microphone
as it's not in my opinion it's not worth
$45 I didn't buy it I didn't spend $45
on a microphone for it to hiss and pick
up motor noise from a some of the
quietest lenses I've ever heard in the
world so yes gonna return this
microphone I'm gonna order a rode
videomic which has low impedance and I'm
know works well with Canon cameras
alright guys that's my recommendations
do not buy this MacGyver county camera
if you have a camera that can utilize
maybe a video camera that likes high
impedance microphones and by all means
buy this microphone for that camera so
the reason why this sounded so good in
the Canon review was probably because
the autofocus did not move at all and I
actually had attenuation on in that too
so attenuation actually sort of nursed
the quality of the audio bit so I don't
like to have it on I mean even though
it's probably the best way to utilize
this microphone but the bottom line is
my fans too close to the lenses and it's
picking out that lens noise hey guys I'm
going to be reviewing this
soon the 240 byte s Intel souls day
drive 335 170 dollars amazing look at
this comes with a factory seal like you
know that no one else has touched your
drive in the you know what since when it
was shipped from the factory to here
that's how good that is
and also I'm going to be coming back to
you guys with memory cards on cameras
how to tell a fake memory card from a
real memory card really easy it takes
five minutes any memory card you do not
have to worry about comparing oh this is
this one the fakes got this writing on
it I got the easy way I'm going to show
you guys soon so it's a really solid
method so I'm really I want to share
that with you guys very soon
so guys if you like this video please
give a thumbs up and also stay tuned for
more tech videos they'll be coming soon
and if you haven't already subscribed
take a seat and I'll catch you guys soon
peace up an out for an easy bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
