will say one thing Galax decided this
time around for whatever reason with
their 1070 TI
the e ex sniper to make it in a
off-white and now I'm not the only one
who has experienced this Greg over at
science studio made a whole video
dedicated towards how the aesthetic was
a little bit misleading especially when
they put on white on their website but
for me personally aesthetic hasn't been
the biggest reason to buy especially a
graphics card for me personally
performance and of course value for
money are the two things I look for when
buying a graphics card and so does the X
sniper have those two qualities well
today we're gonna be comparing it
against not only the 1080 Ti but also
the 1070 TI Hall of Fame and seeing what
the differences are between these two
cards
welcome back to tech yes City in this
tense every TI sniper here we're gonna
pull up some benchmarks but first we'll
pull up the overclocks because this is
the best overclock i've seen out of a
1070 i but not only that also the best
overclock on air that i've seen out of a
10 series card to date this thing got
over 2100 megahertz and even clocked
higher than that of the 1070 TI hall of
fame that i have here
now of course Galax could have sent me
out a very good sample but there's also
another thing that happened with these
overclocks and that is before I started
testing the card I actually took it
apart and took some b-roll of the vrm
which you can see is it's got a fatter
PCB it's also a well-designed card I
think it's a six plus two phase power
design they're using here but also I
changed the thermal paste around and I
used the different thermal paste so
unfortunately I couldn't get these stock
temperatures I didn't think anything of
it at the time but I believe this
thermal paste made actually quite a big
difference as at least when I compared
my numbers to Greg's this card was
performing phenomenally well the max
load temperatures even went overclocked
to over 2,000 100 megahertz was still
staying in the low 70s and that's on the
auto fan speeds when we put the fan
speeds up to 100% this thing really
responded well so it is a phenomenal
card in that the sense that Galax do put
a really good cooler on this graphics
card itself there's also a steel
backplate that does share the same
off-white scheme as the metal shroud
itself though you may also notice that
there's a light bar wedged in between
the steel backplate and the PCB this is
RGB and you can change this within
galaxy's own software itself and
galaxy's own software there's also the
option for preset overclocks 3 and 5%
and also a silent mode as well if you
need this card completely silent while
you're gaming also the options to change
fan speeds voltages and clock speeds
just like msi afterburner would but of
course for overclocking I still do use
msi afterburner though pulling up some
gaming benchmarks for you guys first up
we have Kingdom Come deliverance 1440p
max settings I believe the 10s MBTI
sniper will do very well at 1440p gaming
of course deliberately stressing those
settings to max out the GPU itself to
100%
we can see that it does fall behind a
1080i that's of course to be expected
but overclocked this thing was just
beating out the Hall of Fame and as I
said before I believe I got a really
good sample here with the 1070 and also
that thermal paste making a difference
but I will be making a video on that in
the later coming days and now moving
over to pub G here we see nothing out of
the ordinary point 1% 1% lows are is
expected and also the overclock is
making around about a 10% difference to
the performance of this card it's also
just slightly again beating out the 1070
TI Hall of Fame
since essentially they do carry the
exact same GPU die after the singularity
now in crazy 1440p settings I just
decided to use the inbuilt benchmark
which spits out an average FPS for you
guys you see here 65 FPS as opposed to
72 when it's overclocked and also just
slightly ahead of the 1070 TI Hall of
Fame and moving on with Final Fantasy 15
1440p high settings I personally noticed
absolutely no difference between high
and ultra settings but ultra really
taxes the graphics card to a different
level I think it's unplayable even on a
1080 TI just the stuttering but even on
the high settings one interesting note
that came out of this was the point 1%
lows on the 1070 ti when it wasn't
overclocked it did get quite a sizable
drop as opposed to being overclocked it
was a lot smoother same with the 1070 TI
Hall of Fame they scored similar in this
benchmark and then moving over now to
the last benchmark when I pull up 1440p
GTA 5 this is the pretty much max
settings I could put on this very high
settings at 1440p we saw again roughly a
10% increase in the amount of frames but
nothing was really out of the ordinary
in terms of 0.1 percent and 1% lows also
just slightly again beating out the 1070
TI Hall of Fame when it comes down to at
Galax cards hit very hard in terms of
price performance the value you're
getting at least with the e x9 / series
is really good at least in Australia
when we move over to the US however they
do only have their cards for sale on the
gallic store as I've said in the past I
would like to see them branch out to
amazon.com as I believe like over half
of Americans buy all their stuff from
this website so there is that factor
that probably would put some people off
however
do have a pretty good deal on the tens
MBTI sniper and also a mechanical
keyboard on their website which I
thought wasn't too shabby considering I
do have this keyboard here and it is
very nice especially for a $30 premium
over the 1070 TI standalone Galax also
sent over a ram stick which has a RGB
light bar on it too so pretty cool
they've also got an SSD which does have
a good aesthetic as well so it looks
like they do want to branch into other
markets not just graphics cards and I
must admit if they can get the aesthetic
right which in this case with the
off-white they did get it a little bit
off if they can stick to just making it
pure white like this 1080 Ti here then I
think they will be hitting hard and they
will continue to grow their market share
so every card has come through here from
guys has been really good buy for money
except for the Hall of Fame which is
more of a premium option for people who
need that massive triple slot cooler and
also that extra 11 percent on the
overclocking Headroom with the power
limit and of course that 8 plus
three-phase power design but when it
comes down to value for money the x9 /
series is definitely delivering of
course I don't know what happened with
the aesthetic this time around
especially when I've got the 1080 Ti
here which has that pure white aesthetic
also another thing as well the RGB only
extends to the light bar even though the
fans light up they've only got white
LEDs in them so I would like to see
Galax perhaps get that shroud back to a
pure white and also make the lights on
the fans themselves RGB - that would be
very cool love to see that but in terms
of value for money
great card and if you guys enjoyed this
review and be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below if you've got any comments
about the off-white sniper e^x graphics
card and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
and I was will just throw this in the
blooper reel needs an eight plus six bin
and you've got three DisplayPort 1.4 s
and one HDMI 2.0 B and one jewel link
DVI out absolutely amazing cooling
solution all want that eight plus three
pair a brain for mid review good because
every galaxy art also one more thing I
forgot to mention this PCB is fatter
than a reference PCB weighs in at 900
grams and the 1070 ti hall-of-fame
weighs in at one point three kilograms
moving to the Final Fantasy 15 this is a
GPU focused test we can see here we've
only got an average</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
