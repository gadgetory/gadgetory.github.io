Brian easy here back with a review on
the logitech or in japan Lodgy cool g400
now this is a mouse this is their newest
releases on their Mouse's and i
basically i bought this mouse because
arm i wanted to get a mouse that was
good for FPS so let's get the boring
part done first here's the box small
compact no CD so it's going to save you
money and it's going to save you money
on shipping 2 so 3 year warranty with
this too good stuff from logitech let's
move on now to our little friend and
that is the logitech g400 so here it is
guys basically straight off the mat
straight off the bat straight off the
mat in this case it's a very nice
looking solid looking mouse so to go
well with your desktop the specs on it
we're good so it's got 3,600 DPI all the
way down to 400 DPI in half intervals so
for 800 DPI 1600 DPI or something like
3600 DP is on 1800 yet okay so those
it's got it's got good DPI settings it's
got a thousand Hertz polling so it's
very responsive it's a very responsive
mouse it's got the it's got two macro
buttons here it's got GPI changing
buttons so you can scroll you can
increase the DPI here or you can
decrease the DPI here it's got another
button here which I don't really know
what does yet but I'm sure you could
program it to something else now let's
have a look at the build quality of it
it's it feels really solid so it feels
solid it feels like it's well built it
weighs a hundred and seven grams I
weighed this mouse on my scales and it
came to 107 grams with just the mouse on
the scales so my logic to g3 that weighs
eighty seven grams that's it there
that's more of a RTS I got that for RTS
and that serves its job well let's focus
on this I got this specifically for FPS
games now I've played modern warfare
with it and so far I'm really impressed
it's it's really good um let's get let's
let you know let's first let you know
that I've got a pretty large hand too so
my hand is about 20 centimeters so it's
I got a pretty big hands so basically my
hands more on the larger hand spectrum
and even my hand fits this mouse pretty
well even though I'm core gripping it so
I'm kind of Claude ripping this mouse
and it still feels really good um it the
rubber so the grip on the mouse it's got
your hand really sinks in so it's got a
nice grip on it so if you had a medium
or small sized hand it would be perfect
because you could palm grip it really
nicely
so if I kind of I do a full palm grip my
fingers are all the way over here which
is kind of stupid so kind of got a claw
grip it now however if you do have a
large hand like me one thing you'll
notice on this side of the mouse and
you'll also notice that there is there's
no buttons on this side of the mouse
which kind of things a little bit of a
bummer is this groove here so if you've
got a large hand this groove here will
kind of get in the way of you sort of
see it's kind of liked a little bit
annoying but if you've got a smaller
hand you're kind of your slot right in
there and it's really good if you've got
a medium or small size hand if you're a
large hand like me it's still really
good so you just got a claw grip it with
a little bit like kind of you get used
to it the little groove there okay and
now let's go move on to the actual build
quality like on the move on to the
clicking sort of thing i will say that
clicking this it's the best click I've
ever clicked on a mouse it just it feels
really damn good um like clicking that
it just you can hear it's nice solid
it's a solid click like it's a really
solid click and its really responsive so
it's really solid and really responsive
it's better than my g3 I think it's
better than my g3 in terms of clicking
and I really love this click so 10 out
of 10 to the logitech on the clicks the
build quality is 10 out of 10 and the
specs on its 10 out of 10 so like the
the laser it's that I actually use a
laser they use an optical sensor and so
I've actually tried it and it feels
virtually the same as my g3 that I can't
tell any difference except that and I've
read this on another review about this
mouse it does have this little
prediction kind of speed up thing that
you do notice it it does feel a little
bit different to my g3 but you can get
used to it I mean like I'm already
getting used to it after playing
a couple of days with this so it does
feel a lot better than my g34 FPS and
for RTS obviously I'm going to use my g3
is a bit small so I'll be able to move
it around a bit easier and obviously so
yet basically for FPS games this thing
is a steal the price is only thirty
dollars I recommend that price point is
really good the build quality is really
good the clicks are really good the the
logitech setpoint software is fantastic
as well it doesn't use up any system
resources really and you can assign
macros and you can change your settings
and have settings for games etc so let
you take a really good there one little
one little kind of point that one little
minor disappointment is that it kind of
feels like they have gotten cheaper with
the chords so but here's the g3 here's
the cord there and here's the cord on
the on the g400 it's a little bit
smaller and kind of looks a bit flimsier
and cheaper but I mean if you've got
animals it might be a little bit of a
thing as the you know an animal probably
goes straight through this cord but if
you live by yourself or if you live with
your girl and you don't you know
nothing's going to get in the way it's
fine doesn't really bothered separately
in a bother you so yeah that's nothing
nothing really to worry about there i'm
using a razer goliathus control edition
mousepad a really good mousepad i love
this mouse pad however i've had it for
over years so there might be some better
mouse pads out there I don't know but
I've fell in love with this mouse pad
yeah and basically you guys overall i
give this mouse a 10 out of 10 for value
for money it's it's friggin great it's
really good you know i got it for thirty
dollars it's it's got three year
warranty it's backed by three year
warranty i mean yeah what more can you
want for thirty bucks basically highly
recommend it and lastly sorry the wheel
scroll on it feels the same as
any other Logitech mouse it feels the
same as than my g3 can't really tell the
difference the button on it is very easy
to use so you can depend on using this
button as a regular button for gaming
and lastly yet and if you've got any
questions about this mouse guys post me
a comment or send me a mail to my inbox
and i'll reply as soon as I can yeah and
also subscribe if you like the reviews
