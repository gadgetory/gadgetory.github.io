kitty I know this welcome to tech city
this is brian coming to you guys today
with a review of a paces latest and
greatest memory labeled the panther
interestingly enough i've never used any
of a paces products before recent and
after doing this review i'm going to be
recommending them to anyone as this
memory just like the nvme m to drive
that i tried has good build quality was
simple to use and did overclock
reasonably well to the point where i was
limited by the cpu now let's take a look
at the dims i have on display here these
offer x and b profiles with only one
profile that locks in at 3000 mega Hertz
with timings of 1616 1636 at 1.3 5 volt
which is really tight timings for memory
this fast the heaviest memory omits even
after being overclocked is literally not
even hand warm this is in a 28 degrees
Celsius environment so nothing to worry
about with the temps where the included
heat pipes are doing their job quite
well though where does this memory
really shine well out of the box
settings with the XMP profiles gave you
a considerable increase over the default
2400 megahertz speeds and on my 6800 K I
managed to have that overclocked at 4.3
gigahertz and still hit 30 200 megahertz
on all 4 sticks at one point three eight
volts so there is a bit of headroom for
overclocking with these pants and
modules though in this case i was
limited by the cpu the one that node one
thing to keep strongly in mind is that
you'll have to have a cpu with a decent
memory controller from the get-go
for instance the memory controller that
I had on my 5820k
wouldn't even support 4 sticks of ddr4
even at the XMP profile 3 gigahertz even
after a healthy increase of voltage
applied on the system agent that's a lot
of evens that left me in an odd position
though I did happen to get around this
by lowering the speeds on all four
modules to 2800 megahertz which it was
then comfortable sitting with my 5820k
at 4.4 gigahertz the 6800 K I had here
even managed to get eight sticks of
Panther
for a total 64 gigabytes on all eight
banks running at 3 gigahertz XMP
profiles at its max overclock of 4.3
gigahertz pretty impressive and the
benchmarks was showing performance gains
over the default settings though keep in
mind the applications that can actually
utilize memory this fast in quad channel
configuration are very limited though
for those guys that like to be the
benchmark kings or multitask like an
absolute boss then this stuff is
certainly going to be for you as for
pricing and availability I'm not
entirely sure when this memory will be
hitting the streets in math though I did
manage to find a similar stick at Newegg
for 42 USD a pop though this stuff was
twenty four hundred megahertz at 1.2
volts or should perform similar if you
overclock it considering XMP profiles
are essentially just preset over clocks
for memory and in a way Bend as well so
just like a paces z 280 SSD that I
recently reviewed I'm sure once this
stuff does hit the market it'll be great
value for money
and on that note this stuff is really
solid memory that I can highly recommend
to anyone though I would have liked to
have seen another XMP profile in there
maybe a lower voltage at 1.2 volt or
even 1.25 volt
I'd say 2066 6 and also make sure that
you if you are locking in the X and pre
profiles that you manually set your
system
agent voltage as it can go pretty damn
high if left on auto I accidentally did
this when I was overclocking and when I
went back into the bass to reconfirm the
overclock I noticed that the system
voltage when it hires 1.45 volley lucky
I called that before I went into Windows
and started benching otherwise it might
have been toast all along
anyways that's about it for me today if
you like this video then be sure to hit
that like button and you never know the
Panther might just come to you
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
