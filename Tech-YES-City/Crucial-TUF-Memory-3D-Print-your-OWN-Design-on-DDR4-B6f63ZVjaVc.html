Computex 2018 now there are some new
ddr4 memory to discuss a collaboration
between a Zeus and crucial this is the
tough gaming series you've got different
speeds that are based on the sports LT
series so they're coming with a sports
80 series ranging with speeds from 26 66
megahertz CL 14 all the way up to 3
gigahertz now they are using the micron
banks on this particular memory and the
XMP profiles as with all crucial
products they generally work in every
single motherboard at least that I've
tested I've never had a problem in the
past with other XMP profiles for
instance I have had problems with it it
don't work and you're scratching your
head so there's a 1.2 volt with the 2666
stuff now only come in a little bit more
expensive in the current LT series which
you can get on Amazon currently for - a
gigabyte sticks for a hundred and fifty
dollars now there are other color
schemes it costs red black and silver
being the mains but also with their
Elite Series that is their top of the
line memory so if you want to overclock
then this stuff is seriously hardcore
3600 megahertz
out of the box with CL 17 times now the
good news about that is that it's at one
point three five volt we look at some of
the competitors memory that is coming in
with 1.5 even going up to one point six
volts which is extremely high for ddr4
memory but with all that aside let's
take a look at another new 3d printing
feature that has come out recently two
months ago with some of crucial memory
mm eighteens Computex coverage wouldn't
be possible without gigabyte or Corsair
bringing you the quality and also the
reliability that you need when building
a new pc welcome back to take a city
besides the sport and elite memory there
is one sitting in the middle called the
tactical now it has bars on top
originally coming with RGB light bars
you can actually remove them and then
put in your own 3d printed design and
this came out about two months ago also
for the other stuff the ATC is a tough
gaming that is releasing very soon so
stay tuned for that but this stuff here
3d printed module download the
schematics and if you've got a 3d
printer you can make your own modules up
so simply remove the light bar make it
and then put it in and it's yours with a
custom design so on display here they do
have their own custom designs which do
look quite funky and besides that they
are matching color schemes here with a
special gigabyte design and then lastly
finishing off the booth here with
crucial is they're reliable lineup of
SSDs and also server side memory they
are sporting 64 gigabyte registered
DIMMs this is the first time I've
actually seen one of these in the flesh
it does look very expensive and then
also on the SSD line there is nothing
new coming or so I'm told even in the
concept stages and they wouldn't tell me
I did try and pick their brains but in
terms of RGB memory they are hitting the
market following those aesthetics with
RGB and even custom designing things
yourself and then going in collaboration
with the Zeus seems like a Zeus
everywhere they go now they're
collaborating on the tough gaming let me
know in the comment section below what
you think of these products and also the
tough gaming stuff as well and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye no one
got hurt
so if you download more ram dude like
here we are meeting up again no I might
that looks delicious dude why are you
enjoying that it's about to seed you
accident right now
oh yeah that's a pretty juicy accent
dude isn't it well I'm juicy lamb shank
