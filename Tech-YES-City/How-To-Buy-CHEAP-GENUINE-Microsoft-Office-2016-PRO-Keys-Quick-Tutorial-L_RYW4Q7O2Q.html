get cheap Windows 10 x64 Keys a lot of
people were saying Brian those keys are
not legit of course there were people
that were saying they are legit and me
being in 2018 and thinking it's eBay of
course if I Bay allows it to be sold I'm
thinking it's legit and so I've been
buying keys and they've been working and
a lot of my viewers have bought those
keys and they worked absolutely fine but
anyway SCD keys saw this video as well
and they contacted me and said Brian
we've got legit keys your viewers don't
have to worry anymore I then contacted
tech deals he said yeah this website
checks out it's good and so I thought
okay I'll let my viewers know in today's
video how they can go and get these
cheap keys so today's video sponsor is
SCD keys and there is a link in the
description below where you can get a
2016 version of Office Pro for 35 US
dollars but if you use the coupon code -
you can get it for as low as 31 dollars
incredible deal there's also Windows 10
keys and game codes but we'll talk a
little bit about that later and also
you're probably wondering why I'm
wearing glasses as well that's a long
story I'm gonna tell it in this month's
you use parts hunt as well but with that
aside let's get on with the video
welcome back to tech yet city this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
video on how you can get cheap keys you
no longer have to go to pay full retail
from the web sites like Microsoft comm
or other retailers that charge huge
markups on these CD keys and also with s
CD Keys com I check their website out
and compared it against things like
kinguin and they are coming in cheaper
as well than the competition so that's a
really good thing but today's gonna be a
little bit of a tutorial on how you can
get this CD key how you can get it up
and working so first things first click
on the link in the description below
put the coupon code in and then it'll
apply it and then you go out to checkout
and you can pay with credit card or
PayPal personally I never give out my
credit card online
it's just something about not trusting
web browsers and JavaScript attacks or
whatever can happen if someone puts some
malicious code on your web browser as
well as saved history but I use PayPal
and I've never had a problem so they do
accept paypal you can use PayPal and
then once you've paid for the key you'll
get that and then you can go to the
Microsoft website itself and download a
full legit copy of office 2016 Pro so me
personally I'm an avid fan of office pro
I've got the 2013 version here and I use
Excel and also Outlook religiously Excel
makes all those graphs that you see on
those benchmarks when I do those reviews
of CPUs or graphics cards of course I
use Outlook for reading writing and
checking emails every single day such a
good program and then of course
Microsoft Word I use that just for
reading and writing documents and doing
other things as well making invoices if
I got to do local work here on the Gold
Coast so you can get this full version
untappd
for 31 US dollars delivered to your door
I mean to your inbox but of course we
could be living in a matrix so it may be
possible to get a digital key delivered
to your door I'm just not too sure
anyway that aside
SCD keys are giving you these keys super
cheap they're cutting out the middleman
they're cutting out the store front and
saving you a lot of money if you wanted
to go pay retail it would cost you a lot
of money for a 2016 office pro key even
going on to microsoft's website at least
in australia
where its region-locked to me here being
in living in Australia it costs five
hundred and eighty nine Australian
dollars for a copy of 2016 offers Pro
and of course you're getting a hard copy
that you can keep forever you don't have
to subscribe to office 365 which has a
monthly subscription and of course could
be a nightmare since its cloud-based as
well office 2016 Pro install it on any
computer that you want put the key in
and then it's activated and you don't
have to worry about any licensing in the
future and that about wraps up today's
video so if you want to get a cheap copy
of office than the link is in the
description below on the website as well
they've also got Windows 10 home Windows
10 Pro and also PC titles going at
discounted prices I'll put some links in
the description below for you guys don't
forget to use the coupon code two for a
discount and without aside I hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button and of
course in the comment section below if
you've got any questions then be sure to
drop them also if you've got some
glasses jokes then go at it I'm getting
ready for it don't worry I knew this was
coming
actually for years now I've been in
denial but here we are anyway I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
