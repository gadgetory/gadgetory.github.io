doing mighty fine out there and today
we're going to talk about swapping PC
parts and isn't worth it and is it worth
your time because this month I had two
different occasions where I had people
messaging me willing to swap PC parts
for PC parts that I had and I wasn't
using and honestly I came out of these
deals very much ahead with PC parts that
I can now utilize and especially a
laptop that I can now utilize for
traveling so swapping PC parts it's a
relatively new concept for me Utley
since I did live in Japan for quite some
time and in the Japanese culture
swapping PC parts and phones and
consoles is really much non-existent I
actually never heard of it before over
there but at least when I came back to
Australia a lot of people on gumtree
started messaging me would you swap a
ps4 for our computer and I'm thinking to
myself no I wouldn't swap a 200-dollar
console for a $500 PC but then I had
some genuine people message me and say
hey look I know you're selling a PC do
you have any other PC parts lying around
it was in this case I managed to message
them back because they said they are
willing to swap and all the motherboard
with a cooler and some RAM and also on
another occasion someone was willing to
swap a laptop and I asked for the specs
and then I got more curious when it had
an i7 Haswell in there so I went and
checked out these places and of course
brought some of the parts that I was
willing to swap which in this case was
in x99 motherboard a tank or Broadwell
II and also a 16 gigabytes of ddr4 and a
water cooler I managed to swap this for
a laptop it's a horizon that I've never
heard of but I'm glad I've heard of it
now because it's extremely portable
light weight has an i7 47 m Q in there
that goes up pretty high on the clock
speeds and also has a gtx 860m in there
the Maxwell version so I was very
impressed with the specs and then I also
managed to put an additional 8 gigabytes
of ddr3 memory in there so now I've got
16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory in there
it's also got a 250 gigabyte Samsung Evo
SSD so it is lightning fast and very
good it will surf when I want to edit
1080p videos while I'm traveling now
you're probably wondering does it run
GTA 5 well that was the first benchmark
managed to pull up and it actually ran
it pretty well at normal settings at
1080p I was getting over 60fps the whole
time I was playing the first mission and
I was just very impressed with the
performance so keep in mind that the CPU
was getting very hot there and I managed
to test it in dota 2 getting very good
frame rates and also csgo getting over
200 FPS most of the time although those
cpu temperatures were worrying me a
little bit as they were going there are
a hundred degrees a lot of the time and
this is in about 25 degrees and be an
environment so I will have to look into
maybe replacing the thermal piece see if
I can cool it down a little bit more and
it also had a custom BIOS on there
called the Prima mod where I managed to
overclock the memory a little bit and
there's also some additional more
settings available if you want to tweak
things in the BIOS like sleep states and
different sea states though the laptop
was only half the goodness that I
managed to swap here in that first deal
where I put up the x99 board and other
parts I also managed to get a cooler
master silent√≥ case out of the deal I
also got a cooler master cooler with an
actual of Frankenstein combo fan on
there and also two 16 gigabyte ddr3 kits
of memory which totaled 32 gigabytes in
total there was also a 32 gigabyte SSD
thrown in there and the best part of
this was there was a 4690k thrown in the
mix which will do very well in terms of
future build that I've actually got
planned coming and ties into the second
swap that I managed to do now the second
deal I managed to snap up here was a z97
motherboard and also a cooler master 212
Evo with two fans on it and a eight
gigabyte stick of ddr3 now I swapped
this for a z170 motherboard that I had
lying around here since the person
wanted either a z170 or a z2 70 because
they wanted to upgrade to the latest CPU
I believe they blew up their previous
CPU though before I took up this offer I
managed to go there in person and
confirm that the motherboard was working
so if it didn't work then I wasn't
obviously willing to do this swap and
same with the other deal as well I went
there in person made sure that the
laptop and the other parts of the person
was willing to swap we're all concerned
working before I did this transaction
and I was completely blown away by the
deals that I got here I think I was more
in a better position because
I was willing to offer parts that the
person needed and the parts that I
didn't need so I was kind of in a
position of power there but if you guys
are wanting to swap parts in real life
then I highly recommend you go and
confirm that those parts of working I
wouldn't recommend swapping PC parts
online with people that you don't know I
think it raises the possibility of
getting hosed quite high and getting
scammed so I wouldn't recommend that
there as opposed to just selling things
online and getting cash ultimately it is
something to think about if you are
selling PC parts or if you are into the
use price performance scene and you do
get people messaging you who don't have
money but they do have things that they
are willing to swap I think if you are
in a position of power where you don't
need those PC parts and they do need
them then you can barter your way to a
pretty good deal also I wanted to
apologize for the lack of use price
performance content hitting the channel
recently ever since risin dropped I've
been backlogged with a lot of new
products that I have to review and they
do help pay the bills and they do help
keep the channel afloat so I hope you
guys understand that and with that I do
have a very cool trick if you guys get a
PC or a laptop with windows 10 installed
and it comes with no product key but it
is a confirmed working valid version of
Windows 10 then what you can do is reset
the PC two times when it's booting up
into Windows so yeah deliberately reset
it and on the third time when you're
booting up you'll then have the option
to reset the computer completely without
having the product key needed or without
needing an installation disk so this is
a little trick that I've learned and
then you'll be back up and running with
a fresh install it also clear out any
passwords that were previously on the PC
so it's a great little tip and trick for
you guys who are into the use
price-performance team anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed today's video and if
you did and be sure to give it a big
like and let me know in the comment
section below what was your favorite
piece of all these swaps today would
love to hear your thoughts and opinions
as always and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon he's out
for now and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
