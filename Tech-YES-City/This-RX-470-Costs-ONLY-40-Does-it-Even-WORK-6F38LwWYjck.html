I picked up this RX 470,
4GB, for $50 US dollars.
And it's a SAPPHIRE NITRO variant.
However, it does differ to a
normal gaming graphics card
that was sold on the shelves,
in that it only has a
DVI out connector at the back.
Usually your gaming graphics
cards will have a couple
HDMIs, some display ports,
though this one right here,
its intention was never to
be put in a normal system
for playing games, until today.
(techno music)
Welcome back to Tech YES
City, and right here I've got
one of the two mining cards
that I've purchased when I
was overseas.
The P106, that'll be getting
a dedicated video of its own,
because it does differ a
lot to this one right here.
Which is actually a pretty
simple fix, and it's easy to
get working as a gaming graphics card.
So the NITRO variant
in question right here,
all you have to do to
get it working properly,
is download the VGA BIOS
for the gaming graphics card
variant of this, and use
a program called ATIFlash.
In order to get the flash
working properly, I had to use
the DOS version, and
then I had to force flash
the SAPPHIRE NITRO vBIOS that
I downloaded from TechPowerUp
onto this card itself.
So, it wasn't that much
of a hassle at all,
and if you're gonna do this
for yourself, then I recommend
downloading ATIFlash, maybe
put it on a USB drive,
or put it in your C drive root directory,
and then put the BIOS in
that same directory as well.
Now before you do this, do
back up your vBIOS currently
on this graphics card, so
if anything does go wrong,
you can then Flash the old
BIOS back to this card,
to bring it back to its original state.
Also, another thing worth mentioning was,
the Windows GUI version of
ATIFlash didn't work properly
to get the flash working 100%.
So then after we flash this graphics card,
we then put it in our system,
download the latest driver,
get that installed, and it
actually recognizes it now
as an RX470, 4GB SAPPHIRE NITRO,
which was released on retail
shelves as a gaming variant.
And since we are now using this DVI port,
it will function just like the original,
except of course, we've
only got one display out.
The first thing I did when I
got this card up and running
was to run a 3DMark Fire Strike benchmark.
This will tell you roughly
how the card it performing,
plus you can monitor
things like temperatures,
if you install MSI Afterburner.
And what we saw here was
this card was scoring
under 12,000 points, and I
did notice a little bit of
stuttering during this test.
And then looking at the
temperatures, they were showing
it was going to around 80 degrees,
which during a Flash
Strike run, it shouldn't be
getting this hot.
So what we decided to do
was run it one more time,
just to see if there
was some variance there,
but sure enough, it was
running a little bit less
than normal for an RX470.
They should be getting anywhere
between 12,000 and 13,000
points in this particular benchmark.
So since this card was previously
used for cryptocurrency
mining, it's most likely the
thermal paste has dried up
on the GPU die.
And since the temperatures were very hot,
it's time to pull it
apart, and give it some
Tech YES Lovin'.

♪ Uh, what, hold up ♪
♪ Sometimes you see something
sitting on the shelves ♪
♪ And you ask yourself ♪
♪ Why isn't that in my PCIe slot ♪
♪ They say that dogs man's best friend ♪
♪ But I think in 2018,
WD-40s man's best friend ♪
(clapping)
♪ Come on ya'll, hands up
in the air, clap with me ♪
♪ That's the sound of a greedy
miner losing his money ♪
So there it all is guys.
After we applied some new thermal paste,
and also make it look brand
new with some Tech YES Lovin',
the graphics card was
performing really well.
I even managed to overclock
it, and we're getting over
13,000 points on the graphics
score in Fire Strike.
And the temperatures
were also really good,
coming under 50 degrees,
which means that this dropped
the temperatures by 30
degrees, just by changing
the thermal paste.
Now the thermal paste beforehand
was very crusty and hard.
And that's a general indicator
that you should be changing
the thermal paste on a
particular graphics card.
Even if it's a gaming
graphics card that's been used
for a few years, as you seen
in some of my previous videos
when I've done used PC
builds, definitely does help.
And helps restore the
performance to that of something
that would perform like
a new graphics card.
So here it is right here with this RX470.
Probably the best deal
I've got in a long time on
a graphics card.
A little over $60 Aussie
dollars, and you've got a card
that performs so well at 1080p.
I managed to put it through
three different games.
Battlefield 1, Far Cry 5,
and also Rainbow Six Siege,
and it was performing really well.
1080p, ultra settings,
getting over 60 fps,
and in the case of Rainbow
Six Siege, it was getting
over 150 fps, so it's definitely
a very solid card for 1080p gaming.
Couple that with a 22 or
23 inch 1080p monitor,
which can be had again for around $50,
and you got yourself
such a good budget gaming
combo for the money.
Now I know there's gonna be
questions about availability
with these graphics
cards, because currently,
at the moment on eBay,
or on Amazon.com, RX470s
are running over $100.
I did manage to take a look on
AliExpress, there was nothing
there, but Taobao.com did have
a seller selling one of these
for $55 US dollars.
Now, if you've got Google
Chrome and you can translate
the page to English, you
can create a Taobao account,
and then they have their
own shipping agent within
their own website, which
will ship the card out to you
for around $7 US dollars.
So you can get one of these
cards shipped to your door for
$62 US dollars, if you
have the time and effort
to sort of navigate your way
through a bit of a website
that is in Chinese.
And also, if you manage to
set up an Alipay account.
So you can definitely
get your hands on one of
these graphics cards.
Just keep in mind, you will
have to flash a new BIOS,
and also give it a proper clean and change
the thermal paste around.
But after you do that, you
will then have a graphics card
that will perform pretty much
to that of the best prized
performance money can buy.
Anyway guys, I hope you enjoyed
today's video of the RX470
mining edition from SAPPHIRE NITRO.
I'm not sure about the other
variants that are out there
at the moment.
Definitely Taobao had some
other options that are on
the website from different
brands, some that I've never
heard of, but this one right
here with the SAPPHIRE NITRO
works a treat.
I can definitely recommend
it for someone on a budget.
And since it is a NITRO version,
it will have a very good
cooling solution, so it
shouldn't get too hot at all.
Anyway guys, if you enjoyed today's video,
then be sure to hit that like button,
and let us know in the
comment section below
what you think of the budget RX470.
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always.
And right here we've got the
P106, which will be getting
its own video as well.
Not as successful as this one right here,
and if you are gonna buy
these mining graphics cards,
I do recommend getting
one with at least one
display out on it.
Will make life easier.
But anyway, I'll catch you in
another Tech video very soon,
peace out for now, bye.
