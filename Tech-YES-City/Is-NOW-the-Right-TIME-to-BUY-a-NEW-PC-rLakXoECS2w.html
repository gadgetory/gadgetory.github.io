gumtree of course you know just up to my
usual antics of trying to find some use
price-performance trying to find whether
it be a gtx 970 or a gtx 780 and I
noticed that the prices are actually
pretty bad and then eBay had a sale and
I picked up two gtx 1060 s in u.s.
dollar equivalent terms about $180 a pop
so clearly winning and then it got me
thinking ddr4 memory is also coming down
in price and there's also some really
good options out there especially with
the launch of the new rise in CPUs the
rise in seven twenty seven hundred x for
example great value for money I think
with all this information I'm computing
it and I've realized one thing for you
guys is that maybe the dawn of new parts
is back again and maybe another good
thing to come out of this is that use
parts will get good again but let's
discuss these things
today's video is brought to you by inter
next dot-com with the goal of improving
people's lives their first service XCore
is an end-to-end based encryption
peer-to-peer cloud storage platform
known as X cloud already in alpha and
heading into beta in quarter 3 2018
checking it out is completely free links
in the description to find out more
welcome back to tech es city in today's
video is going to be a little bit odd
it's sort of gonna talk about how the
market shifts in mysterious ways and
when there's one thing that happens
there's also an equal thing that happens
on the other side and over the past year
especially the rise of use parts has
definitely spawned a new market there's
a lot of people out there who enjoy use
parts I love use parts that's got a real
big passion for it here on the channel
but at the same time of course we have
to acknowledge at least as used parts
hunters like myself we all have to
acknowledge that we do what we do
because the new parts keep getting
better and when they keep getting better
and more competitive it enables us to
get better deals and so it's a really
weird market that's linked together in
one way that works in a mysterious way
where at the moment like I hinted at in
the intro we're kind of heading back
towards I believe buying new parts at
least when you want to get the best
value for money because recently I
started looking on gumtree I started
looking for deals and I noticed that
it's seems to be that there's a lot more
people trying to pick up deals so that
of course is the first problem in itself
but the second problem is that a lot of
people are still asking too much for
their used deals for instance I actually
haven't picked up a GTX 970 at least in
a very long time because every time I've
gone to put an offer down on one someone
literally wants about 200 over 200
Australian dollars for one and now quite
simply in my opinion they're not worth
that price they in essence carry 3.5
gigabytes of vram it's not a true form
in the 512 portion is slowed down and
that leaves rise to the 10 63 gigabyte
which is very close in specifications so
it's going to have a longer
since it will have better driver support
going forward and it's also more
power-efficient so plus there's also the
other fact that it's nearer as well and
that it's on statistic averages even if
you buy a used GTX 1060 because it uses
less power and because it's newer on
average it would have a higher likely
tense of lasting longer and being in a
better working condition so there's
those factors that are going for the new
segment and those prices tend to always
base and judge what the use price should
be and so lately what I've seen with the
use prices is that the market is
shifting towards people simply trying to
ask too much for their used parts and if
that happens then my deal hunting isn't
going to be so fun of course I'm always
going to be trying to pick up old PCs
like hate 55 motherboards that's never
going anywhere because the amount of
value you can extract out of those parts
when you go buy them and you know what
you're doing with overclocking is
phenomenal but when it comes to these
new graphics cards versus the used
graphics cards I think a lot of people
are still asking a bit too much for
their use gravis cards especially GTX
970 s now the GTX 970 I still think to
this date is one of the most
successfully sold cards in the market
there was also before that the GTX 780
which sold really well too and then
before that the GTX 670 so these three
cards you will see them pop up a lot if
you're into use price performance and I
find that the GTX 780 s tend to be the
best deals that I've gotten in the last
few months and as I said before I've
never actually picked up a GTX 970 for a
decent price
two hundred trillion dollars that's all
I'm willing to offer the max and yet
everyone wants to keep them and think
that they're worth two hundred and fifty
dollars and that's exactly what I picked
up at n64 so there's the use segment at
the moment of course there's always
going to be a deal when someone tries to
sell something and they just want to get
rid of it there's always gonna be those
deals they're always gonna exist and
you're always gonna be able to get them
for really good prices if you're quick
to snap them up and know what that
product is worth but I feel if you're
looking for a graphics card because
that's the pretty much the hottest thing
at the moment with the cryptocurrency
mining booms still leaving graphics
cards slightly overpriced
I still think people are still
for used gravis carts so the most
popular choices would probably be the r9
290 the GTX 780 the GTX 970 and the GTX
670 and especially those last three and
video cards they were sold in big
numbers so a lot of people bought them
and in turn a lot of people would be
wanting to upgrade and offload those
cards so now here's where we have the
driving factors that are starting to
lead back towards new parts and first
was the cryptocurrency mining boom a few
months ago that sold out grab his cards
and prices if you want to go buy a new
graphics card even something like a gtx
1060 that was nearly double the price of
what they were originally asking for it
but the good news today is is that
that's settled down
you're only slightly overpaying as to
what you would pay over a year ago
though the second driving factor is ddr4
memory now recently micron Samsung and
also hynek's have been slapped with a
class-action lawsuit and so the good
news out that's coming out of this is
that we could see ddr4 memory prices
return to normal at least somewhat of a
normal level because they were
ridiculously overpriced as well and it's
probably this main factor that stopped
me from recommending new builds in
general because we could have went out
and build a new PC with the - the
greatest card and gotta use graphics
card and had really good price
performance but then the ddr4 memory was
stopping that altogether so it really
became an atmosphere for hunting news
deals but I think with this class-action
lawsuit it's gonna be a really good
thing for people who want to build a new
PC and they want to get really good
value for money because even now on
Amazon I've seen prices of ddr4 memory
come down to levels that I haven't
actually seen in quite a while
so that's some really good news I look
forward to in the next month keeping an
eye on this but also as well another I
guess synergetic will benefit if that's
even the words synergetic is that with
the new parts and when people go to buy
those new parts they then have more used
parts to sell and of course people who
are thinking about buying used parts
they might just go and buy new parts for
the advantages of having warranty and of
course just having that peace of mind
and so this is going to lead to a better
market in general not only for used PC
parts hunters like myself but also for
people who want to build in
you PC so good times are to come I've
actually picked up some really good
deals myself on both new parts and use
parts but I feel like the balance is
starting to shift back towards new parts
a little bit I think in the last year at
least it's shifted heavily towards use
parts to the point where gravity scars
like gtx970 s are ridiculously
overpriced anyway that's about it for me
let me know what you think of this whole
use price performance vs. new price
performance the whole market segment and
how you see it shifting and going
because I'm getting excited things are
gonna get good on both fronts I look
forward to bringing you guys a lot more
content on both sides of the fence and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon also don't forget hit that
like button bees out for now bye
but I feel like the balance but it seems
in the last few months or at least in
the last week even prices are coming
down quite astronomically like if that's
the word with you so I get asked about
use deals hunting and which parts you
should go for and I guess when you look
at it you've got like GTX 970 s they
sold really well GTX 780 s they sold
really well so statistically they're
going to be the cards that you want to
get because they sold the most so
statistically there's gonna be the
highest chance of them being sold on the
used market but the weirdest thing is is
that I haven't picked up a GTX 970 for a
good price yet
now the GTX 970 is an interesting card
upgrade and offload those cards so you
smell something
my camera may be blowing up okay
thought I smelled something something
burning okay dude like you couple it
with a very cheap motherboard you get it
cooler included that's really bringing
some table valued that's really bringing
dude I smell something hey and there you
go guys
don't listen to everyone's advice all at
the same time form your own advice from
your own opinion find out what your
markets about find out what your energy
and/or is all about entrace yourself
with that energy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
