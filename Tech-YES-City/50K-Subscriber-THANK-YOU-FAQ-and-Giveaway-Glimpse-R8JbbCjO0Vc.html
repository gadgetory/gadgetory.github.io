all those years ago however the channel

tech videos for you guys and a lot of
people are concerned about the direction
of the channel I'm going to tell you
guys straight up I never going to change
up my opinions are always going to be my
own you guys are always going to hear
the positives and the negatives how I
see them so never forget that anything

am independent so I'm never going to ask
people to give money to my channel

always going to keep it there and I
guarantee that all that money that goes
into those things goes back into the
channel because I just love doing this
