blow-off valve and this is gonna be a
quick explanation as to why you should
buy Japanese car parts as opposed to
other cheap junk so here it is here's
Anna Peck cblol valve now this thing the
guy who sold it to me is like now this
thing is junk I mean is absolutely crap
it it's you know it's worse for wear
he's basically just given up on it but
I'm going to show you why Japanese car
parts are so good now I've pulled this
whole apart and I've obviously I've
located it a bit it's still a bit dirty
but this is the main components of the
blow-off valve this is the this is the
pressure actuator thing and this here is
the spring now this is a spring it's in
really good condition still so and it's
still perfect so once we leave the cake
this all up and cleaned it up and put it
back together it's gonna be perfectly
working again so I haven't bought any
new parts for it at all mind you if you
have a seized blow-off valve it's bright
it's just the spring so you've just got
to pull your whole blow-off valve apart
and check the spring so it's usually
just the spring so this is the epoxy
spring it's really good it's really
sturdy so this is just a quick guy as to
why you should buy Japanese car parts as
the components are really good that they
put in the parts just gonna clean this
back up and then yeah it's working again
ready to get boost you got any questions
leave it in the comments section and of
course subscribe to keep the good videos
going alright guys peace out okay and
after a bit of tinkering around this is
what we get as the final product so as
you can see very clean and certainly not
junk it's a perfectly working app XE
blah fell
so I bought that and polished it up with
metal polish it took about half an hour
and as you can see it's very very clean
blob now peace out guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
