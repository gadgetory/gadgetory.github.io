a blow-off valve and this is going to be
a quick explanation as to why you should
buy Japanese car parts as opposed to
other cheap junk so here it is here's an
apexi blow off valve now this thing the
guy who sold it to me is like now this
thing is junk I mean is absolutely crap
it it's yeah it's worse for wear he's
basically just given up on it but i'm
going to show you why japanese car parts
are so good now I've pulled this all
apart and I've obviously I've lubricated
it a bit is still a bit dirty but this
is the main components of the blow-off
valve this is the this is the pressure
actuator thing and this here is the
spring now this is a spring it's in
really good condition still so and it's
still perfect so once we locate this all
up and cleaned it up and put it back
together it's going to be perfectly
working again so I have not bought any
new parts for it at all mind you if you
have a C's blow off valve it's bright
it's just the spring so you've just got
to pull your whole blow off valve apart
and check the spring so it's usually
just the spring so the apexi spring it's
really good it's really sturdy so this
is just a quick guys to why you should
buy Japanese car parts as the components
are really good that they put in the
parts just going to clean this back up
and then yeah it's working again ready
to get boost you got any questions leave
it in the comments section and of course
subscribe to keep the good videos going
alright guys peace out okay and after a
bit of tinkering around this is what we
get is the final product so as you can
see very clean and certainly not junk
it's a perfectly working apexi blow off
valve
so I bought that and polished it up with
metal polish so I took about half an
hour and as you can see it's very very
clean blow up now peace out guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
