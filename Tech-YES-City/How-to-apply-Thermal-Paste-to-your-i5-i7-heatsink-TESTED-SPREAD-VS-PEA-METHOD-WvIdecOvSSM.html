just coming back to you guys today with
a comparison and this time I will be
comparing the pee method of applying
thermal heatsink paste versus the spread
method okay so basically first off I'm
going to do the spread method okay okay
we're going to apply the spread method
now and something interesting to note
guys is that yeah
silicon grease is still pretty pretty
moist like it's relatively wet and I've
applied that for about three months now
I think so silicone grease is great is a
great thermal place basically now the
reason I'm doing this guys is because
people have said like ah you know the
pee method is just the god method you
know so I'm going to test them today I'm
going to compare head-to-head spread
versus pee
okay guys and as you can see we're at 25
degrees ambient temperatures here so
let's begin the spread method oh yeah
okay guys we have real temp running and
we're just about to stress test this
just stress test in place maximum heat
booyah let's let let's give that five
minutes guys spread method let's give it
five minutes and - when we come back see
what temperature's we have okay guys
we've given that a good you know more
than five minutes and as you can see
this is the spread method we've reached
65 degrees 74 71 degrees 70 degrees and
66 degrees Celsius max across the board
at fifty four point two gigahertz as you
can see there anyway let's get on to
everybody's favorite the pee method
let's test it b.p method this time
so let's got real tamp open here in
place maximum heat power consumption
some Ram tested now let's give that five
minutes in we'll come back we're coming
back five minutes later and we can see
we've got 66 degrees 72 degrees 72
degrees and 67 degrees on the pee method
okay guys so there we have it the spread
method verse the pee method now the
spread method one by one degree but we
can put that down to variance as the
minimum temperature was also one degree
higher which means that everything
probably heated up whilst I was doing
the test the actual room temperatures so
the bottom line is guys there really is
no difference how you apply your
thermal heatsink paste what is crucial
is that you apply a thin layer and I
mean thin guys a thin layer of thermal
paste between your heatsink and your CPU
so there we have it guys if you are
doing the pee method aka the god method
as you guys consider it please do not
give people who do the spread
method as all in all they really don't
make much of a difference so I remember
one of my subscribers Kevin you put me
onto a tech syndicate link and I was
watching that video thoroughly and I
noticed that Tek syndicate had said that
they had tested the spread method and it
was horrible so my results here are
quite the contrary they are the same so
anyway guys if you've got any comments
please leave them in the comment section
below I hope this video has enlightened
a lot of you guys or has helped you guys
and please subscribe to keep the Brian
easygoing and peace out for now guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
