motherboard and actually quite a long
time they sent their ex 370 Pro for ever
because they wanted me to test it with
the new risin 2400 G and they
pacifically asked me to overclock it as
high as they could so today I'm going to
be getting the Corsair H 110 i GT I'm
gonna be throwing the 2400 G on this
thing and seeing just how high I can
indeed overclock it now one thing I will
say about the pro 4 you don't have any
of the fancy steel slots or steel slots
on the memory you've just got these heat
sinks which looked like they'll do a
really good job and we will be testing
that later here with a fan on to see how
much air they can actually dissipate
once we actually start calling them
properly but another thing about the pro
series is that lightweight motherboard
that just has the essentials especially
if you're an overclocker there's nothing
really fancy there's no RGB lighting
again there's those steel slots they've
gone away with that they're just giving
you straight motherboard for your money
so if I had to pick a motherboard
personally I would go for the tai chi
series though for some reason they just
keep sending me the fatality
motherboards and the fidelity
motherboards they're good if you need an
onboard 10 gig NIC but a lot of people
don't need a 10 gig NIC and even if you
are looking for more valued orientated
options you'd probably get a Tai Chi and
go out and buy your own tanking NIC that
way you could port it over to builds in
the future with having a 10 gig NIC
plastered onto the board I mean you
might have to just de solder it and try
and plug it on to another motherboard
that's just not happening at all
so things that I typically like about
this board on the back here you've got
your input and outputs if you wish to
use the Rison apu you've also got 7 USB
ports plus a type c so 8 in total at the
front of the board you've got 6 SATA 3
ports as well as dual nvme m dot 2 now
one thing i will be looking out for
today is I do hope I do have the options
to overclock the Rison 2400 G from the
BIOS I already did it in the MSI Mini
ITX board but when I use the fatality x3
70 board I actually couldn't do anything
in terms of overloading the GPU from the
boss itself as I personally like
overclocking the boss as opposed to
using the Rison master software but then
we will put this thing on the test bench
and take it for a test drive and see
what
can do so now booted this up and I've
restarted it and we're in the BIOS and
my expectations went from being hopeful
to actually being a little bit
disappointed and the reason being there
is actually no system on chip voltage
control here and that's actually really
important setting for overclocking your
memory manually though it has locked in
this XMP profile and that is confirmed
so that actually means that the system
on chip voltage is there and it's more
of a shadow voltage just can't see it
and it is actually controlled
automatically so not a good thing if
you're buying a budget kit of memory and
you're hoping to get the max speeds
possible out of that kiddo memory and I
imagine that's gonna be a lot of people
who would think thinking of buying the
pro 4 since it's a budget motherboard so
I was disappointed in that I was also
disappointed to see that there's no load
line calibration setting here as well
it's a pretty important setting
especially for maximizing your
overclocks for 24/7 air or water
overclock so it is running at 4
gigahertz and here's at 1.4 2 though
keep in mind when I do stress this this
I'd imagine it will be dropping down to
1.3 something so we do have to check
that there's also no setting here in the
BIOS to overclock the GPU portion as
well so I would like to see our ROK
implement that into their boss though
other than that there is the settings of
course to customize your fan profiles if
you need to so it's good to see that on
the X 370 board though one thing I
thought with the X 370 boards is you did
have that full control over your
overclocking I thought that was part of
the X 370 license so let's go boot this
up and see what we can do with it and
see how well it can overclock with the
Rison master software so now we're in
the riser master software and we do
actually have system-on-chip voltage
control here so that is actually good to
see we've also got the apu we've got
full control of that with its clock
speeds and its voltage control so this
motherboard looks like it does have a
chance of redemption but you'll notice
here the CPU voltage is actually quite
high this is at 1.4 5 volt that's what
it's reading at and so this is the
problem here's a
talking about without load line
calibration I've got it running a
stability test at 100% load and we've
got a CPU vcore with its current value
at one point three seven or one point
three six so that's like a quite you
know 90 millivolts below what we had had
at before on this setting one point four
five and even there it dipped even more
so that's why load line calibration is a
really important setting because when we
back off the throttle here when we stop
this we will see that the voltage should
go up now and so it did but then it went
into a slumber State
so now here we are back at the test
bench where I'm gonna be talking about
this motherboard and of course where
they can get it right this motherboard
can be fixed if azrael overhauled the
BIOS implement things like
system-on-chip voltage control implement
load line calibration which I'd love to
see on this motherboard but furthermore
implement things like PLL voltage which
I feel should exist on an X 370
motherboard nvme is good on this
motherboard there's also support for a
solder m dot 2 for memory slots as well
for 64 gigabytes of compatibility got a
heap of USB ports on the back you've
also got really good onboard audio now
the funny thing about the included
onboard audio is as the first board in a
long time that have seen that hasn't had
the crosstalk problem even at a hundred
volume and the cross thought was
actually phenomenal the frequency
response curve was quite good as well
especially for a budget X 370
motherboard it was virtually flat the
whole way through with only a -2 decibel
drop off on under 10 Hertz which most
users would not even notice at all
the heat sinks as well phenomenal design
they dissipated heat really well when we
put the fan on these things we got over
a 20 degree drop on the main CPU voltage
supply the system-on-chip that dropped
over 15 degrees as well I'd like to
actually see this fin design implemented
on some of the higher-end boards instead
of just having a big chunk of metal so
great design on the vrm heat sinks the
vrm itself is decent as well so
everything on this board was checking
out nothing was wrong except the
implementation of that bias as we said
before please asrock upgrade the BIOS to
give those features that I mentioned
before but also unlock graphics control
this is another problem I've had I'd
love to see biased manufacturers update
their boss to allow full control of that
APU GPU solution because what I'm seeing
here when I overclock with the rise and
master software is I'm seeing clocks
that go up to 1600 megahertz in the case
of this CPU on this motherboard but what
we're not seeing is those performance
gains I'm literally getting like 1 or 2
percent performance gain going from the
base clock on the APU which is
supposedly about twelve hundred and
fifty megahertz and we're meant to go up
to 1600 megahertz which is a sizable
boost
that's like near what 25 or something
percent yet we're only seeing a one or
two percent increase yet when I went
into the BIOS on the 2200 G and
overclocked bad on the MSI board from
1100 mega that's the thirteen hundred
and thirty megahertz
I got a sizable increase in performance
that was rivaling that of a 2400 G out
of the box so please implement graphics
portion control in the bus I'd love to
see that then we could really get down
to seeing how far this APU can go when
it comes to overclocking and also with
the rise of masters software was a
little bit problematic there was times
when I'd unlock things and I have to
restart and then I'd lose control of
other things another interesting thing
that's kind of unrelated to this review
that I found out is that if you don't
have the latest update of Windows then
you can't install the APU drivers so I
don't know what's going on there and I
don't know how this APU would work on
Linux in that case but if you do want to
get the 2200 or 2400 G just make sure
you have your
windows updated to the latest creators
update anyway moving on with this
motherboard you get a DVI VGA ports and
also a HDMI 1.4 B it's actually not 2.0
compatible just make that said because
some monitors have a 2.0 only input and
if you try and put a 1.4 in you'll just
get no signal at all though you may in
base mode get a signal but once you
install drivers for example then you
could see the motherboard not giving out
a signal to the monitor lastly though
it's time to talk about the price for
this motherboard it's actually in
America of really well priced ninety USD
it does work out of the box with the
2200 and 2400 G does have great onboard
audio nvme support and also a pretty
solid heatsink design on the VRMs
however it doesn't have those features
that I talked about before so this
motherboard would suit someone who just
wants to whack in a CPU and be good to
go straight from the get-go though keep
in mind the voltages on that 1.45 volt
are a little bit worrisome keep in mind
when you do start playing games for
instance and start putting a load on the
CPU they will drop around about 90
millivolts so the drop in voltage is
quite big and that's because again it
doesn't have load line calibration so
I'd like to see asrock implement that
feature in a BIOS update and this is one
of the funny things I don't know what
they're thinking with not giving these
features on this motherboard because if
they're thinking that people are going
to go out and buy the more expensive
taichi motherboard which is an excellent
x3 70 motherboard is like literally one
of the best motherboards out there then
they must be mistaken because someone
with a budget of $90 for a motherboard
is gonna buy a $90 motherboard so if
this doesn't have the features they want
then they're probably going to go out
and buy a motherboard from gigabyte or
Zeus and the sad thing is I've tested be
350 motherboards in the past that have
had more features than this x3 70
motherboard here has and they haven't
even had heat sinks on their vrm now
here's where things get a little bit
confusing cuz in Australia PC case gear
and other retailers this thing costs a
hundred and eighty s strain dollars and
this price I couldn't recommend this
motherboard in Aulis not for anyone and
I've picked up be 350 motherboards that
are around about a hundred bucks and
they have more features than this does
except maybe - the heatsinks though if
you are in the u.s. at 90 USD it is a
decent buy if you're not into
overclocking at all
I would like to see them however update
the BIOS and introduce some of those
features then I could see myself
recommending this motherboard however as
it stands in its current state I'm not
too keen on it it does have a lack of
features that may as an enthusiast
personally looking at it with coupled
with an ex 370 license I just can't
ignore for my viewers and that's the
thing even though asrock is a channel
sponsor they have to understand that my
viewers you guys put me here behind this
table recording these videos you guys
are always going to come first
that's not going to change that's never
gonna change around turkey s city any of
you guys hope you enjoyed this video if
you have any comments about this
motherboard let me know in the comment
section below and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
