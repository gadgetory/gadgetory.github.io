I made I did an experiment for six
months and it was very successful now
the reason for this experiment was
because about four years ago I spoke out
against Bitcoin and in hindsight I was
wrong it wasn't a fad it is blockchain
technology and it's real it's the future
I believe for crypto currencies or at
least digital currencies in a digital
age and I think a lot of people watch
that video with an open mind and they
wanted to hear more about cryptocurrency
so today we're gonna talk about future
trends that I see going on with the
cryptocurrency market
welcome back to tech yes City this is
Bryant and the first thing we'll get off
is the Warren Buffett prediction now
Warren Buffett did come in and say that
he thinks crypto currencies are going to
crash I couldn't say almost was
certainty that that they will come to a
bad ending now and then immediately
after that they did crash quite a bit
some crypto currencies or at least some
old coins
sorry drop in about 50% and now people
said Warren Buffett doesn't understand
blockchain technology and him himself
did admit that he doesn't actually
understand the technology I I get in
enough trouble with things I think I
know something about why in the world
should I take a longer short position or
something I don't know anything about so
and so what Warren Buffett does
understand however and I followed him
for quite some time is that he does
understand the people behind the
blockchain investment humans and he has
studied market behavior so he sort of
sees the lines he sees the demand the
supply he can read that with the humans
and the market behavior so he is very
smart with that regard of course maybe
his words did predict that slump I don't
know the crypto currencies one thing for
sure is like I said in the intro it's
not a fad blockchain technology is real
for instance let's give you some
examples of why blockchain technology is
really good banks can utilize these
crypto currencies and they no longer
have to have as many servers to confirm
transactions because the transactions
are confirmed on the network via all the
people either were proof of stake or
proof of work as well as being
practically bulletproof when it comes to
the actual security of the crypto
currencies themselves they're 256 bit
encryption and any technology that we
know today even future technology could
not break this encryption so blockchain
itself is a fantastic technology that is
proving its merits now of course in the
real world where can we apply this to
normal people using cryptocurrencies
well if you get a card for instance and
you have that cryptocurrency you can go
anywhere in the world and use that and
change it from your fiat currencies into
that cryptocurrency so you can
immediately have access to your money
not only that if it's a fully private
cryptocurrency you can have no one
knowing what you're spending and what
you're doing with that money so it does
protect the consumer who doesn't want to
let people know what they're using their
money for of course that is a
double-edged sword people can use that
for nuf
various purposes of course there are
many many other benefits to
cryptocurrencies themselves what we're
going to talk about now is trends in the
market what is going to happen with
crypto currencies and what I believe is
going to happen is we're gonna start
seeing a consolidation in this
cryptocurrency field sure a lot of new
money's coming in but it just doesn't
keep coming in it can't keep coming in
when market penetration reaches its full
capacity of course how many more people
are going to enter the market remains to
be seen we have definitely seen a big
influx of people wanting to come into
the market itself and so with that
you'll see it cut sort of plateau over
the next year maybe but with that as
well you also see that there's emergence
of so many different altcoins as well a
lot of these in my opinion will be
losers however some of these in the long
run especially will be big winners now
which ones will be the big one is I'm
not too sure this video is not meant to
be investment advice and also with that
anything I say in this video too is my
own opinion I don't want you guys going
out and investing in crypto currencies
and then blaming me for it okay because
with investments anything you do is at
your own risk just keep that in mind I
would only suggest investing with money
that you can afford to lose if you can't
afford to lose that money then don't
simply invest it you do have the risk of
losing that money just as much as you
could up the benefit of gaining that
money too so I believe in the next year
we will see a big shake-up with
different coins which ones will be the
winners and also another trend that I
see happening as well is Bitcoin just
becoming mainly a commodity currency and
also on top of that this is a pretty
outlandish prediction but I do see in
the very long run as theorem overtaking
Bitcoin it's definitely gaining a lot
more traction from the normal person and
especially the people that I speak into
the streets they all love a theorem they
don't really like Bitcoin that's a trend
that I see continuing and if that
continues enough then a theorem will
overtake Bitcoin in the future as being
the top dog in terms of cryptocurrency
money before we get on with the opinions

link is in the description below but
let's get back on with those trends now
of course what about other trends in the
cryptocurrency market do I see
government's really banning this
altogether is it something that they're
going to crack down on is this something
that regulation is going to come in
place and stop people from using
cryptocurrencies entirely and I do
disagree with this I don't think
governments are going to go too hard on
this especially if they're making money
back in taxes but also on that note big
banks are moving into cryptocurrency
they are investing in the technology
heavily and call it a bit of a grapevine
rumor but the big banks usually nowadays
control government they do invest a lot
of money into campaigns and with that
they have a very big influence on the
market itself and the regulations that
are set in place pretty much in
Australia banks get away with anything
especially the big four so do I see
crypto currencies being banned
completely not really actually see them
getting better as well if the big banks
offer their own exchange services which
are trusted and they move into the
cryptocurrency market then I see that
being a catalyst actually for the crypto
market itself and that will help expand
it help it be actively traded now of
course speculative investors out there
people want to know is this just a Ponzi
scheme and the answer is no of course
blockchain technology is real there's
actually a thing called block daggers
which is meant to be the future and an
additional update on top of blockchain
so that's actually something that's
coming in and it's meant to be even more
efficient than the blockchain structure
itself so what we've got here is new
technologies that are coming into place
and they are being very heavily backed
by a lot of people but is it of course
in a bubble and the answer is I honestly
don't know I think it's been overdone a
bit too much in the last few months so
that's why I think we'll see a contested
Asian phase but as also if we compare it
to the dot-com crash what came out of
the dot-com crash was there was just way
too money going into our websites that
were useless and even at that time
people were like okay the Internet's
never really gonna take off there were
the naysayers here we are with you know
years and years later with youtube.com/
a platform delivering you guys content
so the Internet has proven itself calm
has proven itself it was just over done
at the time and there were even back in
those days a lot of winners Google
Amazon eBay they were big winners that
saw a massive crash in the.com bubble
but when it comes down to if you want to
invest in cryptocurrency pick out what
you believe are the winners I'm not
gonna tell you guys in this video what I
think is gonna go to the sky and back
because that's just a personal bias what
I've researched and what I think is
gonna go in the future and be successful
is my own opinion if you guys want to
invest in cryptocurrencies listen to
your heart trust you've got because you
got instinct is gonna be the one that's
winning in general in the end that's
what I found in past history with
investments when I've trusted my gut
I've always made money when I listen to
someone else or at least especially a
news article I've always lost money so
I'm not gonna identify which picks I
think are the best which ones going into
the future are gonna be like the winners
all the losers but in today's video I
did identify some trends that I do see
continuing on in the market itself of
course with that I do see a few winners
in the market if you guys have followed
me over the past six months you'll know
which cryptocurrency I'm heavily
invested into and which one I'm mining
because that's the one that I believe in
anyway guys another thing I will stress
if you are getting into cryptocurrency
or you have been in the cryptocurrency
make sure you be proactive
your security make sure you're using
two-factor authentication that's where
you have your password on your computer
but you also get a code sent to your
smartphone even that's just a double
protection layer there to stop hackers
getting into it and stealing your money
but also there is another option for
your wallet of course if someone gets
onto your computer and steals your
wallet
they now have all your cryptocurrency or
your money that you've invested into
cryptocurrency so make sure that you get
yourself the right protection here I've
got a device from disk assure those are
the device that you can either get in a
USB key stick which is perfect for a
small wallet.dat file or you can get in
larger files if you want to encrypt
other files as well sensitive documents
files or movies and of course it is a
little bit expensive especially over a
standard SSD this is one terabyte models
coming in at 375 dollars or the 500
gigabyte model which i think is perfect
for most people is coming in at two
hundred and forty five dollars now you
get on the fly 256 bit encryption that
is tied to a pin code that you store on
the device itself it isn't that big of
an ask first just buying an SSD now
another thing about this is it does have
an epoxy coating and it is extremely
durable I've been bashing the buttons
and they're just holding up fine you can
enter a 7 to 15 digit long key that will
let the user access the disk contents
there are indicator LED lights red for
locked green for unlocked and blue for
admin mode the device itself weighs in
at about 226 grams measures 124 milling
84 millimeters wide and 20 millimeters
thick the enclosure itself does add a
bit of mass compared to a standard 2.5
inch SSD and the included cable is about
90 millimeters long so it is quite short
though it does talk into the device
itself for easy portability and it will
hang around quite firmly without cutting
out though this does depend on the
rigidity of the port it is being plugged
into of course what about someone just
breaking into this drive via brute force
and just opening it up and trying to
steal a disk contents without a key
involved well it does have brute force
protection so if someone tries to open
it up it will render the device
completely useless so if you are buying
this device and you do think you are in
jeopardy of being hacked or you've got
someone sort of saucing out your house
you might want to get two of these and
hold your wallet data file across two
different devices now if someone does
also try to enter the pin code up to 15
times wrong then the device will also
be rendered completely useless - it is
water-resistant though it's not dunk
proof so don't try to throw this thing
in the pool expected to work again
though if you are outside some
sprinkling rain then it should be okay
there's also an included carry case and
it is a cross platform that is formatted
to NTFS out of the box so will work fine
for Linux Android and Windows users
though Mac users may need an additional
tool to perform writes and I don't use
Mac at all and I don't know any
cryptocurrency - they do so who cares
the inner self is also plug and play and
you get an instruction manual to set
your pin code immediately to the pin
code of your choosing the drive itself
also auto locks if it's pulled out while
it's unlocked and this will happen you
can set this to auto locking feature
between five and ninety minutes and you
can also hit the lock button at any time
and all virtually cut the device out
even if it's plugged in too so it does
have that super fail-safe option now of
course with the crypto currencies and
the wallets on your computer make sure
you be proactive with the protection of
those set wallets another thing you can
do and something that's been recommended
by people in the community is make
separate wallets one for your mining
graphics cards send that to the wallet
and then send it to a base location
while it sits on a laptop that regularly
gets connected off the grid off your
network so if someone does hack you and
they try to get to that main laptop
they're not going to get access because
it's just simply not plugged into the
internet anyway guys hope you enjoyed
