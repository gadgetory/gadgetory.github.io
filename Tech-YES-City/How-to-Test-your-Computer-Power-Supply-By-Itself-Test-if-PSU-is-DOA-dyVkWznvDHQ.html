welcome back to check it city this is
burr energy coming back to you guys
today with a quick tutorial on how to
spot or identify a faulty power supply
or a dead-on-arrival power supply which
was the case in this pass play now I was
all excited I had this 800 white gold
power supply I put it in I installed it
in my rig connected everything up and it
started for a split second and then I
tried diagnosing literally everything I
could to check that maybe it was a
short-circuit on my motherboard or maybe
it was a short so something wasn't
connected probably so I tried all the
other options and this was the last
resort that is just to test the power
supply itself and so in order to do this
you're going to need a any wire this is
just a paperclip and this will do the
job I'm going to need a paperclip and
you're just going to need to hook your
power supply up to the power point and
make sure it's turned off for this first
part make sure it's turned off because
what you want to do here is you want to
get to get the ATX 24 pin adapter and
then you want to get the green wire
that's the fourth wire from the right on
the face with the clip and then you want
to insert one wire into that end and
then you want to insert it into any
black wire connection point so for me
the one right next to it is a black wire
connection point so we get that one we
put it in like that and then we're good
to go so I'll repeat that again the
green wire which is the fourth from the
right on the face with the clip on it so
that green wire and any black wire can
be any black wire so we leave that there
like that
make sure it's touching nothing and then
we continue just to turn on our power
supply from the wall and also from the
connection point itself okay so once you
have turned your power on from the wall
you and you have your wire connected you
can then turn on the power supply like
so
and as we saw here the fan literally
started for a split second and then it
stopped and essentially what this means
is this power supply is faulty a healthy
power supply the fan should just
continually
spin until you turn the power off so we
can try that again as well and this time
it doesn't even spin at all so something
is faulty with this power supply alone
none of my other components causing this
problem and it's unfortunate that it's
dead on arrival I will be what I will be
doing is getting this ship back to
Amazon and getting an exchange I will
give leper another chance
and then I'll test this power supply and
see how it goes
also be very careful yeah make sure
before you touch any wires all the power
supply all the power is disconnected and
off and if you have any questions about
this tutorial please leave a comment in
