there oh my god I'm not gonna be a gamer
if I don't have a gaming headset
so I've been getting asked a lot about
gaming headsets and I thought I'd share
with you guys my recommendation since I
have tried a lot of headsets
I've tried gaming headsets I've tried
audiophile headphones and I'm going to
make this as a quick guide from $15 to
one hundred and fifty dollars on how to
make yourself a really good gaming
headset so the first recommendation here
is quite simply the KSC 75s go get
yourself a pair of these even if you're
an audiophile even if you have more
expensive headphones like audio
Technica's or something because then if
you try these you'll know what kind of
sound signature I like and now audio is
a subjective thing some people like
treble some people like mid some people
like bass
I like bass and mids a more of a warm
sounding signature and these definitely
provide a nice warm sounding signature
there are only $15 and man they sound a
lot better than even these razor
carcases which are like four times the
price so for $15 get these maybe get
yourself an extension cable as well a
one-meter extension cable and you'll
have your head self a good pair of
headphones to begin with now you're like
well I need a mic to game with and
that's where I'm going to start
recommending this level here that I'm
using right now so you guys can listen
to the audio quality I'm recording this
unedited this is just straight from my
onboard audio I've actually been using
this is my favorite go-to lavalier
microphone and the best thing about it
is it's only twelve dollars on Amazon so
for literally less than $30 you can have
a fantastic mic that you can also use
for recording videos from your camera it
actually mates really well with the comm
board cameras ADC and it's just the
actual quality of this mic it's better
than my V mode of Boone pro as well it's
better than any desktop mic I've tried
for twelve dollars man is phenomenal
value for money as well with this one
get an extension cable as well I'd
probably recommend a two-minute or
extension cable if you're recording from
the camera you're just using on a
computer maybe a one meter extension
cable will be fine for $30 this and this
is the unbeatable combo in terms of
value for money let's move on now you
got a little bit of extra money to spend
so let's step things up to maybe around
about $50
so for $50 you can get yourself the is
KS or the tax stars I believe they're
called in there so
different names for these things I'll
put them in the description below but
essentially what these give you in my
opinion is the best soundstage for the
money
honestly these things when I saw them
when I tried them on I managed the first
first night I tried these on it got like
a thirty to zero flawless in black ops 2
that's how good the sound stages for the
money for $40 I mean actually paid $40
for these that I'm beatable in terms of
soundstage for money they're not as good
as of course like sennheiser HD 598 or
Fidelio x ones or stuff like that but
honestly for the money they do compete
and they will give you an actual
excellent spatial awareness when you're
playing video games so especially if
you're a competitive gamer that's what
you're going to be looking for is
spatial awareness and they certainly
provide it they are a little bit bright
though the treble is a little bit
intense there are a little bit of bass
anemic but honestly for $40 if you're a
competitive gamer these are you go to
headphone now again coupling it with a
microphone I recommend getting this Sony
level ear microphone for $12 honestly
it's much better than the Zalman mech
for an extra $3 you're going to be
getting absolutely awesome microphone
for the money that's not going to lack
any words at all so you're probably
thinking I want to step things up even
further man I got a couple of hundred
dollars I got 100 dollars to blow on
some headphones well I've got two
options for you guys and now this is
where you start to get more of a unique
headphone these are actually the HD v 9
5s I've just mutilated them now they've
got the HD 5 9 8 so if you guys are
after the best sound stage like some of
the best sound stage you can get then
these will give you that they're
absolutely awesome so if you're a real
competitive pro and you need the utmost
best sound stage you can get or some of
the best sounds that you can get then
you'll want to check out the sennheiser
HD 598 so the 595 they got really
forward mids and the mids is where
you're going to hear all those gunshots
and those footsteps which is really
important especially for FPS gamers so
these headphones I have here these are
my favorite headphone my new favorite
headphone of all time they are the
Fidelio L ones and now these honestly
they deserve a review on themselves I
just haven't had time to review them but
I was will do a mini review here because
honestly the comfort they just nail
man they're so comfortable the sound is
like wow you've got just such a good
balance right you've got good base you
got good meds and you got smooth treble
now you don't have the best sound stage
like the sound stage on these is going
to be better than these also you don't
have the best treble mids or bass like
the mids on these is going to be better
but what you do have is just such a warm
smooth sound from these so if you like
music and gaming then I'm going to
simply recommend these they're just such
an everything headphone they're so
comfortable like every single song I've
tried on these sounds good there's not
one song that sounds bad on these so
that's something that's really good
about Fidelio l ones I really love these
and now what I've done here for the
microphones you if you want to step
things up you can use the v-moda boom
Pro now I'll actually switch over to
this this is as you can see here you
attach it on and it makes your
headphones essentially a gaming headset
all with one cable so this is $30 this
is the B mode of burn Pro it's $30 and
it'll essentially eliminate the need for
two different cables so if you want to
go if you want to step things up
especially over $100 then I recommend
you do go with the v-moda boom Pro
option it will make less clutter though
if you do want to make videos like I'm
doing then get one of these as well the
Sony lavalier microphone because I'll
switch over to now to the v-moda boom
Pro and we'll see how good it sounds
okay so here's a quick test with the
v-moda boom Pro this is a $30 attachment
cable but yeah if you guys want a $30
mic then you can get one with this it
eliminates the need for two cables you
simply attach it to your headphones and
you've got a crystal-clear microphone it
does lack a little bit of warmth hence
why I do recommend the actual Sony
lavalier over the v-moda boom pro or
anti from pretty much any microphone in
the budget range but anyway guys this is
about $30 so these headphones they're
about a hundred and twenty-five dollars
they actually discontinued they've
released a new Fidelio l2 as well which
I've heard and personally I prefer the L
ones over the l2 s but without being
said let's move on now to a conclusion
so in conclusion there you have it guys
you do not need to get a gaming headset
so one thing I
well lastly and finally say about a
gaming headset is they are not all that
bad like honestly people bash gaming
headsets a lot but honestly the Razer
cough case is they're not that bad it's
just that they're not as good as the
three head support in any of the
headphones I've mentioned in these
videos in terms of sound quality one
thing they do get right though is that
you've got a nice simple one cable for a
mic and your headphones and yeah they're
also really comfortable as well so I'm
not going to be the guy who's bashing on
gaming headsets because they are pretty
good right and especially if you're not
an audiophile and you don't really care
too much then these will give you a fine
audio honestly but for what it's worth
if you guys are looking for the best
sound for your money then these are some
of my recommendations check them out KSC
75s absolutely amazing especially if you
want a jogging headphone as well for $15
it's easy to replace this microphone $12
go check it out amazing value for money
Fidel if you want to step things up
$40.00 soundstage mic and then you've
got here the HD five nine fives as well
there your sort of great sound some of
the best soundstage you can get and then
you've got Fedeli oil ones just absolute
balance so that's about it guys if you
enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions or
comments then please leave a comment the
conversation below and I will get back
to you as soon as I can so there you
have it that's the gaming headsets that
I recommend I've tried a few different
different headphones out there and
lastly I will say Audio is very
subjective some guy might like audio
Technica's over the Fedele owes me
personally I like the fidelia's over the
audio Technica's so it just depends on
who you are and that's the subjective
thing and that's why I recommend getting
a pair of KSC 75s because this sound
signature this raw warm sound signature
is essentially what I love from a
headset and and you know if you get
these and you've got audio Technica's
for example give them a track try them
for two weeks and then go back to your
audio Technica's let your ears are just
to these and see if you like them
anyways I hope this helps I will catch
you in another tech video very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
