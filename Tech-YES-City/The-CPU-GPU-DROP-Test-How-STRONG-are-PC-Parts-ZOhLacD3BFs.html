experiments everybody wanted to see more
well today we're going to be dropping a
GPU and a CPU in the past I've been
critiqued for handling my PC parts like
a savage fare call though I've never had
a part break due to the way I've handled
it
however today that just might change
when I dropped this CPU and GPU from
multiple distances so first up here I
have an Intel Pentium G 6950 this is a
dual-core LGA 1156 CPU now I'm going to
be dropping this from 1 meter alright so
we're just going to check now if the G
6950 survived its first drop so we're
just waiting for a signal now and I mean
this should work one meter should be ok
I don't imagine it wouldn't survive a 1
meter fall so let's take a look here
bang there it is ok we've got a signal
cool awesome so it survived a 1 meter
drop let's drop this thing now from 2
meters
all right so J we've just dropped this
thing from two meters now and I am going
to save it boots now I think we honestly
have like a 50/50 chance here
maybe not fifty-fifty like a rule that
table you've got also the zero there and
the zero aren't there we go so I was
just about to say the zero would be like
full-on sparks just blown out but uh
let's see if it boots from two meters ah
awesome okay we have dropped this CPU
from two meters high now and it is
confirmed booting up okay so it survived
a two meter drop though what if you get
into an argument with the missus and she
then decides to chuck your CPU off the
balcony let's find out if it can survive
that
all right so we've just dropped this CPU
off the balcony let's see if it boots up
I have no idea I think honestly it won't
boot I mean that was way too much of a
drop for this thing to sustain I mean I
do I bent the PCB back and I mean with
that one of the some of the traces are
probably damaged so let's see that let's
give it a go I mean let's boot it up all
right so there we go the motherboards
actually booting up which is a good sign
but now we still have to get a signal
out all right so we've got nothing this
CPU won't get a signal out it's pretty
much it's correct all right so the CPU
unfortunately did not survive the
balcony drop it is now officially dead
let's move on now to the GPU okay so we
just dropped this from a meter and damn
I do not think that survived even a
meter that was a massive bang when this
thing hit the floor you know like bas
Rutten I'm sorry sir bang bang bang no
I'm not let's see if we get a signal out
of this thing anyway oh okay sweet so
GPU is working after a one meter drop so
the GPU survived a one meter drop let's
try a two meter drop now
okay so here it goes we just dropped
this thing from about two meters and I
honestly think it's screwed I don't
think this will work this time but we'll
try it anyway so let's give it a shot
oh my god okay we've got a signal here
from a two meter drop and I think this
to 200 series gravis card has earned
itself its keep we're not going to drop
this thing off the balcony so in
conclusion the next time someone calls
me a savage I'm simply just going to
link him to this video because today was
some real savagery and ironically enough
both the GPU and the CPU survived drops
from two meters the CPU however
unfortunately died after we threw it off
the balcony though that would have been
a fall in excess of three meters now I
wasn't prepared to Drizzt drop in the
GPU off because this thing weighs over
800 grams that is it weighs 40 times
more than the CPU does coming in 220
grams so would have just been absolute
suicide though with that said PC parts
are definitely more sturdier than we
give them credit for and if you guys
enjoyed this video then you don't really
hit that like button and if you haven't
read subscribe to tech s city for more
tech news reviews and crazy experiments
like this
and I'll see you in the next video soon
peace out for now bye
Brian I wanted to see you drop a GPU off
the balcony well today's your lucky day
brothers because I just finished putting
this thing in the oven and it failed to
come back to life so it's going off the
balcony
but that property bill whoo like a
Jackie Chan roundhouse kick then you
even drop back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
