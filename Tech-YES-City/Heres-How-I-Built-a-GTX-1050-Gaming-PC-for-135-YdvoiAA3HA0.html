been searching for used PC deals being
getting some great deals here and there
I've got two vlogs now that I've made on
some of the deals I've picked up and in
one of these videos we got a PC for $55
it included an i5 760 a gigabytes of ram
a harddrive a motherboard a cooler and
power supply in case but after that we
also picked up a cooler master case with
some bling in it it also included a
cooler and some other things so we're
going to be using that case and also
using a power supply from another build
and then using a gtx 1050 that we got
for $80 so in total this whole build is
gonna cost around a hundred and fifty
five dollars but let's put together this
PC for what I'm going to be calling and
naming the Los Angeles bang job
this PC shouldn't be too hard to put
together the first step we're gonna do
here is take out the hardware that we
need from this particular case and then
we can get rid of the components that we
don't need since I'm on the road and I'm
actually in a hotel room at the moment I
can't keep some of this stuff otherwise
I'm just gonna be too way down in my
trip but let's get the first stage done
now one important thing for me
personally since I'm on the road and I
don't have any spare screws is I will
want to salvage as much of these as
possible this includes pulling them out
of any area I can from Drive cages from
the power supplies I'm not using and
that way I'll be able to build up a
screw stash while I'm on the road but
now it's time to get the alcohol wipes
and clean everything down
there's a little bit of a hiccup here I
took this panel off the top here trying
to get the front panel off but it's
actually a tap it on here so we're not
gonna be able to get this front panel
off on 4G which means the front dust
panel is filter is not going to be able
to be cleaned this is kind of one of
those moments where I wish I had the
data vac I've also already tried the
hair dryer that's unfortunately the one
that this hotel is not powerful enough
when to a big problem here and that is
both the past wise I have that a budget
choices are not gonna fit this case it's
just simply not enough room to mount the
power supply in any sort of normal way
without being too dangerous so what
we're gonna do is going to take this
motherboard out now the power supply and
actually transfer it into the AC case
back there that way we can easily drop
$20 off the build since we can use this
case now in another build and take it to
Vegas with us because we've really got
two builds planned out and I mean
dropping like a cool massive $35 pounds
playing this build and then $20 for the
case that's adding $55 to the build cost
we're not going to be getting that money
back especially since this is a look of
a sort of entry-level build people don't
care too much about the aesthetics more
about the price performance so let's
change everything over see if we can
finally meet some success
so booted the PC up now everything is
working really well so I'm surprised
because this front panel connector has
sort of like a different style of front
panel connector but somehow we managed
to get that working properly and Windows
itself on the initial install on a HCI
wasn't working so we changed that around
to IDE and now we're installing Windows
fine so all's there left to do now is
install Windows run some stress tests
and really just put the side panel on
and we'll have a complete PC here for a
hundred and thirty five bucks
so finish the UniGene heaven benchmark
now and we're getting a score of 3090
for the Maxis graphics cards hit 73
degrees which is absolutely fine
considering its Auto fan speeds and the
FPS is really high - constantly going
over 100 FPS which means the CPU and GPU
combo is really good
so now prime95 is just doing its thing
blend test this will test the CPU but
also a lot of memory as well because I
find the most common problem with PCs is
that sometimes you get some faulty RAM
and that will cause all sorts of issues
so this will pick it up really quickly
and if it has a problem usually the
system would just crash or it'll freeze
so that's a great indicator that you
need a changeover and get some working
memory but this PC looks like it's
absolutely fine it's gonna keep doing a
good job so we're gonna take some b-roll
of this now and then move over to a
conclusion with this PC because it's
pretty much ready to be flipped here we
are now at the conclusion with the 135
dollar la bang job this is a phenomenal
price performance build but this is one
of the most different pcs I've done in
the history of this channel for two
reasons a we've got no time to install
games we are completely out of time
we've got to flip this thing pretty soon
because there's another bill we have to
do before I have to get out of LA which
is tomorrow mid-day
where I'm driving to Vegas so I do want
to get on to the next build and start
going through that but another thing as
well we didn't have any internet in the
hotel via the rj45 to install any games
and test performance but we did the
stress test on both the GPU and the CPU
and the brand and everything is fine
temperatures to find everything checks
out and also wanted to show you guys my
typical process of putting together a
flip you don't necessarily have to play
games on it for hours rather just leave
the benchmarks going and they will
stress test the machine for you why you
can do something else but in terms of
how much I want to flip this thing for
I'll decide when I get to Vegas it's
obviously really good value for money
we got all the parts for unfortunately
we ended up using the Acer case over the
half which would have a bit more bling
but in turn we did save $20 and we can
now use that half in Vegas for example
when we put together another PC while
we're going through see yes there's
definitely gonna be a lot more builds
and a lot more weird stuff coming to the
channel so make sure you stay tuned but
this one is one tidy little neat PC 135
bucks price performance is through the
roof if you guys enjoyed this then make
sure you hit that like button and let us
know in the comment section below what
you think of it I was pretty lucky that
the power button and everything worked
out in this case we don't have USB 3 at
the front but I'm sure someone who's on
a budget is not going to care too much
they just going to want to get that raw
performance and make sure everything
works and that's exactly what this thing
is going to do so we did through all
those problems absolute success this pcs
ready to go hope you guys enjoyed this
one and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon
peace out for now goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
