Las Vegas in the US we're at the asrock
suite and I was having a look through
all their different motherboards and
this one caught my eye this was the B
450 steel legend now it comes in a micro
ATX version as well but the biggest
thing here is that they've redone the
ascetic completely with a new digital
camo print but of course with all the
motherboards that come through takia
city I'm gonna run it through its paces
with things like VRM temperature tests
as well as testing out the onboard audio
to see if it's really fit for someone
who just wants to get into gaming and do
a bit of overclocking but before we do
that let's take this thing out of the
box
snap some b-roll and then put it on the
test bench
so now all the testing is done and
there's mediocre point about this board
and then there's some really good points
first we'll get the mediocre out of the
way the vrm itself it's a four plus two
phase design they've put about a hundred
and forty grams worth of heat sinks on
both but since they're a split system
you're only really getting seventy grams
of heat sink on the four phases which
connects to the CPU for the MOSFETs
they're using SM for 336 and sm for
three three sevens on the low and high
side and for the chokes they got 60 amp
solutions from magic and then on the
caps we're talking 12 K Nietzsche con
solutions but when it all comes down to
the vrm we can have X amount of phases
all this fancy stuff but I like to just
put it through the real-world paces so
we had the risin seven 2708 core
solution 16 threads we overclocked that
to 4.1 gigahertz with a water cooling
solution and here we had temperatures
that on the rise in CPU that were
absolutely fine but the vrm temperatures
themselves with the IR camera got over
90 degrees I believe I read up to 97
degrees so it was okay that this was in
a 26 degree ambient controlled
environment by the way so they could get
worse if we're on a really hot day in
summer but basically if you're
overclocking on this motherboard you've
all definitely in my opinion want to put
a cooling solution like a 12 centimeter
fan or something like that over this
four phase design just so it'll stay
cool and it won't go near throttling as
for me personally when I see 90 degrees
on my IR camera or higher that's sort of
like a warning level I'd like to stay
below that for 24/7 usage then when it
comes to the BIOS asrock do a great job
of implementing a simple UEFI it's very
easy to use and you can overclock with
ease but one thing that I have noticed
is that they've improved the RGB
software quite a lot you've got 13
different patterns to choose from and
since you can control this now with the
addressable RGB headers you can link up
all the rest of your licenses we've done
here in the background and then control
that via the actual bias itself so you
don't even install any software fully
controllable by the BIOS so basically I
like what they've done with the
polychrome solution this time around on
the steel legend now onto some other
important things with this board you get
USB 3.1 gen2 which I believe is up to 10
gigabits per second transfers I think
there's a new fan
named for it nowadays that people
pointed out in the comments that's just
completely over my head I'm just gonna
keep sticking to the USB three USB 3.1
USB 3.1 gen2 it's pretty easy to
understand right you keep going up in
speeds but that aside we tested out the
USB 3 speeds they were absolutely fine
tested out the onboard real technic
solution that was fine up till about a
hundred and thirteen megabytes per
second just constantly it wasn't
dropping out at all so that's a reliable
solution if you used to use that in a
home network or an ass and then on top
of that the audio this is where things
get very interesting for the B 450 still
legend simply because they've used the
realtek al c8 9 - which is lower in
number than the ALC 1220 and you'd
probably think that it's inferior and
yes it would be but is it that inferior
to the point where someone would really
notice it in the real world when I put
it through all the stress tests here it
performed phenomenally well it's some of
the best onboard audio I've seen and
that's the thanks to the niche econ gold
caps that they've used on the onboard
audio solution itself so you can have
the best DAC in the world but if you've
got crap components connected to that
DAC then your audio is going to sound
crap but the good thing is here they've
used a relatively good onboard codec and
they've coupled that with good
componentry
so the end result was pretty much no
drop off below 10 Hertz I think I
measured not even a one decibel drop off
under 10 Hertz which means your base is
gonna come through very clearly very
loudly on either your headphones or
analog out speakers but then we moved
through the frequency response curve and
that was relatively flat the whole way
through as well
no imbalances so this solution is going
to serve you well for audio listeners if
you're playing competitive games or if
you're listening to music and you're on
a budget on top of that the crosstalk
levels were phenomenal all the way up to
the volume level of a hundred there was
no leakage on either left or right
channel and we're talking about - 80
decibels of crosstalk which is very good
the stereo listeners however one thing I
did notice between the left and right
channels was there's about a 1.5 decibel
difference in the balance but this was
easily corrected by just dropping the
volume level of the right channel in
window
down to 90 versus a hundred on the left
and now with the audio itself as rock
have decided to Double Down so the audio
outs really good but then the audio ends
equally as good that's your mic import
where I tested it and they're not using
noise suppression so your voice is going
to come through very clearly and this is
all the way up to plus 20 decibels
volume level over 80 after that it did
start to introduce some noise but these
levels will be fine for pretty much any
mic headset out there so if you want to
stream on a budget this motherboard is
definitely gonna be one of those
components you may wish to consider so
with all the important testing out of
the way here is the conclusion time and
the most important thing I believe with
a be 450 motherboard and that is the
price or the value and this is where
they've got two variants they've got the
micro ATX version the B 450 M still
Legend and that's coming in at 90 USD
and I think I even went on sale for 80
USD in Australia you can get it for
around 139 ozzie dollars and at these
prices it's a solid board as we saw with
the tests everything checks out and even
if you want to overclock
you can do that definitely with a
six-car gonna have no problems but when
it comes to an eight-core and you're
going for those higher 4.2 gigahertz
overclocks for example you definitely
want to get a fan over the vrm just for
longevity but in relation to my rise in
720 700 that thing just tops out at 4.1
giga it's it's just generally a bad chip
I've even tried it on the ERG board here
as well as a Taichi board and it's the
same thing my 2700 X so it goes up to
four point three gigahertz that's really
good so I didn't really get lucky there
but bass if you're overclocking 6 cores
find a core you will want to get some
extra cooling on that vrm heatsink
though everything else on this board
checks out and it checks out in a really
good way the onboard audio is phenomenal
both the mic in and the audio out ports
you've got great connectivity on the
back ample amount of USB 3 ports USB 3
out dual nvme slots as well for
installing nvme drives and on top of
that you've got a really nice aesthetic
and you've got RGB off the north and
south which is addressable and you can
control it within the bus without
needing any extra software so in my
opinion the $90 M solution is an
absolute win but then they've got the
full-size version which is a hundred and
ten US dollars so this is where for that
extra twenty
dollars I believe you're getting an
extra to one speed PCIe gen two lanes as
well as converting that bottom 16x Gen 2
slot on the micro ATX version to eight
gen 3 on the full size version so others
extra PCIe slots worth it to you for 20
bucks for me personally probably no but
if you really want the aesthetic and the
full-size ATX board then that option is
there but I guess that's about it for
today's review of the be 450 still
legend from asrock definitely checks out
and also let us know in the comments
section below what you think of that
digital camo
look I'm definitely liking it I put it
in a build here and it's looking pretty
schmick but as always love reading your
thoughts and opinions down in the
comment section below and if you enjoyed
this one be sure to hit that like button
if you want to cop some merch some
techie air city merch link is in
description below as well as the
Instagram link I'll put that in the
description below as well where I'm
posting up some cool behind-the-scenes
stuff as well as stories I'm getting
into that lately too if you enjoy the
content enough sub buttons their bell
buttons there if you want to see the
videos the moment they drop without a
side I'll catch you in another video
very soon we've got that P 106 testing
we're going to retest that so stay tuned
for that see you in the next video peace
out for now B we can have all the fancy
components we can have 20 million phases
if you want but if you're going for the
full-sized version that's coming in to
110 dollars so it is $20 more and for
that price I believe you're just getting
to 1x lots of PCIe gen 2 + + + 1 PCIe
gen3 16 slot - we'll all the impasse so
now with all the important testing out
of the way comes the most important
price with a be 450 motherboard
decent vrm that will take good care of
sick scores and if you're on an
eight-core just grab a fan whack it over
that vrm and you should have happy days
even then but the I do like what they've
done with the build quality to setting
the RGB control and also the bling okay
through it again studious
