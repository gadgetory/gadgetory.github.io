going to talk also about the ten core
announcements from Intel ladies and
gentlemen welcome back to check yes City
this is brian coming to you guys today
with a little update on what's going to
happen and also the recent 10 core
announcement from intel now rumor has it
that Intel will be releasing four
different models of CPU with their
broadwell align our most notably the top
tier CPU being a 10 core 20 threaded
beast now this is room into coming at a
thousand dollars however I think they
will charge a little bit more for this
cpu considering it is 10 cores and it is
unlocked now I do have concerns about
the motherboard manufacturers being able
to keep this thing under control since
it will draw a lot of power especially
at those four gig and over over clocks
interestingly enough however coming in
below that is a 6900 k which is rumored
to be an eight-core 16 threaded cpu now
good thing about this is that it will be
better than Haswell is 59 60 X and
hopefully cheaper as well so I'm really
looking out for this cpu then below that
you've also got a two additional extra
CPUs there the 6850 k and also the 6800
k which I'm guessing is similar to the
59 30k and the 58 20k and that one will
have 28 pci lines and the other will
have 40pc islands though definitely keep
an eye out for the 6800 k and the 6900 k
they're my two top picks for this
upcoming release now under personal news
with the channel I've got here a lot of
products that need to get reviewed in
the next week we've got the d 15 s which
is their slimmed down d 15 and hopefully
this will mount on the x 99 platform in
both orientations besides that we have
these sound blaster h5 which is a gaming
headset from creative and i've actually
already started testing this thing and
it is impressive so stay tuned for a
review on that now behind this is the
apt Ron vision 27-inch 1440p IPS display
now I'm really looking forward to
testing this since it's meant to have
better response times than the IPS
panels that I have behind me and it
comes in at a competitive price so
looking forward to testing that for you
guys too and on other news I
got a new gaming mouse here and a new
mouse pad finally after five years of
using my razer goliathus control edition
mouse pad i decided to get another one
because they're just that damn good
however this mouse did surprise me i
have tested it out a little bit if you
guys want to see a review of it then i
will do a review for you guys since it
is a pretty inexpensive mouse and it
does have all the features that i want
from a high-end mouse so anyway guys
that's about it for today I look forward
to seeing you guys in more tech news and
reviews if you have any questions or
comments about this video then drop a
comment in the comment section below and
yes I am using the h5 detachable
microphone as I want anyway peace out
for now guys bye I fell under there see
my harry potter levels monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
