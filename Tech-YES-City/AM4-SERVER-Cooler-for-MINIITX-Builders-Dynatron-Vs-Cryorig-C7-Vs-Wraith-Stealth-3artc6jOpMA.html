I've got three different coolers and
they're all designed for low-profile
mini ITX AMD AM for motherboards and
today we're going to be testing all
three different coolers out however what
makes one of these so special is that
it's actually an AM 4 server cooler
it's from Dyna Tron and you can
currently pick it up for 37 US dollars
delivered however that's in the US if
you're in other parts of the world it's
a little bit more difficult to obtain
however at this price is this little
cooler worth considering today we're
going to test out the temperatures and
also the noise and see how it compares
to two top favorites that is the
included race stealth cooler and also
the cryo rig c7
today's video is brought to you by
Vikings war of clans with a recent
massive update adding new shamans and
kingdoms it's now a better time than
ever to install this free-to-play game
but what I really recommend trying is
the massive in-game battle events with
over 1 million players this is crazy
action going on the Vikings really
stands out with this 3d HD graphics with
smooth gameplay but the best thing is
you can choose your style of gameplay
whether it's building up an
indestructible fortress or attacking the
enemy you can choose that style for your
own though to get the most out of this
game you really have to experience it
for yourself kind of reminds me of those
late 90s early 2000s games like Age of
Empires for example but ultimately if
you do want to try out this game then
click on my link in the description
below where you get a bonus 200 gold and
a protection shield for free anyway
let's move on with the video welcome
back to tech yesterday here we've got
the three coolers on the desk and this
is the most interesting because I've
never heard of it up until a viewer sent
this in in an episode of Kenya's fix-it
I'll put the link up in the description
here if you guys want to check out that
video but essentially this cooler weighs
in at 500 grams so it's very heavy it
feels of really good quality and it's
actually a hundred and thirty grams more
heavier than this cryo rig c7 which
comes in around 360 to 370 grams and
also this cooler here comes in at 37 us
so it's not breaking the bank
the cryo rig c7 for example comes in
around 30 us and then this here the race
stealth of course comes for free and
that weighs in at 300 grams is actually
a really nice included cooler especially
if you're buying a budget AMD rise and
AP use or CPUs however today we're going
to test it with the 2400 G and we're
gonna see how well these three coolers
perform and also their noise levels
so now we're on the second set of tests
here I decided to try another
motherboard because it was getting very
hot on the asrock board but it's
exhibiting the same behavior on the MSI
board here now it wasn't contacting
properly on the asrock board but I'm
positive now it's making contact on the
MSI board so now this is the third time
I am testing the am for Dyna Tron cooler
and it's actually not making contact
properly with the MSI motherboard as
well as it was with the asrock
motherboard I'm actually free mounting
this and it's finally making proper
contact with the CPU beforehand the CPU
was throttling it wasn't performing like
it is now it's actually not really
throttling but the temperatures are
actually really high still it's reaching
a 103 degrees practically at that level
where it's going to start throttling the
idle temperatures were down to 40
degrees which is not too bad and so
we're gonna run a Cinebench score now
for you guys and see how it does perform
and also some quick noise tests
so now we're finishing up with the race
self tested at for over ten minutes and
the temperatures are starting to
stabilize here on the package node zero
we're getting about seventy six degrees
maximum of 86 so it looks like there's
no throttling at all however will
quickly run a Cinebench score and get
some noise numbers with DB terms for you
guys holding the meter from 15
centimeters from the cooler so we just
finished up ten minutes on the cryo rig
c7 here and this is doing really well
the best so far it's 80 degrees max also
the idle temperatures they're as low as
25 degrees C and let's run a quick
Cinebench on this thing and see how it
performs in that
so now after testing these three coolers
they're all intended for different
purposes
the Wraith stealth is being a phenomenal
value proposition does really well
especially for the 2400 G and also the
2200 G comes included with the CPU it's
a great cooler has 55 milk clearance but
if you want something a little better
you can go for the cryo rig c7 which
comes in 45 mil clearance and in my
opinion has a better fan included which
does downdraft the air and help cool
around the surrounding components around
the CPU like the vrm for example and I
did test this with the thermal-imaging
camera the noise levels between the
stealth and also the cryo rig were very
similar and the temperatures were giving
an advantage to the cryo rig over the
stealth however they both handily beat
the Dyna Tron here which in its fair
defense it does have only a 30 mil
clearance so it is extremely low-profile
it's lower than that of standard ddr4
memory so it's really going to go well
with low profile ddr4 memory and of
course it's intended for the server
market where they're gonna fit a lot of
these low powered CPUs they can mount
these things properly and they don't
care about noise because this thing did
get very noisy as you may have heard
before and also it doesn't mount
properly on a m4 consumer grade boards
so if you do want to get something like
this just keep in mind you may have some
headaches I had to free mount this thing
and then I got some decent figures out
of keep in mind it still wasn't
performing anywhere near as good as the
other two options that I presented here
today but ultimately with this little
cooler it does blow air completely away
from the motherboard as well so it does
have another purpose but for $36 I would
avoid this thing especially compared to
the other two options I presented here
today unless of course you know how to
mount this thing and you desperately
need that 30 mil clearance anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
let me know in the comments section
below if there's anything else you want
to add about this the cooler is
certainly not as good as the music
doughnut Ron makes some awesome music
but another really cool thing I learned
today with the thermo imaging camera is
this base plate since it is really shiny
it can't get an accurate reading as this
was well over 40 degrees it was really
hot to touch but it was reflecting off
the thermal-imaging camera so it
couldn't read it properly but when we
took a look inside it was giving out
really hot temperatures compared to what
it was reflecting off so that was
something interesting that came out of
today's tests as well as a few other
things but I hope you guys enjoyed this
one I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
