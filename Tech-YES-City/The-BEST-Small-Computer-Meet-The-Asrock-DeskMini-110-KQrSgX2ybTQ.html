azrog desk mini and I mean it's a little
one alright welcome to tech city this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
review of the asrock desk mini one 10w
solution now this thing comes in at a
very competitive price at one hundred
and forty dollars or at least that's
what i could find it for and for that
price you get the case you get a mini
STX motherboard you also get the DC
adapter in the wireless module now as i
alluded to in the intro this thing is
really small it's five by five inches
and comparing it against the mini ITX
rig is g13 silverstone case there you
can just see how much damn smaller it is
than something like one of the smallest
mini ITX cases you can get is but what I
really love about this unit is the
ability to customize it the way you want
to with me I decided to opt in use a G
4500 which I picked up used for fifty
dollars also picked up an aching about
kit of laptop memory for ddr4 which came
in at $30 and I'll stop right there this
thing uses laptop based memory and not
desktop based memory which is a good
thing in this solution because it uses
less power and it also comes in
generally cheaper than the desktop
memory and for the last piece I put in a
240 gigabyte SSD from Silicon Power
which I picked up for $60 after I put it
all together which was extremely easy to
do I now have myself something little
but still powerful enough to do things
like streaming uses a home theater PC
and even gaming and you're probably
thinking gaming how the hell does this
thing even game well actually has the HD
520 graphics on that Pentium G 4500 so
let's take a look at what this thing can
actually do
my obsession I just want you in my
possession never giving up no fly not
letting you out of my side never giving
up this time for you
soon see that HD 520 graphics on the
little Pentium was handling some of
those easier to play multiplayer titles
perfectly fight at 1080p with a blend of
medium to high settings another thing
that I love about this unit is you can
do differently to what I just did you
can put in like a 6700 there and you can
also put in some more memory like 16 or
even 32 gigabytes of memory and have
yourself like a mobile 1080p video
editing station and if you're not even
putting in effects you probably even
step it up to like 4k the one thing I'd
love to see on this unit would be the
option to overclock the HD graphics I
couldn't actually find it there in the
bar so it's pretty sure that's the
limitation of the H 110 chipset itself
we've in the back of this unit you've
got two USB ports there besides that
you've got the Intel I - one 9v solution
which is very solid for something this
small above that you've got a comport
header and also display an HDMI out and
then further up you've got the DC
adapter power jack there moving over to
the front of the unit you've got the
power switch you've also got USB 3.1
type-c and Taipei you've also got a mic
in and headphone out jack then moving on
to the rear of this unit you've got the
option to vaison mounted if you so wish
to the overall the case has a lot of
ventilation so it shouldn't have any
problems with overheating
now one extra thing I'd like to see with
connectivity is probably the option for
two extra USB ports and also an optical
in if possible let's talk about what I
like and dislike about this unit and
really there isn't a lot to dislike
except those things that I quickly
mentioned before maybe an extra two USB
2 headers there and possibly an optical
in besides that the desk Mini is a
phenomenal solution for the price
installation was an absolute breeze the
build quality is very solid the included
power brick is pretty big though it will
do the job and is very easy to port
around considering the overall size of
this unit even with the power jack is
really small still you can also fit in
the desktop CPU fan which is a big plus
because you won't have to go out and
spend any extra money on a CPU fan and
you'll be able to use those desktop CPU
solutions you've also got the option on
the back there to mount two 2.5 inch
drives there up to nine point five
millimeters in height so most SSDs and
laptop 2.5 inch solutions will fit
perfectly fine on this unit and then
lastly you've got those two m2 support
slots there one which generally is taken
up by your Wi-Fi
and another if you want to use an m2 SSD
solution however if you like Wendell you
can even take it a step further and use
those to m2 slots into a PCI four-speed
connector and have yourself some PCIe
connectivity there if you wish to now
ultimately I can highly recommend the
desk mini especially considering the
price and what you can do with it and
also if you like this video please give
it a big thumbs up and also if you have
a deaf mini or if you want one what
would you do with it let me know in the
comment section below and I'll catch in
the next tech video very soon is out for
now bye 1080 P perfectly flung perfectly
flying of that you've got the DCA jet
adapter jack oh like a mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
