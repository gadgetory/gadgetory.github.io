creatives new headset which is the H
fives ladies and gentlemen welcome back
to tech es city this is Brian coming to
you guys today with a brand new headset
from creative
this is their new H series line and this
is the H 5s which I'm gonna be taking a
look at today so I'm really talking
about the features and what utility this
headset brings to the average gamer both
amateur and pro alike and I'm gonna be
giving you guys a mic test and then
talking about how it compares to
something like an audiophile pair of
headphones and giving you my subjective
thoughts and opinions on the headset so
starting from top to bottom we have the
headband which is very flexible and it's
coated in pleather so this is a very
comfortable material that they've gone
with me gaming for it on ours I did not
have any problems with the headband
itself and then moving down from there
we've got aluminium connectors which
connect to the headband they've also got
markings there to let you know how the
adjustments are and they also click when
you adjust it also coming out of the
headphone is a braided cable there which
allows for flexibility when you're
adjusting the headphones also that's
connected to the headphone casing which
is made of both aluminium and plastic
with the outer casing there having the
blaster X logo being made of aluminium
and that's red and black to go with the
rest of the same of the headphones
now the actual headphone casing itself
is plastic and it is very sturdy however
it's a good thing they've used plastic
because it allows the overall weight of
the headphones to be 285 grams with the
microphone attached which is a very
comfortable weight for long-term gaming
sessions now the inner pads themselves
are removable and they are made of
pleather now sweat fans will have no
complaints here I tend to sweat easily
and I wasn't finding myself sweating
after a few hours of gaming with this
headphone so that's a good thing now you
can also replace this with velvet if you
wish to as the size is a pretty standard
size amongst the audiophile world so
taking off the inner ear pads reveals
these speakers the 50 millimeter
full-spectrum speakers is creative call
it with a frequency response of 20 Hertz
all the way up to 20 kilohertz this is
over a hundred eighteen decibel
sensitivity at one milliwatt
as they raid it and honestly they are
pretty sensitive and they put out a good
sound I'll talk about that a little bit
later in this subjective opinion of the
audio moving on to the last place of the
headphone which is the bottom we've got
the 3.5 millimeter Jack Sayer one being
for the actual headphone input and
output and also one being for the
detachable microphone which will allow
you essentially to use this headset as a
headphone if you're travelling onto the
cables themselves they're 1.2 meters and
they're both braided and they're both
very thick now the two separate cables
essentially allows you to use this
headset as a 1.2 meter length if you
want to use it for traveling and just
plug it into your smartphone which will
have the four prong end there so you can
also use this for Skype calls with your
smartphone and then moving that if you
wish to extend it to your PC you've got
an additional 1.2 meters there which
will split to both a 3.5 millimeter jack
for the mic and the headphones
separately onto the last part of this
headset is the microphone itself which
has aluminium ribbed casing here to
allow for a flexible adjustment which
holds very well you've also got a boom
filter on the microphone and the 3.5
millimeter jack with its own unique
grooves there now the microphone itself
does have a frequency response of a
hundred Hertz all the way to 15
kilohertz at a 40 decibel sensitivity so
that's a look at the headset itself
let's move on now to a mic test
so here's a mic test on the creative h5s
attached boom mic so I'll just pause for
a few seconds and let you hear if the
mic is introducing any noise and then
I'll also quickly do some ambient noise
in the background as well so that was
from about five meters away so let's
quickly move on now to the v-moda boom
Pro and do the exact same tests okay so
now we've got the v-moda boom Pro up and
this is just me talking normally just
like the h5 headsets or quickly pause
for a second and now the settings are
exactly the same levels as the h5 and
also quickly do a background noise test
sorry it's actually from about three
meters away
so that's just ruffling a plastic bag so
now it's conclusion time and I'm going
to give you guys my subjective thoughts
and opinions about the creative h fives
now a lot of people want to know how do
they sound and I'll get onto that very
soon but I'll say as soon as I pick
these things up out of the box I've been
nothing but impressed with the build
quality the comfort which I will add as
well the actual size of the headphones
they will fit small to medium heads I
can I kind of think of myself as having
a medium sized head and these kind of at
max distance match my head or fit my
head pretty well so I imagine if you
have a large head these might not fit
your head but now on to the sound itself
very full sound very good the bass is
balanced it's not too overpowering it's
not too underwhelming it's just right in
my opinion they've also got the bass
port there which on the closed headphone
itself will give you a bit more bass
however it that bass port does allow a
little bit of noise to creep in so it's
not a fully closed off headphone you
will be able to still hear ambient
noises now on to the mids themselves
another great point about these
headphones they reveal a lot of detail
they're very crisp mids I like where
it's at and also the 3d imaging on that
note isn't is good it's there but it's
not as good as something for instance my
HD 5/9 eyes which have a lot better of a
3d image than the actual H fives do but
they're an open headphones that keep
that in mind
also my Fidelio L ones have a little bit
better 3d imaging than the H 5s so
they've got decent 3d imaging though it
is a little bit of a weakness of the H
5s now moving on to the treble itself
this is another thing I like about the H
fives great treble it's balanced it's
smooth it's not invasive and that's
exactly where I like my treble so
ultimately the sound itself I'd call it
a neutral sound it's very nice to listen
to and for hours and hours of gaming
you're gonna find yourself having a
great time with this headset now on to
the next part which is the mic obviously
another important part of a headset I
thought the mic was a little bit
lackluster in terms of the actual sound
going into it but a benefit
of this microphone is that it was very
sensitive it was extremely sensitive and
so it will work on any device and no
ambient or outside noise was really
creeping in and there was no inherent
noise to the microphone itself so I'm
very pleased with the microphone
especially since it's targeted at gamers
where gamers just need to hear each
other's voices and very clearly you'll
be able to do that with this microphone
and obviously expecting to record
professional-grade equipment and you're
a streamer for example then you may wish
to get a dedicated audio interface and a
dedicated condenser microphone which I
think you should be doing anyway if
you're doing professional work so the
microphone I'm gonna say they've hit the
Mach with the microphone in definitely
definitely for the intended market also
some things that I forgot to touch on
earlier with this headset is that you
get the creative blaster X live software
which comes included for free and it
gives you four different profiles which
will EQ your headphones to that
particular genre of game for instance
FPS will give you a bit more treble to
hear footsteps easier you also get the
bass management option crystallizer
option and surround options there which
can allow you for a little bit more of
an immersive experience I found this
particularly useful in single-player
RPGs where I just want that more
immersive feel in a game so all in all
I'm going to be giving this headset four
and a half stars out of five as I was
very impressed with everything from the
build quality to the actual sound itself
and I think they've hit the target
market perfectly with this headset and
that gamers will have a great time on
the H fives now one thing I will say is
that the price these come in at 130 USD
which is fair value in my opinion though
I would like to see it around about $100
I think they would sell out like
hotcakes at this price point because
they would offer just a really good
overall headset for the money they're
$130 they do start to creep into the
territory of something like Fidelio l
ones plus a V mode of boom Pro which in
my opinion I do slightly prefer over the
h5z they have a little bit better 3d
imaging and they have a better
microphone in my opinion though that
being said the fact that I'm comparing
this to audiophile grade gear
thanks for the creative h.5 so they've
done a great job with this headset and I
can highly recommend it to someone just
looking for a nice clean headset that
just functions very well overall so if
you have any questions about this
headset then please drop a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can and that's
about it guys don't forget to hit the
like button as well and I'm gonna peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
