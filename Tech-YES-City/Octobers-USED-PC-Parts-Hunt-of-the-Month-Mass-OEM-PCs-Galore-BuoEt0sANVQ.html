parts hunt of the month but you may
notice from the date there's actually
November and there's some excuses of
course we started the SR to build that's
on the way and we've also done the
health videos the next two parts will be
dropping very soon and we had to go to
packs so it was just a super packed
October but that aside let's check out
what deals we can hunt this month on
good old gam tree
oh hey will how are you mate yeah good I
just see you got an ad up here on
gumtree for a PC yeah yeah I mean I can
come pick it up pretty soon if I go like
110 cash if that's okay yeah okay man I
do want to text us your address and I'll
be over all right there's a deal done
110 bucks easy
we've got a 95 2400 whole system we're
gonna try and jump onto the next one so
next year we'll get up here is that
alien where are three desktop from last
month with the i7 6700 we offered half a
G or Z and they said I think there's ask
for 520 or something so I might give
them another call see if we can pick it
up because apparently you can some
people said in the audience you can
vertically mount a GPU and so you can
put in something like a GTX 1060 even
that would really make the appeal of
this build so much better but we'll see
if they do take see if they are open for
500 and then if so we'll go pick it up
yeah so you got an ad up on gumtree for
an alienware desktop I think I offered
like last month 500 building he came
back with like 520 I mean if you wanted
I could pick it up for 500 yeah sounds
good night sounds good thanks Danny
seemed a byte okay that is looking a
little bit prompt hello Bryce Bing oh I
can call in pretty soon I should be
hitting the road like in the next hour
so if you want to send Texas over the
address then I'll come
No okay that is success they call back
pretty much immediately so they can take
the half a G which is the specs in this
thing look really good so if we can fit
a GPU in it like a 1066 gigabyte then
this will be a pretty solid PC so now
next up here we've got an i7 4770k it's
like before except they've got no
graphics card in it they're only asking
450 AUD so I wanna see if I come in with
an offer of 380 but I'm also gonna ask
if it has a power supply in it because
the only list that it's really just the
system and the SSD and stuff like that
so if it does have the power supply and
it does have and it just needs a hard
drive for example on a graphics card
then it will be a really good pickup at
this price so we had someone else who
didn't pick up their phone onto the last
deal now so next PC we've got up here is
a pretty interesting pitch because it's
a whole PC with an i7 4770k rx4 84
gigabyte and they're asking 650 for it
they say they need to move to New
Zealand so I'm gonna call them up and
see if they'll take 500 and if so what
we can then do is then part out the RX
for 80 sell that individually put in
something like a 1070 TI and then make a
really healthy flip here that's if they
take it so the more we beat them down
essentially the better and more
appealing this deal will be I guess
that's much like any deal I guess but
let's give it a shot
all right so that one rung out I'm just
gonna send them a text message and see
what they say cuz it's still only 11
a.m. but it's I don't know it is a
Friday so I know is what pax does to you
so next deal now we got up here is an i7
3770 I always love me a good eye seven
and this is going for 120 we're gonna
drop in an offer of a hundred
I think they'll take it at that price
and since we're going up that way anyway
I've got to go see my accountant up in
Brisbane today so it'll make sense if I
can go pick up some deals while I'm up
there
so let's give it a shot alright so
that's someone else who didn't pick up
their phone but that aside we do have
the two addresses ready for the
Alienware and also that other desktop so
we're gonna go pick them up but we're
also gonna give less a call since liz
has a few pcs up for sale and less
always does good deals so we're gonna
see yet what's cracking over it lasers
so it's now the next day I'm actually
pretty sweaty because I was cutting all
these pcs downstairs we ended up in
total getting 11 pcs so we ended up
picking up the Alienware on the Gold
Coast and then picked up the i5 PC we
don't forgetting the only way for five
hundred and then the a lab the other PC
the i-5 for a hundred dollars sells six
hundred in the both the people I picked
it up off there were actually viewers of
the channel they knew who I was so it's
really cool meeting them having a chat
and then as I was going up to Brisbane
to see my accountant Nathan got back to
me with the i7 3770 said you could have
it for $100 so I ended up picking that
up and then after the accountants we
went to lasers stopped off there and he
had nine pcs that I was interested in so
I ended up picking up a lot but I could
only fit six pcs in my car at that time
so I've still got three up there in
terms of what's still left to get but
this months been absolutely crazy
because we've picked up in total 11 pcs
and we've also got a I 7 3770 and these
are all decked out with AI fives 4th gen
I 5 2nd gens very curious to see how
this all goes down it's very interesting
I'm hoping it all goes smoothly but
maybe the I'll give you guys a separate
dedicated video on that because I think
I may come into some problems but
regardless I do have a 1050 TI on hand
ready to put in that build if the 1066
gigabyte doesn't come through but in
terms of every other PC here some of
them are aces some of them of course the
other ones where I just have to rip out
the components but the aces themselves
are the easiest to deal with in terms of
OEMs because you can plug up a
conventional ATX power supply and then
use that motherboard just like any other
mother bought at least up until 2nd gen
and 3rd gen I believe or even thought
gen with the Aces so they'll usually
like the prime goal they usually at the
prime of the cake in terms of OEMs and
they generally have backward support
with all the gravity odds Nvidia and AMD
also the other two people with the pcs
the RX for 80 they never got back to me
and the person with the i7 rig I've sent
them an offer I said look would you be
interested in 400 and I come and pick it
up so I'm still waiting on them to get
back to me I don't know if they'll come
through
but we will update this vlog later on
during the day because I love deals and
I know you guys want to see deals and
the way it's been going at the moment is
I'm sort of just been doing this parts
hunt once a month and it's been like I'm
just going Berserker on the deals so
it's really good I like I like getting a
lot of deals at once but I sort of want
to pace myself out through the month
maybe and I get some really good deals
but that's the weird thing like this
parts on this month all the deals have
been extremely good and in terms of the
pcs I picked up off less I'll put up a
list of what I got all the stuff for
because in total we got 9 pcs off him
for a thousand and forty dollars and the
specs of them were all like 4th gen i5
2nd gen I Five's even a first gen i7 and
now all decked out with memory 2 so I
think we've scored off less as we always
do here's a really good hookup I always
like buying off him in terms of the
other other people on gumtree I mean
it's always a vulture market out there
so you've just got to get what you can
and when you can but I was glad I picked
up that Alienware machine so I was very
curious about it to begin with last
month surprised no one really took the
gamble and try to pick it up but
regardless we've got the deals here
we're gonna try and get some more deals
before we close off this parts hunt so
stay tuned
so we just got back in now and the last
deal is now on the table well it
actually didn't fit on the table so I
put on the floor for now but what we're
going to do with these builds now is do
a tack yes hurricane whip them up into
something that is nice and juicy but
also has the gaming spec on it plus all
the tuning as well and these pcs are
definitely going to turn out from rags
to riches which is what I love doing
hope you guys enjoyed this month's pod
hunting I think the tally now is coming
over a bit over 2g AUD so in USD terms
I'll put that up on the screen for you
guys over in the US but yeah we got 1112
pcs now so 12 pcs for that price we also
got an i7 3770 and these are all you
know quality 2nd 3rd and 4th gen CPUs so
nothing to fret out still got great
performance when it comes to gaming and
I think I need a day off sometime but go
back from packs everything's still under
control health videos are coming out
they're already been filmed and cut too
so stay tuned for parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 part 2
will probably be actually coming out
before this video and so you just got to
wait for part 3 and then the sr to build
we've already got part 1 done so stay
tuned it's all all the broken promises
they're all coming together now so those
guys have been complaining over the last
year can I can I get a yes and with that
aside there is one more thing before I
get out of here and that is one of the
OEMs that I got this month they've got
the 24 pins already there sometimes when
I get the Lenovo pcs or the Dells and
stuff like that
they've got proprietary connectors but
this time around we had pretty much all
the pcs having 24 pins on them so that's
really good news I'll be able to
transplant them easy if not I could
probably get some converters or
something and change them over but this
month was definitely a success let me
know in the comments section below what
your favorite deal of the month was and
if you like this one then be sure to hit
that like button sorry I've been so busy
lately and I know I do hear a few people
in the comments like we want more use
content that'll be coming very soon
especially with Christmas just around
the corner but we just had a massive
wave of new r-tx gravis cards new CPUs
from in
and AMG so hopefully after this new wave
we'll have a little bit of a break and
we from the new stuff we can get back to
the you stuff so stay tuned
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
