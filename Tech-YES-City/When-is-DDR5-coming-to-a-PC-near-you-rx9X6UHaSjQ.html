even ddr2 if you're into a bit of LGA
775 it's all system memory and nowadays
is actually quite expensive but there is
DDR 5 on the horizon and should you need
to upgrade to it let's do a little bit
of analysis and focus on the topic
today's video is brought to you by
asrock with their hates 370 performance
motherboards if you're in the market for
an eighth gen Intel CPU even an i7 this
board has you covered with a 10 phase
vrm design you can even control things
like RGB fans and other components via
the polychrome RGB software which you
can use in both the BIOS and windows
click on the link in the description
below to learn more
so before looking at the future of
computer memory we have to evaluate what
we have right now if you're buying a
computer in 2018 or even a new
smartphone it's most likely running ddr4
you may stop me and say that's because
ddr4 is the fastest look I can pick up a
stick of ddr4 with 30 200 megahertz X
and piece but there's more to the story
than just memory clock speeds the
biggest resistance to clock speed is
latency so we need to start with latency
we mainly need latency because the CPU
and memory don't run at the same
frequency so there's an element there
where the system is waiting for the
memory because the CPU is faster most of
the time but what about when it isn't
what if we happen to have for example
3200 mega Hertz ddr4 memory on a 3200
maker at CPU zero latency you might ask
nope because the motherboard is now your
bottleneck so true low ultra-low latency
memory is it even possible well no they
even did it on really old Intel CPUs
such as the original 8086 which runs at
8 megahertz on a 3 micrometer
architecture that's 3,000 nanometers
that was the last time the memory
processor and boss ran at the same
frequencies but even the 8086 needed
latency so that the data could
physically move between two components
otherwise by the time the electric
current reach the CPU it would have
started a new cycle resulting in
essentially a short circuit
lots of talky-talk what does that mean
for you DDR 5 was initially rumored to
be released in 2020 but news of the
standard being finalized in 2018 and
released in 2019 have come to fruition
here's some things you can do now to get
the most out of your system however well
as long as you have dual channel and
some systems even have quad channel
memory you are using the most bandwidth
possible for your CPU you could also try
overclocking your beak
instead of your cpu ratio but with ddr5
hopefully we'll be able to sync up those
clocks once again then it's just a
matter of waiting for motherboard
chipsets to improve enough to reach an
equilibrium before cpus get higher
clocks once again ideally games will
start utilizing more cores so we don't
need to hit such high frequencies so we
can focus on trying to cut down on
latency because the ddr 5 spec proposed
is aiming for 40 400 megahertz 260 400
megahertz with latencies of CL 42 to 48
to put that into perspective most ddr4
runs at seal 15 out of the box 21 33
megahertz and ddr3 runs at CL 11 1600
megahertz well at least most of it does
now so comparing latency across
different DDR architectures is factually
inaccurate since memory goes by cycles
and the lower the better however the
higher the polling rate the better from
the speed itself means we are looking at
ddr4 having a comparable latency of
which tend to keep speed differences
between the two marginal for example
we're comparing ddr3 to ddr4 we have
0.006 875 latency per pole for ddr3 with
ddr4 we have 0.007 oh three three four
for ddr4 and for ddr4 we have calculated
roughly zero point zero zero seven zero
three two three four and the guesstimate
for DDR 5 would be somewhere around zero
point zero zero nine five four five
so as bandwidth improves the latency
increases some may say this is a bad
thing I would say it's both a good and
bad thing a necessary evil rather ddr5
of course will have its other benefits
and it will run at lower voltages one
point one volt is the predicted spec
this will mean lower power consumption
and less heat output a great bonus for
large corporations with server farms
like Google for example running X amount
of servers in their headquarters the one
at all draws back to the single end
desktop user which is me and most likely
a lot of you guys out there the
differences are negligible for the end
user only an extra few watts extra power
consumption and is shown by many
different benchmarks in games ddr4
already doesn't make that much of a
difference compared to ddr3 and in fact
some games generally
appreciate lower latencies of anything
though Rison is an exception to this
preferring both higher transfer speeds
and also lower latencies call it a
unique CPU designed to say the least
much because of its infinity fabric
though truth be told ddr5 isn't delayed
at all and it actually is ahead of
schedule
I think with worldwide increased
consumer demand for smartphones tablets
computers laptops and all things
Electronics brings a never saw /
amplified demand for this memory and
when ddr3 was released back in 2007 ddr4
came seven years later in 2014 way back
when Intel's fifth generation high-end
desktop CPUs and x99 was first released
so for a 2019 slated release it is
actually beating the previous
generational gap between ddr3 and ddr4
though mitad Lee it's losing out to that
of the shift from ddr2 ddr3 which was a
four-year gap when ddr2 was initially
released in 2003
so in conclusion memory is a funny thing
o pun intended
just like our own memory the system
memory is volatile it will forget things
there let's not forget the ddr 5 will
just be another release in the pipeline
and that will of course come with the
new release of cpus motherboards and of
course fancy RGB heat spreaders the
technology itself is predicted to use a
seven nanometer node process which is a
2.2 times shrink compared to that of DDR
fours 16 nanometer when that was first
released it will have the same 288 pins
as ddr4 and provide overall transfer
speeds faster than its predecessor
though predicted to still lose out
slightly when it comes to latency the
first prototypes are already in the
testing phase and everything looks to be
going as smoothly as planned though one
thing for sure is the insatiable demand
for things like smartphones has in my
opinion sure increase the demand for
speeding up the before estimated 2020
release to the now predicted 2019
progression of transitioning from ddr4
to ddr5 with the following graphs
showing some crazy stats where in 2012
the total demand for DDR memory was
around 20% in smartphones fast-forward
to 2018 that is now up to 45% and
predicted to top 50% in the next few
years quite scary when you
think of it not quite pleasant since you
guys might be watching this video
on a smartphone though speaking of this
video thank you guys greatly for
watching it if you enjoyed it then be
sure to hit that like button and let us
know in the comments section below are
you looking forward to ddr5 me
personally yes because then we have
hopefully more fabs
that can produce more system memory and
hopefully in turn that can have some
kind of economies of scale that can kick
in and bring the price down of ddr3 or
ddr4 perhaps so we can start getting
gaming PC's for cheaper let me know your
thoughts and opinions in the comment
section below
love reading those comments as always
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now BAE
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
