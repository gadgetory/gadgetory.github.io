easy and back here today just come with
your view video firstly I want to say
thank you guys about 250 subscribers
booyah
which is really good so you know
channels going guys so thanks for your
sub really appreciate it and today I
wanted to come with video today because
we're going to not just a
shopping-center guys we're going to a
shopping center in the retail so you're
probably wondering well why's the reader
so important because well in Japanese
it's nerdi dot but why is it so
important because when you get to the
airport you're in Narita
so that's you're actually you know when
you're flying into Tokyo so to speak
you're not really flying into Tokyo
you're flying actually into Narita so
basically I wanted to show you guys
around like you know there's a big
shopping center there called Eon so
today we're going to go shopping there
and hopefully we're going to buy a
little beam and a present so we're going
to find him something nice so yeah guys
firstly when you come to Japan you'll
notice there's a few little difference I
want to point out while we're driving
too is if you look here so we look here
we've got you know almost every Japanese
car has a navigation system now I
installed this myself because I'm a geek
so yeah they're really cheap in Japan
they're probably about we got this one
for about $500 and it does everything
plays DVDs gives you navigation you know
all the all the fancy bits that you need
in the navigation system so yeah
basically every car in Japan has a
navigation system and a lot of the cars
here are kind of new so that's something
to look out for it to do they love the
technology even though the houses in my
opinion are you know kind of outdated so
it's funny and the Japanese do love
their technology and I love technology
too so it's a bonus I'm living in Japan
so when we get to the shopping center
guys will have a look at what this big
shopping center is about so narrator
itself is a massive City it is I think
the third biggest city in chiba camp so
this is the prefecture which i live in
and it's only about a 40-minute drive
from the cells onto birth alright guys
well we are here now this shopping
center is massive so I've never been
here before but yeah this place is huge
it's got a humic cinema too so yeah
we're trying to find a park now oh my
god so we are here now at the shopping
mall and little bees got his new worm
costume on
don't you here's your little worm
costume yep
whoo he's happy hello oh and so there's
our car guys that's you know a car like
that in Japan's really cheap so if you
wanted to buy a car you know something
like probably cost you like $4,000 maybe
so with navi and everything so yeah
Japanese cars are very cheap in Japan
yeah let's go into this place guys and
check it out
so we are just in the shopping mall now
and here's Megami say hello he's a
little bee man he's he's ready for the
ride too and first things first guys

coffee I'm in lazy holiday mode and I
just started doing some exercise again
so pretty damn lazy the man need a
coffee to kickstart me Oh God so that's
pretty cool man
looks like all you new big shopping mall
the best thing about this place probably
he's got a humic cinema like those real
big cinemas and they have the Avengers
in 3d so I wouldn't mind God seeing that
well have we got little B so I think we
can't see it today Oh grant white Wow
okay all right well let's get Starbucks
first and then we'll show you guys more
of the stores that we're going to shop
at
that's let's just have a quick look
first Scot club ooh lots of work lots of
women's fashion so yeah I mean probably
there's a parent who's like 170 stores
here I'm guessing like most of them yeah
guessing most of them would be for women
but yeah there will be the occasional
store that's pretty cool for someone
like me so let's have a look
but there's coffee italics coffee that
should do the trick we are going to get
cut Tully's Coffee I am no loyalists to
Starbucks I drink any coffee is good
enough for me so let's have a look
Tully's Coffee New Year
let's go let's go it's what really good
this is what I had up getting I ended up
getting a honey milk latte yeah would
you end up getting alpha Gore help yeah
but what was it called an alpha Dora and
alpha Gore now I end up getting an alpha
Gore's off yet something hey guys we're
gonna finish this and we'll get back to
shopping well yeah we just finished the
coffee now there's all these other
stores but also in Iran they've got the
Big E on store them itself and that's
kind of got like everything like your
electronics and your clothes and toys
and stuff so we mainly came here today
to see to buy some stuff for little bee
man so we're going to see what baby
stuff they got and how we can spoil him
because was it two days ago he had his
three-month birthday yes three months
and he just got his Australian
citizenship too so he is now a citizen
of both Japan and Australia yeah so
let's have a look at some baby stuff
yeah guys we're gonna look at baby stuff
and then we'll keep looking through this
big super more super more not super
marvelling super shopping more big
complex / biggest shopping more oh my
god anyone I'm saying so once we're done
baby shopping we'll get back to seeing
some of the other cool stores and see if
there's anything unique really but yeah
they got lots of cool stuff here beside
like mobile phones I actually need a new
mobile phone soon so I think I'm going
to buy one baragas we'll take a look
through once we're done baby shopping
yeah so we kind of see how big this
place is like you know kind of goes all
the way back to there then goes all the
way over there
just massive so we haven't even found
the baby section yet but it's just so
much to shop here like so yeah if you
guys come to Japan you're in Narita I
definitely recommend you check this
place out
it's called the Aeon Narita so we're
gonna keep shopping oh it's got the kids
section oh my god so that that that's
like the yeah that's the katakana kids
yay let's have a look
let's keep looking so moving out of that
big Iran shop we ended up buying him a
little cap little ball she will show you
later when we unbox will we unpack it we
got in a little baby hat but it was like
20 dollars pretty expensive but it's his
three-month birthday so he does get
spoiled today was two days ago that we
didn't we went shopping but we couldn't
find him a baby hat then so yeah
lots of shopping for like for girls
especially there are lots of shopping
here a ladies if you're watching this
there is this place is your heaven I
think you know there there's just so
many stores here that yeah they cater
for fashion and stuff especially female
fashion
reason being I guess yeah Japanese women
and I guess all the women who come to
Japan especially to a very very fashion
orientated it's very fashion here is
very huge I guess so yeah I guess
rightfully so there's enough stores to
accommodate me myself I'm just here
angel just show the audience what I'm
wearing what yeah just take the camera
I'm just wearing a shorter shirt
here's my fashion shirt shorts and Crocs
that's a long way yeah
so how's that for fashion guys and girls
that's just not much fashion there at
all sorry when I use the term guys I'm
pretty old-school
I usually use the term for guys in
everyone so I think lately there's been
people who've been getting pissed off
about it you know when I grew up we
learnt that you know guys kind of meant
everyone so I don't know so if I use
that term sparingly please forgive me
yeah there's just so many stores here
what do you want to look at angel
so somin like unbelievable this place is
huge I got to come here again I think I
might even do some fashion shopping
myself get up-to-date instead of just
wearing a plain t-shirt and shorts and
looking like a bum ya guessed true to
heart I am a bomb
maybe shoe shop so yeah guys is huge
huge huge every this is only this like
we're only on one for me to walk under
all these stores so when we find sort of
we'll find a store that we're going to
shop at and we'll show you guys what
we're what we come to shopping at I got
no idea what I want to look at I'm just
wandering through this place like I
don't even know what I'm doing this
place looks kind of cool right on I
guess they're right on
don't have a look in here
I have a quick look slide the first
store that's got something for me I
think so this is right on this is like a
big yelling at the big men's fashion
chain store so
I don't know I really don't know
they don't have bomb fashion I'm sort of
after that I'm sort of after the
unfashionable fashion if they have it so
we can find you guys okay guys so the
clothes store did not really have
anything for me it was too fashionable I
mean it was just too much
I need the store where they've got kind
of like just a t-shirt
so the plain t-shirts you know but they
be a little bit of like a little bit of
fancy stuff on just a little bit but

about pets in Japan is a really
