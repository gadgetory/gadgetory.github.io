problem where the motherboard run just
isn't going to cut us
what is cracka lackin ladies and
gentlemen today we are building a gaming
pc for the newly released title anthem
it's on the origin EA's platform it cost
around 40 USD and it's been getting some
mixed reviews people are saying it's
good some people are saying it's
stuttering the performance on PC is
pretty bad we're gonna be checking all
that out today but let's move over now
to the minimum and recommended specs and
then compare that to what we have on the
table so the recommended specs state
that you'd either want to have an i7
4790 that's 1/4 Gen Intel processor 4
cores 8 threads or you'd want to have a
risin 1300 X and that's I four core four
threaded CPU but it's also newer than
the 4th Gen Intel and then for the
graphics card they're recommending
either a GTX 1060 or an Rx 480 which is
sort of mid-range graphics cards
released about two years ago so it
doesn't look like it's that demanding
but looking at the minimum required
specs we're going back like nearly seven
years now to a Radeon 7970 for the
graphics card a gigabytes of memory and
a Core i5 or if you know named the CPU
they're recommending an FX 6350 so what
we got on a table here is kind of like a
mix between the recommended and minimum
specifications because we're going with
that fourth gen Core i5 has well this is
an i5 4590 so it does have four cores
four threads but it does have decent
clock speeds so hopefully it doesn't
present too much of a problem we've got
to offset sticks of ddr3 memory we will
put these in dual channel this will make
eight gigabytes of system memory
hopefully I'm able to overclock this
stuff a little bit for the graphics card
we're going with an Rx 570 I got this
for fifty US dollars so is an absolute
bargain some of the best price
performance of course if you can find
deals like that then you're gonna be
miles ahead especially against going
with new parts and then for this case
here this is the Antec or Lindley I
picked it up on a bargain for 15 Aussie
dollars and make it like 10 US dollars
and it is admittedly a little bit dirty
but we're gonna be giving all these
parts some tech yes loving very soon
and then of course making this PC look
like brand-new and hopefully perform
even better
so techie ass lovin is all complete
we're now ready to put this thing
together but I did cut myself on this
heatsink down here it was so sharp
around this corner
lucky I learnt my lesson with my thumb
not to apply too much pressure when I'm
cleaning so it's pretty good just a
little nick on the surface there but
let's put this better than brand new
gaming PC together
so the pals flight isn't long enough and
we had to use a CPU extension there and
then over here we came into another
problem where the motherboard run just
isn't going to cut it so you've got to
go like that and just doesn't have
enough reach because this power splay
doesn't have long enough cables in the
case is actually really big so it's not
really the power supplies fault so we're
gonna remedy this by using cable
extensions red and black cable
extensions these will set you back
probably around 20 to 30 dollars
depending on what brand you use I got
these cheap ones off eBay I think for
these three pieces it's about 20 USD so
while we're at it we're gonna throw in
$2 extra of red LEDs and also wise will
spice off the CPU cooler with a red LED
fan
so here's the build it's all complete
and I gotta say this build is just
looking so amazing it come out a lot
better than I thought it would and we've
also got three fans up here three fans
at the front one fan on the CPU two fans
on the GPU and one fan on the power
place is like 11 fans in this build and
it's still very quiet there now it's
time to install Windows 10 then after
that anthem and if you guys are looking
for a cheap Windows 10 key Pro Licence
om as well legit single end-user license
tied to your motherboard then today's
video sponsor ek offers.com has you
covered for $11.90 after you use the

site to navigate I've used these keys
myself they're legit they check out they
are single end-user license and if
you're also looking for an office 2016
Professional Plus key and get one of
those for thirty three dollars and ten
cents after you use that coupon code TYC
20 what are you guys waiting for if
you're looking for those legit keys
since I think SCD keys have been out of
them lately
then ek offers have them in stock links
in the description below let's get back
to the build I bet you missed these
sound bites didn't ya okay well they're
not going anywhere
this guy
UST
to
that's fine
sure to real
sheep
bad days faster
so now the results are in for this PC
and I'm just blown away by what this
thing could do the i-5 4590 was smooth
as butter and when we look at the
results anthem first up high settings 62
average FPS 41 1% low 25.1% low so no
hiccups whatsoever I decided to turn it
down to medium settings but
unfortunately with medium settings and
all the other presets when you just try
to turn off anti-aliasing for example
because it doesn't have SMA it's my
favorite anti-aliasing taa doesn't look
that good to me when I turn this off I
have to then go to the custom presets
and then it applies the ultra preset in
this game sort is a little bit annoying
to have to go then change everything I
wish you could just put the preset in
first and then just change individual
settings from there but apparently I
have to go past ultra and then change
the settings from there so anyway high
settings was absolutely doable on this
PC at 1080p with the RX 578 gigs of ram
and the 4590 with no hiccups whatsoever
moving on to apex legends this is where
things got even better and I took you
guys advice to turn off the
anti-aliasing in this as well because of
the performance hits and this was
extremely smooth as well 1080p high
settings we're getting like 85 FPS on
average a 1% load of 50 and then a point
1 percent low of 45 I mean we're looking
at around a build cost of 218 US dollars
for this build and if you're in a stray
340 that's after I put the red LED
cooler in and the red LED strips and of
course those black and red cable
extensions now I checked the prices
online for the cable extensions and
they're so cheap I don't remember them
being this cheap for a 8 pin PCIe
extension for example it's around three
dollars and eighty ozzie cents which
would be like under three US dollars
delivered to your house and then for the
24 pin that was I think 11 Aussie
dollars so it'd be like 8 US dollars so
you could get the same custom extensions
that I've got here for next to nothing
and then for the CPU I actually didn't
have one that was actually another 8 pin
so I just had to use that standard
custom 8 pin CPU extension but it ended
up working out well because you can
barely see it and then the whole build
came to life I mean let me know what you
guys think of this build in the comment
section below because I just think it
turned out a lot better than I expected
I thought it would end up looking like a
potato but it ended up just looking like
absolute class I mean the metal inside
this case really reflects the LED
lighting well especially at night time
and then all the fans inside are whisper
quiet even while we're playing games and
talking of power consumption is around
I think 270 watts I think that's what we
saw our max load while we're playing
games with this combination but of
course we had to add on some additional
cost the game itself cost 40 US dollars
we had to install Windows 10 Pro that
cost an additional twelve dollars so
those things do add to the actual tower
itself unless you want to play Linux but
I'm not sure if anthem and apex legends
are currently supported in Linux correct
me if I'm wrong but also guys another
question I got asked about this PC was
the rx 570 I posted it up on Instagram a
sneak peek and it was true like I just
noticed as well someone pointed out that
hey you've been using this rx 570 over
and over again and I'm thinking to
myself yeah that's kind of true but it's
not the same rx 570 guys like you know
me when a good deal comes along I just
have to take advantage of it so you know
when you get an RX 570 for 50 US dollars
you don't just buy one you just keep
buying them because you know that's an
absolute deal so that's what I tell you
guys all the time in the audience when
you see a good deal regardless of
whether you desperately need that piece
or not always take a look and see what
you can get for the money and then grab
that piece because later on down the
track you'll probably be able to add
that with something else for example if
I found a heap of i-5 2400 systems and
they're really cheap I'd buy as many as
I could because I know I could use them
later and when it comes to PC flipping
like or just building yourself a really
good budget rig everything always
balances out in the end so you always
want to be looking for the best deals
possible and that's what these rx 570s
are at the moment they're just
phenomenal value both on the use market
and even in the new market if you go buy
these things brand new I think I saw the
going for like a hundred and ten US
dollars brand-new on amazon.com so
they're just going out everywhere and
they're the performance is insanely good
at 1080p you're usually talking better
than a GTX 970 and you're talking high
settings on a lot of titles even coming
out in 2019 at over 60 fps and then you
can get a 1080p monitor and that's dirt
cheap as well you can pick them up for
anywhere from like 30 to 50 US dollars
and they're still really good panels but
it goes I hope you really enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button also thanks for all
the comments on yesterday's video where
I put together that potato I mean
personally I love this thing a lot more
it's got a lot more class to it I just
didn't expect it sort of putting this
together I thought okay what can we do
here and then I sort of just happened by
chance otherwise you would have still
got ketchup and mustard and no LED
lighting but I didn't realize that for
so cheap I think it's like not even 30
US dollars you can spice up your build
adding just really good class tool with
the cable extensions the LED cooler and
the LED strips and that just makes the
build look totally different and I think
in this way it's actually a good look I
mean honestly that's not your thing in
the comments because I just think these
bling add-ons here they've come down a
lot in price I mean the strip's are a
dollar each on eBay the cooler itself I
think you can get them for 14 US dollars
on Aliexpress and then the actual cable
extensions themselves you can get them
on eBay as well for very cheap so I'll
put all the links in the description
below for some of the stuff that you can
get readily available but keep in mind
for some of these deals you will be
paying more if you want to buy it now on
the Internet as opposed to getting stuff
locally for example the CPU motherboard
a gigabytes of RAM and one terabyte hard
drive I go that for an absolute bargain
it's about 114 US dollars 160 Aussie
dollars from a contact who lives about
40 minutes up the highway from me but
that's what it's all about here around
