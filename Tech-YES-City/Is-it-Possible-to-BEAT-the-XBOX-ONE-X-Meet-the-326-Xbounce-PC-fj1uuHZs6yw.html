is a console that's being touted as
kicking the PC in terms of price and
performance and before we get on with
this video I will say one thing and it's
like a disclaimer and that is I will
agree that it will be extremely
difficult to build a PC especially a new
PC that will beat the Xbox one in terms
of pricing performance especially with
the current process of ddr4 Ram being so
high at the moment and also with that
graphics cards being sold out due to
cryptocurrency mining boon and with that
this is generally cause graphics cards
to be priced even above their retail
pricing though although we can't build a
new PC that beats the price performance
of the Xbox one X how about a used PC
which is a big focus of the channel here
at tech yes City well this PC beside me
does come in a lot cheaper so let's find
out if it can beat it welcome back to
tech yes it is brand coming to you guys
today with the PC of the month usually
every month around the channel I build a
used PC that gives really good price
performance and today's PC is kind of in
the middle it's not the best price
performance I've built but it's
certainly one powerful PC with the
center of this PC having a GTX 780 Ti
now this is a graphics card that's a few
years old but was very powerful back in
the day it was also extremely power
hungry to the point where this thing was
burning 550 watts
from the wall and this thing isn't even
overclocked I haven't even overclocked
it I'm just using the out of factory
settings although it is the Hall of Fame
so it is really aggressively clocked out
of the box now for the CPU we are using
a Xeon X 3450 you can get these off
Aliexpress for around $40 Australian and
even cheaper and USD so around about 33
US dollars shipped to your door
4 cores a threads can be overclocked
even with the budget motherboard like
today the H 55 motherboard which we
picked up in a whole deal for a hundred
astraying dollars came with a hard drive
case and a power-play though although
the case and the power supply are
mediocre we have to replace the power
supply with something stronger so we've
got here an ant X 621 continual power
high current gamer power supply which
will feed that 780 Ti all the juice it
needs
especially when it's under a gaming load
there was for some other parts with this
build it came with 4 gigabytes of ddr3
memory in that price although I decided
to replace it completely with a gigabyte
kit of overclockable ddr3 memory and
this came in at around about 40
Australian dollars and that's for the
cooler we actually got a brand new
cooler this is the antec a 40 pro and we
go this 429 Australian dollars and
although it's very small it did do a
really good job of taking this CPU up to
4 gigahertz and even under stress it
stayed under 90 degrees and keep in mind
this is in summer too so things can only
get better throughout the rest of the
year and this leaves the whole total is
build to 326 US dollars or if you're in
Australia 422 or strangles now if you
want to add a Windows 10 Pro key you can
go on eBay pick these up for 5 bucks and
you can install Windows legit have no
problems at all so if you want to add
that to the total an extra five dollars
Australian will get you sorted now
comparing this to the price of the Xbox
one X it's about two-thirds of the price
however you don't get any warranties
it's generally used parts and you
compare that to the Xbox one X is 500
USD or 650 Randle's with brand new
warranty it does make the Xbox one X a
pretty compelling option however with
that aside when we take a look at the
Xbox one X what actually makes it tick
it has an extremely updated graphics
portion on the system which makes it
comparable to a PC graphics card like
the rx 580 the RX 580 does have less
stream processors however it is clocked
a little bit higher so in the real world
the PC version the RX 580 and the Xbox
1x is custom AMD graphics solution would
be performing roughly the same however
keep in mind there is one key difference
and that is the bus width on the actual
memory itself it is 50% larger on the
One X as opposed to the PC though keep
in mind that the CPU still has to share
that extra big frame buffer of 12
gigabytes versus the aku bites on the RX
580 which is dedicated to the graphics
card itself and with that in mind two
weak points that I believe with the Xbox
one X is its CPU itself it's still using
the same CPU that the ps4 original and
the Xbox one original released three
years ago are using today that's only
30% more faster and also the ROPS
the graphics card itself allow its 4k
performance to be a little bit capped in
my opinion so with this console it is
kind of stuck in a little bit of a high
place sure there will be some awesome
customized games for the Xbox one X but
on the other fence there will be some
games that come out that won't play that
well on the Xbox one X as well
especially compared to the original
consoles you won't get that much of a
boost because of the CPU and also
because of that GPU having limited drops
at 4k anyway under the most important
part of the video the performance
numbers let's take a look at this PC
first when we went to overwatch we had
1080p ultra we're getting around 90 fps
and this was against the leaven Road
hogs on the screen me being a bastion
just mowing things down now when I step
this up to 4k medium settings I was
getting 90 fps
move over to a game like fallout 4 which
is meant to have an enhanced experience
4k 30fps on the Xbox one X we're seeing
here with the PC we can get 60fps at
1080p high settings and when we step
that up to 4k we're getting around 45
fps on low so it was performing a little
bit better than the Xbox one X low I'm
not sure on the graphical settings of
fallout 4 on the One X moving over to
destiny to the highest settings at 1080p
on this PC we're getting 90 FPS constant
practically no dips at all stepping it
up to 4k low settings 60 FPS we're still
getting a really good experience now
moving over to rise of the Tomb Raider
which is another enhanced in game on the
Xbox one x 4k 51 FPS on the lowest
settings at fault came and then taking a
captain's quizzo a Call of Duty World
War 2 which is actually a poster child
game for the Xbox one X it does run at
4k and it does run at 60fps when we
stepped up this PC beside me here on the
lowest settings at 4k we're getting
around about 60 FPS as well was very
smooth and there was no real stuttering
at all stepping it on to 1080p with a
very high-end extra setting detail we're
getting around a hundred to 120 fps and
of course there was no stuttering on
this PC as well there was I was talking
about before with the One X and it's CPU
and it's GPU configuration it's kind of
been an odd place for new games that
come out pretty quickly and of course
this day and age being
the age of a quick buck and bang jobs
it's no surprise to see a game like pub
G which was released quite quickly
however with that is a very exciting and
fun game to play being quite unoptimized
and this games like these that hit the
Xbox one and they just run really bad
you're getting around 30 FPS a lot of
the times 60 FPS will pretty much be out
of the picture due to the limitations of
the CPU so you're practically forced to
go to 4k however since this game is so
graphically intensive those drops are
going to be a limiting factor even at 4k
on the Xbox one X this PC beside me here
did perform really well at 1080p was a
great experience however when we did
step it up to 4k it was a very tough
time for this PC one that I wouldn't
play on personally so really when it
came down to it there were a few
victories for the Xbox one X and of
course there were a few victories for
this PC beside me it just depends on
your playing experience personally I
love high refresh rates and that's
something PC enables me to do especially
with very powerful CPUs even on a budget
and on a used PC like this you can get
really good performance though with the
grants cards you can pick up something
used in the use PC price market I've got
a lot of guides and every month I do use
PC parts hunting you guys can see how I
hunt every month of the good deals
what gravis cars I look for I put some
links in the description below with that
said this PC of the month here is very
good I'm proud of it it is a nice PC
they're taking a look at this PC it does
use up a lot of Parham with that I have
to leave the side panel off and also the
a 780ti Hall of Fame I actually thought
this would run a lot better than it did
the cooler was a little bit of a letdown
in my opinion it wasn't able to keep
this graphics card under control the 780
Ti does use up a lot of power and with
that it does need a bigger cooler I may
even put an arctic explorer on there
just to see if I can drop those
temperatures and get the clocks even
higher as it was thermal throttling I
believe and it's something that I'm not
proud of you might want this to run at
these temperatures all day every day
especially if you're a hardcore gamer
another thing is well I would like to
replace the hard drive maybe with the
one terabyte or even put in an SSD to
accompany that 500 gigabyte hard drive
but as it stands the Xbox one X great
console it's one of the consoles that I
can say is actually
very good in terms of its specs and its
hardware as opposed to the ps4 and the
Xbox one when they were first released
they were having a tough time doing even
1080p 30fps so it is a great addition to
the console market with the Xbox 1x it's
something that I may even consider
purchasing as opposed to the ps4 which I
purchased when that was first released
and I played it for about 15 minutes and
immediately sold it afterwards
anyway guys that's about it for me today
if you enjoyed this video then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comment section below what you
think of this PC here beside me and also
what you think of the Xbox one X do you
think it is a contender to the PC
personally I do think it is coming into
the good price to performance especially
in this day and age of high ddr4 Ram
prices and also the cryptocurrency
mining boom however I much prefer PC I
always have and always will and with
that I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
