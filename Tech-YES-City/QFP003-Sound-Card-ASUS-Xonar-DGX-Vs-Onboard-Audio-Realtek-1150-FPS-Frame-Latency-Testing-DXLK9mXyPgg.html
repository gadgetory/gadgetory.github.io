city's been easy coming back to you guys
today with episode 3 of quest for
perfection now you guys would love in
the series last week you gave me a lot
of support and this week I'm going to
give you another hit we're going to be
comparing sound cards more particularly
the pci express zeus zone rd GX and
we're going to be putting that against
MSAs onboard Realtek 1150 now will
firstly say that both solutions are
amazing for listening to music if you
want to check out my review where I talk
about the Zeus in terms the audio
quality and mic and I'll put the review
in the description below you can check
it out there but today we can be more
concerned with frame latency and also
FPS test and does it make a difference
for the hardcore gamer so I've done this
week is a lot easier to test with link
we can eliminate a lot of variables
because we can do single-player games
this time and I'm going to be using two
games Skyrim which is a very CPU
intensive game it's also RAM intensive
as well I'm going to be using that game
also I'm going to be using black ops 2
so these two games going to test these
sync off max frames we're going to see
if there's a difference let's move on to
the results okay so here's the results
that I've compiled for you guys and if
we see here this is the first test that
I've done skyrim at 1080p every graph
here is a 25 second run with the top 3
runs being the onboard Realtek audio
solution and the bottom 3 results being
the sound card from a Zeus now the
results here just showed that there was
practically no difference between the
two
the closer I look at these graphs the
more I can't see the differences at all
pretty much they are pretty much
identical there will be a slight ever so
slight amount of variance and that will
be due to when I press the record kit
you know I could have pressed at 50
milliseconds slower and this run as
opposed to this run so yeah really these
results come down to variance I'm in the
zoo sonar dgx lost the worst frame lost
against the real onboard real but real
tech by like 0.2 milliseconds so again
nothing so I can't pick out a clear
winner here in the FBS results on Skyrim
the the onboard real Tech one the
average FPS by one it lost the minimum
FPS by three at one
maximum FPS by two so I mean again that
can be put down to variance there was no
clear winner moving on to black ops 2
the sound card from a Zeus and the
on-board Realtek produced very similar
results again you guys are probably
thinking well this graphs look crazy
what the what the hell is going on here
so this was black ops 2 single-player
again 25 second runs 1080p ultra with
MSA - two speed so I wanted to put more
strain on the GPU the core itself as
opposed to the vram so I turned the MSA
down a little bit now you can see here
this time around maybe the Zeus zone RDG
x1 the worst frame by 0.2 milliseconds
so the reason why these graphs look so
crazy in black ops 2 is because you've
got to look at the maximum and the
minimum here since it's only 6
milliseconds the results are sort of
you're looking really close at the
results like if I was to double the
maximum and the minimum it would look
more smooth the line would start to look
more smooth so don't worry about that
it's just a visual thing but either way
5 milliseconds on top and bottom is just
an absolute smooth experience it's just
butter so these results here are just
smooth on both there is sound card from
a Zeus and the on-board real tech moving
on to the FPS results it was a win for
the azouz zona dgx by 0.4 fps and a win
on the minimum by 3 fps and a win on the
maximum for the on-board Realtek by 2
FPS so again I can't you know again this
comes down to variance so let's move on
now to the conclusion which I will also
talk about the onboard audio output of
the realtek versus the azuz sonar so
let's get on to the conclusion now so in
conclusion you guys probably took from
the results anyway that it does not make
a difference if you're using the PCI
Express sound card or using the onboard
audio solution both recorded very
similar for FPS x and frame latency
times as well which is the big thing so
I couldn't pick out a difference so yeah
if you're looking for more FPS or frame
line C's you're not going to get
sound card so that being said let's move
on to the audio experience for gaming
because you know you're probably
wondering okay alright sue cares about
the FPS let's look at the sound card
it's my designed to give you sound and
that's true when I when I booted up the
azuz sonar dgx i noticed straight away
that the mid-range frequencies were
boosted compared to the real tech 1150
so this meant that in games voices and
footsteps could be heard easier than the
real tech 1150 so I will give for gaming
I will give the wind to the ozu's onna
dgx that being said when I was doing my
music tests I tested three genres 80s
rock in excess I tested a wrap from
exhibit and I Chester deadmau5 these
were all flak audio files and I could
not hear you know the bass as well as I
could hear it on the real text so these
Zeus zona DG acts it sounded like the
bass was a bit muffled the realtek 1150
really did a good job of producing clear
definitive base and clear definitive
highs and I mean I'm not an audiophile
guy so you know don't tell you know take
tech audio advice from me with a grain
of salt but this is what I thought I
thought the real tak 1150 sounded better
for listening to music and I thought
Thea's ooh sonar DJ sounded better for
gaming and you're probably thinking what
the hell like why is that you know a lot
of people say sound cards are just so
good compared to onboard audio solutions
and this is May I think this is true
because of the fact that a lot of
onboard audio solutions have crap amps
on them this generation and this is why
I'm loving MSI so much this generation
they've put a good app on the onboard
audio solution so this means that the
signals
I thought the signals were actually
stronger as well on the MSI compared to
this designer dgx so when the signals
stronger people are automatically going
to get the headphone they're going to
get their sound card they're going to
install it and they're going to put the
headphones on and go oh well this is so
much better well it's just because the
you know they're getting a stronger
signal to the headphones
the everything's louder of course it's
going to sound better when a national
factors not you know it's not that the
DAX or the ADC is a better sister this
is the amps better so that's the main
that answers that question I mean of
course when you start going into like
$200 sound cards that's when you start
getting differences but at the same time
you're going to need a good pair of
headphones to be able to tell the
difference as well so everything works
in moderation you need you know the
weakest link always needs to be the same
as the strongest link if that makes any
sense but anyway that's all I can take
out of it I hope you guys enjoyed this
episode of quest for perfection if you
want to check out the review of these
Zeus zona dgx I'll put it in the
description below when it's ready and if
you like this please give it a thumbs up
and if you haven't really subscribed
attack your city now I have run out of
ideas for quests of infection so give me
some ideas what do you want to see
tested I'm gonna take some feedback from
you guys I want to do tests we want to
get the perfect gaming experience that's
what we're all here for give me some
ideas and I'll test them for you guys
anyway peace out for now ready be</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
