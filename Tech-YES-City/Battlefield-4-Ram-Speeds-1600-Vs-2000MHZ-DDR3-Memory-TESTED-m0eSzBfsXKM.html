down for cosplay come on
hoodie you know headphones what more do
you need ah anyway let's get on with
this take a city baby Brandi's game
about you guys are dead with a
battlefield 4 video and I'm testing 1600
speed memory versus 2000 I thought I'd
crank it up a notch instead of 1866
because I wanted to know if there was a
difference now let's get on to the
results bang it made absolutely no
difference at all
I mean Skyrim it made a difference in
Skyrim and it was a difference that was
I guess quantifiable you could say that
the difference was noticeable in Skyrim
but in battlefield 4 Ram speeds do not
make a difference at all as you can see
here the averages were virtually
identical and the minimum was actually
one frame higher on 1600 speed memory
and the maximum were the same now it is
important to point out that on my house
wall I have tested Ram speeds in the
past and for Haswell I do recommend 1600
speed memory with tightest timings that
you can get as this gave me the best
frame Layton sees it might make a
difference on AMD FX 8350 s or FX rigs
but you know it's this game isn't ran as
RAM intensive as some of the other games
I have played on before so battle for
four Ram speeds do not matter that much
anyway guys this is just a quick video I
hope you enjoyed it and yeah if you have
any questions please let me know in the
comment section below
keep in mind the Haswell does utilize
memory better than any other platform
out there as well so keep that in mind
if you have any questions please any
message if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up and if you haven't
read subscribe to take your city and
I'll be coming back to you guys with
another tech video chatelet emps a fan
at brainy bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
