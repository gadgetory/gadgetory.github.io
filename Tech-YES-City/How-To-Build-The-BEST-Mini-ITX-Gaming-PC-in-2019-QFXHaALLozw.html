Lindley PCT u-100 was released for
around a hundred USD now I think it was
definitely ahead of its time it was a
small form-factor had a suitcase handle
and the build quality was phenomenal but
I think they never intended for someone
to cram in six years later a ninety nine
hundred K a water cooler and also in RTX
twenty sixty which is exactly what we're
gonna be doing here today and in ways
it's all coming about because we're
using the AUSA SF power supplies these
are really small but in this case we're
gonna be using a 750 watt gold power
supply that has over 60 amps available
on this 12 volt line this thing is
pretty much half of an AS 1500 yet that
power supply is so much bigger and for
the motherboard we're using a Z 390 from
as Roberts got funderbolt of the front
it's got all the expansion you'd want as
well as the ability to overclock the
9900 k and then we're using a gigabyte
r-tx 2060 mini which will fit inside
this little case here so this build is
gonna pack a serious punch however you
probably noticed that we've taped out at
the bottom here and we've also taped out
the top that is because if we don't
drill some holes in this thing it is
seriously going to overheat and in fact
I'd say the design was never intended
for something like this with this much
power going through it but regardless my
need for this is the fact that when I
travel I need a mobile 4k video editing
powerhouse and I needed to be small and
I need to be able to carry it so this
fits the bill perfectly
and without aside let's drill this thing
out and see if we can put it together
properly without any hiccups
so here we are now we've finished the
top here we've smooth that off as a lot
of work actually even though it doesn't
look like much and then we got the
bottom we got some bigger holes drilled
in there because that's just for the
graphics card and so we've got air flow
for the graphics card we've got out take
here now for the radiator and fan then
we got intake at the front so hopefully
now we can start installing these PC
parts and have a build that won't
overheat that also still carry such a
small size and footprint
here it is it's finished we're gonna
boot it up and of course see if it works
but after that we're also gonna start
tuning this thing I'm just off the top
of my head I'm going to go for around
four point four gigahertz because with
the 9900 k after those levels it just
starts to hitting an efficiency curve
where you're using up a lot more power
and those extra 600 megahertz will end
up costing you probably double the power
consumption which in this case like
literally we have to keep the power
consumption down as much as possible so
we'll be going for efficiency curves
based on the GPU and the CPU and let's
get the show started I've kind of got to
turn the thing on first
so there's the results in now we've been
stress testing for over ten minutes and
we've Gus 73Â° max which I am super happy
with these temperatures in this little
box pound consumption is about 158 watts
I think that's the max I measured at the
wall and so now we're still gonna add
the GPU into the loop which I'm a little
bit scared about but we're gonna do that
and then come back and see the total
power consumption and also the
temperatures this time around
so now we've finished up with the GPU
tests added on so everything's being
stressed CPU and GPU and we're getting
about 300 watts power draw from the wall
and the fan speeds are going up to about
92% grabba Scott is hard locked at 83
degrees so it looks like it will be
slightly throttling in this case by the
CPU the temperatures are very well
controlled still 76 degrees Maxim very
happy with the CPU at the moment but the
GPU is getting a little bit hot so we're
gonna try something a little bit
different because this case does enable
you to quickly release the side panel
here and that will be beneficial when we
are editing videos because I don't
really care too much about the
aesthetics this thing has one purpose
and that is to travel and then put on a
desk and then get the most out of it so
let's leave this side panel off now for
another 10 minutes and come back with
the temperatures and see how it fared
so leaving the side panel off
unfortunately didn't do much to change
the total outlook the CPUs pretty much
hovering around these same temperatures
the noise of course a little bit louder
now coming outside the case and the GPUs
still getting pretty hot but ultimately
I believe this thing is still going to
be able to edit videos absolutely fine
as the thermal imaging camera is showing
that it's still inside near the
motherboard CPU things are pretty cool
the radiator at the front is remaining
very cool and also the outtake is pretty
damn awesome but now there's only really
one thing left to do but actually two
things I'm going to check the lowest
voltage I can use for the CPU at 4.4
gigahertz and see if that drops the
power consumption even just down by a
little bit then we're gonna run some
gaming benchmarks and see how this
little beast box the yes Mini performs
oh yeah
so all the gaming numbers are in and
what an impressive display by this
little yes mini box here we've got in
Apex legends of high settings we got 123
average FPS seventy-seven one percent
low 70 point one percent load dota 2 was
over 200 average FPS at max settings at
1080p 91 percent lows and 40.1% lows and
the good thing here the GPU wasn't still
being stressed at near 100% moving over
to shadows of the Tomb Raider the latest
and greatest title high settings 1080p
people getting over a hundred FPS and
all these three games were using about
200 to 250 watts while we were playing
them they're still under that max limit
of I to 64 is 300 watts that we saw
before and now it's time to talk about
all the components in this bill because
I'm honestly just blown away by this
thing it is gonna be an absolute
powerhouse when I travel overseas and in
fact I think a lot more people who are
traveling and doing video work for
events like Computex and CES and stuff
like that will definitely want one of
these because it's so unique to the
point where you've got the handle and
carry it around it's lightweight and
it's also got the 9900 K inside and the
r-tx 2060 and the balance is just so
good now we did manage to under vaulted
to about 1.0 5 volts at 4.4 gigahertz we
dropped the 110 watt figured down to
about 95 watts and suddenly I learned
about the 9900 K is I think that 5
gigahertz setting it's really past its
efficiency curve I think actually around
4.4 gigahertz is where you're gonna get
the best performance per watt out of
this CPU and it's still going to be a
beast of a CPU of these speeds but this
is really one of those things where the
past meets 2019 a 2013 case I just
honestly couldn't think of a better
candidate in fact these things are
getting so rare that I only managed to
get the silver version but I just
checked on eBay and there's a guy in
Italy selling them for about a hundred
and ten euro knee actually isn't
charging too much for shipping
he's only got seven available with the
black one and I actually might buy the
black version because I think it'll look
better than the silver version and I got
the idea from this when I was over at
Christopher years place in the you
when we're in Vegas doing that
competition if you haven't seen that
video already I put the link up here but
he had this case with different older
hardware in it and he said take a look
at this thing and I took a look and I
thought wow straight away I saw the
potential so I started researching up
about it and I thought well why don't we
just try to do a magical build in this
thing and this is where I'm gonna really
put an emphasis on this things literally
just fit like just fit it was a massive
pain in the bum to build in it was it
was just crazy how much effort it took
to get this thing right and get
everything packed in but the end product
is all that matters it's something that
works really well it's something that's
so small so portable but at the same
time it wouldn't be possible with all
these components inside so for the water
cooler we had the h-60 and then we
changed that around to to light lu-fans
and you might be thinking okay why do
you need the RGB bling it's actually for
functionality as well so I've got these
with the front one set up to a
temperature of the CPU the top set up to
the GPU so if they go red that's when I
know they're both entering the danger
zone and I might want to save my work
turn the PC off try and diagnose some
things so they actually offer
functionality in this purpose of the
Mini ITX PC here but moving on with some
other components the SF 750 watt power
supply would put in this is Corsairs and
you line up a new refreshment of their
small form-factor power supplies now the
cables are about half the length of your
normal cables that would come with other
power supplies and so this really made
it possible because we needed shorter
cable runs and we also had to get in a
small form-factor power play with enough
juice to power everything the thing
about this bounce blade was it so
overpowered even for this little build
that when we were on full load the fan
wouldn't spin up for literally like 10
minutes until the benchmark and then it
just decided to turn on a little bit so
it was whisper quiet I even tested it on
the other rig when I was overclocking
the 99 hundred K and the twenty eighty I
and getting six hundred watts and these
power supplies really hold up they've
also got an FS 600 which would do
absolutely find this build and an SF 450
even though the prices vary they go from
ninety five dollars to a hundred and
eighty US on Amazon at the moment
honestly the SF 4/5
would do absolutely fine in this build
despite it having such high-powered
components now for the motherboard we're
using the asrock mini ITX z 390 chipset
here and this thing is phenomenal had no
hiccups whatsoever of course with as
rocks bias it's so easy to use yet it's
so detailed I had no hiccups whatsoever
getting all the hardware inside to work
we're also using two 16 gigabyte 2400
lpx sticks from Corsair this was
actually super important to have low
profile memory in this case because we
had to mount the radiator at the front
and if we didn't have the RAM this
shallow then we would have came into a
problem where the build we would had to
do some serious hacking to get that
radiator working in the front then came
the graphics card at the bottom the our
TX 2060 mini this was the only card I
could imagine in the our TX 2060 series
that would fit inside this case and in
fact when we're installing the radiator
we had to push that up and then get the
graphics card in and then pushed the
radiator back down it was such a tight
fit but in the end it all worked out
everything performs phenomenally well
the graphics card does get up to 83
degrees when we are gaming at 100% load
but even when we saw the heaven
benchmark numbers with the side panel
off we had just over 2900 points and
then with a side panel back on we're
getting 2800 95 points
so basically also happens with the GPU
is once it hits 83 degrees it just
starts throttling the megahertz down so
it's nothing to worry about
this GPU will perform phenomenally well
especially since I'm not gonna be using
this PC all the time it's mainly a
travel rig and/or a gaming rig in my
spare time and honestly I don't get much
time to game nowadays because I'm
constantly hassling I'm constantly
making videos and doing other things non
gaming related although I do love
playing a bit of dota 2 every now and
then and this thing just absolutely
smokes to it it's too very responsive
amazing experience and it's just so damn
good hey guys if you enjoyed this tu 100
build right here then be sure to slap
that like button also let us know in the
comments what do you think would look
better the silver or the black version I
think the black version would be more
sleek the silver version kind of looks
like the musical carry case which I
guess would be good in the case of
traveling but
this is the reason I built this I don't
want much attention I want that
portability I want something that's
going to be out as five a bit of a
beating and this thing has it all the
build quality is phenomenal everything
inside is just really good components
big thanks to as rock and also Corsair
for sending out the cooler pounce blame
the motherboard wouldn't be possible
without these components if you guys
want to check out something like this
and build something similar then I'll
put some links in the description below
but this thing here in 2019 is easily
the best mini ITX case out there at the
moment especially for what I want to do
with it and that is just a mobile
powerhouse that is still very small and
with all that said I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
