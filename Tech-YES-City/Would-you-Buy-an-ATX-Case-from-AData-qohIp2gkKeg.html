is in the pocketoli?
This is a PCle Gen Four SSD
that's gonna be released
in quarter four, coming
at the end of this year.
Now, the speeds, we've got a silicon
motion controller on board with apparently
data storage up to 8 terabytes.
And they're coming in from 250 gigabytes.
In terms of the pricing,
I will update you guys
once they become available,
and of course I will be doing a review
where I put this thing
through all its paces
on a new X570 motherboard
with that PCle Gen Four support.
But in terms of the read and write speeds,
they're looking up to
4,000 megabytes per second,
read speeds up to 3,000
megabytes per second,
write speeds, so the speeds
are a bit of an improvement
over PCle Gen Three, especially
on the read sides of things.
But what else has ADATA
and also their sub brand,
the gaming brand, XPG, got on display?
Let's take a look after
I put this in my pocket.
(funky electronic music)
Here we are at the ADATA
booth at Computex 2019
with their sub branding, XPG.
They got a heap of new
products on display.
One of those which is very
interesting for a headset,
and the reason why is that
it's got two drivers inside,
one of those being electrostatic,
the other being dynamic.
The dynamic driver will deliver the bass,
the electrostatic will deliver the highs.
So people complain on
electrostatic headsets
that they don't have enough bass to it,
so this is going to alleviate that problem
and I have tried them and
they are very comfortable,
they sound very good.
They're gonna come in at $150,
and they are going to
call them the PreCog.
You can expect these
out in August sometime,
but they are still gonna make
a few final changes
before they release it.
For instance, maximizing the comfort,
also reducing the weight by changing
the metal sides to plastic,
things like that to
really improve the comfort
because I am enjoying the sound
coming out of these
things at Computex here.
They are a closed back headphones,
so they will block out a lot of noise,
and trust me when I say it is
very noisy here at Computex,
so if they're blocking out noise here,
they'll pretty much
block out noise anywhere.
So now, ADATA is making cases
and they're looking like
they're doing a very good job.
Now obviously, I can't test out whether
the airflow is really good until
I put it through its paces here
at Tech Yes City on the studio,
on the review desk by
putting a full build inside,
but it does look promising
with a detachable magnetic front
that also has a lot of clearance
for airflow to go in
through those front fans,
as well as having clearance up the top
and having that that tempered glass look
and new aesthetic and bling.
Now here's where things get a
lot better inside this case,
you've got four included ARGB fans,
so this seems to be a whole new trend
going through the industry
here at Computex 2019.
That's RGB that shines
brighter and uses less power.
Now, you do get the
controller included as well,
which you can change
on the top of the case
to any sort of style you want,
as well as hooking it
up to a five-volt out
on your motherboard, and
then you can change it
to addressable RGB if
that's what you wish to do.
Now, in terms of the top panel,
you've got your standard USB Three,
you've got a hybrid mic and audio out,
and a USB Type C, which is a
new addition coming into cases.
This thing features it all.
And coming in at the
end of August for $150.
Though, if $149 is out of your budget,
then next up here we've got something
that's stepping it down
with more budget in mind
but it's still containing
a lot of the features
from the previous case.
Though you do only get
two black fans included,
as the previous, you get four ARGB fans.
This is the Invader, with
four mil glass on the side.
Also, the previous
Battlecruiser does feature
that same four mil glass,
though you get ARGB lighting
underneath the case and you
still get the controller
included at the top,
but they are taking away
USB Type C and it does support up to ATX,
with opposed to the Battlecruiser,
which supports up to extended ATX,
but nonetheless, looking like
a really good case at $79,
especially if you wanna deck
it out with your own fans
and do some custom mods inside.
Power supply covers on both these cases
as well as this one having a
detachable hard drive cage,
which you can then customize things,
and you don't wanna go with
a modular power supply,
then you can tuck some power cables
where you're taking out
the hard drive case,
or if you just wanna go with SSDs.
And in terms of a release date,
you can expect the Invader
and the Battlecruiser
to come out around the end
of August, or so I'm told.
Now, ADATA aren't just getting into cases,
they're also getting into power supplies
with the OEM here being
Channel Well Technology
ranging with a 550-watt power supply
all the way up to an 850-watt gold-rated
with a full modular design,
so this thing does look pretty simple,
does look clean,
and also, the price is gonna
start from $90 to $130.
Next up here, we've got a new water cooler
that's coming at the end of August too,
this is the XPG Levante
with jewel 120-mil ARBG fans included,
and the block itself features ARGB too.
Now, the good thing is,
it's got two free installation spot
on both AMD and it also
includes support TR4
if you guys wanna raise the
bling up on an X399 build.
Now, to the left of that is something
that's still in early concept,
so there's no release
date and pricing yet,
but that is RGB24 pin
cable for your motherboard,
and underneath that you've
got the standard cables
that are hidden away from that RGB,
but also besides that,
this is an extension,
so you won't need to go
out and buy a whole new run
for a modular power supply, for example.
You can just grab this, and
even with ketchup and mustard,
you could have some RGB bling,
but still hide those
cables away at the back.
And the last of the products here at ADATA
are their recently released Spectrix S40G,
and also their Spectrix D60G DDR4 memory.
These feature ARGB LEDs on the outside
and also on the case of the SSD,
it is an MVME drive and it
does have LEDs on each side.
Now, I have got the thermal camera out
and these are running a little bit hot,
but that's because they are actively
transferring files and they're constantly
being stressed on these demos
here at the ADATA booth.
Now, besides that, the RAM itself goes up
to one point four vol 41,
33 megahertz XMP profiles,
and that's of course with
your Samsung Bidai stuff,
so they put in the good stuff inside,
they got the ARGB bling shining through.
But with that said, they
do want your feedback
in the comment section below.
Are you diggin' these new ARGB designs
on the coolers, on the
memory, on the SSDs,
or do you wanna see ADATA
go in a different direction,
as they love getting your
feedback in the comments below.
But with that aside, let us know what your
favorite product here on display was
at the ADATA XPG booth,
and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon.
But besides that, on your way out,
make sure if you haven't already,
hit that sub button, ring the bell,
to get these videos the moment they drop.
And I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now.
Bye.
