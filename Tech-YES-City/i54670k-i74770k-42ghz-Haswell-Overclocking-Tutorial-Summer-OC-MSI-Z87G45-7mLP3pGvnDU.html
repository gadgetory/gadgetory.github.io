Barone's coming back to you guys today
with the 4.2 gigahertz overclocking
tutorial for Haswell so this will be for
the i-5 for 670 K and also the i7 4770k
now Before we jump into it you're going
to need three programs and this is cpu-z
most likely 64 bits since most of you
guys are probably running 64-bit windows
prime95 this is a stress tester for
putting out heat and making sure your
computer stable and last one is real
town which is for monitoring
temperatures so yeah and you need these
three programs I'm going to put the
download link in the description below
you can download these three programs
also you may wish to check out before
you start the server blocking tutorial
managed to check out my RAM overflowing
tutorial and also my has well
optimization guide which will explain
why I'm doing a few of the things I'm
doing today but also another thing I'm
going to stress is seriously run your
computer in for three or four days
before you start overclocking and the
reason for this is to make sure the you
know if you make sure if you're
overclocking you don't have any faulty
hardware or any driver problems so when
you first start your computer and you
first install your hardware load up
optimized defaults have it running at
3.4 gigs and have everything on auto and
load up all your favorite games install
all your programs get your system setup
and make sure nothing's crashing
because once we do this it can eliminate
once we start overclocking it will
eliminate a lot of variables so if we
for instance if we just get our computer
straight away and we start overclocking
it could be because of faulty drivers
and we might think oh it might be
because of our overclock when it's
actually faulty drivers so the reason
you can just run all your auto run
everything on auto before you start over
con it's just to find out how stable
your computer is before you start over
calling so I recommend it it's crucial
for overclocking if especially if it's
your first overclock anyway now we're
into now we're in bass here so when you
start being a beauty just hit delete and
you get into the BIOS this is the msi
UEFI bios different biases will look
different so there's a Zeus will have a
different bias asrock will have a
different colored bars and gigabyte will
have a different style bars but they
will all have similar settings
in terms of overclocking so in MSI we
want to move over to overclock here and
it'll bring up a lot of different
settings which should be similar just
maybe different slightly different names
from other board manufacturer to
motherboard manufacturer now I'm going
to go through all the important settings
so the first setting here is a base
clock you don't need to change this this
is mainly for people who want to get
that extra bit of performance out more
advanced overclockers who really want to
wheeze out that last bit of performance
out of their cpu same with the clock
strap which is a new feature in the
house wall CPUs over the OB Bridge CPUs
and this basically let sets your RAM to
1.25 the default speed and also your CPU
at 1.25 if you were going to set that to
1.25 we don't have to worry about these
two today also the base clock applied
mode you want to set this to next boot
next boot that's what I find is the best
setting so you want to set your settings
in then let your computer start up off a
fresh boot running the overclock
settings now CPU PCL peep sorry PCI PLL
we don't have to worry about this
setting it's actually fine on auto scene
with filter PLL if you're going for more
advanced overclocks then you may wish to
change these especially this one to
Southbridge if you are I mean sorry LLC
PLL if you're overclocking from the
clock strap now the adjust CPU ratio
this is the first big one that we want
to change so now we want to set this up
to 4.2 because this is the overclock
that we're going to be going for today
now with a 4.2 gig overclock this is a
great overclock for the summer
especially when ambient temperatures are
like 40 you know can get up to 40
degrees or 35 degrees this is the kind
of the one that's not going to be
pushing out too much pressure on your
components so even if it was a really
hot day I'd say if it was 40 degrees you
may wish to tune it down even more maybe
three-point-eight or something because
you know heat is the biggest killer of
computer parts voltage as well but
voltage produces Heat
so that's um mainly that's something to
think about there now I've got it at 4.2
here and what you want to do is here you
want to set it to dynamic mode because
this is going to allow us to use the C 1
the C 1 C state which will down clock
our computer and debt and undervolt our
computer when it's not being straight
it's one of the great features I love
about the you know the Intel CPUs the
AMD CPUs have it as well I think it's a
brilliant feature it's one of the only
sea States that I use is the c1e so
that'll allow your computer just to you
know turbo down create less use less
power while it's doing it now this is a
new feature with has well is the ring
ratio so this is a it will probably be
called the cash ratio or could be called
something like the cash ratio or the on
call ratio it's basically just another
setting it's what their level 3 cache
the speed at what the cache that besides
the CPU is running at so you want to set
this at 100 megahertz below your CPU
ratio this is what I found is optimal
for gaming now now you've set those two
you can also go down to here load XMP
profiles and you should have at least
one profile which is 1600 speed memory
so here's my XMP which is at 1600 and
it's a 1.5 volt if you guys don't know
how to enable you don't know anything
about XMP profiles and you can check out
my rant over blogging tutorial which
will go up with the description below
for the both two links that I have for
those so I'll put them down below you
guys can check them out but for now I
found that XMP especially with Haswell
1600 speed memory is the best setting
for frame latency so I don't know why
this is exactly I do recommend ya
getting those getting that 1600
megahertz overclock on your RAM in there
with the tight timings so you will what
you will want to do that now memory
fastboot I'm not enabling any of these
features because I don't want my
computer to boot up ultra fast and skip
the boss digital power you don't have to
worry about that
also VC CIN voltage you shouldn't have
to worry about that the CPU core voltage
mode now this is the most important one
I want you guys to set this to adaptive
mode because it's a new feature with
Haswell and basically it's like the new
offset it will automatically adjust the
voltage for you based on what voltage
you've put in here and I found that it's
actually a really damn good feature
after using it so first of all we're
going to go start off with one
11.0 5-volt now if your if your cpu can
boot up at 4.2 gigs with one point zero
five volt then you have a pretty good
cpu also with adaptive mode I find that
even if you've under vaulted it it'll
give it that little bit extra voltage
which is really good you may wish to do
offset mode if you're old school but
today we're going to be using adaptive
mode on both the core and the ring bus
so now I'm going to set this at one
point I'm gonna set this four point zero
to five volts
below my core voltage because the fact
that it's clocked a hundred megahertz
below as well so it doesn't need as much
voltage I find it's generally about
point zero to five volt it may need a
little bit more maybe point zero three
may need a little bit less so that's up
to you guys to fine-tune so once you've
locked in these settings I want you to
try these settings first now if your
computer does not boot then you just
have to hit the clear CMOS button or
clear your BIOS and then start again so
if your computer did not boot then I
want you to go up to one point one and
add another point five on to this as
well point zero five sorry and once you
that should be those settings there so
they should be the settings that you try
if you fail to boot and keep going up in
that kind of keep keep on upping your
voltage in those kind of increments
until you find a stable level now I'm
going to go through all the other
settings here because they're important
to know these sa voltage you shouldn't
have to worry about that it's the system
agent voltage which is more for extreme
overclocking when you've got extreme
memory profiles in there and you're
going from really really extreme
overclock which you're not gonna have to
borrow that bother today with this the
input/output memory digital and analog
voltage we don't have to worry about
them the internal VR ovp OCP protections
over voltage protection over current
protection I would leave that on auto
this is the one that we should be
turning off here is the internal via our
efficiency management I want you guys to
disable this because I found that it
helps makes overclocks more stable it
also
lower the temps by one degree on average
what I that's what I found now the after
you don't have to worry about the PCH
1.05 or the PCH 1.5 unless you were just
running so many different fuels on your
computer which I don't think a lot of
you guys are so that's about it for now
guys that's literally we don't have to
worry about too many settings with
Haswell except for the ones that I've
showed you here now once we're ready to
overclock we can then just go to exit
sorry there's another setting that I
will turn off before I do this and that
is the Intel smart connect I always
disable this because I don't use it and
it's just something I don't need so
after that you just go to the X or save
configuration and reset and you can also
save the overclocking profile if you
wish to I mean my since it's not
finalized yet I'm I'm going to save it
once it's finalized so once the
overclocking profile is finalized I will
save it so now we boot up into Windows
hopefully it will boot home why not it
may not be so I don't know this is just
me go on for this overclock so we'll see
here booting up and yeah I like to give
it to you guys uncut this is how it is
this is always with my overclocking two
doors always do things uncut so first
thing we're going to do is load up CPU Z
see what voltage we're getting and I
mean yeah with with other I mean with
with the z77 platform I would recommend
going fixed first since Oh since offsets
pretty weird but with the house will I
find adaptive voltage is actually really
damn good and as we see here my voltage
even I set it at point zero five it's
actually gone all the way up to point
zero eight six so adaptive voltage is
saying look this is the optimal setting
for your CPU so once we now let's we do
that we can open prime95 and go in place
large FFTs maximum heat so we want to do
that we then want to open up real temp
you actually open up real temp first but
we can monitor our temperatures here and
we can see it's running about sixty
degrees ambience is about 25 I'd say
maybe twenty-six degrees in here at the
moon
it's pretty hot and yeah that's I mean
that's running stable guys so you can
leave that on for about 10 minutes and
then once you once you do that you can
just boot up games and start playing
games one of my favorite games for
stress testing your whole system is
heroes in new earth even though it's not
that demanding I found that it finds
unstable overclocked
really quickly like I'm serious this
game if you can play maybe two games of
this your system is really close to
stable so I do recommend here is a new
earth also I recommend a game called
Star Wars The Old Republic and
planetside 2 is also another one that
I've been hearing about itself so really
good for stressing stress testing CPUs
so once that's done you guys once you
know this is for me it's stable so I've
actually found out that my core likes
one point zero eight volts so I'm going
to then go back into BIOS and I'm going
to change this to one point zero eight
and that's my that's my optimum voltage
setting for my computer but if you guys
want loading up into the BIOS if you're
like Brian you've got a good chip that's
cheating then you may wish to go into
your overclock settings and simply go
back to the voltage and up that all the
way up to one point one and you know
some people are going to have chips that
aren't good at all and they may knit
they may have to give their computer one
point one five at four point two and
also one point two five so when I've
been doing a lot of my overclocking
tutorial bits I've been doing at about
one point two because I think that's
what everyone should be able to get
around at a four point two gig overclock
so my settings are usually like that so
yeah just keep upping the voltage until
you're stable in prime95
and then after that you may have to
start up games so even if it's prime95
stable for 10 20 minutes
I find that or even ten hours it you
know you can load up a game and it won't
be stable that's because you're getting
close to your optimum setting you're not
there yet but you're close to it so
that's about it guys i you know load up
the optimum settings
for me I found that adaptive voltage
found 1.18 was the optimum voltage
however I'm going to set that to 1.09 so
once you've found your optimum voltage
settings I just want you to then give it
just that little bit more so you saw
there is one point zero eight six so I'm
going to give it one point zero nine
just that little bit more and that
should be a stable really stable
overclock for me so once that's finished
I can go to overclocking profile this is
my first one here I'll go to save over
climbing profile and just set the name
for it for point two gigs summer so
that's my first over longer profile done
so once it gets a bit cooler I will show
you guys a four point six gig
overclocking tutorial for the winter
some CPUs may not be able to get to four
point six that just depends on your CPU
four point four should be doable on most
Haswell CPUs so another thing to
remember is I've deleted my CPU as well
so the temps will be lower and you may
wish to use liquid pearl something like
that on your CPU yeah guys if you have
any questions about this overclocking
tutorial then please let me know in the
comment section below if you haven't
ready subscribe to take care city where
I'll be coming back to you guys with
some really good tech videos from here
on it's going to be really good testing
so this is pretty much the last video
with house weld and I'm going to be
doing and as you can see here's the
first going to be getting my budget
builds out soon as well so anyway so
that's about it for now and yeah so as
we load up prime95 here we'll be able to
check set that let that stress test open
up CPU Z to see the voltage and open up
real time so we got one point one volt
there so it's just giving it a little
bit more and you can see here it's
pretty much all stable so it's really
good settings there and it should be all
stable that should be good for games
I'm not going to load up games obviously
it's going to take too much time to
stress test games on a video but that's
about it guys so I hope you enjoyed this
video and peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
