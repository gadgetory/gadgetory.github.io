solved this issue by calling up customer
support so why can't I solve this issue
from calling up customer support so
recently I bought battlefield 5 and I
was using it to test our differences
between a Zeon of rise in CPU and at 99
hundred K and during the final phase of
the testing because we tested it first
with an RT X 27 and then I was doing
some follow-up testing for another video
with a gtx 980ti and during that the
games would just not load anymore and I
was like this is really weird because I
also had battlefield 1 installed at the
same time and upon loading up
battlefield 5 and loading up battlefield
1 these games would just disappear and I
was like damn this is really weird
because it came off the back of testing
out games on Steam and also battlenet
which worked absolutely fine and so I
decided to contact customer support
because I started doing some research
and apparently there was a EA lockout on
Origin accounts where if you've used too
many different hardware configurations
you would essentially be locked out of
your account for 24 hours and then upon
contacting origins customer chat support
I was then greeted with a person who was
honestly the worst customer service
representative I've dealt with in my
life and from there it even gets worse
so what happened when we connected to
customer chat I knew exactly what I
needed to do coming into this whole
ordeal and what happened after this was
really weird because I was actually
capturing gameplay for the videos making
so it just had happened to be that I was
capturing this actual chat conversation
when we went into it and it just shows
how bad this customer service is when
you receive someone who a gives you
wrong directions on what to do and B
doesn't even listen to the customer I
straightaway went into this and I told
him look I'm benchmarking I'm changing
my hardware constantly and I think my
account has been locked out here's an
article on the exact same problem and
they've said to contact you guys the
customer support to help fix this and
what happened after this I just got
someone who's just so ignorant they were
telling me no you've got to try delete
your Documents folder and they pointed
me to literally the wrong folder I'm
sitting here scratching my head I'm like
okay there is no My Documents folder in
Windows 10 it's just documents and after
that I found the battlefield one in
battlefield 5 folders two folders
deleted them both and then they like
restart your PC so I was like okay look
whatever like I know this isn't the
problem that I did it because I was
hoping in turn that they would then try
and check my account and get it back
online
so I restarted my PC got disconnected
from the customer chat and then I went
back in and it was weird because at
first it was like chats not available
then it magically popped up again and so
I clicked on chat to another live
customer service representative and
after this I got someone apparently with
a different name but it was really weird
during this conversation they really
suggested something that was so
outlandish that made me believe it was
the previous customer service
representative they basically told me to
just reinstall my whole system without
even giving me like and this is the
thing if I was someone who is maybe new
to PC gaming or new to pcs I maybe might
take this advice and go do just that and
maybe lose some important files or
something like that it was such bad
advice
for when you're having a problem with
the video game and you've said that
other platforms and other video games
have worked and all you've done is
change some system memory in between
that one changeover and the person's
then giving me some other really bad
expire advice it was just some of the
worst advice they're saying all the
Registry's corrupt something's wrong on
your PC and I said no like I've been
doing this for years and years
troubleshooting some of the worst
problems on PC this is not my PC this is
your problem on your end and so he just
basically kept being ignorant to the
fact that there is no lockout there is
no this doesn't exist this problem and
he said the problems all on my end and
he basically I said can you please just
check on your end if there's some kind
of problem with my account and so he
says oh there is no problem and then
after that he says I'll please try
reinstalling everything so what we did
we just said okay well we'll try this
please hold the line and so we copied
the game to the NASS and then copied it
over to uses computer and we're doing
all this while we're telling him just
please wait and he said yep take your
time
and so while he's telling us to take our
time he just says to us oh you're afk
and then quickly disconnects the chat
again and I just facepalm so hard
because when we just finished about five
minutes later copying the game over and
then installing it on useless PC when we
logged in it gave us this proper error
message that said yep your PC has had
too many hardware configuration changes
we can't let you login and so on my PC
it would just simply try to load the
game and then just disappear and so when
this error message popped up we got it
on video and then we sort of just said
okay we've got enough content here to
make the first video so we ended up
shooting the first video and editing and
doing all that now we're coming back
here to the next day and the problem of
course still exists because it's 24 hour
lockout and so I decided to contact the
Australian division at EA and we
basically told them the problem and I
said look I've been you know the
articles there's numerous articles on
the internet that
says please contact your customer
support to get help and I'll give credit
to the last person on the line I did
record some conversation footage he was
pretty good he actually told me okay yes
this problem does exist with origin
accounts and the only thing we can do is
let you wait 24 hours and I'm thinking
to myself okay this is really bad
because I've paid for a game that I
can't use and I'm trying to do content
for my viewers who really appreciate and
love these videos and it just got to the
stage where it was so frustrating that
they couldn't do anything yet people on
the internet have reported that
something can be done so even though the
person was honest the third time which
was the phone call it just made me upset
that it was sort of like it was like
okay let's just get rid of this guy and
maybe move on to the next customer and
so I got really frustrated with that I
asked to speak maybe if there was
someone with more authority that could
unlock my account please do so but it
just got to that stage where I was like
no okay we'll just move on to a
completely new project and we just wait
for this 24 hour lockout to reset and so
now here we are with the conclusion of
EA's customer service support is just
absolutely horrendous like I've heard
stories of it in the past but this is
the first time I've actually had to deal
with it firsthand and it is just beyond
bad you've got guys on the live chat
giving you the worst advice possible on
how to fix your problems and not only
that they're not even telling you where
to properly go like the proper places
you can go and then the next advice
you're getting is to reinstall your
whole PC I've never ever heard someone
give someone that advice that's as if
someone's talking out of spite and it's
like this is your work you shouldn't try
to be spiteful what towards me because I
know exactly what my problem is and I
know how to go I want someone to know
how to fix it and I mean the buck
doesn't stop there either when I read up
some of the other problems people are
having where some people are testing for
instance hyper-threading versus
hyper-threading turned off if they do
that enough times it'll actually lock
their system
and it's not even to do with it physical
hardware change is to do with an actual
intended registry change in Windows on
just basically a hardware configuration
so if even if you have the same hardware
you can reset your computer five
different times and try to login to your
games and as long as those technically
that configuration is different then you
can get locked out of playing your own
games which you pay good money for and
this is the biggest crux of the whole
situation people are paying ridiculously
good money for these games you're
getting digital copies like back in the
day you have to sell a CD a manual a box
and then go through retail channels
nowadays you just got a key which is
being distributed online so there's even
more profit than there's ever been a
video games yet the customer service has
got to the worst it's ever been in
history
so origin if you're out there please fix
your customer service because in my case
I'm okay with PCs I've had a lot of
experience dealing with them before but
for people who are new to PC and want to
get into it and have some of these
issues and have some of these problems
it really just stacks up to me being yet
another story of EA and origin having
absolutely horrible customer support
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let us know in the
comments section below
have you had any problems with this
platform or any other platforms for that
metal love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon and also
yeah my account I think it's still
locked out I'm actually gonna check
right now because I want to get back to
making more content and it these over
now bye
castles are reaching for
I assure to you if you want to I can
send you a link where you can see that
all you have to do is just yeah you can
simply send me the link so man sherbet
dislike I mean last I mean you're you're
okay like you're honest thank you for
that but last night I talked to two
different guys on chat and they were
dishonest can it really really got to me
because there one guy told me to
reinstall my whole PC wipe everything
and reinstall battlefield when that
wasn't the problem
so I mean I don't know man like it's
just it's been one of the worst customer
service experiences I've ever had I mean
you've been pretty nice and been honest
and I appreciate that
but the other two people before that
basically told me I was an idiot so yes
I mean it's just it's one of those
things that's frustrating me because I'm
wasting time like I'm wasting time
that's what I'm doing right now it's
just a waste of time anyway yeah you can
send us the link you can send us the
link but I'm just telling you now and
I'm extremely disappointed and like it's
it's really frustrating so you know it's
yeah it's one of those things which is
really frustrating so anyway there's no
point wasting any more time I just want
to know when I first got the message or
when on there okay
