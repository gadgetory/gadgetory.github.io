tech yes Nass and this is not the rapper
Nass I every time I do something about
NASA's I always get one guy in the
comment who talks about the guy who used
to make that good rap so what could we
get that out of the way with but what
we'll go here is the TS four five three
BT three now another thing we're going
to get out of the way with is the price
tag it's a thousand dollars u.s. and if
you're in Australia just let me get my
water quickly here it's $1,500 now
you're probably gonna be on either two
sides of the camp you know what this
thing can do and you came here to see
the review or you like Brian that's too
much for an a so you can go and build
one yourself for much cheaper and yes I
could I could build some nass here with
a lot of the used parts I got lying
around but this one here is very special
because of the small form factor it can
fit four drives in it it's also got dual
Thunderbolt three connections it's also
got cross support for Linux Mac OS and
also Windows and so I'm probably getting
your attention already and also couple
that with the adding card that is
included with the BT 3 it doesn't just
have 10 gigabits per second Ethernet it
also has two slots for nvme SSDs so in
total you can essentially make this a
six bein ass that has support for raid 0
raid 1 raid 5 raid 6 RAID 10 raid 50
raid 60 and we start to see what this
thing can do so let's get on with the
review that kind of rhymed
welcome back to techie cities Brian
coming to you guys today with the ts4
5/3 bt 3 from Q nap now last year I took
a look at aq nap NASA and it wasn't
really my shindig it didn't have 10
gigabits per second Ethernet essentially
which is what I was looking for out of
an ass being a 4k video editor you can
sometimes stack up footage that goes
over a hundred gigabytes in total so you
need something that needs or has fast
file transfers and sometimes you need to
keep some of that footage because you
might be doing two videos when you need
to keep some of the previous footage so
having something like this that can do
tanky with so second for me was kind of
important but then I went to Computex
last year and I said to QNAP what I was
looking for in an ass and then they said
well we've got something that's perfect
it's gonna be exactly what you need for
a small studio small network and then
they sent this over and coming into it
you're gonna see that the price tag 999
dollars actually isn't bad for what
you're getting with this thing so yes
we've talked about the ten gigabit per
second connection on board which can be
routed to a 10 gig switch and then you
essentially have access across all
computers on the network providing they
have 10 gig of their own solutions can
access the data at any time and so with
that you can on this Nass have the
option to implement a nice kizi if you
want to but there's really no need with
kynapse
ecosystem and OS it's absolutely amazing
I was still managed to map drives all
across the computers on this network
into this thing and use them to install
Steam games for example and then other
people could access that same storage
pool and access the games - this is from
my raid 0 array which is 2 SSDs and
they're combined - corsair xti drives
originally i was going to put PCIe nvme
Zin but again it only supports side of
3m VMI's which isn't too much to worry
as those drives will still saturate that
Tang gigabits per second connection
quite well but another thing I needed
from this was also ease of use where
other people who aren't really computer
literate
here can again install the QNAP finder
software which is really good and then
they can essentially map the network
drive with ease on their own and they
won't have any problems so this thing
gave me that advantage because what I
wanted to do with this and why I needed
this so badly is because I want to save
time essentially you guys see the amount
of builds I'm doing around here on the
channel
whenever I'm still one of those new
builds and I put the games on I've got
to get those games and sometimes I got
to transfer them across USB 2 sometimes
those games need to be updated and it
just takes a lot of time with this now
especially with the raid 0 portion which
is a static volume I can then put the
games all on this device access and from
my main computer if I want to play games
in my free time or also when those new
builds come along I can have a
deployment kit along with that raid 0 in
the games and just quickly get things
set up without wasting any time and now
even if they don't have 10 gigabits most
computers will have a 1 gigabits per
second solution so I'll still be able to
get those games across and install them
relatively quickly with this box now the
other two bays that I've dedicated to
this drive so I've installed four drives
in total and I'm not going with any
classical RAID one I'm just going with
two different storage pools with a J
bond and that's for me and how I want to
use this thing because the thick and
thin volume structures that they allow
on the QNAP ecosystem allow you to add
drives in if you want to and have very
little downtime so if I want to install
an 8 bay drive in this studio in the
future I can then take these 2 drives
out put them in the a bay and then make
them double raid 1 or even make it a
raid 10 so it's up to me but it's not
really gonna be a problem as you guys
may have seen in the past
with the Intel rig that I had recently
going from the AMD system to that it was
just a massive hassle to get everything
reinstalled and some people in the
comments thank you guys you're like dude
you need an ass straight away you need
to hurry up and get an ass because with
these things you're not going to have
those problems future expandability is
not gonna be a problem at all and also
backing up your diner and even if
something blows out you're going to be
able to replace it with ease in this box
now speaking of the box itself the
hardware specs we've got a 12 centimeter
fan in the back very quiet
does a great job of cooling I didn't see
my drives get hot at all and this is in
a again Australia's ambient temperatures
are pretty hot though keep in mind what
it does get too hot I will turn my
aircon on because with drives I find in
the dead heat of summer if it goes close
to 40 degrees and you're transferring
files you can blow out hard drives I
have blown out one three terabyte hard
drive in the past so of course even
though this does do a decent job of
cooling you still always have to take
precautions in terms of how you treat
your gear but pulling off this right
here it comes off very easily if you
unlock it I actually have already busted
it because that's how you break your
kness when you're too savage Midway
reviews you can grab the bays and just
literally pull down on that knob and
then they come out and you can hot-swap
them if you need to so you've got that
option there to install the drive bays
with these they do have a screw this
installation on the 3.5 inch side of
things but on the 2.5 inch drives you
will have to use the included screws
again though it doesn't take any time at
all though if you do want to pull this
thing apart just keep in mind that you
may void your warranty so I've already
pulled this thing apart it actually took
a long time to disassemble I don't
recommend doing it but inside we had two
sticks of ddr4 memory so eight gigabytes
of ddr3 L in total you've also got that
full core J 3455 quad core comes at 1.5
gigahertz base across for cause they'll
can turbo up to 2.3 gigahertz if you
need it to so if you're doing encoding
which you can also dedicate to the GPU
side of things it's got HD graphics 500
so you can use that for life encoding or
transcoding if you wish to then it does
have that little bit of extra power now
the best thing about this package is as
a small lightweight package uses 10
watts from the wall when you've got it
switched on and even when I was
transferring files the most I saw come
out of this thing was 14 watts from the
wall and so that's another big reason
why I wanted something like this with a
very small footprint is because of its
low power consumption the noise is low
as well and it's also literally the size
of my hand very small form-factor
especially for fitting
two-six drives now with the package
itself you also get the HDMI cable to
rj45 cables and the AC adapter too and
on the back of the device it has the two
HDMI 1.4 B ports that support up to 4k
30 Hertz and with that on the actual
QNAP drive itself this is where things
start to get a little bit interesting it
doesn't just double down as an ass and
add a direct attached storage because it
does have the Thunderbolt 3 on the front
so you can get up to 40 gigabits per
second transfer across those devices not
only does it have that which will
support Mac Linux and also windows it
does have the whole app Center where you
can install things like plex media
server surveillance systems or VPN
software on this box so you can even
install karaoke if you want to and
Spotify so you can have this thing as a
music station as well so on the back
does have mic in Jack's and also a line
out now if you use the line out you will
cancel the voice activation system on
this device though of course you can get
it to better audio system because the
included speaker is really small and
tinnies but with those mic jacks as well
you can essentially use this not only
for karaoke but for an intercom too so
the possibilities of this thing start to
become like what can this thing do
initially when I got first got it in and
I was like thinking the price tag was a
little bit expensive but it soon became
a question of what can this thing not do
because literally everything that I want
from this it can do it and can do it
over the network as well you can even
hook it up directly to your computer
which is what I did for the 10 gigabits
per second test because I currently
don't have a 10 gigabit switch here so I
wanted to test the speed so I hooked it
up directly to my computer via a 10 gig
cat cable and also with this device - it
was so easy to set up as soon as you put
the drives in and open it up for the
first time you can log in via your
computer if you wish to or you can hook
something up directly to the NAS but
setting it up is so simple it's very
easy it gives you a step-by-step process
but as well as that it's so intricate
and detailed if you want to read out all
the drives the history of them the
temperatures also check their health you
can do that with the BT 3 but if you
guys want to know more about the actual
augmented benefits of the Q nap NASA's
then I'll put my previous review of the
Q nap NASA where I went and played video
games on it even and that'll explain
more because what I'm doing here today
with this NASA is detailing what it's
doing for me in my studio being an
actual story dedicated storage device
now they're moving on with this device
the only thing that I could think of
that someone might critique about it is
the fact that doesn't have wireless
built in but you wouldn't really want
your nice to have wireless built in
because most of times it is going in a
different spot to where you're gonna be
working and so you would maybe want to
hook this up to a switch and then get a
mesh wireless network happening so yeah
that's really kind of a mute point but
I'm guessing someone may be interested
in like oh does it have wireless onboard
too because nowadays it seems like in
2018 whenever I'm selling a computer or
something everyone's asking does it have
wireless so this thing here doesn't have
wireless built in but you for what its
intents and purposes I don't think you
would want it to have wireless it'd just
be a waste of time you know guys the
last thing before we move over to
conclusion with this thing was my
experience with this Nass the setting up
of this device was so easy it made me
feel like a pro because my networking
knowledge is very limited I mean I did
do the basics in the past but this thing
made me feel like a pro because it had
so many options and it just explained
everything along the way and setting it
up was hassle-free you can even update
the firmware to the latest firmware
it'll let you know if it needs a
firmware update you've got on the
desktop side of things the cue finder
Pro which will just map your drives on
your actual main systems with ease and I
had no slowdowns whatsoever there's no
dropouts the 10 gig connection worked
flawlessly and the one gig connection
worked really well when I was just
backing up data overnight just to test
everything out and so I've backed up all
my files from my main drive to this and
the important files again across two
different drives over the j-bot because
initially I wanted to put two nvme
drives
in this device but there were PCIe nvme
s and I realize it had the side a3
interface so that may be just one little
negative about this device but I ended
up using the four bays and again they're
hot swappable so easy to install things
I ended up putting to one terabyte SSDs
in and to 10 terabyte a wolf pros and
now with the data I ended up putting
these two and these separate storage
pools because of the fact that I wanted
to get as much space as possible and
only really double backup my most
important files but again when it comes
to an ass I'm a unique kettle of fish
I'm definitely doing things differently
than the norm where people would have a
raid one for example and then be
scheduling that to auto backup either
every day every week or every month me
I'm just Yolo I'll back up things when I
need to back up things are after I
complete a video or after I'm initially
dumping the footage on a SSD drive from
the memory card on the camera of course
the loading times and the wait times
when setting up a raise on an ass
solution does take a lot longer if
you're coming from Windows where I'm
used to just setting up hard drives and
clicking format and at taking two
seconds this thing will take a few
minutes to boot up and it will take a
few minutes to set up the arrays and
also just do things in general when it
comes to configuring things it's not as
snappy as your 8700 K or five gigahertz
do keep that in mind but that aside when
it came to setting up all the drives in
the array that I wanted it was just so
quick and keep in mind I'm not doing the
norm what I do with my footage it's not
a weekly or a monthly scheduled backup
kind of thing over raid 1 I want to
maximize the most storage out of my to
10 terabyte iron wolf pros I don't
actually want to raid one them because I
want more storage and a lot more of it
so they're very expensive drives so I
utilize it in a way where I can only
double backup the really important stuff
that I can't afford to lose or even
triple back it up with the raid zero if
I need to and if I need to in the future
have where a scheduled backup for
example then I can upgrade that with
this to a raid 1 also the file transfers
as well
that were really quick I had no problems
over the tang gigabits connection which
I directly connected to my computer -
and setting that up was so easy it even
told me it's late look you've got to get
this under the same subnet mask so it's
very noob friendly for someone who wants
to set up a new NASA and they want to
get the most they've got an idea of what
they want this thing will let you do it
so kudos to QNAP for making something
that's so simple yet so intricate that
even a dummy like myself when it comes
to networking can get things set up in
like literally less than a day and get
it set up we've copied all your files
across and having no dropouts having no
slowdowns yeah this thing can do it all
and I'm glad to say that even though
it's $1,000 us and 1500 AUD it does have
everything that I'd want from an ass but
it was in conclusion this thing is gonna
be that little workhorse that's in the
background you're not really gonna hear
of him again you're not really gonna see
him that much but he's gonna be pulling
his weight here around at Tech yes City
that's for sure don't worry about that
another thing as well it does have trim
support too I was able to trim my assess
these even while they're in raid zero so
I believe that even works better than
Windows 10 Pro it was amazing that it
had that feature as well as the iron
wolves in this device they were copying
over 200 megabytes per second
consistently over the 10 gig connections
all surprised at how quick those 10
terabyte drives were I was actually
shocked I was expecting them to be a bit
slower but they're pretty quick for what
they are you do get 10 terabytes of
storage with them so hmm
anyway I hope you enjoyed today's video
if you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below what you think of this
NASA if you guys want to see me build a
NASA with the parts I have lying around
here and then compare it against this I
will make that happen one thing though I
will want it to have a 10 gig solution
on board and I will want it to be small
and I will want it to be low-power so
I'll see what I can put together and see
how it compares to the ts4 5/3 BT 3
because this thing with dual funderbolt
it's able to be a
- say it would be an ass it's even able
to be like a directly connected Ethernet
box if you need it - and also coupled
with the host of all the other things
that can do man oh one more thing some
feedback for QNAP maybe just the build
itself it is all plastic and since it is
a very high-end unit for an ass I would
like to see it maybe have a bit of Steel
that would make it just perfect like for
the aesthetics and just for like I don't
know the feel of the unit just little
thing just those little things maybe I'm
just being too picky anyway I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now
bye no you're not getting him you're not
giving this away I am given this way
though so if you want a chance to enter
for a free mini ITX pc world wide posted
internationally links in the description
below 2400 G in this little package 16
gigabytes of RAM in and this is D
by took a long time to fall apart
actually and and the speeds were very
impressive keep in mind everything is
setting up reporting raid 0 raid 1 raid
10 raid 50 rate 60 raid 5 raid 6 and if
I could say so but ultimately excellent
unit and I'll catch you guys in another
tech unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
