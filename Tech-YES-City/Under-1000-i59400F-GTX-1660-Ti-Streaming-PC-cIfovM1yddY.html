brand-new PC and you want to get
performance price and a balance between
low power consumption all-in-one then
this build today is definitely going to
strike your interests I'm actually
building this for a streamer here in
Australia his name is Kay Anita and I
think he's predominantly a dota 2
streamer but he does play other games
but he needs something that can stream
at 60fps 1080p but also give him more
frame rates because he plays
competitively so I'm gonna be aiming to
give him 1080p 144 Hertz across a
variety of titles lows including
fortnight apex legends and of course
dota 2 which I also play competitively a
little bit even though I'm not as good
as popular players but I still like to
play a bit of storm spirit mid pull a
few snake moves and rock a bit of jazz
over my opponents and also to be
completely transparent all the stuff in
today's video is sponsored out by msi
nvidia and intel though with that aside
let's get on with this build welcome
back to tech yes City and we're gonna go
over some of these components quickly
because some of them are really good
value at the moment for instance in the
US the i-5 90 400 F which is six cores 6
threads boost up to four point one
gigahertz is currently going for a
hundred and 50 USD that is incredible
value for money if you want to get some
of the best frame rates in games but
also still have money in your pocket
after you're done building a machine
we've also got the NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti
from MSI this is the gaming X model so
you do get an extra 45 mega Hertz boost
over there baseline models you also get
the RGB bling and a
cooller design does come in with a
little bit of a premium though so we'll
set you back 310 USD if you're in
Australia 469 AUD and then for the
mother while we're going with a bee 360
gaming Pro carbon this is a balance
between price performance and aesthetics
it's got that nice dry carbon fibre look
going on as well as addressable RGB
control on the board which is going to
be important since we are using MSI's
own gummy a case this has got RGB
control comes included with RGB bling at
the front and also with an addressable
fan at the rear of the case as well as
including three basic fans inside but
we're also gonna be adding some fantex
collaborated with MSI RGB strips inside
so we've got two of those and then for
storage we're going with a Western
Digital black nvme 250 gigabyte SSD
great price performance in Australia
pick these up for a hundred Aussie
dollars in the u.s. 62 USD and now for
backup storage we're going with a 250
gigabyte Western Digital hutch I'm just
joking we're going with the 2 terabyte
hard drive for all those games that you
don't play that often or movies and
music that you want to backup you'll
have that storage there and then for the
ddr4 memo scre that is Russian for
memory we have the Kingston HyperX 16
gigabyte kit here with - a gigabyte CL
13 - 6 66 megahertz memory great balance
since this board does max out with the
CPU combination at these speeds and for
powering this build we're going with the
cooler master 650 watt MWe 80 plus gold
PSU or as I like to call it sue first
thing for you cooler we're going with a
bit of bling but also saving a bit of
money here the cooler master i-71 C
which has it all for the 90 400 F since
the CPU does pull under 40 watts on max
load making this combination a great
little choice at 15 USD with that aside
here's the build total for you guys in
USD and AUD let's get this build
underway and then in stole some games
and run some tests
you
since I am passing this build on to a
fellow dota 2 player it just wouldn't
feel right if I gave it to him in its
current form so we're gonna fix that
with some tech yes lovin
we just finished streaming on this PC
here for Canada he is going to be over
the moon because the results are really
good so these results I am presenting to
you guys aren't just benchmarking the PC
normally this was while I was streaming
to my not so many twitch followers I
don't really stream at all over at
twitch but I wanted to test it out and
we'll live streaming at 60fps 1080p at
6000 kilobits per second so basically 6
megabits per second stream and the
results were impressive that was zero
dropped frames the whole time so I
streamed for about two hours and in that
time we got apex legends benchmarked we
also got dota2 benchmarked and fortnight
just had a corrupt file for some reason
it had some problems installing there
must have been a problem copying it over
from an ass but we then decided to
benchmark csgo csgo max settings was
getting overclocked 203 average FPS 123
once at lowes 82.1% lows again over that
magic number of 144 Hertz if Canada
wants to be competitive then this is
going to deliver even while is on stream
even when it's not overclocked so if you
don't want to overclock the graphics
card and just keep things quiet like
they are now then you're gonna get a 180
average FPS and still really good one
10.1% lows moving over to Apex legends
here's where I decided to drop the
settings a little bit because I knew the
1660 T ie
is not going to get max settings 144 FPS
but it's capable of getting really
smooth frames if you tweak the settings
and so what I did here was I had a blend
of medium and high and the stream still
looked really good we've got great FPS
with not overclocked GPU figures coming
in at 118 with great 1% in 0.1 percent
lows and then overclocking the GPU went
over a hundred and 25 FPS with again
really solid 17.1% Llosa so this is some
great frame rates just like csgo that is
gonna play apex legends with really good
frame rates on a 144 Hertz monitor while
are you streaming now the last title
dota 2 i decided to max everything out
here because is it pretty easy to run
title but
this Canada's main titled and he's
probably gonna want to play this with
max details and have some fun and since
it is upgrading his PC I'm happy to
report we're getting 135 FPS with 1% in
point one percent loads of absolutely
fine and then overclocking it got really
close to that 144 Hertz figure getting a
hundred and forty to average FPS and the
thing is with 144 Hertz monitors I hear
a lot of people out there like to just
drop the max frame limit down to 141
just two or three fps below the monitors
max limit and that gives these smoothest
experience but regardless we have here a
PC that can play games really smooth
with really good FPS while you're
streaming but also not use a whole lot
of power and the numbers we got when the
CPU and GPU were stressed in the game
was just over 200 watts and then the
extra wattage added on top when we
overclock the GPU was only 12 to 13
what's really impressive figures
considering its going to stay quiet it's
gonna stay cool and the most I got out
in terms of heat out of this thing was
lukewarm air when I put my hand behind
the case when we're playing some games
for quite a while and honestly in
closing I'm just blown away by this
whole build in general everything from
the price performance to the actual
looks of the build itself has come in
really good I mean the gungnae 100 for
its price so you get 4 fans included
tempered glass and the build quality was
really solid and in the i5 9400 after
that things using like around 40 to 45
watts power while you're gaming but
still giving you really high clock
speeds across six cause so that's
impressive and then the 16 60 Ti is
actually in my opinion the most powerful
card out of the whole GTX and r-tx
lineup because it doesn't have the RT X
features but it cuts down the die size
and with that they're using GDD are six
memory as opposed to the GTX 1650 and
the 1660 so it is in my opinion the most
efficient out of the bunch and you get
that latest Nvidia encoder
which for streaming increases the
quality and as we saw in these
benchmarks really gives out a good
experience so there it is with this bill
we've got the price on point we've got
the looks on point
and we've got the performance this combo
is definitely one to look out for in
2019 I'm sure Kay Anita the fellow
Aussie dota 2 twitch streamer is going
to be very impressed with this build and
guys with that said I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button and also let us
know what you think of the exposed RGB
LED strips do you think they should be
hidden or do you like them as they are
I'm going for a different look
I'm kind of digging what this case is
about and it allows you to see those LED
strips Plus that cooler matches up with
the color sync that I manually can
change with the controller included with
that budget cooler so everything came
together worked out but also if you are
interested in building something like
this then I will leave all the relevant
links in the description below for you
guys I do believe that there is some
kind of promotion going on with the B
360 pro gaming carbon and the 90 400 F
in that if you buy this combination you
can actually get a free 250 kg byte
Western Digital nvme Drive Black Edition
included and the good news too is if
you've stayed this long in the video
