secondhand workstations I recently built
which just came under five hundred
dollars for the both of them
however today were mainly going to be
focusing on this one though which is the
X 5650 which is a six for twelve
threaded Beast which came out to be the
most expensive of the two though it
certainly does perform well for the
money
and I've also benchmarked it against the
5820k and the 1231 v3 with the GTX 970
so let's take a look at this
welcome back to tech yestiny this is
Brian and today I'm going to talk to you
guys about the two workstations I
recently built for under $500 however
today I will be putting the main focus
on this as the other one which came just
over $100 isn't too important and it's
not really worth talking about though
that is one important thing with that
rig and I'll talk about it more at the
end of the video though let's focus on
this rig here and we'll tally up the
total costs so for this rig it came in
at about 380 dollars though one thing to
note is that I did get the ddr3 memory
for free kind of borrowing it from work
on the pretense that I have to use this
at work also the SSD was a review sample
so if you had to tell you those two
parts into the whole total I'd say it
would come around just under $500 and
though for the performance in the bang
for buck it is certainly worth it with
this thing performing pretty much better
than the four core has well overclocked
and then seriously putting out some
serious figures when it came to gaming
as well with the GTX 970 so now let's
get onto some benchmarks which I'm sure
you guys are dying to see and this was
clocked at 4 gigs with 12 gigabytes of
ddr3 memory at 1600 megahertz I'll put
the exact specs in the description below
for you guys of all three rigs but
anyway let's get on with some benchmarks
you
so now time for the conclusion and I'll
talk about a few other things here but
let's do it clean-cut and simple and
first of all if you already have an x58
motherboard and an i7 920 then upgrading
to the fx50 650 is a complete no-brainer
in my opinion you see that you're
getting over 50 percent more out of your
CPU in productivity also since it's a
drop down from 45 nanometer to 32
nanometer you're also going to get
better performance in games so Wow
I mean considering you get it from
anywhere from 60 to 100 dollars this CPU
is absolutely phenomenal value for money
and I think the best person who would
take advantage of this CPU would be that
person who has already got an x58
motherboard that supports the X 5650 so
if you if you want to know if your
motherboard supports the CPU I'll put a
list in the description below where you
can check out the compatibility which
boards are compatible with the X 5650 so
let's get on to the next segment now and
that is the beginner or the person
buying their first rig and I'm going to
say this is the part or this is the
group that I wouldn't recommend the
second hand rig to mainly because of you
running a lot of risks more so than
buying brand new the first reason is
you're running is that when you buy used
generally you're not going to get a
refund I mean especially where I am
there's just options going up with plain
and simple writing no claim no return
and as in the case of the other rig and
I'll quickly talk about that read the W
35 20 and the X 58 t power that
motherboard had four dims which just
didn't work it registered in the BIOS
but it just wouldn't register the RAM in
Windows and so I don't know if that's a
compatibility problem with the biostar
motherboard I don't know if it's a
faulty motherboard and I just simply
don't have time to diagnose that on a
50-dollar motherboard nor can I get my
money back
so that's the risks you run when you buy
used thankfully this rig worked out all
ok and it's fantastic value for money
though if it's the your first rig and
that's your only rig you're going to
have the trouble of overclocking in
because overclocking on this thing is a
lot more difficult than your simple
Haswell 4 core where you only bumping up
the voltage and multiply it pretty much
on this there's a lot of other variables
that you have to look out for and you
have to know what tests to do in order
to see if it's stable
so it's actually in that that being said
it's a lot of fun and I'll talk about
that in the next group of people but if
it's your first PC and you can't risk
not having a working PC then I'd simply
not recommend the used workstation or
the used parts for that kind of group
now let's get on to the last group of
people and that is the person with a bit
of experience overclocking and building
pcs
and someone who's already got a rig as
their main rig and they're looking to
build a cheap second PC whether it be
for workstation purposes or for gaming
purposes and this is the group where I
can recommend this PC to as well
keep in mind though that the x58
motherboards whether they're used or new
that support the ex 5650 are currently
in my opinion pretty overpriced I mean I
was lucky to pick one up on an auction
that sort of wasn't on those
compatibility lists and I got lucky but
usually they can go anywhere from 150 to
200 US dollars which is quite a lot for
an x58 motherboard considering a lot of
them don't have side a3 or USB 3 onboard
and so you know they don't have support
for more than 24 gigs of ram I think you
kind of already behind the eight ball
when you compare it to something like
the b85 pro gamer that I just recently
reviewed and you coupled that with one
of these and you got yourself one sweet
spot in my opinion though one thing to
keep in mind with is that this although
was a lot of fun and although was a
beast in productivity the power
consumption man it was huge
like it was literally huge this thing in
Crysis 3 with the GTX 970 went over 700
watt also on the combined test and 3d
fire strike it hit 700 watt as well
while my jaw was dropping literally I
was like watching this inlay well then
that's huge considering I was on a gold
rated power supply with so was pushing
the end of max 630 what powers play over
its limit so I was kind of really
surprised this was only at four gigs as
well now I also tried to overclock it a
bit more and it just wouldn't go any
higher so that was another limit of this
motherboard the motherboard would go up
to around about 206 megahertz and then
it just wouldn't post after that at 205
megahertz I did manage to get it 4.1
gigs I think I managed to get around
nine hundred and sixty seven points in
Cinebench
though it wasn't stable and it
continually crashed at these speeds so I
had to drop it down to four gigs for the
benchmarking and to be honest the power
consumption of four gigs yeah was huge
so honestly if you want it to go all out
with the x58 line you better you might
want to go with like a rampage three and
then maybe get a cpu with a higher
multiplier at the x50 675 because I
tried to use the turbo mode on this
motherboard and it just wouldn't go any
higher then like it did go higher but
that was on two cores it went up to like
four point six gigs and then even with
those turbo settings enabled I'll do a
stress test on all caused and I just go
back down to four gigs anyway not to
mention it was unstable in these
settings with the turbo mode enabled as
opposed to not having it enabled so all
in all it was a great experience this is
going to be a fantastic workstation
especially since it beats out the 1231
v3 which is a kind of I think nor a fair
comparison the one thing I failed to
mention as well is when you're buying
these use parts you can remember this is
a four year old motherboard who knows
how much life this motherboard has left
in it I don't know as for the X 56 50s a
lot of them will be being pulled out of
servers whether it been babied their
whole lives so you generally don't have
to worry a lot with the xeon cpus it's
just the motherboards i mean if you can
pick up a new x58 motherboard that'd be
pretty cool especially one with solder
three and USB 3 that'd be an interesting
combo as the solder to was limiting the
SSD schools especially when I ran a SSD
benchmark through it so anyway I hope
that answers all your questions about
these used guides I'm probably going to
be selling a few of the parts I mean I
did get some excess parts as well so all
this came under three five hundred
dollars this one came up to about $380
and I managed to get a GTX 285 and a i7
920 out of it as well sort of I can try
and sell them and recoup some cost the
other rig costs around about a hundred
and ten dollars and I'm pretty much
going to sell that because I mean I mean
I will stay tuned the option that
doesn't work properly so hopefully I can
get a hundred dollars back and someone
can have fun with it but it does still
work it just doesn't work as well as
something that would be fully functional
in my opinion I mean technically you
could get it up to four gigs of red
gigabytes of RAM in
and maybe it still works but anyway the
other parts in there really good except
the motherboard so that's about it guys
I hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and if you
have any questions or comments about
this video or anything about these parts
used in this build
then please drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can I look forward
to giving you guys another tech video
very shortly peace out for now bye
sorry and one more thing before we go I
pulled up some old benchmarks of the FX
8320 or 4.4 gigs and that scored in
Skyrim 109 frames per second and ARMA 3
I think was 46 frames per second and
this looks to me like AMD is getting an
unfair disadvantage in the compiling
side of things especially when you
compare the CPU to the FX
5650 which was scoring like 140 in
Skyrim and over 60 and out of three like
surely Andy can't be that far behind it
wasn't like it was looking to me like
you know AMD was purposely getting
gimped from the compiling side of things
so I would like to hear your comments
and thoughts in the comment section
below about that as well because I feel
sorry for AMD in ways it's kind of you
know sad to see them getting GIMP that
much possibly I don't know I'm shorts
I'm sure the architecture isn't just
that far behind right so anyway let me
know your thoughts about that and I'd
love to hear your comments and thoughts
on that too
anyway I'm done talking so hit that
subscribe button for some more juicy
tech news and reviews bye
you guys are interested in making a
multi petition USB pendrive then let's
continue on so we're on our desktop here
and now there are three programs you
will want to get straightaway two
programs sorry that the first one being
you me and now there are other programs
you can use but I prefer you me it's
just so easy so like a few clicks and
you'll might be able to make that good
