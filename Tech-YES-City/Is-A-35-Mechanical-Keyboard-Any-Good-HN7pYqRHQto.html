keyboards that didn't crack $50 I
reached out to a company that I already
had experience with vilasa fire and
asked them if they had anything on hand
when they said they had the new VM o1
keyboard that had teal backlighting
interesting and brown mechanical
switches for $35 I almost lost myself
let's take a look at this little bad
bland also their accompanying Mouse the
v9 to see if these gadgets are indeed
worth the $35 asking price
what was the tech city this is Brian
coming to you guys today with a budget
entry-level keyboard and mouse review
though the word budget sticks to mind
the keyboard which will focus on first
features a mechanical Brown switch from
a company called Zorro which i've never
heard of though the switches did feel
consistent even though the feedback
wasn't as pronounced as I would like
especially compared to that of a Cherry
MX brown it did feel a little softer
however it was very comfortable type on
especially for long sessions and with
that let's have a quick listen to what
this keyboard sounds like the keyboard
itself has a unique capital font on a
matte black coating across both the caps
and the keyboard itself the logo is
featured above the arrow keys and
features that fireball that's kind of
indicative of another tack channel and
with this particular model you'll have
six different styles of backlighting lip
breathing scaling down with or without
holding and scaling up with or without
holding you can disable the Windows key
from the keyboard itself by pressing the
function Windows key looking at the
weight of the keyboard it feels solid
since they have used the metal back
plating with the VMO one weighting it at
almost 1.2 kilograms the cable is 1.6
meters long and there are no clips to
adjust the height which if it was only
one thing to critique about this
keyboard it would be just that I'd like
to see the clips there so you could
adjust the height of this keyboard there
is no wrist rest or key cap puller
included and the boxing was minimalist
though this price I really can't expect
any of the aforementioned to be included
so for 35 bucks it's a solid little
option that I can recommend to anyone
who is on a budget but still wants
something consistent to type and game on
now under the v9 Mouse getting straight
into business here this is a palm grip
style Mouse that weighs in at 104 grams
without the weight it has three
adjustable weights that interestingly
enough can be screwed into the mouse
itself very easily and quickly to add an
additional 12 grams in total or roughly
4 grams each very awesome way to add
weights might add onto the bottom of the
mouse there are also six teflon feet
which made this Mouse glide very well on
my razor goliath control edition mouse
mat the Vino itself features the Abagail
9800 sensor and has on run switches on
the four buttons of the mouse which all
have a solid click to them there is also
an on-the-fly dpi button and a red LED
light to indicate what level of DPI
movement you
on stock settings use 800 1630 280 200
increments though you can download the
software and make your own adjustments
to the four levels if you like you can
also change the polling rate from 125
Hertz all the way up to a thousand Hertz
in the software the main LED light can
also be changed to an array of different
colors so to pick and choose which you'd
like to match your setup the surface of
the mouse is matte dark gray and the
mouse has a cable that extends to 1.8
meters long which is also braided the
software allows you to program the
buttons on the mouse for a total of
eight different configurations with the
buttons in the scroll wheel the scroll
wheel is awesome stiff and not too hard
to move you can reliably use the press
as a button without having to worry
about scrolling up or down whilst
pressing the software allows you to
program the macros as well but what
about the input lag testing this against
my Razer Taipan I found them to be
virtually identical in terms of input
lag which is great for vilasa fire since
this mouse also has 128 kilobytes of
onboard memory - all the specs are great
on paper how well does this mouse
perform in games when I loaded up
counter-strike csgo of 4k just to test
for any skipping or erratic movement I
was happy to report that there was none
this mouse was very smooth and playing
games like csgo
I found that this mouse was just great
if you're a palm grip enthusiast I found
myself fragging with these having a
great time and also not noticing any
noticeable input lag or stuttering so
there we have a two products that come
in at entry-level pricing and offer
extremely good value for money the mouse
was impressive having all the features
that I'd want from a palm grip Mouse yet
coming in at 35 dollars the keyboard was
pretty awesome for 35 bucks - featuring
mechanical browns and although heavy and
looking a little bit budget it is great
for someone who doesn't want to spend
lots of money on a keyboard but still
wants the comfort the mechanical
switches have to offer there we are hope
you enjoyed this review today if you did
hit that like button if you have any
questions about the mouse or keyboard
featured here today then be sure to drop
a comment in comment section below I'll
get back to you as soon as I can also
let me know in the comment section below
what kind of mouse grip do you use at
the moment the lot of your comments as
always and I'll catch in the next tag
video very soon he's out for now bye
so here's the final test is it cowboy
