don't want to spend much money can you
get a good one for under $30 well here
on the table we've got two mechanical
type feel keyboards and these come under
$20 in the case of this one here you
even get a mouse for 14 US dollars so
that's ridiculously cheap and then the
last two here we've got come right on
the $30 mark but they offer real
mechanical switches now over two years
ago I did do a video looking at a few
keyboards off Aliexpress and to my
surprise I was really blown away by the
value for money you were getting fast
forward to now however and the brands
that I picked in that video have either
since raised their prices or they're
just simply not for sale so I've got
2019 what looks like top picks but we're
still going to unbox these keyboards
look at the features look at the quality
and more importantly play some games and
type on them to see if they are indeed
any good
now who also got a budget mem Kanaka
which is similar to these two on the
table here from Coolermaster so we're
gonna see how this stacks up against
these two keyboards right here
well that aside let the unboxing and
durability tests begin
so the first keyboard now was the GTX
300 and I've got to warn you guys I
would stay well away from this keyboard
and mouse combo both of these sets are
just complete and utter garbage I mean
the build quality on the keyboard is so
cheap to the point where it's the
lightest keyboard I've had come through
here for a full-size keyboard it comes
in at just over 400 grams but not only
that it's like literally like the base
of the keyboard is warped before it's
even got here so when I put the feet up
it's got shake in it not only that when
I'm typing on it that it make my hands
are bouncing up and down off the
keyboard like a springboard and then
moving on to the mouse the sensor is
absolute garbage and not only that the
cable is so short that it won't even run
that far so I've got an invisible Mouse
bungee that's not working that well but
also the rainbow light so literally just
like five LEDs at the bottom of the
keyboard plus an LED at the top so it's
really nothing special I mean it just
looks so tacky
it feels tacky but despite all that the
actual keys themselves are not bad that
type on like typing on this thing was
actually decent I could get over a
hundred words per minute consistently on
it and the mouse switches themselves the
actual switches they've used feel quite
good and the scroll wheel is not half
bad as well as the middle click on it
isn't too bad either so the build
quality let's this down big-time like
I've got a retailer locally that does a
cheaper mice and keyboard combos that I
would much rather any day of the week so
everything besides the actual switches
they've used on this keyboard and mouse
combo is complete garbage and another
thing is - this mouse weighs in at 58
grams Wow we've got an air 58 competitor
here for final Mouse except everything's
just complete rubbish
so then it's keyboard we've got up
here's the K 28 and this although it's
double the price of the previous
keyboard we looked at it's literally a
night and day difference where this one
is actually decent build quality it
comes just under 700 grams and it's got
real mechanical blue switches now I
don't know the name of the switches
they're using there's actually no
tagging on it so usually you get like
cheerio max or kales but this is a brand
I've never heard of but typing on it was
really good consistently over a hundred
words per minute the keyboard itself was
a little bit elevated does have the
option to elevator to the back in this
case it since it is a little bit
elevated at the front here I do
recommend getting a budget wrist rest in
combination with it but other than that
very solid build quality of the keys
themselves don't have hardly any flex in
them at all so they're pretty rigid on
top of that you can also change the back
lighting effects however keep in mind it
is only a layer of white orange green
red blue and purple so it's not really
RGB it's just they've used different
lines of different colors to sort of
make it sound like it's RGB but other
than that very good for 30 bucks if
you're looking for a mechanical keyboard
now I just finished up on the one up and
besides this quirky text down here which
I don't even know what they're trying to
say the keyboard itself is absolutely
phenomenal you've got an aluminium
backplate
you've got key caps that feel very solid
very rigid there's like no flex at all
and typing on them is very consistent
the RGB backlighting also looks not too
tacky it does glow through very well and
it's not too in-your-face so at night
time it is going to allow you to see the
keys very easily the cable itself is
over a meter and a half long very good
you've got two levels of height
adjustment just flat and then raise it
about ten mil and it weighs in just
under 900 grams and it is a full sized
keyboard too so you do get the numpad
and the keys are spaced out very well so
even if you've got big hands this is
definitely going to accommodate that too
and they're using a switch called a jig
jjang I'll put the text up on the screen
I don't know how to pronounce a bit the
good thing is you can replace these
switches if they become faulty in time
and they do give you three keys included
as well as a key cap puller which works
absolutely fine so I'm really impressed
with this keyboard especially for 30
bucks it definitely feels like it's
punching well above its weight of course
the only drawback is you don't get
dedicated media keys but again at 30
dollars shipped to your door this thing
is definitely packing a punch harder
than the two previous keyboards and in
fact I don't know how the next keyboards
gonna go or even the Coolermaster after
it because this one's impressed me that
much already
and last up here we've got the K 40
which did say it had a mechanical feel
but that is complete lies I mean this
thing is a pure membrane through and
through and it kind of feels like those
1990s membranes very mushy style click
but other than that the build quality is
pretty good this keyboard does look
quite neat with the sort of black and
white contrast going on here and another
benefit of these keys is that they are
extremely quiet so if you need to keep
noise down at night or you need to keep
noise down in the office then this
keyboard is actually not a bad option
for the money but with that in mind I
was making the most typos by far with
this keyboard verse the other three
keyboards that I did test here in the
studio and on top of that the feedback
of the keys didn't feel good at all but
that's a personal preference thing I
mean the other three keyboards here did
feel a lot better to type on but let's
move over now to the Coolermaster a
combo which does cost a lot more than
all four of these combinations here and
I'll quickly test that out and then we
can come back with the conclusion to see
what the winners and losers are of this
comparison
and now we're back at the table and I've
put these keyboards in order of my
experience just typing on them and using
them in games starting with the best up
the top this is the one up I was blown
away by the actual build quality the
typing experience and the rigidity of
the mechanical keys they're using really
great job they've done on this and I
think this one's coming in now at about
35 US dollars which honestly guys if you
want a cheaper mechanical keyboard
you're probably not going to get it any
better than this especially if you want
a full-sized 104 style keyboard this one
really blew me away the only thing I
could critique about it would be the
fact that there's no media keys in the
top right hand corner but again for the
price this thing is hitting so hard for
the money and just below that is the $30
option this is the same sort of RGB
effect or the fake rainbow effect and
typing on this was a similar experience
to the one up except this one was a bit
lighter it didn't feel like it had as
good build quality the rigidity of the
keys on this one for example were just
the best out of all five keyboards here
the key caps of use have a rough texture
to them they've got a little slight
curvature and they really fit your
fingers well and nothing's wobbling
around when you're typing so really good
job on the one up and then this one here
just has a slight bit of very slight
tinge of wobble it's very very subtle
and the key caps that they've used don't
feel as good as the one up though the K
28 since it is lighter and is a 10
keyless model I could recommend this for
someone who's traveling and still wants
a good keyboard on the go but wants to
keep the weight in their suitcase down
now coming in third place is the cooler
master ms one-to-one this is a mem
Kanaka switch but don't get me wrong I
don't think this is that good value for
money at all I think if you're going to
spend this kind of money on this
keyboard I'd much rather recommend you a
1-up plus like a Logitech G 102 which
could be had for around the same money
you'll be getting a much better typing
experience much better Mouse as well
since the included mouse with the
one-to-one it didn't feel that good it
had a very sort of
texture service here which on my
mousepad the Corsair cloth mat it wasn't
moving around that well at all
the mem canticle switches does leave a
little bit to be desired especially if
you're typing day in day out and you
need something consistent I did make
quite a few typos on this keyboard as
well as number four here this is the
motto speed aka the K forty now I did
like the build quality of this and I did
like the white and black aesthetic and
if you need to keep noise down this will
be a decent option but just like the MS
one-to-one the typing experience wasn't
that good and I was making quite a few
typos they do have a rough texture to
them and the rigidity of the keys
themselves was pretty good and then in
last place we have the most flimsiest
keyboard I've seen in my life seriously
I almost thought this thing was like one
of those rollover keyboards like that
you roll down on a mat the nice squishy
ones it was almost that bad it's got a
very light weight to it but besides all
the bad points I found typing on this
thing was actually not too bad it has a
very thin and short cable length coming
in and out of about a meter as opposed
to the others which were all one point
five meter and all had thicker cables
and in the case of number two that had a
braided cable but typing on this thing
surprisingly wasn't too bad I'd actually
prefer to type on these switches that
they've implemented here over there to
above them so they do say this is a mem
Kanaka Laswell but it doesn't feel like
a mechanical switch as opposed to the
one to one kind of feels like it's
somewhere half way in between so typing
on this was decent but everything else
the build quality the implementation of
the LEDs and then couple with the fact
that it's like a spring board and the
included Mouse is absolutely horrible
that you could not reliably use this
thing the sensor that they've
implemented is so bad I wouldn't spend
my money on this I'd much rather go down
in my local supermarket and grab their
$10 banger mouse and keyboard combos so
in conclusion guys Aliexpress keyboards
they can be pretty good though you do
have to sift through the good and the
bad which is kind of what I've done here
today for you guys and the clear winner
is this one up despite the quirky text
in the bottom right hand corner it's a
very solid keyboard
build quality is good typing on it's
good it's very consistent and they even
include spare switches so if you do have
an issue with one of the switches in the
future you can just simply change it out
and replace it so it does have the
longevity factor as well couple with the
best thing of all is the price tag and
you are going to get a real mechanical
switch so props to the one up it also
said on the box it's a k-8 so I'm
guessing there's two different
manufacturers that make the same
keyboard but regardless if you guys are
keen to check out this keyboard or any
of the other keyboards are featured in
today's video then I'll put the links in
the description below but this one
