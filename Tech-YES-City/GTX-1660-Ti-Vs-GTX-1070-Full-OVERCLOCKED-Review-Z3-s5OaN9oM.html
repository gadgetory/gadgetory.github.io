called the 1660 TI and it's not
featuring any ray tracing or tensor
cause and so with that it does have a
cut-down die size of 293 millimeters
squared which is a big drop from the RT
X 2060s and this card is on 12 nanometer
as well just like the RT experience so
it does have those truing cores on board
which does have better IPC than the
previous GTX 10 series cards so today
we've got six gravis cards in this
equation for which I've sort of pointed
out and singled out here because we are
we talking about them in the conclusion
and I know you guys came here you
clicked on here for the benchmarks and
the real scoop no you guys came here for
that real scoop you know not a little
scoop you know if you've got like a tub
of ice cream and you've got the spoon
out and you just scoop in and you get a
little bit out you like now eat that
quickly you go in for a real scoop
that's what you're gonna get at tech yes
City here today yeah a real scoop so
let's roll the intro and roll those
benchmarks for you guys
so there's the gaming benchmarks done
with the GTX 1660 TI and I gotta admit
it does sound a little bit weird saying
that naming scheme especially coming
from the 10th series and then going down
from the RT X 2006 a little bit more
here with Resident Evil 2 up first the
RT X 2060 taking the win the gtx 1070
still performing very strong in this
benchmark and the 1660 TI really just
beating the vega 56 when it's
overclocked now will point out in the
vega 56 i have is a reference model the
gtx 1070 i have here is the gaming ex
version so it is overclocked out of the
factory quite aggressively so the
numbers you do see here today with the
1070 will be slightly in favor of it but
it's because these things are just
literally readily available we'll talk
about that in the conclusion but next up
we've got apex legends and this was a
multiplayer benchmark I decided not to
test the single player because gets a
lot higher FPS than you can in the
multiplayer benchmarks and there's just
so much going on in multiplayer even
though there's a lot of variants I did
get the inkling here that AMD cards did
perform very well at least with the
particular settings that I was using the
1660 I did fall a little bit behind in
this benchmark I guess since it's just a
newly released graphics card coupled
with a newly released title needs some
more driver optimizations be going over
Far Cry 5 the overclocked 1660 T I did
clip out the gtx 1070 here and of course
the RT x 2060 coming out on top and the
vegas 56 doing okay in this benchmark as
well then metro exodus pretty much lined
up with all the cards as they fitted in
their order and the graphs that I've
made here so it was a decent performance
from the 1660 ti and also the RTS 2060s
but the Vega 56 and 1070 still did very
well but moving over the shadows of the
Tomb Raider this is when the 1660 ti did
pull ahead of the 1070 when it was
overclocked the RT X 2060 coming out
ahead I guess those new optimizations
with churring cores and the newest
engines are taking advantage of what it
has to offer
moving on to Tom Clancy's the division
this really does favor the RT X cards
heavily beating out the 1070 by quite a
bit and Vega 56 sort of coming out in
between
the 1070 and also the r-tx 2064 the 1660
T I did very well here especially when
it was overclocked though this is the
most impressive thing of this card right
here I'm gonna pull it up for you guys
and that is the power consumption
figures when I saw the power made up my
jaw dropped I didn't know what was going
on this was very low power consumption
for what it was doing it was basically
performing a lot better than a 1060 yet
it was using roughly the same power so
it was very impressive in terms of its
efficiency though one thing in
particular to this Galax card it did
have a power limit of 100% and so I did
manage to get the overclock stable to
plus 150 five megahertz on the core
which allowed it to go over two
gigahertz and then how the Box got
around eighteen hundred and forty
megahertz and on top of that the memory
did go all the way up plus a thousand on
the slider so I was basically able to
get r-tx 2000 series GDR 6 memory speeds
as it comes out of the box with 6000
megahertz set on the GDR 6 so
overclocking is definitely worth your
while on this grabs card in terms of the
100% power limit I did ask him video if
this was a limit imposed on these 1660
Ti grabs cards they said not in this
case they haven't imposed any limits
like that it's probably just a bug in
afterburner and actually using Galax own
software it was a bit off so I'd like to
see the software get an update because I
believe you'll get even higher
overclocked out of this thing once that
power limits able to go up to around 20%
for example and speaking of this card in
particular it has a DVI port at the back
HDMI 2.0 out and also DisplayPort 1.4
but the temperatures noise and also fan
speeds were very impressive with this
card in particular auto speeds even when
it was overclocked 17 percent and at
these levels
it was so whisper-quiet that this 31 DB
reading is actually inaccurate because
the fan speeds on the CPU cooler in the
background were overpowering it so
basically it's whisper quiet at Auto fan
speed 60% will keep the card under 50
degrees and still keep the noise very
low so it's a recommended sweet spot on
this graphics card and then go up to 80%
and also a hundred percent see the
temperatures drop down very low going
under 45 degrees but the noise does get
pretty high especially at 100% so
absolutely amazing cooler implementation
here from Galax it does weigh in at
about 605 grants also
measures 22 and a half centimeters long
but doesn't feature a backplate but I'm
sure that's not really gonna be a
problem for people who want to get into
the mid-range gaming segment especially
since the card does weigh 600 grams it's
not really gonna suffer from GPU sag
either but it we guys let's put these
cards out here at the front because this
card here at 279 dollars does now pretty
much blow this card away the RX 590 he's
just gonna fall down here because he
doesn't really have much going for him
in terms of value anymore because the
efficiency is better the performance is
better and a video have also updated
their drivers now to support adaptive
sync on free sync monitors and on top of
that you do get these same NV encoder
improvements as the r-tx 2000 series
over the 1000 series which is really
good if you're a streamer on a budget
and you don't have a good front end in
terms of your motherboard CPU or you
don't have a second rig then utilizing
the onboard encoder with the gtx 660ti
is going to be a great option in terms
of efficiency so it's kind of hard to
recommend an RX 590 at the moment but
here we've got the our TX 2060 and
that's only $70 more but it does perform
in a sort of higher league than the gtx
1660 TI but it does so whilst using
about 50 watts more power and also you
do get a backplate if that's a big deal
breaker for you and you do get dl SS and
ray-tracing support on this graphics
card but I will say as it stands the ray
tracing and DL SS support is messy at
the moment and so the 1660 T I in terms
of raw performance for the dollar is
decent it's not impressive it's not the
worst but its biggest feature is its
efficiency and so when you're building a
new PC you don't have to go out and get
an expensive case with super high
airflow you don't have to go out and get
an expensive power supply because this
thing will give you great performance
for the power it's using I guess that's
the biggest benefit of this graphics
card here today but now you may be
wondering what Nvidia have done going
from r-tx to GTX here on these two
graphics cards and it's basically with
the die in particular they're still
using
cheering based shader modules on both
these gravis cards right here the one on
top however is going away with the
tentacles and also ray tracing course
and so with that Nvidia still wanted to
keep the floating-point 16 processors on
board the gratis cards so they've moved
them from the tensor cores into the
shader modules themselves they've also
changed up this graphics card versus the
1060 in terms of its cache structure
giving it access to utilize threefold
the max cache then the 1060 they've also
reduced the die size down from the RT x
2060 to the 1660 Ti to 284 millimeters
squared it still is using the twelve
nanometer process but that allows it to
get those power savings with the IPC
benefits of cheering cos versus the gtx
ten series as we saw in that power
consumption graph it was definitely
doing a lot better in terms of
performance per watt than the GTX tenth
series was doing it also has fifteen
hundred and thirty six of these cheering
cores on board and also some powerful
improvements they've made to the
eleventh series cardia versus the 10
series card is a parallel processing of
floating-point units besides the images
as well as technically making this a
card that should theoretically reduce
input latency ever so slightly if we're
looking at from that perspective but
they've also included adaptive shading a
technology that I'll boasting about
saying that it does make a big
improvement with Wolfenstein 2 although
for me personally I've uninstalled
Wolfenstein I've already finished it
it's a game that's done and dusted and
so relation to adaptive shading
essentially how it works is doesn't need
a shade areas that don't have that much
detail but otherwise would command the
processing power to utilize more
resources than it should in relation to
the image quality so technically with
adaptive shading it makes the grab its
card more efficient and that's what
we're seeing with the 1660 ti but I
would like to see them focus with this
technology in games like apex legends
that are very popular at the moment and
have a huge player base
I think this graphics card in the people
who want to buy it would love to see
that happen anyway guys we're here at
conclusion time but with the 1660 Ti is
currently coming in at $279 this is what
you can actually get it for two on
Amazon so the from pricing is accurate
in this case I in Australia it's coming
well
over 450 dollars at the moment and when
we adjust the US dollar to Aussie
dollars
I think it's overpriced at the moment in
Australia I'd like to see it come down
at least $50 in ours
it'd be good value at that price point
the r-tx 2060 of course you guys have
seen the numbers here today uses out 50
watts more it performs a little bit
better than the 1660 TI
pretty much performs better than the
vega 56 and also the 1070 so if you're
in the market for a new graphics card
and you want that sort of more
performance but you also maybe want to
utilize ray tracing and DL SS then
that's definitely a solid recommendation
on the table in terms of Vega 56 there
was this thing going around where it you
could get it for under three hundred US
dollars if you can get it for that price
then go ahead and do it but I think that
was only on one model and it sold out
instantly or there wasn't even enough
stock or something because when I
checked on Amazon Vega 56 cards are
going for around four hundred US dollars
and I'd much rather buy a twenty sixty
then a Vega 56 at those prices then
we've got the 1070 which is very
abundant if you're looking for a deal if
you know what you're doing with deal
hunting this card here performs in a
similar league to a sixteen sixty TI but
of course if you to go on eBay and buy
it now even on a used graphics card like
this it's gonna cost you around maybe
two hundred fifty US dollars and
honestly at that price point I'd much
rather buy a sixteen sixty TI and then
we've got the rx 590 here which
unfortunately after today's review and
results that I've seen here I can't
really recommend this thing it just got
blown out of the water in terms of
efficiency power efficiency and also
performance except for apex legends
where ambi graphics cards are performing
very well in apex legends at the moment
you guys that wraps up the 1660 TI
review here this is the gal axel big
thanks to Galax for sending this out I
had little time to do this review this
thing got to me pretty late hence why
the reviews late but this model itself
is a stellar performer as we saw with
those noise and thermals and
overclocking Headroom this is definitely
a great implementation of a 16 60 TI but
I mean Galax know exactly what they're
doing with geforce cards all the cards
that have come through here from them
have I
been exceptional value or exceptional
performers in the case of the Hall of
Fame's
this one's no different and without a
side let us know in the comment section
below what you think of the gtx 1660 ta
is it a card that you'll be in the
market for or is it a card that you'll
skip love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and one more thing
too there is actually no founders
editions of the gtx 1660 TI is unlike
the RT x series so it's all custom
models that you're gonna see out there
from all the AIB partners so just
thought I'd add that into the end of
this review and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon but also if
you enjoyed this one I want to hit that
sub button hit the bell and also check
us out on Instagram check yes City for
that inside scoop and I'll catch it in
the next tech video very soon he's out
for now wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
