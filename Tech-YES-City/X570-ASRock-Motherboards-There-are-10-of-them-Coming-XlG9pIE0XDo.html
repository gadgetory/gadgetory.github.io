and I am here at the ASRock booth
where they have a heap of
new motherboards on display,
and for X570, it's actually
10 new boards in total.
So today, we're gonna try
and get through these as best as possible.
And these are the boards that are gonna be
supporting those new Ryzen 3000 chips,
which we saw that three
of them were announced,
but five of them were actually listed.
So, that's the six cores, the eight cores,
and the 12 core CPUs from AMD.
These are the boards that will hopefully
be the ones to pick,
but let's go through them all
and give you guys the details.
(upbeat music)
So going from the list top
to bottom, we first off
have the X570 Aqua with that option
for water coolers who need
the water block installed.
Now we're talking 12+2 phases in total
for 14 direct phases for these CPUs.
This one also features Thunderbolt.
That's right, Thunderbolt
3, and 10G Aquantia LAN.
As well as having two Gen
4x4 slots there for NVMe.
So this thing is absolutely packed.
It's the top of the line flagship board.
The one thing that does trend through
with some of these boards is that
that Dr. MOS 14 phase design
is gonna be in some of
the higher-end boards.
So even though the Aqua itself
is gonna be top of the line,
it's still gonna feature the same VRM
that is powering, for
example, the X570 Creator
which is their next board.
Which has again the
12+2 phase power design,
but it doesn't have water cooling.
But this one actually has
two Thunderbolt ports on it,
as well as a 10 gig LAN solution on board.
So I guess this on actually is geared up
towards creators, that's no joke.
Next up here is the third board in line
and this is the Phantom Gaming X
and actually my personal
favorite in terms of its looks.
I think it looks phenomenal.
Massive heat sink over the
actual chip set hub itself
as well as having a
12+2 phase power design.
Dr. MOS direct phases.
This one has triple Gen 4x4 NVMe.
It also has the Realtek 2.5G LAN solution
as well as having Wi-Fi 11ax.
So that's currently
the best Wi-Fi solution
you can get on a motherboard.
That is included.
They also have integrated IO shields
all the way down to the Extreme4
and this is a flex design
that ASRock is implementing.
So in the case of some
integrated IO shields
from the competitors, for example,
you can have a little bit of trouble
if the actual IO shield
cutout doesn't match
since it is a fixed solution.
This one on the other hand,
on all these X570 boards,
has some flex in it, so
that is a good thing to see.
But next up on the line is the X570 Taichi
which again has that same high end VRM
but it is essentially going away
with no fancy LAN solutions.
You've just got the one gigabit
per second LAN solution.
Three Gen 4x4 NVMe slots as well as
a Wi-Fi solution included,
which is the 11ax Wi-Fi solution.
Then moving on, we have the Extreme4
which is a very popular
choice back in the day,
especially in the Z77 days,
for being that value king.
It seems like they're keeping the Extreme4
as their value king.
But going with a blue
carbon and black theme here.
Actually quite interesting.
As well as having an 8+2 Dr. MOS
direct phases on the VRM.
So, 10 phases in total
and cutting away 4 phases
versus the higher end models.
But it also has a type C,
so they're not going with
Thunderbolt on this model.
I think the top two X570 boards
will have that Thunderbolt delivery.
But next in the stack
is the X570 Steel Legend
having the same VRM as the Extreme4,
sort of that mid-range VRM.
Integrated IO shield, RGB,
dual heat sinks on PCIe,
4x4 NVMes.
And then moving down in the stack,
we have the X570 Pro4 and the Pro4-M.
I am told these are entry level boards
so don't expect any 16 cores
overclocking at 10 gigahertz, for example.
As well as having 2 oz copper PCBUs
throughout all the boards.
So they are making sure
that they are still
sticking with quality
and even though this board isn't going
to be the best overclocker
it still has 48 amp chokes
as well as an 8+2 phase power design
on the VRM delivery.
Then last, but certainly not least,
I've saved this special till last.
This is the ITX version,
the Phantom Gaming-ITX X570.
They've already got something in the works
before the Ryzen 3000 chips are out.
And the special thing
about this board is that
it features Thunderbolt on
board as well as having an
LGA cooler mounting system in place
which I didn't think was possible,
but ASRock have done it with the
1151 cooler mounting system.
You can put it on this ITX board.
That essentially enables
for more cooling options.
Now for the VRM, they've
got 10 phases in total,
8+2 design here,
direct phases, Dr. MOS design just like
those other boards that
we saw here on display.
And I am told this board will be able to
support a 16 core absolutely fine.
Now in terms of demos and showing you guys
actual performance of
the chips themselves,
I was told that ASRock were only told
that they could show the
actual PCIe NVMe Gen 4 speeds
and so they had something on display here
and the speeds were absolutely monstrous.
If you guys didn't know,
PCIe Gen 4 offers double the speeds
as the PCIe Gen 3.
But another important thing
to point out on that note
is that every single chip set heat sink
on these X570 boards has a active fan
so basically that PCIe Gen 4,
I believe it is putting out enough heat
to warrant the requirement
of a fan on board.
So with that, you may see some higher
idling power consumption on X570,
but I won't exactly know until
I get a hands-on for you guys July 7th.
And as I said in the intro,
we don't know about
the exact release dates
of these motherboards
nor the pricing as they can't give that
information out just yet.
But I am told that it should be released
before July 7th.
So you will be able to
get your motherboard
before you get your Ryzen 3000 CPU.
Anyway guys that's it for the X570
motherboards on display here
at the ASRock booth at Computex 2019.
If you guys enjoyed this video,
then you know what to do.
Hit that like button for us.
Also if you want to see these videos
the moment they drop,
sub button, ring the bell
and they'll be delivered to your sub box
the moment they drop.
And with that aside, I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon
but also on that note,
let us know what you
think about these boards,
the designs.
I think that they look super
cool ASRock's definitely
picking up their game
when it comes to getting
the aesthetics right
as well as getting the
delivery of everything
someone would want in different lineups.
For instance, that Taichi,
for those people that
just want to overclock,
has that VRM ready to go.
Anyway guys peace out for now.
Bye
