doesn't work and the answer is it can
work depending on which product you get
so this journey of mine began a few
months ago when I installed a low light
blue LED in my room and I noticed that
my vision was becoming really poor
really quickly to the point where I had
black holes in my aisle black spots in
my vision in the morning and so after
doing a lot of research I figured that
it was the blue light being what that
was causing the problems and so I
decided to switch all my lighting in my
house to see CFL bulbs but there was
still one problem and that is that the
computer monitors that I use are white
LEDs and they still emit a lot of blue
light and so there are a few things you
can do to combat this and help reduce
that blue light and today I'm going to
talk about actual protection and that is
glasses or protective filters and do
they actually work so let's look at the
contenders here I think from the bottom
here we have the hardware stores big
glasses then to the left of that we have
some le comm PC glasses which are touted
to block as much as 65% blue light these
are touted to block about 30% blue light
then we have on the left here these are
my current glasses that I use they're
also from the hardware store and they're
touted to block around about 45% I think
it is of the blue light coming out then
at the back there we just thought I'd
throw in some sunglasses for comparison
and then to the right of that we've got
some Jin's PC glasses which are touted
as blocking up to 55% of the blue light
behind that we have some Korean eye
sorry no so actually Taiwanese panels
actual eBay specials that are meant to
filter our blue light so I'm going to be
running a test with as you can see here
I've got a UV light here I've got a
white light and then I've got a blue
light a blue LED and a red LED so we're
going to run some tests in the dark and
we'll see how well some of these
products work so first up here we have
the hardware store glasses and this is
the first test I'll run is the
reflection test and we just see if
there's blue
coming off these glasses so these are
the $10 hardware-store glasses as you
can see there there's blue light being
clearly reflected off a white LED so
these glasses are clearly doing their
job when it comes to protecting your
eyes from blue light so the next test
will run here is the blue LED test where
I just get a blue LED light and I just
shine it through the glasses themselves
if the light gets weaker then the
glasses are clearly doing their job as
you can see here the light is getting in
my opinion substantially weaker so let's
pass that test okay so the next test
here we've just got a red LED light and
I'm going to shine it through the
glasses and then shine it on the actual
desk itself so this it basically this
test is just the same as the blue except
this time around you don't want red
light being blocked out so you see there
there's not much of a difference at all
so these glasses are doing a good job
when it comes to actually letting
through the green and red light I'm
going to assume the green lights getting
let through as well and blocking out the
blue light so next up here we have a
reputable Japanese company called Jin's
PC these are $50 glasses that are
actually they feel pretty good but
anyway let's run them through the tests
let's do the white LED test first and
this is just so much blue lights being
reflected not that much at all I don't
think this is fifty five percent okay so
next up let's do the blue light test
here with these Jin's PC glasses okay so
it's blocking out a little bit of blue
light there anyway let's do the red
light test okay so here's the red light
test so it's letting through so I'm
letting through practically all the red
light Jin's PC glasses they did a little
bit but seriously I don't think the
fifty-five or 50% claim that they're
making doesn't hold true especially to a
white LED this is the same technology in
this LED even though it's much brighter
that's going in the back of your
monitors stop here we have this is just
for fun some sunglasses we're going to
see how
well these do is we got the white light
test coming up first here and we can
actually see off the sunglasses a little
bit I'd say probably more blue lights
being reflected off these than off the
djinns PC glasses so the sunglass is
wearing sunglasses in front of your
computer we'll make a little bit of a
difference ironically well like that's
pretty huge I mean that's blocking out a
lot of blue light but that's to be
expected from sunglasses which I'll show
you in the red light test okay so here's
the red light test for the sunglasses
I mean it's blocking out a lot of red
light but I think it blocked out a lot
more blue light than it did red light so
anyway less sunglasses aren't too bad of
a choice sunglasses these are a pair of
police sunglasses so they're I think
they're a little bit expensive but they
actually work like if you've got nothing
else and you don't know what to trust
then a pair of sunglasses will give you
some relief from the ultraviolent blue
light essentially because I guess it's
stated to block out moral travail light
the other sets of lights and the blue
light spectrum is closer than UV
spectrum than any other green or source
of light okay so next up here we have
the le comte glasses which are touted to
block as much as 65% blue light and I
will say one thing these are definitely
the most comfortable out of all the
glasses I have here but anyway let's run
it through the tests okay so first up
we've got the white LED tests we'll just
see if it's reflecting blue light I mean
it looks like it is reflecting some blue
light but really not a lot compared to
the other contenders
especially compared to the hardware
store glasses so let's run it through
the blue light and red light tests to
get some more insight on these classes
and so here's a blue light test with the
Le comm glasses so we can see here they
are blocking out if we look at the
Center there you see that it is blocking
out some blue light why should it's
quite significant I think let's try the
red LED test so here's the Le Cong
glasses with the red LEDs so it is doing
it's not blocking a whole lot of red
light which is a good thing
so these glasses actually do work so
there's the Le comm glasses these things
actually do work in their own weird way
I guess they're absorbing the blue light
rather than reflecting it which is kind
of interesting and maybe they've got
some different kind of technology going
in there but it's definitely they're
definitely doing a job of blocking out
more blue light than red light which is
a good thing even though the blue light
wasn't reflecting off the lens in that
particular test so let's move on now to
the next contender these are the glasses
I was wearing at the start of the video
these are my favorite little hardware
store glasses these are again with $10
let's run these through the tests I
guess the next up we've got the hardware
store glasses here we can just see
they're reflecting that blue light I
mean that's a lot of blue light coming
off these glasses so they're doing their
job and they're definitely doing their
job when it comes to reflecting that
blue light next up we've got the blue
LED test here so we'll just run it
through that and see there it's dropping
the amount of blue light that's coming
through by quite a bit in my opinion I
mean that's that's doing its job so
let's run the red LED test here and
we'll see how much of a difference it
makes there okay so here's the red light
I'll the red LED test so we can see here
there's just nothing really happening
it's letting thrilled pretty much all
that red lights going through which is a
good thing
okay so hardware store glasses number
two $10 pair number two does pretty much
the exact same job as the other pair
reflects that blue light and lets the
red light through so these are a win as
well okay so lastly here we've got a
blue light filter off ebay that's touted
as protecting your eyes from blue light
let's run this thing through the tests
here's the white light test I mean it
just looks like it's reflecting white
light and when I first put this on my
screen the reason for doing all these
tests is pretty much because of this
filter I just there was like wall okay
I'm not one to believe in placebo and
this is why it's just pretty much
reflecting white light okay so let's do
the blue light test here I mean on the
panel off the panel on the panel off the
panel this thing is freakin useless
right I mean the sad thing is I actually
paid good money for this like $40 for
this thing and pretty much all you're
getting is a piece of acrylic I mean
let's just do the red light test as well
here's the red light test you can see
it's and doesn't filter any blue light
of course it shouldn't filter any red
light as well so here's the UV light
test I mean this is the last test I'm
going to give to this acrylic piece of
 and see if it's doing its job I
mean it's filtering out a little bit of
UV light there's still letting even a
lot through anywhere even at that so so
here's the overview of the ebay panel
and it's completely useless so let's go
over to a conclusion now so in
conclusion there were some winners and
there were some losers let's talk about
the winners first because this really
impressed me my hardware store man it's
a local hardware store chain the selling
ten dollar PC glasses and they do a
really good job of reflecting the blue
lights we saw in that white LED test
that light was just coming off these
glasses in mass then we did the blue LED
light test it was significantly reducing
that blue light and then letting through
a lot of that red light so these get a
recommendation even though I don't think
you could buy them where you live which
is kind of ironic
anyway it goes to show though that not
things aren't always what they seem
though these do get a recommendation as
well these are the Le comm glasses these
are around about $20 and they were
significantly reducing that blue light
even though the white LED test wasn't
too promising the blue LED and the red
LED test did show that the blue was
getting reduced compared to the red so
these definitely do get a recommendation
as well let's get on now to a neutral
kind of a neutral recommendation and
that is the sunglasses I mean these
things did a good job of kind of
blocking out everything I mean I was
surprised but they blocked out more blue
light than they did red light which
means that they will work for blocking
blue light in front of your PC so if
you've got nothing else that you can
trust in or if you're saving for a good
pair of blue light PC glasses or whatnot
these will work in the mean time so
that's just a decent pair of sunglasses
let's get onto the losers now this is
the part that really shocked me because
the most expensive pair of glasses did
not perform that well at all and this is
coming from a company that's called gins
in Japan they're very reputable company
and these were pretty much like these
are almost $50 so expensive but they
were inferior to the cheaper products
even the ten dollar hardware store
glasses so I was kind of surprised these
won't do that good of a job of blocking
out blue light then we get on to the
worst thing here and this is borderline
fraudulent like this is I think this is
disgusting because the person
advertising this was putting a child as
the advertisement a child blocking out
blue light and as you saw in the test
this thing did absolutely nothing at all
and the whole reason for doing these
tests was because when I got this thing
I thought it was doing nothing in the
first place and the testing just proved
that so this thing is absolutely useless
I'm going to get a refund for it and
this thing was this wing was the most
expensive well actually was just a
little bit and think there's $40 this
wing was $50 so the most expensive
products here came out dead last so I'm
kind of shocked but anyway I'm getting a
refund on this and I mean just when you
when you're looking for PC glasses or
blue light filtering
products just be careful what you buy as
for Gunners I know there's going to be a
lot of people out there what about
Gunners I've asked Gunners for a review
sample as I'd love to test their glasses
and I'm waiting on their response though
I'm pretty sure from all the reviews
I've read about Gunners I'm pretty sure
they will do a fine job and one thing I
would like to add those what about other
people who have tested other lights and
lasers well they're not putting lasers
in the back jana ters especially 4 or 5
nanometer lasers they're putting in
white LEDs which emit blue light very
strongly in that spectrum from 450
nanometer to 4 70 nanometer so basically
if you get a white LED like I had here
it's going to be emitting pretty much
the same amount of blue light that the
monitors even though a lot more of it
then the actual PC monitors are emitting
so it's in the same sort of spectrum so
that's something so I think my tests are
pretty decent even though they're not
like super professionals I don't have
the most expensive gear to test though
they are pretty accurate in my opinion
so anyway guys the whole thing just to
come out of this is just be careful what
you buy and some blue light filtering
technology just technology just simply
doesn't work and some works really well
