you guys doing we're going to announce
the giveaway winners for the a Ark
giveaway it's international giveaway and
we're going to pick two winners one for
each channel and we're going to draw it

doing giveaways if you guys enter
giveaways to I think you guys should be
requesting that they're giving away live
that way you know there's no funny
buggers there's no crap going on we you
know heard of all these scams going on
blast on giveaways legit giveaway so you

so we've got xsplit running here's and
look crazy
but we're going to draw the winners live
so it should be good especially if
you've got the live monitoring here too
yeah so that's it someone's already
asked what happened to the Ghost Recon
keys is coming so that's why I was going
to talk about there's a thousand

Google go through it throw a good number

them out because some of them are pretty
funny I have been reading him so I'm
gonna go with first-come first-serve the
first five funniest comments that we
read from the first yeah yeah yeah I
think you really stick when I have
enough time to go through a thousand
comments yeah so we got a lot of entries
of course that isn't how many users
there were I believe there was over
10,000 users so about 12,000 yeah yes so
your chances are a lot better than gold
lotto so a lot better than gold prizes a
lot better so yeah so exactly - yeah 240
Hertz okay

the idea

bit of a bit of a fun time so we'll take
this off here then we can come back
congratulations to you two guys Julius
and who was your winner do you remember
his name
Christopher yes I remember good he's
cheating so yeah if you guys wonder the
voice of mine is gone because I've been
partying for like every night the course
is really good Coursera Brian hiding up
and working yeah
man it's it is good like Taiwan guys if
you if you like nightlife then come over
to Taiwan it's really good like it's
next-level good the hard way is also
pretty good as well if you're into
computers yeah it's nice to say this is
rising like I did the vlog the new parts
were like pretty much even dare I'd say
more expensive than Australia yeah I
don't think it's too surprising like I
would expect graphics cards and like CPU
you have a really yeah like 80% of what
you'd pay in the Taiwan was a bargain B
that's what I'd fight for new parts
because they're manufactured here it's
like air you look at um for instance the
oil it's manufactured in Arabian
countries they charge out 10 cents a
liter I heard you know taking care of
the locals like I thought you know they
would have taken if it was really cheeky
there'd be so many scams of people
saying Harbor to Australia Rocky Bay
would lie to earth coming here just on
the count because at the end today it is
hard to balance right it's a balancing
act so we also have really good internet
here I think the upwards like 20
megabits per second on Wireless so
Australia then what are you guys doing
I've got two megabits per second so
that's very good for uploading those
videos yeah hopefully the colors better
- yeah I'll take minutes instead of
hours yep and guys again tonight we're
going to another Corsair party are we
ready for another one
oh cool ser partying our jeebies but
they make i speaking to the guy who
makes the air cases yep dude almost
fanboying him handles like dude and
everyone's like everyone's just like to
go makes the air cases and what that's
the guy makes the air cases it was a tea
well there are cases are some of their
best for sure I want to thought they're
amazing and really the first time I saw
one of like damn that's that's PI yeah I
used them for the test systems for quite
a while yes they're legitimately good
this the thing about case cooling right
when you guys have a good airflow in
your case it helps that everything
legitimately helps overclocking I
remember I was like did this I did this
is like I haven't even done it on a
camera or anything but I remember doing
my overclocking Rison and I opened the
side panel and within a couple of
minutes my stability crash would crack
and if I close it just go all night on
all day so well that's the passively
cool comparison or not getting the
airflow once you take the door off okay
so yeah a lot of guys think with the
door offer you'll actually get better
temperatures but not necessary if you
get the Sarila if you didn't if you get
there not necessary
Lele Lele so you get the idea what I
meant yeah but the old-school if you
guys are on a budget of course the
old-school way is never going to fail
just get the massive desk fan and have
that crap blowing air yes and it's a
$2.00 fix oh yeah yeah yeah you just
well it's not a $2.00 fix because you
need about ten dollars for a good set of
earmuffs and then you said yeah well as
how's the audio to so we haven't really
yeah and no one's complained what no
one's complaining about the audio sir
yeah I some people are joining in yeah
who's the winners we yeah we have the
winners up here so we've just we can
quickly share that again okay so there's
one is there if you guys missed them
there's a two winners they were drawn
alive so you can click back any time and
you can see fully legit congratulations
guys again
you got 240 Hertz no American winners no
Australian winners yeah oh I think I
remember I saw that I saw the
Thermaltake giveaway comment section
that was brutal that was it was so mad
Elsie's weren't too happy were they well
I mean the bottom line is is like I kind
of like I was reading on the comments
it's like it was more it that giveaway
was especially touted as anastasi NZ
giveaway kind of well it was through
yeah and Zed thermaltake but my
channel's global and I announced that
was a global giveaway yeah unfortunately
I think 70% of the guys that didn't turn
this is four by the way the thermal tape
Verizon PC that I gave away and yet
something like seventy percent of all
guys that entered were from the US so it
was a good chance someone from the US
was going to win that one
but anyway rock on yeah we'll be doing
another should I say that for PC
giveaway sir it will be coming yeah so
we've got to get the details for that
but we're getting people on board and we
want to give you guys yeah like three
machines I think we've got at all yeah
so we're going to still marry up with a
third guest for the giveaway and the
cool thing is they're all going to have
different specs so different graphics
cards see if you
use yeah all custom-built so yep it'll
be very cool
think I know what your system is going
to be what I was new Intel CPUs man
Nvidia graphics card no that's probably
minor I'm actually the rumor is here's
the rumor the rumor is until the cabbie
Lake X CPUs are actually going to be
good that's the room on the street well
they're not gonna be bad but you know
why them for us you know why they can be
good why's that
so going to be soldered and apparently
they're going to overclock a lot better
than the cabbie Lake mainstream CPUs
weird yeah so yeah so yeah that's the
word on the street guys heard it here
first so I think I'll try and do a
thread Ripper system then if you're
gonna go inside I'm not like I don't
really care like I actually love Verizon
yeah that's really good so yeah I'm the
i-5 1600
we've been living both fair warning that
pretty hard like that's a really good
CPU yeah six core processor for that
price with 12 threads it's hard to be
what car be beaten right now I mean
unless they slash Broadwell II and
that's not going to happen but that's
the thing I think when we get into it
it's everything else the motherboard
Sochi and it comes with a cooler well
works well on a be 350 bull and I think
they started something like $70 us for a
decent board that works well so even the
bottom of the barrel boards they gave
you that there that ability to overclock
work pretty well so what's there not to
love yeah well what's the cheapest broad
well bought got a fish hundred board
well II oh well a yes so yeah apparently
arm one guy was telling me about the
five seven seven five see he reckons
that's the best gaming CPU you had one
didn't you did you get yeah they they
are actually good but they are very
expensive
did you test because he was telling me
some motherboards don't have that
ability to use that level for catfish -
you have one wrong yeah I don't know
about that to be honest with you so some
of them don't have the ability to use it
but apparently the Zeus motherboard can
utilize it okay I wouldn't have thought
to be motherboard dependent but yeah
that's what I honestly I do have one and
I have tests it why I honestly haven't
used the Broadwell core i5s for a
long time mainly because no one's
interested I'll hit new Marples they do
can you send it to us and like I'll just
never get it back yeah I'll just test it
and keep it like what up yeah they were
very cool I mean having I think 128
megabytes level for cash cash yeah
that's very cool necks I don't know
enough to talk about that there's some
times the software can use it if the
discreet is sorry the integrated
graphics isn't utilizing it so that's
why it's good in game yeah so games can
use that massive buffer and apparently
it's smooth like super smelling you
imagine smooth
you've got next level like yeah yeah
butter just melting on your face while
you're playing games apparently that's
why I had to help works avocado butter
avocado tastes pretty good so yeah yeah
Tom Taiwan man the nightlife is really
good so if people coming over like
people think Japan was good or something
like that this place is just more open
like Japan's really crowded like Tokyo
yeah Oh Tokyo like you going to a club
in Tokyo onions
yeah Malaga you drinking ebert yeah
lovely scene Sunday night of course yeah
I got him last night quite late I think
it was ten o'clock before yeah you got
to tell him about that what oh man tell
him the story come on where do I start
well first of all the first leg of my
journey went well I got to Hong Kong but
the problem was at a two-hour layover in
Hong Kong and my original flight was
delayed an hour and a half so by the
time we disembarked I had something like
five minutes to get to my next flight
and I was told that was delayed by 45
minutes I thought okay it's not too bad
but I still ran and not the fittest guy
going around that was a killer was a
couple of Kay's as well from where I had
to go to see you're not used to
overclocking yourself no my calves still
feel overclocked so I got to the
terminal and it was just enough
heartbreaking as a right word to use but
it was they just slam the door I mean I
was about a minute late and they'd
closed so that was it I miss my flight
and then I they said the next two
flights were full so they
see if they get me on one of them and it
looked like I think this was six o'clock
at this point it looked like I might I
don't know I might not everyone got
there that day i mighta had to spend the
night sleeping in the airport so anyway
I got real lucky with the next flight
who fixed you up too brother
well that one that was the real funny
part of the whole story because it's
meant to be getting picked up by the
hotel limo from the airport and all that
it's quiet it's about an hour drive so
if I had to get a taxi that we've been
quite costly and whatnot so I ended up
using the air free why I fight the
airport to Skype call Brian I said Brian
can you please ring the Hyatt and let
them know that I've missed my flight
really hijack and he's like I'm already
at the Hyatt it's okay and I said I said
to him I said I'm going to be ours is
also to make this less confusing Brian's
staying in my room at the Hyatt so who
is going to come to the heart weighs for
me so yes it Brian what are you doing in
the Haight already I'm gonna be hours
and hours before I can get there at the
earliest he said I'm in your room all
set up in the room
I just hijacked admit like look this is
a store I got my part of the circuit
might get looted I checked out so
checked out of my hotel went out
partying till 6:00 in the morning the
day before had to check out 11:00 now I
got out of my hotel I was like oh
still a bit roasted from the night
before and then I'm like let's just get
to the grand yet I had and then I'm just
gonna smooth talk and thankfully it was
a check oh yeah
and I just started smooth talking I just
started saying hey I usually here's my
business card
I'm staying with mr. Walton and this is
the room number because I knew that room
number two kind of thing like I having
had little bit of your details - you
must have yeah and then I started like
never forward Brian emails make sure you
check every bit of information we sent
it to him and anyway the hotel ended up
getting changed into my name I couldn't
check him when I got here
oh so buddy and then like this morning
I'm down at the lobby I'm Claire hi akka
say hi Brian had to come down and get me
to take me up to my room
so he's loving it though yes ladies
loving it
is love he's got company
so we actually yeah cuz I'm you get the
money he is weird - you got new tie $1
so like 20 23 Taiwan dollars is one
Aussie dollar 30 Taiwan dollars is one
US dollar so it's really confusing
because just yet doing all the math like
Japan's really easy because it's like
pretty much a hundred yen to one dollar
so it's easy to calculate but here it's
like it son fusing I don't really have
to worry about it too much because no
I'm just gonna pay for everything I
decided he's paying for the room think
about his back got his back just tie
Jack in his hotel and my even hi
Jackie's wallet like where's my wallet
man I've got my internet so funny but
yeah that was awesome so yeah I actually
did get on the next flight thankfully I
was a bit worried but yeah go on the
next flight so I was only there for an
hour or something I would delay in the
end so that could have been a lot worse
and that I got in here the hotel driver
was there and I got here to discover
yeah that Brian had hijacked my room but
anyway all good and it's man it's really
good here the use parts hunting was yeah
like the use parts man it's really I
thought it would be easy but there's
like no stores in the electronic
district I haven't been outside to
trying to check out like if we do
Computex next year which I'm going to
try away yeah definitely loving loving
it it's awesome
I'll try and come in like early early
and rent a car and then wait we'll go I
reckon I'll just for that Ridge is just
my go around site scene but also try and
check out like junk stores and stuff
around it looks like a lot of fun your
video yeah is man like the the digital
Plaza though is like only new stores and
I got to one store man how was this and
he had an x58 box cuz I'm not just going
in the stories like what are you doing
what dude I'm just sure
oh sure I'm like as over he picked up a
prize waiting all the bins yeah like I
already picked up a part by that time
and I'm just telling the guy oh sure oh
sure and he's like oh sure not like oh
he's like oh sure
my weight is like bonding easy because
they guys that they have that if they
have used parts they're generally going
to like use parts yeah so they're going
to recite it's just a pretty much
mutual thing if they don't like use
parts they're gonna be like oh did you
my computer go to sleep yeah just go
motor yeah now we're still alive
no like because the screen turned off
was I no don't don't do that midstream
but yep if they like use parts they're
generally going to have that respect and
love for use parts as well so I figured
the only guys who have the use parts
were very nice they were like oh yeah
I've got this let's start haggling and
so I think it's just the like I don't
even think the part don't even matter
what part you've got it's just the the
deal process like I bang this guy down
from $2 to $1 and he said he said
because he could speak English he's like
 you're good I was like I like man
you guys it's all about getting the deal
like it's a little about the deal strong
here he go he's like yeah I made a
dollar off that rubbish here's the thing
he said I could have anything in the bin
he's like I'm like dude what is this is
like I'm kind of gonna throw it out like
and I'm just checking through and wait
what about this I found like for RAM
sticks in a motherboard age 55
motherboard with an i7 870 I think well
and he's like because I pulled the
cooler off and stuff and that I tried to
put it back on but by the clips like
hanging out he's like what's this what's
what's on this he's like pulled the
cooler off he's like I'm not selling you
this I'm like damn I would have been
ever so cool because I was like I like I
came out pretty strong see I already
bought the other one for a bark and I
came out very strong I'll give you 10
for this because it's got RAM in it and
like and then he looked at the CPU I'm
like yeah no it's not how he's like I'm
not selling it okay he said I could have
anything in the bin we discovered the
best thing in the bin you yeah al but
yeah it was it was hectic I started like
literally just before lunch and then I
ended up spending like a whole day every
store I was just gave and went into the
service repair stores where they're
repairing laptops and phones I'm
slightly you go in use parts they're
likely not a bad spot to start and
they're just like what are you doing in
here I'm like no ask you know getti
watching the video it looked like was
I'm actually equivalent of
walking around like a shopping center
and trying to find used parts like that
imagine doing that back at home that
would be so bizarre that's pretty much
what it was like I ended up getting
stuff in the end which was really cool
so that was that was I guess yeah that's
the big drugs other thing we were joking
that was from BitFenix his office though
so they see this one here was from the
BitFenix
that was the best part of it so I get to
my room and there's just Hardware over
the beds the couch there's just stuff
everywhere Brian's just got the edge
just palpable were floating around yes
so this one these I was at the BitFenix
office because they wanted me to cover
their booth for Computex and I said to
them as legs at a 780 at 770 or 780 they
haven't checked so I don't know who
either I'm gonna try and check it out
like it might work and then they're like
I'm like what are you doing with these
parts like this is such a waste it's
just sitting he was like oh yeah we're
not using it anymore so I'm like I just
kept hounding I'm taking those used
parts you know that and he's like yeah
like taking those use parts and file
he's like dude he's your bad I'm not
joking man I don't joke about taking use
part yeah exactly you don't you don't
let it go to waste
all the boys know that in the audience
too so yeah so um we want to go through
and we can pick out some comments you
guys can come through we've got to pick
out some comments to give away the Ghost
Recon keys all be well how are we going
to get like because there draws a winner
I'll just announce the winners on
Twitter well we could you can read
through yeah like 20 or so or 30 or
whatever you want to read through and
just enter them in the draw will be
randomly selected major I don't know
we'll give away you work it out yeah
I'll sing in the first five that make us
both laugh I think that's legit ah okay
so it's just is basically just a fun way
to let people win with ya and it's not
it's not like if I don't laugh at your
comment guys I'm sorry it's just that
I've got like a weird my dad's a builder
in Australia so he's got a weird sense
of humor and you know the the sad thing
is it's usually the dirty comments they
get the laugh but good but yeah you
can't you got to be like you can't be
dirty on your channel you got to be like
politically correct now too
so I don't know glad it's your channel
yeah I guess you I was going to boot a
channel like as a joke politically
correct tech miles when we get onto the
new studio if we get if we get ahead of
schedule is going to make this just this
skit channel politically correct tech
where we do everything over the top like
we're talking ten wrist rests when wrist
straps when you're building a computer
how would the thermal application look
yeah it's actually exactly thermal paste
it has to be a perfect and if you mess
it up you row to redo it and so just to
picture myself redoing it all night
don't do any build yeah it was just for
last okay so we have notepad here I'm
going to write down the names and then
announce the winners on Twitter there is
a thousand comments so we're going to
start going through these comments
should we just should sketch share the
screen I think that's the easiest way I
think we pulled it up here we got it up
here so wow this is this is crazy so
we're going to go through the comments
and you guys can go through with them
too so here we are here so hopefully
yeah well that's good that's live
feedback because then we can see what's
going Lidl a so okay one d oh my god so
it's basically what you would do for a
Ghost Recon zki so what would you do for
a Ghost Recon ski okay so for a game key
I would go to an area with the Bunnings
in my tent and pick my 210 I'm truly
sorry don't crucify me Ozzy Jesus mark
tenza right that's like like I like
might attend well I live in a rural area
so might attends quite good though they
are all being overtaken by Bunnings now
so it's pretty hard to find him I'd
attend I think we'll do what was the
other one that was very wrong what was
your masters what was the one that
Cole's yeah mass that was masters yeah
one of them had one and just failed hard
yeah that was masters yeah they've just
failed miserably as they went more
expensive than Bunnings that's right so
we had these two hardware stores like
and one of them tried to be a premium
brand and it's like no one cared
Bunnings just has like the best approach
basically I try to be yeah let you say a
premium it was just different stuff and
if a person liked it oh man I
dude I know not this comment like I was
out the other night and like literally a
gay guy I said I will suck you off I'm
like dude like I'm not that's cool but
I'm not gay you know I think you know me
like hey just asked all night as well
and like oh man like dude like you know
I'm fast forward in there possibly this
is a nutty giveaway holy moly a case is
not who's going to do what free who's
gonna do I would comment on this video

congratulations and then Lambert says I
wouldn't do anything for that game code
because I have a laptop that can't run
minecraft at 30 FPS at 720p but for some
reason I still want the win the monitor
okay okay is it just me or the hardware
box guy looks like a villain from
another movie your villain you look like
a villain guys to Steve I'll take it
thank you
like the red villain already said you
did Billy villain Rx carry my feelings
oh sorry man I did you've been roasting
me in your videos lately hardcore hey
last four I'd buy you a game code for
the game as a thank-you gift so you'd
buy me a key for a key can you give me
money actually that's a pretty good
transaction bribery day no rads
we cannot do that oh that's honest that
one there yeah what am I gonna do with
those five codes sell them of course no
you can't win five it's only one person
wins won five different people so I
would love prizes become man we could
hear the comments like I think a lot of
them started coming in after like the
first day
yeah the lane I think that's right
that's right the absence of action we
got to do something if you want the key
I'd love to win the case so I cannot
play the game just kidding I really love
hope to win the key but you got to tell
me what you would do for it and it's got
to be like crazy what would he do I'd
buy the game okay Josh Mandell you said
it man like you could have won one if
you I don't know maybe this is okay I
would like that comment wasn't early by
the way yeah by the key are you because
I put newest comments and not funny so
you played it to me we're going
backwards in time yeah what's this if
you give me the code now that'll be the
end of it this is scary man
well I'm ready to hear what he says I do
know who you are I don't know what you
want if you're looking for ransom what
bleep dude you should be doing the other
way around you should be like
threatening me for a game can be like I
know where you live bro if you don't
give me a key I'm going to come over and
like then what okay I'll give you the
key man just that's too much of a hassle
if I got the key I'd probably go to my
school tell my principal to make a party
at school and then later play the game
he wants a key so bad it's very
descriptive of what he would know it
sounds like you probably would do that
you're on we're raising Dre if we pick
no one else bro we'll pick you we're
holding raising raising drag because we
got to go through I know there was some
that really made me I would deep throat
cactus and TSS itch haha
all right Skywalker number 2 this is it
made you love it made you laugh too man
oh crap alright Skywalker the MSI's
gonna love that yeah
I'll post on their website the stupidest
yet idiotic thing he would do yelling
stupid things you guys tell skate p200
you got to tell us what you would yell
out it's gotta be pins got to be Pacific
though Mike Tech said he's the best
though okay that's a stupid game okay if
I get the game key I will throw it in my
in my pocket in my pocket no okay but
the key
I'd play an entire day of screams in
overwatch I think we can actually what
we can do is because people like dude we
want to see we can actually live we can
actually make the camera up here so
you're like live reactions yeah actual
weren't they saying all the way no but
then we can pull but yeah so they won't
see in your cool reactions if I get the
game key I will go through it in my
pocket my pocket
entire day of screams in overwatch from
FPS lock to 10 that's pretty rough
you're when you say actually don't want
to hear that happening to anybody
yeah don't do that you would comment on
this video for Ghost Recon that's pretty
nice like thanks good like we need a we
need a good laugh commenting about your
videos for a wildlands key I'd post on
my facebook timeline that I am fari and
that I see Donald Trump as honest and
pure individual but Donald Trump is a
pure individual oh so it brought
everything on politics yeah you don't
like getting into politics I'll reenact
mr. bean gun scene for you in order to
receive the code for Ghost Recon that's
pretty good
mr. bean gun scene which they haven't
seen mr. beef ages which gun I don't
know like I don't know is that the one
where he does the fake I'd say so yeah
oh okay but he already did he post once
I think so you can search but for the
game key I'd polish your computer with
Turtle Wax so I can see your face on
your PC and review Turtle Wax at the
same time Roger yes sure he's gone he's
gone to the effort WWD undertake a fan
okay
okay guys look if if people if we're
gonna announce five winners if you guys
don't claim the keys
I might just randomly publish the keys
on Twitter and first whoever adds them
will just get yeah like cuz it's it's a
lot of time to go through like I think
maybe I just randomly waiting like
people yeah I wouldn't put the key on
Twitter okay
anything for the game code hound I'd
love to win the key and play wild ends
I'd leave this comment for that game
come on guys we gotta get originality
you got to go over there you got to go
above the call of duty give me the key
to me so I can shoot some llamas in the
wild ray okay we'll put him on the maybe
little got raising dragon right there oh
you're right yeah you guys are on the
backup list okay
I would stream you playing the game in
Mt Zhu and use sugar high should be very
funny to watch if I win the game key
Mountain Dew so sugar and juice Thai
dude I used to drink mountain journals
just like chillin KFC and now that's
what you did I'll see you like some of
that arm nowadays you got some Red Bulls
pretty crazy very little snow drink five
Red Bulls man like you know I won't
survive that yeah I would stay sub dove
course and keep suggesting your channel
since all the others seem to be going to
pot to pot I think maybe yeah I don't
know it pop means okay going to popular
I'm going to crap maybe I don't know but
yeah I mean yeah I don't comment on
other YouTube does what they can do what
they do man we're just going to do our
own thing like we help each other out
behind the scenes a lot too so other
youtubers I wish them all the best I'm
like that salty hating attitude year you
can't Linus is still growing pretty well
I'd take these for millions yeah yeah so
if I won Ghost Recon I'd probably
upgrade my netbook with fantastic
integrated graphics to get a proper PC
I'll sing about buying a Mac anyway so
I'm set man is that seems asking for
sympathy is asking for sympathy that's a
hard pass than that comment you
where was the map it does one dribble I
was think Mac hey Mac listen man no Mac
Mac yeah it's like he's sympathies like
do give me the key I'm gonna buy a Mac
and that's hard to not give him a key
like that that's a good pass on that
sorry don't mention Apple hi guys but
he's like yeah ok so I think I would
take off my clothes and run around the
tan naked for that game you're probably
winning a quote from Brian come on do
r-wave open moving off restate though
the game key I'd make a series called
surviving astray with just one CPU you
could survive a straight one CPU a rise
and CPU that's a lot of pins to Ben T
also man T key for your gives OK for a
gank oh I'd start scroll Scroll tak
draggers you have won a key that's just
cheeky yeah
I'm that's cheeky boot but I'm not salty
about other youtubers that's five
seconds like a reflex like that man
that's differently that's different this
guy owned a special place in my life
I've already told the viewers everything
so yeah comment man no come in anyway
but that's that's earning you laughed as
well you laughed I was laughing in
anticipation if your reaction yeah I'd
love to add this game to my C library
but what would you do from it I would
add any people you can't do you play
code sorry look at this comment like
don't even highlight that okay like that
there is a bar you know like there is
the bar I obviously had no intention of
getting that case yeah oh man okay so uh
what would people do for keys while the
people do we've got one more winner on
there we got one more winner okay what
would he do for a key I'd try make a
paradox first stealing the keys and then
when I win I wouldn't get any key
because I had them already bloomin how
do you yeah
I'm just like okay
I was thinking of some kind of torture
I'd put myself through for a game code
and I thought maybe watch it shake it be
wait
pretty pretty surprised I don't like
this second one of those actually
because they all know how to get a win
off you but they got to get off you two
josée not past then okay you're
fastened okay I'd sleep on the couch
just for the game key I really will
I'm dude I love sleeping on the couch
like I've slept on so many couches in my
life eh for the game code I want to I'm
going to give it to my cousin and free
him out of being miserable console
peasant but maybe gotta get him a PC as
well okay my brother is a console
peasant and he's not miserable man he's
Lala he's loving his console like that's
the thing ignorant is bliss man and
simplicity so I yeah like that's why I
don't that's why I like in the past a
lot of people been like Brian man
on the console gamers bro we've got to
do it man we're gonna go on console
gamers I'm just like as I say my brother
he's happy he's home and hoes man he's
got his controller is like what's what's
the need is simple to just leave him
alone
what's the need to on him isn't he
like he's in his own world love and his
30fps and that's up to him man it's like
I know some guys that are heavily into
PC gaming but also have a console
because they liked you to sit back and
say whatever yeah
oh yeah sort of I respect people who
play console and enjoy it I don't know
like it's it's each day I started off on
console when I was a kid yeah I think I
did as well yeah so there is love for
consoles especially retro so I think mum
was like one of the originals yeah
Mandark Homer Oh for the game code for
recon I would spill coolant all over my
face to see if it would ruin my sister
custom I video it called edition he
would spill cool and all over his face
that's pretty brutal today he hasn't got
you he hasn't got he's gotta have you on
board - it's got to be a double so I'm
waiting for that right comment okay this
one I'd walk completely naked in the
mall for a game kid and also tattoo
Steam on my left bot so those guys
getting naked forever on cuz on the
right one I already got tech city
chatter ah
oh come on no no you would have picked
that fish pic of that is like come on
the after-the-fact was pretty little
case to give away anyway now he's gonna
make you gonna pick it too
he's pretty Sergio's got a pretty that's
pretty cool comment sure yeah alright
Sergey over because we want to get we
wanna chat with peeps too so Sergio
alright there's the five winners guys we
have Sergio Creveling okay so you're
going to contact them now you're going
to now see you guys on Twitter after the
streams done so they're the five
giveaway winners for the so we got
Albert there's the list they're number
one two out so we read them out Albert
crap crow Albert crow number one
Skywalker number two number three WWE
Undertaker fan ninety-two number four
tech drags number five Sergio Creveling
so message me guys on my email just go
the about page send me an email and I'll
hook you up a game key you'll have to
you'll have to tell them to comment a
certain sentence on the video to confirm
it to them yeah yeah that's true yeah
reply to your own comment on the video
see through yeah yeah come on yeah
and then if no one if you guys don't
claim them I'm just like honestly
randomly just dropping up the keys and
whoever registers and first wins after
that because it's pretty time-consuming
hmm yeah I yeah
yeah sometimes you like make sort of
semi mistakes I guess it kind of was
some things work something time back to
the live stream awesome so we have
comments time with you guys we're just
going to chill out now we'll go to what
another six o'clock maybe so we've got
all this four o'clock Taiwan time I got
all Z timing oh yeah so that's confusing
yeah I don't care whatever so we got all
day
yeah left we've got a Corsair party I
don't I forgot what time 5:30 I think it
starts only because I wouldn't mind
having a nap too I've got to film a few
more things as well but anyway now we're
making these things up we're going to do
yep and so we are just here man this
hotel rooms really good Taipei guys
loving it here arm
I was promising a used PC but when I got
here like they used parts they would
just nothing there's no use case in
these past but there's nothing to build
a use PC here like I got that
motherboard and CPU and
things like I could have if I got that
memory with the ddr3 I could have then
only needed like a little bit more but
yes it's not going to happen because I
have to film we have to we've got a busy
schedule for Computex well I'm hoping to
actually pick up a lot of new hardware
well not a lot but things that I haven't
got you're gonna be hustling are you
right after the news flows yeah like run
after the Christmas bag filling it up I
want to get a GT 10:30 yeah that's a
I've been locally I couldn't find them
in any of the computer stores you know
them and love for weeks now I know guys
on my channel have been asking to
compare that with the rx 550 yeah got an
rx 550 about a month ago now yeah no no
1030 so I asked him I said to Nvidia can
I have a sample for a GT 1013 they're
like oh we've got none they went there I
mean like it doesn't say much like I
just buy one like if I wanted to buy one
get one so I didn't blame it at the
stores not yet in Melbourne um someone
here will be like I got one last week
better thing is okay like I I'm starting
to after especially playing a lot of
dota2 and csgo I'm starting to
appreciate the cheaper cards that even
though that price performance is nowhere
near as good as a 1060 or an IX 580 for
example yeah they still are cheaper and
they do those competitive games that
people want them to do with the frames
they want to get yeah the s550 for
example was very capable but it's a
horrible price yeah but it will go on
sale and so by providing the data and
the results when it does go on sale on
it you know it's not what is it it's $70
USI thinks the MSRP on that so if it
went down a 50 or whatever all down the
track it was even less you can about it
how it compares I like that comment boys
still still Vega from AMD man I'm gonna
be gone for a day here's the demo guys
they're gonna be like here's the demo
for Vega
why is the screen not turning on yes
like see me running out the door I've be
I wish I Brian I did a couple of pages
of my test system so I have a rise in
image and an intel image so if we come
across surprising system I'll quickly
jump dropping the benchmark drive in
there and run it as many tests like I
mean
see what happens yeah but we grabbed the
Vega card eBay I'm coming man first bit
of oh yeah guess I once for the jelly
I'm digging vidya better or yeah and
NVIDIA better hide at their hardware and
Intel when I am when I come around yeah
but I think no one's really like I think
no one's really going crazy for the iron
ions and stuff like that I think I'm
really interested in them but I'm
interested in that six core twelve
threaded mainstream yeah why I mean I'm
really interested in the price above I
you kind of know how they're going to
perform based on the specs a lot YouTube
is making some cool comments so you got
to distract them and then I'll do the
I'll do the hard work so well yeah you
do the benchmarks and then I'll just run
or just be running these mouthing yeah
so you got the Excel slides up and then
I'll just be like a screwdriver in like
subtly go get that Vega cards for you
guys a little benchmarking I'm actually
really looking forward to Vega I want to
do image quality comparison okay and
like ten different games because I think
that's something that we need an update
on because I so yeah yeah yeah just
pixel P before k2 because then we can
pixel peep hardcore like we can go real
in-depth and see what the differences
are yeah yeah so who went I will drop it
in the description when the lives
finished guys so we've got two winners
Julius and you had Christopher I think
so yeah yeah and they were the guys one
from the Philippines one from Lithuania
so really it should I've never had
giveaways from those two kind of like
winners from this yeah good can't
promise anything but hopefully any well
it probably I guess it depends on the
country hopefully no import duties and
stuff like that but IOC will probably
cover that yeah well that's what they
said okay cool yeah the other way like
dude I don't think we could afford to do
a giveaway from Australia like posting
because these guys are from Taiwan they
can post from Taiwan and this postage is
really cheap international postage I
know that they do ns I mean in Japan the
postage was pretty cheap io so you
probably have a bigger budget than
Harbor unboxing exact and they've got
business accounts with the post offices
like me I'd go down to straight post I
would get raped like just to send that
box with the monitor would be hundreds
of dollars yeah like 300 bucks like I
kid you better buy them yeah monitor
locally for the winner yeah it's that's
how bad postage is in Australian any I
tell you the same thing it's like yeah
it's brutal man so I haven't found out
about that risin PC that got sent to the
US yet from from Melbourne I don't how
much that cause okay and also yeah if
you guys do you can just post a little
video and we'll put it up on Twitter so
people can you know hopefully like yeah
hopefully the giveaway winners need the
hardware - yeah that'd be clear no cool
- because it's the best thing about
giving something away to someone if they
anyone appreciates your video of them
using it or whatever that would be
really cool yeah he'll be honest I
wanted to be a young dude as well
because when I was young I didn't have
much money and like I always wanted
better gear and better specs and like I
could never get it like I just had to
work hard and then like I'd build a
computer and they'll be obsolete and I'm
like that's it it'd be amazing it was
someone that doesn't just get their
parents yeah everything and then my
monitor was so potato like oh man was
like those crazy old resolutions like
eight something by six forty thousand
sixteen by ten weren't they the like the
two thousand something then queue LCDs
honey how many inches was that got 17 or
eight nineteen or something though those
were 1280 you know I was lower jaw it
was like 800 by 600 something wash yeah
it was he was bad man I remember I was
playing well that wasn't a CRT no LCD
I'm pretty sure was LCD or maybe no
maybe I dropped the resolution cuz my
graphics cards suck that's my Grammys
cards sucked so hard I had to drop the
resolution I think it was a 720p and I
had to drop the res because my graphics
card sucks so much at the time that I
couldn't play the latest titles or like
man's as hard yeah I remember those days
too hard life guys nowadays you guys
have budget gtx 1060 and IX 580 man they
complain well secondhand pcs like you
wouldn't even entertained buying a
second-hand PC back when we started out
because it was moving so fast yeah like
and that's I guess everyone complains
about you know the move from Sandy
Bridge to say you know even up to KB
Lake for example it has been so small
but it's opened up such a huge market
for guys to you know buy a second-hand
PC - yeah where's back I think I worked
for
six months at Kohl's part time - bill -
oh stop it yeah hold on the Reg oh dude
I was getting called the checkout guy
I just shelves yeah see packing shelves
is like the stereotypical checkout chick
dude i okay one time I had these two hot
birds walk through now I'm going to tell
your story man I'm gonna sit back there
so I was only 15 dude I was only 15 they
finished off they finished off like the
V drinks and they're like just put this
in the bend online I'll check them but
bitten like oh yeah sure just chucked in
the bin then they like they message us
and then and then within they're like
are we drunk we drunk that here I'm just
like so and like 15 I don't give a
and they were like you're so cool do you
want to come over to our house tonight
I'm just like my eyes just like lit them
like I was just like yes yes man as well
that's what the good times into man like
that was just crazy cuz yeah well I did
he get rewarded shelves together
sometimes you get rewarded for doing the
bad thing serious well no she I think
ever whatever doing the wrong thing I
don't know man
so but um yeah so back then though it
was very different
I remember I had a 16 megabyte batchi
voodoo banshee I think it was that oh
yeah it was the first AGP graphics card
and it was the original yeah AG first
one and it got one extra point and I
think it was the original 3d mark yeah
they had the original 3do one think yeah
yeah 2001 probably or something like
that or another thing here - guys I
think I booked in for an overclocking
ln2 workshop as well so I showed in the
vlog there was a one slide in there
where it was seven gigahertz he got his
7700 k-27 gigahertz so that was pretty
huge yeah and to say there's I'm like
I'm trying to figure out I was asking
like how much for you know because it'd
be so expensive to do all that wouldn't
it Ellen - and and they were telling me
the price they buy like they buy the
liquid nitrogen like 180 liters at a
time or something well that's crazy yeah
I'd like to go see it happen because
I've never never seen it so hope
you guys gonna get me on video just
pouring it and being like let's just
let's just like I'll stand back in film
you know what they do this is the thing
they take it up slowly like they're
revving it up dude I'm just going to
like this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
grab the grab the thing like port and
just like Jack the speed up yeah mega
voltage it'll be like the CPU blows off
of it is there's just tutorial yes man
doesn't know messing around with these
mental wink
let's not waste time let's get straight
tube is that's how you're overclocking
guides go isn't it yeah man get in depth
that's when we get into the dome
laughing someone was having a go at you
for stepping too high on your overclocks
or something oh he was going crazy who
was that dude in the comments I don't
know that the viewers but when I
overclocked I sort of hit it where I
think it'll work and then if it does I
sort of take another big step and it
fails you keep just notching it man
rather than just the valid point like
someone replied in my place and they
said it's that was the old-school way
when you couldn't overclock much
nowadays you've got such a high
overclock
but there's no wrong way of doing it
exactly it's just you just want to find
that sweet spot and that's how I do it
an end but so that's how I do it though
I legitimately just go Yolo yeah it
saves me time heaven benchmark crashes
so quickly if it's unstable it's like
well I think the reason why I went that
ways as you'll know now like when you
get a rise in CP or whatever you have
days to put together a comprehensive
review so you don't have half a day to
sit there going up mega hit by mega
fine-tuning everything you've just got
to sort of find roughly where it is yeah
and I go from there that's what some of
the guys watching don't understand
they're like oh yeah I got five
megahertz more on my side yeah it's like
guys like sometimes man we're cut to the
limit where we have to put out a 4k
video we have to test the product
because we're not going to be
recommending products if we can't do a
proper review I'm not going to release
it I'm not giving people advice that's
bad yeah so it's like sometimes we don't
have more than only a couple days to
brand review a brand new product well
and it's crazy
this videos nuts like it's a lot harder
than written some of the guys know
watching you know I've written for
techspot for over a decade now and I've
only been doing the YouTube videos for
about six months so you're natural do
SOI on camera like this is this makes
sense Matt was just that Matt was just
the new presenter you're the guy making
the scripts doing the benchmarking well
thanks but I feel like I've gotten
better than when I started a lot better
I went back and watched a couple of the
earlier ones and yeah is like great
melis i'm like i watch the hardware
unbox video guys hit that like button
straight on it's like I like that I'm a
simple man I miss Ben yeah basically
Jack I'm a simple man a hijack hotel
rooms hug Nvidia walls and love rise and
CPUs okay yeah that's the thing I'm
loving that this is another thing right
do you guys remember back when 2005 AMD
was on top right before the core duo
came out Core 2 Duo
Radford came out like for me an AMD cpu
and a Nvidia graphics card was the
perfect combo here was the combo and
here killing on the CPU front and it was
the combo and it feels like it now is
kind of the combo again like Intel's in
a much stronger position obviously AMD
is alone coming back but I've always had
a soft spot for that combo that AMD CPU
and that Nvidia graphics card I don't
know it's been always it's been a good
combo I've always loved it I just like
whoever's giving us new projects values
yeah of course who wouldn't like to
so anyway comments guys we got you can
ask questions anything you want to ask
will answer so I'm kind of running out
of topics on my mind that microphone is
actually so I tested this microphone
it's a it's a random used microphone it
was it's called a vocal Pro yeah like
there was a sticker on it like an audio
someone rebadged it trying to make it
their own brand and it actually sounds
really good on the g7 so I'm happy about
that like I put it on the other camera
and it sounded terrible
which camera the vlog cam yeah and so I
put it on the g7 it sounds really good
so I was like thank God I didn't want to
go and buy another microphone today so
you're not using you're pimping gold one
but like I knew I forgot something I was
like right before add to catch like a
midnight floor
and I had to hustle because I got the
people were like dude Windows 10
optimization guide you guys just didn't
shut up about it like guys messaging me
on Facebook like where's the
optimization ten dude need it right now
and because that's the thing I get a lot
of people comment about like you know
removing this doing that doing a regedit
hack it's like I like to just keep it
simple don't like it because if people
have problems they can then go back and
undo things that I've done if they have
problems and that's the basis of the
optimization guide and it does it does
help with performance you know I did
this on a patron livestream and I got an
extra 1% performance on my high end
desktop okay one percent on high end so
imagine what it would do on low end so
yeah yeah yeah someone said Steve have
you got a spare 1080 and do you want to
trade it for a steak dinner yes I wanna
trade it for steak dinner iron steak
yeah it's got to be like what's the best
steak you can get Wagyu beef is it y
guythur yeah yeah we'll talk about that
more later Steve's on GTX de nadie dude
I wait yeah
tez DJ's kitchen ygg log it was good oh
thanks man thanks guys
so comments comments bring him in bring
him in love it so we've got yeah we're
gonna be popping out soon I went down
grade to the creators update I'm with
you yes so that's the thing when I first
updated I had lots of problems I figured
the only way to properly do this is to
root so soon as you updated creators
update you've got to reset your PC and
break all the links and everything
you've got to Bri set it that's the only
way well and then really you're saying
there's no upgrade option like there is
an upgrade option but I've had problems
you've had upgrading so you've got
upgrade and then there's the option to
reset your PC and that's no point then
you must download and up-to-date ISO and
that would be even better wouldn't it
and start yeah but like it's sort of I
don't have the patience to make a whole
USB boot drive and then like it's a
tedious process it is to 6 hours hours
you know as all application does that
like 5 minutes now you got to I'll take
I'll do a video for you on it
but yeah I I tried it on too so I went
to my test system first and thought I'll
try it out because I was going to beat
this guy to an optimization guide but
Windows CE creators yeah but it was so
bad I didn't even want to deal with it
oh so a lot of the games that I
benchmark with for crashes okay remember
I remember I tried that really early on
okay we'll use my optimization guide I'm
going to have to do the better I'll have
to study it what I am home yawning and
then I did on my personal rig and I
started on a cold boot knit with blue
screen don't have to restart loading yes
creators update on my benchmark system
when I first updated it would crash out
my overclocks like completely reset them
now does a Windows Update we must be
connecting with your bias that's Buddha
magic yeah her code
that's voodoo magic man like I was
scared I was like never seen this before
like the windows update was crashing my
overclocked my system wasn't overclocked
it was my 69 50x editing rig and then
premiere just kept crashing and then
when I when I drag in video and stuff
sometimes it was just weird so I rolled
back and as soon as I rolled back
because that process only takes about
two minutes yeah I rolled back and
everything was perfect again so at least
that was good I thought I'd have to do
like a fresh install the rollback was
good actually yeah and it rolls back so
quickly it's like two minutes like roll
by yep done like okay what happened with
this yeah that was scary man when it
started crashing the overclocks - but i
found with game mode it legitimately
helped the biggest game was GTA 5 for me
so I tested on this laptop here this is
sorry guys I was right it's not it's I
guess you call it semi potato because it
is kind of old and I did trade it so I
did hustle for it so it didn't cost a
whole lot but this laptop is doing
really well I thought it couldn't do a
4k video and it did I was like shocked
so because that was a 10 minute vlog the
Computex videos be like 4 or 5 minutes
it's definitely going to do Computex
videos which is really well so online
shameless plug ms:i oh there we go
oh yeah go I'm good man plug it MSI
laptop by msi laptops probably gonna be
5 next levels guys that's the next level
set I look I'm gonna be honest I like
this laptop they showed again it's not
it's the one with a single power brick
yeah it's oh yeah the papel brick is
is about as thick as the laptop this
it's conventional I like it yes
conventional one I'm using now it's
conventional laptop yeah 14 inch laptop
it's got a core i7 it's got a GTX 1060
and a and it's I did a video on my
channel encoded like for video encoding
it's funny because I had no idea how
this would go because like I said I use
a 69 50 X rig at home so an Intel I do
use Intel for my personal ok
I'm using risin to make a statement I
promised my viewers I would so so you're
giving me a hard time about horizon and
you're using rise and I'm using Intel
wait to say that again I'm I'm not
giving you a hard time about rising I'll
give you a hard time I gotta tell ya
that rosen's I'm loving the rising
content actually like I was about to
call these channel rise and unboxed with
the amount of rising videos is putting
out and of course you did like a lot of
those videos you did I would have want
to do it Dunham at one stage yeah I'm
just not as good as you have
benchmarking so guys oh yeah I'm kind of
like what do I do here I'm scratching my
head like damn what do I do for content
Steve's already nailing everything on
rival I was just yeah doing like
basically most of it was like mrs.
hunter officer what guys were asking me
to test so you know stuff like the
memory and the boys take care of the
boys yeah let's take care of the boys
that's what the comment section yeah you
learn a lot yeah well that's the thing
guys upvote the comments like if you
think that's a cool idea and someone
puts a cool idea in there upload it all
the time and then because you see that
and usually if it's 10 up votes or more
I'll take it into consideration because
means people really want to do that that
was like that video I did with the 1600
by the 1600 or the 1600 X which year I
pretty much ever run the chats going to
know the answers okay someone did raise
in the when I tested game-mode on
because I ended up recommending leaving
game mode on I found it helped on the
laptop now I would love if it's not too
much time for you to have things open
like not editing of like doesn't think
people like edit a video while your game
I never added a video when I came is I
always see guys with those kind of
saying of it I'd get the 1700 over the
1600 we're talking rise and processes
again because those two extra cores mean
while you're editing a video you can be
using After Effects or doing something
else I'm like
it doesn't really like when you render a
video it really hugs all the system
resources that you can still browse the
instant you can watch YouTube and do
likewise but you do something else
really taxing it's going to use a lot of
memory bandwidth and it just it doesn't
work yeah but the guys rendering a video
when you're gaming I I know I have tried
it before we don't even I'm 32 Eva not
the only one that did it okay was the 32
core like the 16 core Z on the June
Acron I've like said my editing rig is a
69 50 X that's 10 core 20 thread I have
a hundred and twenty eight gigabytes of
ddr4 memory a pair of m dot 2 960 Pro
SSDs my point is that it's still read
like a the game still around like a GTX
today it's generator kill you render a
video on that you do and I wouldn't even
entertain playing down it's not going to
work
yeah but anything else that's it you've
got the guys then you've got the guys
who ask for you to stream games while
you're editing a video and rendering it
it's not let's do it like it now the
solution for that is to get two
computers get yourself an Intel system
and an AMD system have the best of both
worlds both was very nice
oh that's a good fire and a so you can
edit on the Intel and render on the baby
because no remember I did it's here to
PAX East there was the they had two
systems on one case and that was what
they had way back in the day Thermaltake
did a standard ATX on one side in a mini
ITX and other actually did that was
really cool
I was cool thing is that's actually a
good idea for a build fire and ice and
you got a water-cooled like blue on one
side red on the other oh man that would
be cool actually
oh man who's gonna do it like I'll try
and do it when I get some free time one
of these days yeah so maybe at Computex
will walk around the showroom floor and
find a case that allows you to do just
that maybe
yeah well hunt phone there will be yeah
there will be I mean doing out like
you've even make your own cake you
always find a lot of interesting things
so I'm excited to get into it tomorrow
well yeah it's gonna be awesome I mean
it's gonna be busy but it's really gonna
be cool complexes like Comi takes is the
shizzle
like well it's it's huge there's three
big holes is one massive hole which is
hole one yeah and we Brian and I stuck
in there today yeah we got in there and
now it's just a construction zone
there's just stuff everywhere
but we walked around how to be able look
and we saw a gigabytes booth going to go
that's pretty huge yeah and yeah so so
yeah with the game mode play music in
the background have Skype video
conversation not done on video or maybe
just a talking music and bit more music
acting at all that's the thing you won't
notice it's a reduction in performance
on a decent computer okay well I might
go back and test it on the laptop
because I do yeah just do a quick test
like same three games they're both
they're all pretty CPU intensive when
you set them to be CPU intensive so I'll
probably read that redo that but even
then I recommended game mode on because
it was pretty good like I thought it was
that's a repeatable test arm I thought
it was then I looked at all the
individual frame times all of them not
point 1% 1% lows like that would have
probably have skewed the anniversary
update to be the bests yeah because I
looked at all the frame times between
them so looking at every single frame
time you can see the the game mode on
was tight and that means smooth when you
look at frame time so if you just see
this if you go to real the left
indicators on the graphs if they're
really low narrow and then that line is
really tight it means that game is just
butter coming out any mana monitor so
yeah frame times are just they're tricky
thing it does take a while to do like
full-on like every single frame analysis
but it's worth it in the end you get a
bigger picture but at the same time
that's why I like just minimum and
average FPS especially on GPU GPU can
have I mean this so touchy kottdeer
touchy subject there's so much
misinformation there and stuff as well
and frame times are good for sure I
don't really want to get into it
basically a lot of I say minimums are
useless and guys were saying that I
think don't I don't want to be rude or
anything but I don't think they quite
understand or it depends outs testers
see my results are all out I say this in
my videos but guys seem to ignore it is
that it's all based on an average of
three runs so if I've done a GTA 5 past
I don't just do a 60 second pass record
the result and put it in a graph because
that is almost always going to lead to
an inconsistent result so you run it
often especially a game like GTA 5 that
gives you add results I'll run
once and I kind of that's a cached cash
benchmark yeah and I'll run it three
more times and then I take the average
of the average frame rate and the
average of the minimum frame rate yeah
and guys think that's like the absolute
minimum
so frame time like the 1% will always be
the 1% can only be at best the same as
the minimum yeah otherwise it'll be
better and the point one's obviously
going to be lower the 1% wait yeah that
makes sense
yes the the 0.1% is I mean it's not all
basically the point one percent can take
it from different seconds to the one
point just it's just yeah it's the more
extreme minimum that's all yeah it
essentially it's yeah and then they kept
converting it to an FPS figure but
minimum is just like it's always been a
solid indicator well it's it's minimum
frames per second and then the point one
and one percent is converted to the
transfer second metric yes it's from
frame time it's from milliseconds
converted and the thing with the thing
is I just in the past I've always found
if you've got a properly tuned rig which
is what a benchmark eschewed have yeah
the minimum should generally be close to
those frame dips and if they're not then
the games usually crap yeah like I mean
you know you could say that I'd only
even on an average of three runs guys
who say you know I only hit that minimum
once so it's not valid but it's like
well but the frame time doesn't do
anything different yeah say it's a bit
it's a bit confusing I think it's just
how guys interpreters at the end of day
it's like you can do what you want
eventually eventually I'll probably move
to the frame time for the minimum and go
for the one percent because it's very
similar to the minimum frame rate anyway
for the most part I just I mean simple
for the viewers especially I especially
the casuals guys are like look this is a
gtx 1060 or an RX 580
it's performing like this that's pretty
cool I'm gonna go buy it and then you
start putting like 1% lows my point this
guy's gonna be like what what is this
well that's it I would I would have
probably done what Steve from gamers
Nexus has done tilt to stabilizer point
zero zero zero zero zero one percent low
we could actually do that let's that's
the lowest frame yet the works like we
could manage we could go through the
whole graphed
and that's what I might start doing
remember I told you I was like let's
just look at the worst frame like forget
about the point one percent in one sense
let's just get the worst frame that was
recorded the gap between that but that
doesn't put it into a net yeah so for
the guys that are certain the frame
within the center so there's just
completely pointless and stupid yeah so
but yeah I mean you could get extremely
low on everything basically you good
yeah I mean if I suppose was the average
of three again
Dahmer John billion all-time low low low
low low low low low low tax check senior
that's okay yeah like you were saying
the reason why I haven't gone with the
game is Nexus approach which mind you I
was testing the 0.1 percent and 1
percent well before I became a youtuber
so we're doing that on you know that
became important with multi GPUs quite a
while ago and we did it then but for
single GPUs it just wasn't that once
they fix the drivers up and that all
blew over years ago for single GPUs it
wasn't really that important and
crossfire and SLI is kind of like I've
known across fairness I tell every
viewer just stay away from it if you've
got money to burn and you want to play
around with it but if you're trying to
build your piece sitting at the most
bang for your buck a good value system
don't even think about SLI across fine
they both suck equally yeah so there's
like as much as the other yeah I would
say ones yeah guys are sli scales better
or crossfire scales better it's like
well it depends on the game and most
games don't offer great support these
days yeah so I did have we did a poll
wait do you want I was funny man in
between that wedge or that's what it's
what framed you're getting into it this
is good like people want to see Steve
get into it on a live man see you could
just stay was telling me he hadn't done
much live like you haven't done a model
see this is so much better talking to
you sitting in sobriety because guys
don't I sound like and Kevin will
experience this as well like you've got
nothing to go on it it's delayed so
Jeff's got his punch line he's got the
you know it is well yeah that's
interesting it is interesting though
well no is it as interesting as if it
was interesting as as interesting as
what's keV
well we're gonna have to get Kevin you
answer that okay keV where are you Bambi
and eyes totally sitting next you it's
totally different than when
you stream from your webcam and it's a
lot easier to interact and chat with you
and you feel the energy oh yeah feel the
energy yeah yeah like a punch Prime when
he gets out of line yeah even though
like we're gonna do an arm wrestle one
day we can't do it now
I find I think this is a minute we don't
need to do that this is a mess no one
wants to say that no one wants to sit do
you want to see you guys go in the
comments do you want to say it man Steve
arm wrestle one day anyway this is we
can do he is like oh yeah we gotta like
gear setup bit you've really moved the
camera over there and like do it on your
rock at mobile desk sounds like the only
thing in my eyes you're paying for
mechanical switches we'll put under the
tests dishwasher unbox it stop with the
dishwasher stop the dishwashers are
people going crazy on dishwashers so
yeah right they give away winners we ran
out so we'll quickly go over the end of
the line for the people because we're
going to shut down the stream students
we got to get ready to go to weak pate
and then tomorrow guys Computex coverage
coming out there'll be the vaguer
announcement - I'm pretty sure pretty
sure there's AMD event tomorrow better
be and then we've also got some really
cool stuff there's apparently a lot of
cool products coming out at Computex and
that's the thing Computex is like the
event where a lot of the companies
release their new products there'll be a
lot of stuff announced yet is even an
RGB chair like no crap legit RGB chair
coming I'm doing a video on it all right
so there's an RGB chair coming guys
like legit my who would it like and the
other thing is I actually looks good
yeah I saw I can't say I'm surprised if
they I was thinking to myself if they
had to do an RGB chair they actually did
it okay like I looked at it it's subtle
it's not like bling-bling it's actually
like the sad thing though 2017 and I can
honestly say I'm not surprised we have
an RGB chair yeah and that Brian's
reviewing it I'm not reviewing I'm just
covering it like so I'll be having a
look at lined up reviewing it okay yeah
probably will okay so we'll go back to
the giveaway winners just lastly we'll
show them we had will drop out I think
we can just go like this we go a little
here and we got the giveaway when it's
here Julius Barn askus from Republic of
Lithuania
and Christopher del Rosario from the
Philippines congratulations guys
they're the two giveaway when it's for
the monitors and also go on the comments
if you guys want requests for videos and
stuff yeah like your videos to write
requests yeah up votes on watch my Tommy
takes videos watch mine first shows more
of you in my videos and there isn't me
at the moment you went crazy like in the
roasting on the the other one yeah I
roast Brian good in my first video oh
that's good man I got to get you back
right when it when I get him back he's
going to be able to take a day was like
so that's the thing like sometimes you
go on my comments section I'll shut you
down so hard I'll do okay I'll be back
anyway guys we love you thanks for
tuning in absolutely amazing Taiwan is
really cool like I'm loving this place I
was like wow this is really one of the
coolest Asian cities to go to if not one
of the coolest places in the world to go
to can highly recommend I've been just
loving this place since I've been here
for only a few days it's really good
street food is phenomenal the tech of
course you've got the tech here
computations gonna be really good I mean
mind you I've heard the weather has been
pretty good like usually it's a lot
hotter and I'm thankful that as the
weather's actually nice at the moment
I'm really liking that so that was
really good wasn't too human at all so
yeah I heard like last year was
apparently like 40 something like wow
like no thank you but this is really
good place the event air-conditioned
though so anyway guys you guys thank you
so much for tuning and congratulations
to the giveaway winners and also we'll
be giving you guys a lot more Computex
coverage and you got any closing
statements mr. hardware unnhhh is 'old
know thanks for watching see you guys
next time alright guys peace out for now
you like that in your hardware on dude
I've been meaning to say that on a live
and all without a video hardware I'm
nestled all right see you guys peace out
