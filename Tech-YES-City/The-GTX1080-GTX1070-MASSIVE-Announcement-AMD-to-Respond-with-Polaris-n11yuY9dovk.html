and my reaction was something like this
oh I'll take that welcome back to tokyo
city this is bryan coming to you guys
today with a quick update on the gtx
1070 in 1080 which were announced from
invidious CEO jensen wang today with the
gtx 1080 rumored to come in at 599 USD
and is supposedly coming out on May the
27th now this card will feature 2560
cuda cores and also up to 9 teraflops of
compu performance and also have the new
gddr5 x memory there and you'll get 8
gigabytes of that over 256 bit wide bit
bus but one of the most impressive feats
of this generation coming is the clock
speeds I mean compared to a gtx 980 I
think we've got one point two gigahertz
on that from the get-go this time around
we're going to get one point seven three
three gigahertz which is a phenomenally
increase in clock speeds over the
previous generation they've also got the
founders edition which costs a little
bit extra but is reported to be a binge
chip and at the event they supposedly
had one of these GTX today's running at
2.1 gigahertz on freaking air that's
right to point 1 gigahertz on air
imagine what some people will be able to
do with liquid nitrogen now the youngest
sister car the gtx 1070 which i
personally have my eyes on it is going
to be my favorite mid-range or even if
you'd call it a mid-range card is coming
in at three hundred and seventy nine
dollars now this is going to have a
gigabytes of vram as well though will it
actually have it since the gtx 970 had
kind of a gimp thing going on there we
will find out when this is being
released as it's supposed to have 2048
cuda cores but there's no definite word
on that yet it'll support up to 6.5
teraflops of comput performance which
would actually mean that it would come
slightly clocked in lower than gtx 1080
speeds however one thing to keep note of
it does have the gddr5 and not the 5x so
this could be a reason why it's not
getting the compute figures that the gtx
1080 will be getting though I wouldn't
worry too much about the computer
performance configures as will get these
cards and we'll be testing them in games
and seeing how they run and that's where
the real value will come
when we get the final benchmark numbers
though Nvidia have released their own
benchmark figures which kind of should
be taken with a grain of salt in my
opinion though we can see that the gtx
1080 is scoring a massive lead over the
980 there by around about seventy to
eighty percent in two games tomb raider
on dx12 and also which are three the
Wild Hunt which would suggest that this
card actually does support asynchronous
compute at the low level side there
another thing touted from Nvidia is the
VR performance which is supposed to have
two times the performance of a Titan X
so this spells huge news for the vr
gaming community and I'm sure one of
these cars will be invaluable to those
people who want a game on VR headsets
but what about AMD and their answer to
this well they're actually going to be
moving down to 14 nanometer with their
Polaris architecture and if the 16
nanometer is this good then it actually
remains to be seen that the 40 nanometer
should be either just as good or if not
better and if we look at the raw
architectural improvements of pascal
over max well actually how much are we
getting in terms of raw low-level
efficiency there I mean we're getting
the 16 nanometer dropped we're getting
the higher clock speeds there are also
when we compare a 980 to a 1080 we're
also getting twenty-five percent more
cuda cores so essentially we are getting
maybe a ten to twenty percent increase
in efficiency going by Nvidia's
benchmarks themselves which yeah as I
said before she'll be taken with a grain
of salt so this would mean to me that
AMD still have a great fighting chance
to come in with their Polaris
architecture and all eyes are on AMD to
perform as well as in video this year
Nova means one thing for the enthusiast
tech community that is that 2016 is
going to be an absolutely kick-ass here
for PC gaming so anyway guys if you have
any questions or comments about today's
announcement or about this video or
anything you want to add and be sure to
drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can and if you haven't already
subscribe to tech yes city and I'll
catch you in the next video peace out
for now bye what would you get a 1080
men get yourself 1070 / save yourself
220 dolls Nvidia fanboys be like Mandy
what you got for me AMD Fabolous be like
14 nanometer baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
