2016 and this is going to be a six
hundred dollar bill for you guys
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
month of january 2016 now this month we
have a 600 dollar USD gaming PC now I
will also take care of people in Oz and
the UK so links are below for those two
countries and also the Amazon links for
the US so let's get on with the build
this is going to be a mid-range gaming
PC with a focus on all decent parts
so first up here we have the i3 6100
from Intel this is a hundred and thirty
dollars and it's got four threads
it's the latest skylake architecture and
it's also clocked in at 3.7 gigahertz
not to mention it comes with a stock
heatsink fan so you don't have to spend
any additional cost on a heat sink fan
so for the motherboard we're going with
the asrock eh 110 you get two slots of
ddr4 there it's a micro ATX board and in
the past I know that asrock give you
great value for money when it comes to
motherboards so for the memory we're
going with one stick of a gigabytes of
ddr4 memory from crucial this comes in
around $42 now the reason we're going
one stick of eight gigabytes is just to
give you a bit of future upgrade ability
there and to give you a better path if
you wish to upgrade in the future you
can use that even on this same
motherboard or if you're taking it to
another motherboard it's always good to
have eight gigabytes instead of just one
four gigabyte stick now for hard drives
and SSDs I decided to change it up a
little bit especially since SSDs are
just so cheap at the moment so for the
SSD we're going with a Santis Ultra here
480 gigabytes of SSD storage they're all
for 130 dollars this is a really good
bargain considering SSDs are gonna make
a world with a difference especially
compared to hard disk drives and since
you've got 400 80 gigabytes there you'll
have a lot of room for games and whatnot
so if you do find yourself needing extra
room you can always get a hard drive
especially if you are loading on a lot
of those latest titles like GTA 5 and
fallout 4 now we move on to the most
important part of the build choosing a
graphics card and lately I've been
recommending both sides from team green
and team red and so for the team red
option we're going to go with the online
380 from XFX this is comes in at a
hundred and $80
and it's a really good card for 1080p
gaming especially for the money not to
mention it's got an aftermarket cool
there it'll keep your card cool and
quiet now for the nvidia option we don't
the gtx 960 here from ZOTAC this also
comes in at $180 and you get two
gigabytes of gddr5 memory as well just
like the r9 380 now over this will do a
great job just like the r9 380 but
playing games at 1080p which is where
both the sweet spots of these cards lie
now for the case we're going with a
Roseville FBM 0 1 micro ATX case I
looked at this case and it looks like it
will have all the room you need since
all were doing is putting in micro ATX
motherboard in there a graphics card CPU
and an SSD and a power supply and it's
also got two fans in there to boot so it
should give you a decent amount of
airflow and the best thing about this
case is it's only 28 dollars last
component of today's build is the power
supply and we're going with the EVGA 500
watt power supply here for $40 a
reliably price and also a reliable power
supply now I wouldn't really go any
cheaper than this unless you can get a
really good deal on a solid name to
brand power supply however just make
sure you keep away from those really
cheap power supplies that I just
considered junk and they'd use a small W
instead of a big W which means that
they're not a true 500 watt power play
this on the other hand is a true 500
watt power play and will do a good job
of powering your i3 and your graphics
card and it will do a great job for
hopefully a long time so that leaves the
total price of the bill to around about
$600 and I put the links in the
description below so if you click on
them I also get a small kickback as well
each time you use one of those links
which helps me to keep creating content
for you guys for free so anyway guys
that's about it I've also put the links
as I said before for the PC part pick up
in Australia and the UK in the
description below so check them out if
you are in US or the UK anyway guys if
you like this build then please give it
a big thumbs up if you have any
questions or comments about this build
