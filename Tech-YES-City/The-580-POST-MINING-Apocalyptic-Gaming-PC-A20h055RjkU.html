selling out practically Hardware
everywhere people are complaining that
they can't build a PC however today I
have a solution for you guys to get you
through the apocalypse welcome back to
tech yet city this is your yes-man Brian
come with you guys today with the PC
that features a four core 1500 X rise in
CPU you currently get this for a hundred
and ninety us it also includes a Wraith
spire cooler really good value for money
also has eight threads as well and it
does a really good job in multiplayer
titles at least of four titles that I
tested here today this CPU performed
really well it also overclocked pretty
well out of the box to three point eight
five gigahertz with the stock cooler and
also for the grams card we're using the
gtx 750ti from gal axis is pretty
aggressively overclocked out of the
factory and does a really good job in
title scoring an 8000 graphics core and
3d Micra fire strike even though it is
behind a gtx 1060 they're currently sold
out at the moment
so the 1050 Ti is pretty much the best
choice to get you guys through this
current apocalypse of graphics cards
selling out although if the temperature
ta stocks do get low then you can get an
rx 560 as well these through gravis
cards aren't really popular for mining
because they have a lot less powerful
mining than say a gtx 1060 or a gtx 1070
and of course the RX 517 RX 580 but when
it came to gains the 1050 TI performed
really well surprised that the figures
were getting over 60 FPS on high
settings with pub g that players
unknowns battlegrounds really popular
title at the moment and then we had
overwatch this thing was going over a
hundred FPS on high settings of pretty
much all times the performance was
really smooth nothing bad to report here
and also for csgo we were getting over
200 FPS on a combo of high-end low
settings at 1080p and then for the last
title we had dota 2 again 1080p high
settings this thing with scoring over
150 frames per second a lot of the time
really exposed experience on all four
games so if you're into competitive
multiplayer titles this PC here today
we'll perform really good now I did tell
me up all the parts it did come in at
around 580 dollars u.s. then you can if
you are on a budget swap out the CPU and
motherboard for something cheaper say AG
45 60 and a b250 motherboard if you are
on a budget
however on that note going with the be
350 combo in my opinion does give you
better upgrade ability you can swap that
fork or over in the future for say an 8
core and then you'll have also the
option to get a better cooler and you'll
have a lot more power at your disposal
not to mention you can upgrade the
memory and speaking of the memory give
you our four prices through sync you
have come down
I found a 4 gigabyte stick of ddr4
memory for $25 at the moment even though
I use some g.skill to 133 megahertz
memory the crucial stuff will do
absolutely fine get two sticks and then
you'll have a gigabytes of memory and
then couple that with a budget power
supply like the EVGA for $40 and you'll
be rocking pretty hard now for the case
I did use the BitFenix Neal this is the
white and red version goes for around
about $50 comes included with two fans
and you also get the transparent side
window I was really impressed with the
cosmetics but not only that the
performance was really good too the
included two fans did a good job of
staying quiet and also keeping the rig
cool at all times the one thing I will
point out in regards to this case is
that it didn't have a tough time at all
cooling the gear since we're only using
a 1050 Ti and a rising fork or how
consumption was actually really low even
when overclocked I was getting pretty
low power drawer figures that was still
coming under 200 watts that's really
good performance for something like this
PC though the last pots in this build
were the storage I used a 1 terabyte
Seagate these go for around 50 USD or if
you're in Australia around about 65
Australian dollars really good value for
money how if you do have a little bit of
extra money you can get the 2 terabyte
version which is only a few dollars more
and does give you double the storage
though whether you need that as a gamer
is up to you I think one terabyte is
plenty enough for a lot of the titles
that you'll be playing and of course a
lot of people mentioned in my previous
build then I did not include an SSD so
today we're going with a 128 gigabyte
SSD from Kingston these will make a big
difference in terms of
general usage and also your boot times
for your OS and of course you can
install the games that you play a lot
say for instance if you play overwatch
every day and stall that on your SSD and
then you'll have faster boot times on
not only the game but also the maps
themselves and we go today's PC is
pretty much a recommendation for those
who really want to get into PC gaming
and just can't see themselves spending
exorbitant amounts of money for a gtx
1070 1080 or 1080i or an RX 570 or 580
so only like this will get you through
at 1080p high settings with a really
good and smooth experience and it won't
send you broke and also before I get on
out of here another great thing or
actually another two good things about
today's build was that it was extremely
quick to set up as one of the fastest
build I've done in the history of the
channel the case was really easy to work
with and also on that note that
overclocks if you guys aren't into
overclocking then today's build will do
really well when I overclocked I only
really managed to get an extra five
percent roughly performance out of this
thing so the CPU out of the box comes
clocked at 3.6 gigahertz and only
managed to get it to three point eight
five gigahertz and then on the graphics
card that comes out at about two
gigahertz on the cores and I only
managed to get that to 2.1 gigahertz so
effectively in gaming only got an extra
five percent performance so overclocking
wasn't a huge deal on today's build
anyone guys if you enjoyed today's video
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comments section below
what parts or PC build would you go with
in this current generation of selling
out graphics cards and cryptocurrency
apocalypse love hearing your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
