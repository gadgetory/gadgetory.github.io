here for the second time and i have in
front of me a very interesting cooler
this is a thermo electric type known as
the Peltier effect
it essentially separates two different
metals and one gives a cooling effect
which you can see here with a
thermal-imaging camera and I'll pull
that up for you where it cools down the
liquid below ambient temperatures so
essentially what this means is that it
will give you a better overclock then
you're otherwise used to it now cool
must also tell me that they're improving
the base plate on there all in one
colors as well so what you're gonna get
with the thermoelectric cooler is a
double whammy so you're getting a better
base plate you're also getting colder
than ambient temperatures and then on
the other cool you can see with the
thermal-imaging camera the heat effect
where one of the plates is sucking the
heat externally out of the all-in-one
device so very interesting concept
coming in at $299 and slated for a
quarter for release so it is a little
bit expensive but something like this is
also very quiet too so it looks like
it's a great implementation of a cooler
can't wait till this hits the wild but
let's see what else is at the cooler
master booth
mm 18s Computex coverage wouldn't be
possible without gigabyte or Corsair
bringing you the quality and also the
reliability that you need when building
a new PC welcome back to jackass City
and here we have some new keyboards
hitting the market from coolermaster
first up is the MK 850 this has 8 keys
that are actually analog Stalin now what
an analogue key switch is essentially is
how much you push it down will be how
much it responds in-game so if you just
want to walk in a game like csgo for
example push it down a little bit if you
want to run push it down the full way
that's slated to come in at around 230
USD in quarter for towards the end of
the year besides that is little brother
the 10 keyless option however that won't
have the analog key switches but one
thing about both these keyboards that I
really love is that they've got a really
nice wrist rest is soft it's got the
nice PVC leather on top and really when
it comes down to it I've always
recommended most people go out and buy
their own wrist rest but this one if
you're typing on it you won't need to go
out and buy a separate wrist rest it's
an awesome option that's included from
the get-go and it also matches the
aesthetic of the keyboard so besides the
Mk Series we've got now linear switches
on a new CK series as well low profile
Cherry MX red switches throughout all
these five keyboards the pricing of the
MK 730 is still to be confirmed as well
as the CK series here the 620 which is a
mini sized keyboard the CK 630 which is
10 kilos and above that the CK 640 which
is a full size keyboard and there's
three new low-profile keyboards RGB
controllable type-c connectors on all
five of these that i've featured just
here but on the CK series they do plan
to implement a Bluetooth version as well
so wireless with that low profile they
are really innovating in not just cases
and not just coolers but now keyboards
as well and then lots of the new
products here are some new fans hitting
the market from Coolermaster master fan
mf1 22 40s now the design concept here
is that there including a plate to help
lower vibrations and of course in turn
make things quieter 24 LEDs in the
single 52 LEDs RGB of course addressable
on the Joule PACs are coming in at 29
and 39 dollars they do aim to
have a pretty nice price as well as
having that aesthetic to go with that
awesome feature set so that about wraps
it up for day 3 of Computex here at tech
yes City and cooler master my voice is
still gone
hopefully day four we might be able to
get rid of it and might be gone for good
who knows but if you enjoyed this one
then be sure to hit that like button and
let us know in the comments section
below
what was your favorite product in
today's video I think that
thermoelectric cooler is so cool it just
oh pun intended - it's so cool but
anyway I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
