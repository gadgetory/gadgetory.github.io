bright is he coming back to you guys
with the old intro and the new intro so
let's hit it
so what did you guys think that took me
actually quite a quite a bit of time to
make I had to learn after effects and
I've got an intro comment ultra coming
as well so stay tuned for that now also
this is going to be Tech Talk episode 23
where I'm pretty much playing catch-up
because I've been away from the tech
world and I've been delving into the
audio world for the last few months I
have finished all my research I have
come to my conclusions and results and
I'm going to be producing those videos
in due time I just need time to make
those videos but in the meantime I'm
going to be refreshing myself with all
the tap top tech topics out there I also
want you guys in the comments to let me
know what you want me to talk about in
the next tech talk as well and i'll be
getting onto that but let's give my
thoughts and opinions i asked got asked
about Titan Z and what do I think about
Titan Z and first of all i'm going to
say like it's a bit of a mixed bag here
right three thousand dollars is
ridiculously expensive for a graphics
card however in invidious defense they
did not market this card as a gaming
graphics card they might they might even
marketed as a like a scientific compute
and they I think essentially the main
deal was the floating-point 64
performance and that if you put three of
these together in sli you'll have as
much compute power as Google brain I
think that was the whole deal behind
this I mean these cards aren't
marketed towards gamers if they were
marketed towards gamers then I'd be
pissed off as well but essentially this
product isn't marketed towards gamers I
mean essentially a gamer with more money
than sense is going to pick one of these
I can go yeah I've got three thousand
dollars who cares i think nvidia
obviously want to have that option
available to people but in essence we
got to look at what actual good is
coming out of in video they have given
the go ahead for the gtx 780 6 gigabyte
editions so if you guys honestly want to
get the best value for K gaming setup
then I think your answer lies with 209
to 90 s in sli or two gtx 780 s6
gigabyte editions in sli these things
are six hundred dollars you put two of
these together I'll repeat that you put
two of these together for twelve hundred
dollars you'll have a faster solution
than a titan z you're thinking why is
that they got way more criticals it's
about the clock speeds these will be
able to go up to twelve hundred
megahertz let's look at the titan
it's about 700 megahertz so essentially
that means you can have a card two cards
in sli that are running a lot faster
than the dual GPU tight and Z and this
is going to give you better fps in games
so if you guys want that better solution
you want that ultimate gaming setup than
two gtx 780 six gigabyte additions on 4k
that's my recommendation that's this
from nvidia this is from their own
company so that just goes to show that
the titans he really isn't the game√≠s
choice so start achill we're going to go
on to now is basically the whole intel
AMD deceptive sing and i got asked when
i did a video on the big three in the
past i said they're all been guilty of
deception and someone asked housing tell
been guilty of deception and today i'm
going to cover how intel's been guilty
of deception basically it has to do with
the whole deal it in fiasco and the junk
thermal paste that they used on Haswell
and Ivy Bridge and now basically those
this big write-up and a lot of people
always sent me here my dear leading
video like Brian it's the distance
between the chip and the dye it's not
the actual thermal paste and I mean an
antec posted up an article here in
defensive Intel and I mean I honestly I
knew it was full of when I had
deleted my chip put some new thermal
paste on there and I got differences of
seven or eight degrees and before I did
that I had clamped down that CPU so damn
hard that if I had clamped it down any
harder I would have bent pins on my
motherboard so that's how I knew the
distance thing was a load of crap but
here we go here until right they're
admitting it right here that the thermal
paste was junk and improved thermal
interface material with devil's canyon
right so we're going to get better
thermal paste let's let's look at that
again an improved thermal interface
material between the CPU core and the
heat spreader so intel is admitting now
that they put junk between their die and
their spreader that's basically what
they're admitting with this with this
information here's another article here
reengineering refers to improve thermal
interface materials so intel please from
now on just be honest I mean look I get
it you're a company you want to make
money that's fair enough any publicly
listed company wants to make money but
please do not play the enthusiasts for
idiots the people who spend the most
money on your company I mean I guess the
server market
but I mean look don't shun us
enthusiasts please we're not idiots
we're not going to be buying this crap I
mean I certainly had buying it I knew
straight away there was a load of crap
when this article came out I'm sorry an
antec but you know I knew it was full of
 I knew they put junk thermal paste
on those CPUs and they'll covering it up
but I look they just confirmed it they
Intel themselves confirmed it that they
put junk thermal paste on their CPUs
anyway that's how guilt that's how Intel
is guilty of the septic or deception I
call it the septics deceptive deceptive
tactics anyway let's move on now to what
Devil's Canyon will be and there's
another issue I've got with it because
again basically Intel releasing a
refreshing the Haswell line they
actually bringing out the Pentium models
which are going to be overclocked and
essentially they're promising here is
that you can overclock a pentium and I
mean the problem I have with this is
that if you can overclock a Pentium do
you have do you need a z97 motherboard
to do it or do can you do it on h81
motherboard this is the questions I've
got because if you can't I mean sorry be
95 but if you can't overclock a Pentium
on a low budget motherboard then there's
going to be essentially no point in
getting an overclockable pentium there's
just the value for money isn't there for
any budget minded person and I mean like
the z97 HSN multiples are going to talk
about my favorite too but they're coming
out and essentially it's just I mean I
just feel like I'm getting fleeced like
you know Intel just wants to take my
money and people are going to be like
don't buy it brain but like you know for
me I'm the tech channel and I kind of
it's like a prerequisite of being a tech
channel that you kind of have to have
the latest tech so i guess i will be
buying a z97 motherboard and honestly if
i'm going to buy one of them it's
probably going to be one of these two
these two looking good honestly I'm
leaning towards the gigabyte as I have
tried the asrock z77 recently and the
msi z87 g45 gaming both motherboards
impressed me both were very good I did
like both those motherboards the
gigabyte honestly $150 it looks like
it's well-priced it's got sli supports
sli mean it's got the did
they're coax out there it's God I mean
it's just it looks like it's
feature-packed it's got good support for
overclocking looks actually looks half
decent 150 bucks so that looks like my
pic the z80 97 asrock extreme ford oh
440 six dollars does look pretty good as
well they both got the real tackle m50
on board good on-board audio good on
board and I see as well the Intel and I
see on board there these are my two top
two picks for z97 refreshes so honestly
though I am pissed off though that we
cannot use our z87 motherboards for
broad well I think that's a frickin an
absolute joke I mean come on one
motherboard and then we have to buy
another board motherboard to freaking
use the next-gen cpu I mean come on
that's a bit that's it is a bit too far
I mean there should be some condolences
or some sizable by I guess some remorse
or something from Intel to say look
we're sorry we can offer you guys a
special I don't know some store credit
or credit on a broad well discount on
the cpu I don't know something please
give us something because I feel like
I've been just juked out of my money
when i bought my z87 motherboard anyway
let's move on down to the next topic so
these are I mean msi is launching 16 new
ninth series motherboards and as rocks
in releasing their new motherboards as
well but honestly msi 16 new
motherboards god damn that's a so many
motherboards like for me it's like to it
too many I don't know which one to pick
they got the gaming three the gaming
five the gaming seven I think those come
with like xsplit or something and then
they've got the g45 gaming as well I
mean I don't know between all these
motherboards I don't know which one to
pick from MSI so anyway next let's let's
move on to the last article here and
this is AMD returns to traditional smt
base multi-threading so what if you guys
didn't know what they're using on their
current architecture is CMT which is
basically it's a md zone multi-threading
technology and those are the the gym
Keller I think Jim Kelly said look we're
gonna scrap this we're going back to the
chopping block and we're going to make a
new architecture the
going to feature the traditional smt and
I'm really pleased about this I hope I
think it's simultaneously multithreading
it's what Intel users but look they're
going to go head-to-head with Intel they
got to say look we can make just as good
as an architecture or something that's
even relatively close to as well or
broadwell and if they can do that man
i'll probably be buying an AMD cpu so
I'm hoping that AMD can get their
together and can release a CPU that can
at least come within margin of Intel
CPUs it doesn't have to beat it it
doesn't have to calculate doesn't have
to match it but if he can be like you
know the FX 8320 when I tested it man it
was leagues behind the 4670k like we're
talking everyday usage not just gaming
it was behind in a lot of cases so yeah
that's just that anyway but I hope AMD
can get back on board get get the boat
running get all the good stuff coming
out for us anyway with that being said
I'm going to catch you guys with another
tech video soon I'm really keen to hear
what you guys think about the z97
refreshes I'm seriously I'm out of it so
this Tech Talks probably like the most
in an informative tech dork I've ever
made it's just because I've been
researching all this audio recently
I'm just over it and I'm literally done
it all it's done I'm going to get the
videos for you guys about that the
scariest thing is though is that I'm
back to loudspeakers most of the time
because the headphones just there that
dangerous fear is be very careful with
them but that being said we're going to
close out to the new outro and I will
catch you guys with another tech video
very soon peace out for now let me know
what you want me to talk about the next
I'll go to a little it tech talk and
I'll catch you guys soon do you want the
Brian easy intro or do you want dr. easy
I'm going to thinking I'll go back to
Brian easy that's just who I am maybe
who knows anyway I'll catch you guys
soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
