on how to fix your blue screens of death
you've tried changing memory sticks and
you've tried changing the power supply
okay
some of these may indeed fix your
problems but if you're still having
those blue screens of death then today
we're going to go through some of the
weirdest problems I've encountered since
I've started building pcs and of course
how you can fix those problems walking
back to tech yesterday the first problem
we're gonna get into is under voltage
default settings this one can rear its
head up more than you would think
especially in 2018 where AMD and Intel
are how could you say it pushing the
envelope as much as possible on their
CPUs particularly when consumer CPUs
like the rise in 2000 series and also
the i7 lineup are to be discussed these
have been clocked more aggressively out
of the box towards the point where they
may be near diminishing points of return
so in some cases when a power supply is
a budget one that may have large amounts
of ripple which is a whole topic in
itself but basically fluctuating voltage
levels that can in certain cases drop
below the default voltage spec leaving
your computer blue screening coupling
this together with a budget multiple
being used with most likely a lackluster
vrm that's a voltage regulator that
draws power directly from your power
supply and then changes it to power that
your processor can use all this can lead
to a situation where your central
processing unit may be starved of
sufficient voltage to run at even
default settings so in order to fix this
just simply head into the bio so hit the
delete or f2 key when your computer
boots and if your computer allows to
which on most modern motherboards the
hardware will boot at non-turbo settings
so you shouldn't crash before you get
into the BIOS and then simply after this
go to the part where your CPU voltage
settings are and then just press the
plus or minus key on your numpad and try
raising these over the default settings
voila you may be able to kiss those blue
screens goodbye however before we get on
with problem number two if you have a
lot of different websites that you visit
and perhaps you are like me and have a
different tearing of passwords for
websites starting from websites you
don't trust at all two websites that
have your
banking details then today's video
sponsor LastPass can help you out
greatly I find myself constantly
visiting websites that aren't that
important to me personally but I do
enjoy reading using forums for example
and then a lot of them require username
and passwords that you may all well
forget well if you don't want to forget
any more than last parts can auto
generate unique passwords for every
website you frequent and store them in a
secure cloud and autofill it into those
websites to make your life that much
easier I've been using the service for a
while now and it's avoided a lot of
headaches and an added benefit of it is
is that you can have all those secure
passwords for these sites shared to you
and your trusted friends for instance an
Nvidia NDA login account for driver
downloads then you can easily share a
password with other LastPass users and
you know exactly who you've shared it
with not to mention they don't know what
the password exactly was used either so
if you feel like you don't like sharing
the account anymore you can just simply
cut them off and this service is

description below number two
hibernation mode computers often go to
sleep and on windows default settings
the computer can go into a mode called a
hibernation where the computer is on a
minimal power draw state and is ready to
spring to life the moment you click a
button on your keyboard or Mouse there
are also other settings like USB ports
and PCIe slots on your motherboard that
can be disabled too though here's where
things can get a little tricky some
budget power supplies don't actually
support the low power draw states to
feed the CPU when it is in this mode so
the computer doesn't wake up after you
hit a button this can in particular rear
its ugly head after the fourth gen Intel
CPUs were introduced that is CPUs like
the i7 4770k 546 70 k i5 6400 etc where
Intel introduced at low power mode
called c7 so in order to circumnavigate
this problem and stop it from becoming a
problem you can do one of two things
either go into the BIOS and set your
minimum C state to c3 or if you're on a
laptop I do recommend c6 for power
savings which is what I always do or you
can go into Windows or of course you can
do both which is what I do on my desktop
computer x79 god bless and in the power
settings you can set your computer to
high power mode in here you can also
change selective suspend settings and
PCIe power
States and in general this just helps
make a super snappy machine though one
negative to all this is of course higher
power consumption so again if you're on
a laptop do be careful you may wish to
just go with c6 in the bus and call it a
day and of course if you're no longer
having those b-sides or freezers then
you can call it a day number three
faulty memory modules this one is such a
pain to diagnose because sometimes it's
completely random in nature and it can
pass some of the Diagnostics tests and
then BAM just suddenly spring on you
with a blue screen or a program crashing
for no reason or in rare circumstances
lines going through your screen though
if you do want to rule out memory
problems the best way is to run mem test
86 plus and run this for a few hours
going through all the tests it will
stress the memory thoroughly and if the
memory does have a fault I usually find
it will come out in this stress test it
has never given me a false positive nor
a false negative so in order to get this
program to work just simply download it
make a bootable USB and then boot into
mem test 86 and you shall be good to go
so if you don't have much time and you
don't want to make that bootable and you
don't want to use mem test 86 then you
can try just using one memory stick at a
time or if you've only got one memory
stick in your computer and try changing
that out for another memory stick
because in my time building pcs I've
never had two memory sticks go bad at
the exact same time and I've built a lot
of computers so this is rare if this
ever did happen you'll like one of those
guys who won the lottery but in a
negative way anyway if you do find out
there was a memory problem with your
computer then you should no longer be
freezing or having blue screens of death
coming in with number four is hardware
incompatibility this can sometimes come
about with things like RAM not working
with a particular motherboard or simply
and in this one is very weird using a
cheaper chipset license like a h-60 one
versus a z68 motherboard for example or
a h1 10 motherboard versus a z170 I
found that some budget mulder boards
would just simply not have the ability
to boot to different ddr3 memory modules
from different manufacturers at the same
time if this is indeed the problem then
I would suggest just trying one memory
stick at a time and of course simply
just trial and error in the situation
and if they don't work together then you
may
source another memory stick or another
motherboard because unfortunately some
problems like these are just not
avoidable and non-curable another common
problem is using a PCI or PCIe wireless
adapter and the drivers not simply being
installed and when you install them they
just give you a b-side like in the past
I've used a d-link wireless module and
when I turn the computer on it was
working before I installed the module
but then after soon as I get into
Windows bang be sod this can cause a lot
of frustrations and in this case if you
buy a new piece of hardware and this
happens then simply return it to the
store and get a refund and try a
different branded product we the
consumers ultimately and we should not
be used as beta testers can cause some
serious headaches though more problems
from Hardware incompatibility can arise
from things like sound cards same thing
is the wireless module some can cause
issues even working on Windows 7 for
example but then when you upgrade to
Windows 10 bang no longer works
same deal save yourself the headaches
and get rid of this problematic part out
of your life
and coming in with number 5 is a faulty
or underwhelming power supply this one
is a very very tricky one to diagnose
sometimes and in fact I've only had this
rarely pop up a few times since I've
started building a pewters mind you I
don't use garbage power supplies and I
have been building and tinkering for a
very long time though that doesn't mean
that it won't happen and it can happen
so basically the problem here is that if
you have a faulty power supply your
computer while either just not boot or a
good blue screen or it can just freeze
and other problems that can happen as
well as that your computer may seem fine
but there is this weird burning smell
and it's not the smell of freshly open
hardware this is different it's a smell
that just lingers and draws itself to
your nose if you smell this odor ladies
and gentlemen then do yourself a favor
shut down your PC immediately find out
what source of the smell and remove that
part a SAP this goes not just for the
power supply but other components in
your system though 99% of the times a
weird smell from your PC has always been
from a power splay that's just my
experience so always out of all your PC
components do get a power supply that is
a little better than the cheapest junk
they sell from the brand you've never
heard of for instance if you are in
Australia the promised land and you are
on a budget even a power play like a
corsair vs
50 will be miles better than some
no-name 680 watt power supply there will
in due time most likely sizzle and the
problem here is that it might not just
take itself but it could also take out
other hardware with it or even your
whole house don't risk it just like
those dodgy sellers on gumtree or
Facebook and the last problem with power
supplies is of course the power supplied
some people buy cheap 500 watt power
supplies thinking they can power their
gtx 1070 all okay and then when they
boot up a game and find out that a
computer just shuts off this is because
that five under what pounds fly just
like mentioned above is junk you'll
generally need to spend some decent
money on a power supply if you're
putting in medium to high and components
in a built if you need to find some
decent power supplies then I will put
some links in the description below but
for most people a solid 650 watt power
supply will cover you for years and
years to come
and it won't break the bank and it will
be able to be ported from every PC you
build meaning you can reuse it anyway
guys hope you enjoy today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
let me know in the comments section
below what are the weirdest problems
you've come into when it comes to blue
screens or freezing or problems that you
may encounter when building PC's love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon also don't forget
