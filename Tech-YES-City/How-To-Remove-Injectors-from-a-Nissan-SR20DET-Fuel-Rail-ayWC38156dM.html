coming back today with a quick review
showing you guys how to remove injectors
from a Nissen fuel rail this here is an
sr20det fuel rail and I just want to get
these Tommy or Nissen Nismo 550 CC
injectors I want to pull them out so
first off so if you wanna get this done
you need tools if you're not confident
at all then I recommend going to it
place and getting them professionally
removed otherwise you may break
something so now the first problem I've
ran into is the thief group of the and
not even coming out so I'm gonna have to
drill them out okay now most of you
won't have this problem but yeah I'll
show you the next step after this okay
so we've drilled one off two to go you
can see I've basically this rail is
going to be useless from now and since
it's the stock sr20det row it doesn't
really matter okay stage one complete
okay now this next part is up to you but
I like to do it arm you just get
lubricant spray this is Japanese
lubricant spray and you just spray a
little bit so you make sure you don't
get make sure you do not get this in
your injectors in the actual fuel pot
just around the edges so if you see I
will just spray a little bit around
around so it's not getting in the top
part which is where the injector
actually injects the fuel so you're just
getting it around the sides and then to
loosen it up so just do that to all four
and I'm going to cut the camera off
because it can't hold it camera and do
it at the same time
yeah you do that to all four and then
sort of just sort of loosen them up a
little bit so see you can see the
lubricant already working in there so
you just want to loosen them up so yep
and that's that step number two okay now
you're up to the last stage and of
course this is the probably the hardest
and most important stage so you've
gotten a bit of wd-40 in there bit of
lubricant spray to loosen it up you
haven't got any in the actual injectors
as well which is important this last
stage I personally just use a
screwdriver and sometimes an allen key
which I put into this little hole on the
side here yeah let's start off we'll try
I show you one and basically I get the
screwdriver in between there and I just
wedge it so I'm just wedging the
injector out and this one's actually
coming up pretty easy just wedging it
out just just slowly just nice and easy
nice and easy and it comes out so that's
one injector BAM done you can smell the
fuel off that too
so that's off and sr20 rail guys second
one line that up just in here so you got
a nice little position right in there
and you just wedge it out nice and
slowly nice and slowly so it's all
loosened up and that's out as well
nice and easy got two more to go two
more to go
okay this one's down over there we go
it's like a little click when it comes
out yeah that's another one out and the
last one here awesome here but the fuels
coming out this is the last one so I'm
holding ink I'm doing this one hand two
guys I'm doing what so I'm not putting
practically any pressure on the injector
so easy they come out if you know what
you're doing so there you go guys
there's four injectors removed from a
Nissen sr20det rail if you've got any
questions uh please just comment in the
comments and also if you want to
subscribe subscribe to keep the awesome
videos going and help you guys out so
this is a Brian easy review coming back
and yeah so the reason I removed it from
these rail is this rail is really old
and rusted and shitty mean insides
pretty clean though get clean but yeah I
don't want this rail so bye-bye old
crappy sr20det rail so alright guys
peace out okay guys and electrical
contact cleaner and clean up your inject
really
maybe location
we write down
yeah yeah I just got the injectors out
because I'm going to sell them basically
so there you go guys they're perfectly
clean and they're perfect will be a
really good condition they're in
immaculate condition so that's the final
product okay guys see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
