little journey behind the scenes to an
tech event hosted by Corsair this is
down in Sydney so I live in the Gold
Coast so I believe it's like almost a
thousand kilometres away down south
takes about an hour and a half on the
plane and before I do I'm gonna quickly
show you what's going on behind the
scenes here so we've recently just
finished doing the APU review for the
2200 G and the 2400 G there are nice
little solutions for the money and you
guys wanted to see how high these things
could overclock so now I've got the 2200
G on the testbench it's got the frieze
of the 33 from Arctic this is a really
good budget cooler I tested this against
a couple of others coolers in a
comparison I'll put the link for you
guys if you want to see that and this
one pretty much won out that comparison
at least in value for money in my
opinion so we've got that on the test
bench and we're overclocking the rising
both on the CPU and the a GPU side and
you can see here at 30 degrees it's
really hot where we're at so summertime
no aircon just yet but it's not gonna
stop me from getting these results done
so I'm running the final test now this
is the fire strike benchmark I've got
the single channel memory there which
you guys also requested and we're gonna
be getting that video done very soon but
in the meantime I've got no time left to
spare I've got to get out of here get my
backpack ready and catch a fly
so I just got now into the air B&amp;amp;B and
it's about an hour until the event
begins and for some reason in Melbourne
and Sydney I always find air Bambi's are
a lot cheaper than places like a go to
for example so this is awesome I go this
place we're pretty cheap but I'm gonna
head there now and also want to ask
Corsair about the cryptocurrency mining
and if that's affected them as a company
so two-fold purpose for this event today
but let's head there check out some new
products and then get an interview
so I just go to the event of course it
is really good here and the sad news is
though is I kind of got clicked baited
because their new headset the HSC 60 and
they're going to show it in the product
sample presentation but they don't
actually have the sample on hand so they
do have some other samples here but the
problem is is I got click beta 2 coming
into this event and then I click betas
you guys so it's like a round-robin of
click bait at the moment what the joke
is on Corsair because I skip lunch and
there's free food here so I'm going to
indulge myself and then we'll talk about
some of the other products here as well
so going through the list of products on
display of this event was some of the
products we've already seen on the
channel to begin with that was the h1 15
inh 150 I Pro which are their new water
coolers featuring RGB and Maglev fans
they also have the brand new obsidian
500 D which looked really good in the
flesh and finally is able to fit courses
own 280 Miller ad who would have ever
thought that Corsair can now fit their
own coolers in their cases but also on
display with some pretty cool new
products the k 68 RGB which is a
waterproof keyboard which also features
RGB backlighting and Cherry MX red
switches they also have the K 63 gaming
lap board which is for those people who
want to sit on their couch and play
games but still have a comfortable setup
so you can insert your own keyboard and
use your own mouse with this setup and
they also had to couple with this the K
63 keyboard which is a wireless design
so they've now got a cherry MX wireless
keyboard to add to their lineup but also
if you guys like the Corsair t1 racing
chair but you thought it was too small
and you say for instance 6 foot 4 or
over you're just a really big guy in
general they now have the t2 racing road
warrior so this accommodates people of a
larger stature and it sort of alleviates
that problem that the t1 had what was
for guys like me who are like 5 foot 10
so great solution there for people who
are bigger and want a bigger chair but
also besides that they had the mm 1,000
miles pad you guys might have seen this
at Computex last year when I did a video
for Corsair was a concept that they had
at the time where this mouse pad could
wirelessly charge your phone via a
technology called Qi charging now if
your phone's older if it's just a budget
option phone and doesn't support
wireless charging and they do have a USB
attachment
device that will then charge your phone
once you plug that into the phone and
you'll then be able to wirelessly charge
your phone just like if you had the
technology to begin with but they also
have their dark core Pro RGB mouse as
well this mouse was the wireless mouse
that will be charged from the mousepad
to but also it has the option to be
wired so this can go along with the MM
1000 as a combo for wireless and you
don't have to worry about battery life
too and then lastly on display was the
spec Omega Alpha their new case which
has tempered glass and also accompanying
lighting at the front they had this in
three different flavors black silver and
red two of which had red LED fans and
the other had white that was a silver
version so now the event finished it was
awesome and I am joined by the one the
only Chris Smith email here at the
Corsair event but there's some big tough
questions we look at the products they
were nice everyone wants to know is
crypto currencies affecting Corsair as a
company that makes cases power supplies
and coolers because if people can't buy
the brand-new graphics cards then how
they gonna build it whole new PC isn't
that sort of taking away from that
ability to build that new PC and it's
not affecting Corsair in any way yeah I
mean if you're looking at power supplies
as far as most of course there's
offerings we're offering in the upper
range so we're offering things like the
ax 1600 i platinum that was just
launched recently you know really good
quality we're offering you know a lot of
the goals and and above kind of levels
so you know we're not seeing I guess too
much of a deep because people are buying
our power supplies no matter what
because of the quality that they offer
so whether you're building you know a
crypto mining PC or whether you're
building a PC triple SLI whether it be a
second hand graphics card or a new one
often people are going for course there
anyway because you get that that
reliability that you don't necessarily
get with all the other brands as you
know as far as all the other stuff goes
I work mainly in marketing not so much
in sales but but you know we don't see
too much of a dip and everything else
you know lucky said there's there's a
lot of 580 s that are sold out around
the around the trap some retailers
they're telling me they're backordered
till all the way back into 2017 like mid
to late 2017 but I think for us you know
we're selling on our cue and link
connective
you know we're selling a lot of our new
fans and we're putting a lot of
performance stuff into like a h1 105 IOH
150 ISO we're still trying to innovate
and people are upgrading because of the
innovations rather than us just
providing these little iterations of 1%
performance gains it's more about how
can we revolutionize the market through
R&amp;amp;D and provide something that people
want to buy no matter what so basically
looks like Coursera as a company is
positioned really to ride out a storm
just four main PC builders who want to
build a new PC and need everything else
in between because you've got the other
products there that you charging mouse
pads that are coming out for example
you've got the laptop there's a lot of
other products that have seemed like
they're balancing out plus you've got
those power supplies which I'm pretty
sure those 1500 watts and even the 1600
Watts they'd be back ordered by now
right
and look all says philosophy in the end
is is kind of iron D is greater than
everything else you know you've seen us
bring out the first kind of mechanical
keyboards back in 2014 you know with
their partnership with Chery you've seen
us work really hard in a queue and Lync
integration to be able to integrate your
power supplies your LED pump caps and
everything all into one system and
you've seen that where their cue with
the keyboard mouse mouse pad headset can
be all synced up all the lighting
together whether it's an equaliser or
whether it's something just like a
rainbow RGB vomit you know so so you
know using like the words that you said
weathering through a storm I think that
in the end courses I was able to survive
because of the really solid iron D and
the really solid relationships we build
with you know not just our media but
also connecting with the gamers and the
end users to ask them hey what do you
guys actually want out of a product all
right mr. mammoth thanks for coming out
and taking your time out here to answer
some questions here today if you guys
have any questions for Chris in the
comments section
just ask away and he'll be sure to
respond and it's an awesome time this
event was a really good event thank you
so much for bringing me out here but
make sure you guys stay tuned thanks for
joining us today
because Brian will be taking a look out
later some of the products that he's
showing you
so it's now the next day and I just got
back into the studio and the event was
awesome went really smooth I hope you
guys enjoyed some of the footage but I
found out in the meantime that the new
AP used from AMD they're not sold during
them anymore they're using thermal paste
in between the die and the heat spreader
and if you guys have followed the
channel for a while you know how I feel
about that
I would rather personally pay a few
dollars more on top of the product cost
and have it soldered and just think it's
a much better way especially if you want
to overclock but in this case it is a
budget option especially the $99 APU so
generally when the companies use the
thermal paste over the sole during at
least from all these sources of spoke to
inside the business and we're going to
name any names but everyone I spoke to
says it's to cut costs because the
soldering technique is actually very
complex they've got to use different
materials and they've got to use it in
sort of like an exact science and so it
does add costs to the final product but
anyway I made a survey on Twitter where
I want to hear you guys as opinions if
you just go on Twitter up with the link
in the description you can just vote and
let me know your thoughts and opinions
as to which you think is the best
outcome because I think in this case as
much as it annoys me that they're using
thermal paste it is on a budget entry
level product as we pose to Intel if we
look at their ten core for example
there's practically no excuse to use
thermal paste on a 70 900 X at least
when it costs a thousand bucks so that's
just my thoughts and opinions there but
as well as that we now have some more
testing to do in the next video so I'm
glad I found out about this before I did
the overclocking video because now with
the 2400 G I can deal with that and give
you guys some before-and-after results
how much better overclocking can we get
on air but also the temperatures before
and after too so look forward to giving
you as those tests they should be coming
very soon but also another thing on my
mind as well was I spoke to a few other
youtubers down in Sydney and there's
this thing going around like I had this
happen to me last year and now it's
happening again to me and it's where a
viewers just aren't getting my videos
notified in their sub boxes so I don't
know what's going on there it seems to
only happen to channels that are under a
million subscribers so it's like it's
just a little bit unfair because
trying so hard to get the channel up and
to give you guys better content but if
people who sub to the channel can't even
see my videos to begin with then that's
sort of like it's just a real downer
like makes me feel sad because I'm just
working my butt off here trying to get
content out for you guys and yeah people
aren't even seeing the vids so if that's
happening to you as well let me know in
the description below but a solution for
that in the meantime is again to head on
to Twitter and every time I videos are
posted the link to the video is posted
on Twitter as well so that but with all
that aside I hope you guys enjoyed
today's vlog and video and I look
forward to giving you guys some more
awesome content as well as that the new
x79 I know it's a little bit old now the
x79 board but the one-and board from
Aliexpress rocked up as well so look
forward to getting a video on that and
there's still that backlog there but
that's getting plowed through now the
new Studios done I can just get a video
out almost everyday for you guys so I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon don't forget to hit that like
button
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
