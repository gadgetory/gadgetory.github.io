gtx 1080i and today we're going to take
a look at how this card compares to all
the heavyweights out there and also some
of the new features being offered
welcome back to tech city and here we
have the 1080i founders Edition which
was sent out as a review sample and
features the cooler that's separately
weighs in at seven hundred and five
grand and has a seven phase double vrm
that features fairchild fdpc eight zero
one six s DOOL DOOL MOSFETs they're
actually two both phase which helps with
power efficiency and thermals which are
rated at sixty and a hundred ads of 25
degrees Celsius and for the chokes we
have n P I M r22 is rated at 40 amps and
besides that is handle and capacitors
there's also a thin backplate to add to
the feel of the product and stop GPU sag
though enough of the technical talk
let's get straight to the benchmarks
where I put the 1080 P I up against the
previous king of the hill the GTX 1080
and also 2015 king of the hill the 980ti
all being overclocked by the way so
let's take a look at the benchmark rig
specs and all the overclock on the cards
specified in this video and then roll
some numbers for you guys
there it is the GTX 10a DTI and at Ultra
we really didn't see a huge gain which
was to be expected since we were
starting to get some CPU bottlenecks at
this resolution however when we look at
the 1440p ultra wide benchmarks that's
when the 1080 TI really starts to shine
with about a 30% increase from the GTX
1080 and about a 55% increase over the
Maxwell base 980ti discards 3584 CUDA
cords 11 gigabytes of 11 gigabits per
second rated tdg l5x
really stops stretching its legs and I
imagine that the 35% claim from Nvidia
would be about right for 4k gaming keep
in mind though that I did overclock all
these cards and the GT x 1080 was about
100 megahertz faster than the GTX 1080
TI 2 gigahertz overclock the
temperatures were getting a little high
overclock on the 1080p ion stock fan
setting however they work pretty quiet
at these settings though to keep
temperatures down and overclock higher
one will want to increase the fan speeds
which will make it not as quiet as some
of the aftermarket solutions out there
though one benefit to the founders
addition card is that it will pull air
out of the case instead of aftermarket
solutions which will usually tend to
dump it inside the case so the 1080 TI
for gaming is essentially the new king
of the hill though the card does come in
at a steep price point of $700 which may
be expensive for a lot of people however
to be honest in the GPU market over the
last few years we have seen nothing but
gains on end which does leave a smile on
businesses face and with this
performance shown here today does
justify the price especially when we
compare it to the CPU market where
things has been quite slow and gotten
really
really expensive really really quickly
for a flagship product they're speaking
of flagships in the GPU arena itself the
Titan XP was the card on top and it does
have 96 Rob's first 88 on the 1080 Ti
and does have more level to cash coming
in at 3072 kilobytes versus 2,816 it
also has one gigabyte more of gddr5 ex
memories and a slightly larger buff
though the 1080p eye makes up for this
with faster memory and actually comes
out slightly ahead in terms of max
theoretical speed Nvidia also introduced
a new technology in their drivers called
Ansel which when I tried it out in Mass
Effect Andromeda I was really impressed
it essentially just tosses the game when
you press old f2 and then you can zoom
in rotate the camera change colors and
saturation and get such a unique shot
that can really add an additional
element of fun to the game ultimately
ended up really liking this feature and
I think it's a great option for those
who like to do a bit of artwork and or
thumbnails for example it can make for
some really cool and unique shot there's
also been another major focus with the
release of the GT X 1080 Ti and that's
on direct text well where the api's
optimizations come mainly from the game
developers and not the driver
implementation itself unlike DX 11 where
the driver is so crucial
so in video have claimed some massive
improvements with recent driver releases
something I will put to the test very
soon in a separate video and they have
also recently introduced VR works 2
which makes us some improvements in VR
performance so I haven't tested this nor
do I own a VR headset due to getting
vertigo when wearing most headsets
unless we're looking at the outputs on
this card there are three DisplayPort
1.4 out and one HDMI 2.0 out though you
may notice that there is no DVI port
which has been removed to apparently
help with air flow so Nvidia does
include a DisplayPort to DVI connector
to combat this and likely to put
everything into context for you guys the
GTX 1080 Ti is quite simply a beast of a
graphics card it's mainly intended for
the high-end gaming market with people
with monitors such as a 1440p ultra wide
hundred Hertz display or a 1440p 140
her display or even a 4k 60 Hertz
monitor these are the type of
resolutions where this card will
absolutely kick some bootay sorry guys
let me know what you think of the gtx
980ti and what would you do for one I'd
love to hear your thoughts and opinions
in the comment section below and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
