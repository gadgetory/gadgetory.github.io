you've bought some PC pots they're
filthy or they're just a little bit
dirty in your OCD you want your used
products to look like brand new
well if that's you you've come to the
right place because I have the obscure
the different the yes-man way of
cleaning things to show you guys here
today we are indeed using carp rocks
we have brake cleaner now brake cleaner
one of those things that I've heard from
people some people don't like it I've
been using this stuff for years now and
I haven't had one component died because
of it besides that is a thing known as
wd-40 or just simply degreaser I use the
cheapest stuff on the shelves because I
think it's all the same you're gonna
save some money now the good thing about
this is this finishes the product makes
it look really mint it also in my
opinion can help protect components the
only component I've had died in recent
times is this cougar power supply here
and that was a new product but rumor has
it with this cougar power supply right
here ok well there's something fell out
of it that had I'd sprayed wd-40 on this
thing it would still be alive today
true fact but unfortunately it died so
we don't need it anymore and we've got a
power supply here that actually does
work a nice and tech 650 watt power
supply now we're gonna be hosing this
down we're gonna be hosing this down
here at motherboard we're gonna be
hosing this gtx 960 down and i'm gonna
be going through each and every one of
these products how i use them why and
what goes through the process of getting
abused product from trash to treasure in
the 2018 tech yes use parts restore or
guide will get that bone click out of
the way
welcome back to tech yes city this Brian
coming to you guys today with that
cleaning guide and we've got the data
vac this is first up on the bench here
this is like your initial sort of
preliminary phase one that cleaning
product that you use when you just want
to give it a generic clean and sometimes
this thing will even do a good job all
on its own this is sometimes all you
will have to use but of course the first
thing before we clean up any of these
components however is we're gonna take
them all apart now you notice there is a
power supply here so one thing with
power supplies do make sure they are
completely discharged before you start
touching them if you're unsure whether
they're discharged one thing you can do
just to save your life would be to hose
it down and break clean up before you
even take it apart that way if there's
any electrical charge in there it'll
short itself out and you've saved
yourself your life and also if you're
wondering how to discharge these things
you can just plug it up to a motherboard
with an LED light on it or a power
button and if that LED has gone out then
you'll know that the power supply is now
discharged
so now we just pulled the graphics card
apart we can see here the thermal paste
is really crummy and dry it actually
does kind of need a thermal paste
reapply really quickly so that's a good
thing we actually pulled this thing
apart and the thermal pads here on these
two chips here are actually really bad
they're shot but surprisingly the
thermal pad on the VR himself that's
really good condition so we'll avoid
cleaning that because we don't want to
destroy that however you can get a
thermal pad replacement off eBay or I'll
Express these things are like a dollar
I'll put a link in the description below
just the generic ones keep in mind
though sometimes you will need a very
specific size on these thermal pads
otherwise you could have cooling contact
problems so make sure if you're pulling
one off and it does look like it's very
close to this die here make sure you get
the right height so they come from like
0.3 I think to 0.5 to 1 mil so there's
different size variations so do be
careful that but initially how we're
gonna clean this up is we're gonna use
an alcohol wipe first and they call it
this is actually in Japanese it's called
it I'll go to wet the tissue for some
reason they don't sell these in
Australia I mean you could use another
product especially since we're gonna be
brake cleaning and after that but this
will enable us to get off all this grime
here and also just give it a generic
clean as well as miss these thermal pads
because we're not going to be using
brake cleaner on the actual heatsink
itself since it does have this thermal
pad on it we're actually going to be
using this here the data vac blower to
clean up the actual heatsink but with
that said let's clean up this here
without whole wipes and then we'll put
the brake cleaner on clean up this fan
and then we'll put it back together with
new thermal paste here and then we'll
put the finishing touches with wd-40 on
so here we are now we've finished the
first stage and we've just got to put
these thermal pads now on these two V
RAM chips here and then after that we
will then put the thermal paste on and
put the card back together but of course
before we do that we'll quickly data
back down the fan and get all the dust
off that AB another thing is about this
card too is it's got the power delivery
here coming from the PCIe port yet
they've got two 6-pin connectors on it
so very odd configuration on this
gravity Scott itself and one of those
weird things
so now we've got the graphics card
complete that is all ready now to go in
a build and the good thing about that is
not only do we make it look good we've
got the performance now of something
that we can be confident in because
we've changed that thermal paste but
change those pads we know this thing's
gonna be running a hundred percent now
so that is the graphics card finished
let's move over now to the big prize
here the motherboard and this one's
pretty much a similar deal though there
are some different things to look out
for so let's start pulling this thing
apart
so here it is now the motherboard is
pulled apart and we have the vrm heat
sink thermal pads these are actually in
really good condition still so also we
have to do what this heatsink is give it
a quick alcohol wipe over and with this
Southbridge heatsink however the thermal
paste here has hardened up so we're
gonna have to scrape that off since it
does get really hard I just tend to fast
track it and use a screwdriver because
it's not that of an important chip to
cool down especially when we're just
overclocking on air anyway so I usually
skip the chase screwdriver down you can
use some really hard plastic if you
don't wanna do any scratching at all but
make sure you don't scratch this at all
so that's actually the die there so we
only want to scratch it off this side
and thankfully the thermal paste is only
hardened up on this side and then of
course we're gonna go brake cleaner on
this whole vrm here there is dirt in
really weird places sort of in real
finicky places so the brake cleaner does
do an excellent job of cleaning that all
out as well as getting into these DDR
Ram slots I have found that after I've
sprayed brake cleaner in Ram slots they
have started working properly again as
well so that was a really cool thing so
let's get on with this cleaning and also
don't forget to take your CMOS battery
out and also leave your cpu in there
until you are ready to break clean the
CPU socket down so this will be taken
out after we've done the rest
so the break clean is complete and in
the time we're waiting for that to dry
off and evaporate we clean down this
heatsink here and got that ready as well
as this heatsink here so you will want
to let the brake cleaner evaporate
completely this can take anywhere
between usually 20 minutes to an hour if
you want to fast-track the process then
you can put a hairdryer on it that will
definitely speed up the evaporating
process however one thing to keep in
mind is you will want to make sure that
it's all evaporated if you're spraying
down the socket especially in this part
here if it's still moist in there and
you go to turn your CPU on you may find
that your computer won't boot at all so
I have done this once in the past that's
how I know so yeah make sure it
evaporates completely usually if you're
doing this one time I just recommend
cleaning all your products leaving them
to air overnight and then working on
them in the morning to put them all back
together
so here we are now we have finished
cleaning this motherboard put it all
back together given at that final wd-40
new look shine and it is looking so damn
schmick at the moment so what we've got
here now ultimately is just something
you can put into a build and it will
sell the bill when something looks this
good
it'll just sell the build on its own
that's one thing about PC parts in
general especially with used builds
presentations everything and it always
has been if we zoom in close here we can
see that those little bits of dust now
are all gone so as before it was kind of
it was just dust in there it was even
some hair I believe was stuck in there
so that's the motherboard now done so
we've got the graphics card and the
motherboard done and I think it's time
to move on to the power supply so now
we've just pulled this power supply
apart and it's actually a good thing
because I got to see now that I am
definitely not going to be using this
power play in a build at all that will
cause problems and it can be anything
from shorting things out to just
randomly having the computer restart as
I believe I have tested this power
supply in the past and it has worked
I've just never pulled it apart before
so what we're gonna do here is instead
of wasting precious brake cleaner on
this power supply we might try and find
another power supply to pull apart
instead
so now we've just finished hosing this
down with brake cleaner and really for
power supplies that's all you really
have to do is just a good cleansing with
brake clean and it'll get all that dust
in all the hair out in the past I have
had much dirtier power supplies that
I've cleaned down and the results have
been phenomenal this one was pretty
clean from the get-go anyway however the
last thing you can do of course is to
give it a nice polishing off with wd-40
that will just protect the components as
well I mean how'd that an tech pals play
like all jokes aside had that had a good
wd-40 protection layer and it might have
been a different story it might have not
fried the way it did so who knows but
anyway let's give that the final shine
put it back together and then we got one
more piece to do so here it is now the
final component this is the case and
really when it comes down to a case it's
probably the easiest out of all these
components I've shown here today maybe
because it's just a rag and usually
wd-40 of course if it is dirty enough it
will need the data back as well so
usually two tools they use on a case is
wd-40 and the data vac however I would
not recommend using brake cleaner on the
actual case itself sometimes there is a
lot of plastic and brake cleaner is
known to sometimes eat away at plastics
so yeah that's my recommendations there
but let's give this thing a nice before
and after
so there it is guys this is a wrapping
up the tutorial on how to clean your PC
parts and conquer the universe in 2018
though quickly do a recap on what we've
got here on the desk the data vac that's
probably the biggest difference between
the last time I did this garden this
time this thing will save you time it's
also great if you just want to do a
quick cleanse on your main rig get all
the dust out especially hard-to-reach
places this thing will do a great
general generic clean of course it is a
little bit expensive comes in around
about things 70 USD so if you're not
building computers that much or if you
only want to build one computer like
once every two years there's probably
gonna be a waste of money but if you're
like me and you're building computers
constantly changing things up this thing
is really good great product next up
here we've got here wd-40 aka water
dispersant this stuff will do a
fantastic job of giving you that final
look shine but also protecting the
components after the fact now the one
here I've got here is not called wd-40
it's called multi-purpose spray it's
essentially like a copy of wd-40 so in
your country you might have different
brands in Australia this is the cheapest
I could find on the shelves save myself
some money does the exact same job in my
opinion in Japan there was CRC I think
it was 2 3 2 or something like that and
the thing about this is a lot of people
say oh well this short things out no
I've sprayed this on live electronics in
Japan I even just yesterday sprayed it
on a live computer and it was absolutely
no problems great product next up here
we've got alcohol wipes now this is one
of the hardest things to find anywhere
in the world in Australia I think
they've government office works they're
like $5 for 70 of them in Japan these
things were like a hundred and fifty for
a dollar 50 extremely cheap and they're
probably if I had to pick one product
out of here that I would use the most it
would be alcohol wipes they're just a
godsend literally they these things save
time they just clean up GPU dies if you
need them to clean up thermal pastes
anything I even use them around the
office just to clean up just do it and
monitors even glass doors around here
they just saves so much time
fantastic I'm actually running out of
stock so I'll get even a friend in Japan
to send them over more of these if
you're in the US I'm not sure what they
are when I was over there I tried these
ones that had detergent in them and
since they had detergent in them they
started foaming up and it was actually a
bit of a problem I wouldn't recommend
getting those make sure you get the pure
alcohol ones next up here we've got the
most controversial one here today
this is brake cleaner now some people
will say go out and get EC see an AC C
stands for electrical contact cleaner
now if you are really worried about your
components especially if they're like
brand-new components like a z3 70 80 700
K for example or a new verizon system
then you may wish to go out and get some
ECC it's about 20 bucks a bottle this
stuff I've been using this for years I
haven't had one problem with it it's
fantastic it's about five dollars a
bottle in Japan I think it was like two
dollars a bottle it's so cheap so
powerful it will get into those really
hard to reach places
it'll just clean out that dirt and leave
it looking brand new especially after
you use the wd-40 so usually I use this
first and then I'll use this after and
also before I get on out here we'll
actually two more things before I get on
out of here the reason for cleaning up
your parts is also twofold we do want
them looking really good because the
final product will sell better when it
looks really good but also we saw as
with that power supply we had a broken
bounce place so I'm pretty much chucking
that in the bin now so that was a good
thing that would have just caused me
headaches and problems if I had put that
in a build because I actually have tried
that power supply before and it still
does work but I wouldn't put that
anywhere near a client's build so I was
glad I discovered that and yeah that's
actually one thing that was good they
came out of today's tutorial the GPU as
well saw the thermal paste that was shot
all hardened up so glad we gave that a
new coat and also before I get on out
here discharging your power supplies to
big thing make sure there's no power
left in these things before you take
them apart as you saw without a Zeus
motherboard I had plugged it up made
sure that LED light was not on that
means the power supply is discharged and
we're good to go
also with your motherboard CMOS battery
make sure that's out and the cpu I
generally leave that in there until I'm
cleaning the pins
that's just so I don't accidentally grab
the socket and bend the pins which has
the potential to break the whole
motherboard itself anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed today's tutorial if you did
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
which product do you think came up the
best here today also if you have any
tips and tricks of your own or any
products that you use then be sure to
drop a comma in the comment section
below and I'll catch you guys in another
tech video better peace out for now bye
and that's pretty much the main weapon
tree there all right papa Giuseppe or
sometimes even better than brand-new so
strap on in grab yourself a yes 'mobile
if you haven't got one already oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
