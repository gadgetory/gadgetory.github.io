journey to start mining crypto
currencies and experience it firsthand
what was all the hype about what was the
technology itself about and also gained
some experience in the real world so
then when I talk to people in real life
I knew what I was talking about when it
came to cryptocurrency mining but today
will be the part one of a two-part
series with crypto currencies where I
talk about the money that I've made the
profits involved and then in part two
I'll talk about predictions and new
trends that I think are going to happen
as this was certainly one trend six
months ago that is paid off very well so
let's talk about it
welcome back to tech yes City and
obviously the big question on your mind
is how has it been and the answer has
been it's actually been too good
I've actually sold half my holdings in
cryptocurrency and it's on a site called
coin spot they're an australian-based
broker for crypto currencies and now I
actually have to get my account verified
still and bring the money down so it's
not actually in my hands at the moment
but I sold half my cryptocurrency
because I believe that the whole thing
has gone better than expected it's just
done too well and usually when
something's doing too well if you can
can cash out then usually should that's
just my opinion and so I think over the
last six months it's been literally just
crazy the actual money that's been made
off this I've got a total holdings now
in Zen cash which is about twenty five a
thousand Australian dollars and this was
off about five thousand dollars of
hardware so I had six 1080 T eyes and
210 ATS
mining over the span of about five
months and I've since decommissioned
that mining rig because mainly because
it's summer and I don't have it in an
aircon environment so that cards will
just be getting an absolute pounding in
the summer but also as well I wanted to
sort of have some time back and sit back
because the difficulty of mining the
cryptocurrency has gone through the roof
and now difficulties when when you minor
currency there's a difficult rating so
the more people that start mining it the
difficulty goes on so in other words it
makes it harder to actually get more
amounts of the coin so you may have just
heard before that I said Zen cash and
not Z cash initially I started out with
a cryptocurrency called Z cash and after
a few days of mining I saw my balance
was like point one of the coins and I
don't like looking at decimals
personally so after I saw that I was
like no I want to start mining something
else I want some actual coins in my
wallet and so I found the Zen cache
which was a fork it's basically when
they get their cryptocurrency then they
make a new one and it had better merits
not only that the original developers
take a less cut or in other words
attacks essentially on the miners
and it just looked like a better
currency so I switched over and it was
crazy when I switched over it was like
three dollars or two five dollars a coin
and I was mining about ten coins every
three days off these a graphics card
configuration and it was crazy because I
was like yay cool my balance is going up
I really I got to about 200 coins
extremely fast and then it just
skyrocketed the difficulty the price of
Zen Cash started going up from like five
dollars to twenty dollars immediately
and the difficulty started going I was
like wow okay I'm making a lot less
coins but those initial coins that I
mind started to go through the roof and
so now to this date it went out to like
65 dollars a coin and around sixty
dollars I sold 150 coins and this is USD
so I had a just a lot of I guess money
now that I transferred from one crypto
currency exchange called crypto piya and
transferred that across to a coin spot
so there was fees involved as well and I
think total to get this money to my bank
account that'd be about I'd say maybe 7%
fees involved so that's right so me
getting from the actual coins from my
wallet all the way to my bank account is
about seven percent involved so it's
actually very costly at the moment to
transfer money via cryptocurrency at
least to convert it into a cash based
currency like Australian dollars or US
Dollars and also with that the currency
itself is still not directly linked to a
currency like a US dollar or a straddle
it's actually linked to Bitcoin and
bitcoins the actual main medium of
exchange and that's another reason I
think Bitcoin is still extremely popular
but we'll talk about that in part two so
over the last six months very successful
operation I have started cashing out
half my earnings because I want to
realize some actual profit rather than
just have it on paper and so it's
looking good so far everything's been
absolutely amazing but that's why I'm
cashing out at the moment because the
expectations are better than expected
and now anyone in finance or anyone who
invests in any vehicle
if something doesn't go as expected then
you pull out whether it's better or
worse of course better being a better
thing and that you make money more than
you expected but when something just
goes crazy and it does too well that's
when you start to say hey I'm gonna
change my plans so now with that I
essentially had a lot of review samples
as well I did borrow some grab his cards
off Steve from hardware and box as well
for this experiment so a big THANK YOU
to him and the it was just really free
money essentially and it's just for me I
can't believe the concept of this free
money because I've paid about a thousand
Australian dollars in power I think
maybe a little bit more maybe about
twelve hundred dollars in power over the
last six months mining these crypto
currencies and so the actual profit
margin is looking like it's around
twenty four thousand dollars of course -
the grab is carpet and now that's the
reason I went into mining some people in
the comments said you should have just
put that five thousand dollars and
bought the crypto currencies directly
and this is where things start to get a
little bit confusing because you've got
those people on the side of the fence of
just buy the crypto currencies directly
I mean personally I love gratis cards I
love hardware so I'm more of a hardware
guy when I heard the concept of mining
it using your actual graphics cards at
your rate own or you can go out and buy
I immediately leaned towards the mining
side of things and so with the mining
side of things it's a little bit slower
you're not going to obviously get say
for instance if I put five thousand
dollars into a $3 n cash I would have
made a lot more money but I still would
have had to have gone through exchanges
lost money in fees and with that as well
you put yourself at risk of losing money
like the amount GOx exchange at least
with the mining operation you can get
the mining via pull put that balance
directly into your cryptocurrency wallet
and then send it to an exchange slowly
and cash out over time so there's less
risk involved I believe in actually
mining the crypto currencies versus
buying them directly so and one more
thing to add on top of that too if you
go with mining which is what I did in my
opinion there's
almost 0% risk because you've got the
hardware there which are gaming graphics
cards which you can turn around and then
sell to a gamer and you can usually sell
it at least a little bit under retail
especially if it's a hot graphics card
like a 1080 or a 1080 TI in some cases
you can even make a lot more money and
now that's why I initially got into this
cryptocurrency experiment because I was
selling my AMD gravis cards because they
were just so overpriced those like damn
you could have bought one of these for
$300 a few months ago a strangles and
then sold it for 600 strain dolls so you
could have made money for gaming so the
cryptocurrency market has definitely
inflated the prices of gratis cards but
has also created a whole new market
itself and one thing I will add on top
of this of a gun like on crazy tangents
in this video is that personally I
wouldn't buy the gravis cards with no
display outs because if the mining thing
goes belly-up then you can't really sell
that Gramsci that card is essentially
worthless to a gamer if it's got no
display outs unless of course you SLI
won but you're gonna need one with a
display out so very weird concept with
the graphics cards that don't have any
display arts yes they'll come in a
little bit cheaper but they're
absolutely worthless to games in a lot
of cases so I of course would believe if
you were doing a cryptocurrency mining
rig I'd just buy the actual normal cards
with display outs of course there's that
argument of this has inflated the price
of grabs cards it's stopping gamers from
getting a graphics card but of course
there is the use price performance
market out there it's very healthy at
the moment that's why I don't mind the
cryptocurrency thing a whole lot I've
looked at us sewed back and I've said
hey you can go and get a GTX 780 for
like a hundred US dollars and that thing
will absolutely own in graphics for
video games so if you're on a budget you
can definitely get into PC gaming so
that's the whole cryptocurrency thing
done that's how much I've made I came
out of this with 310 Zen coins and
honestly it's just crazy how much this
whole cryptocurrency boom thing has
inflated recently there's been a crash
where it's gone down 30% people were
talking about a friends
in real life who were like telling me
about Ripple I'm like dude well like
you're investing in crypto currencies I
never even knew and they're like yeah I
bought some ripple like bought yeah it's
gone from 30 cents to three dollars and
I'm just labeled why don't you sell it
that's a lot of money and it's a
thousand percent so when you look at the
actual percentage gains they're
ridiculous I think in the last six
months this vehicle of investment I've
done with crypto currencies in this
whole experiment has been quite
literally like 600 percent in six months
which would be like a twelve hundred
percent ROI return on investment it's
been absolute stupidity to say the least
so in terms of how much money has been
made it's been crazy even though I
haven't made much those guys out there
who are making an absolute killing off
crypto currencies but for me I'm really
happy because this money is going all
back into that new studio it's just
it'll be able to pay off upgrades money
that I borrowed I won't have to borrow
that I just have to pay that all back so
the whole studio is gonna be complete I
may even have a deposit now for a car
upgrade as well so the whole
cryptocurrency thing for me it's like
why not hold on to it's like no I could
really use that money at the moment and
utilize it for the health of tech yes
City but I guess that's the profit thing
aside in this case the trend definitely
was your friend always look for trends
and if you can identify them early and
you think they're gonna be a success
then definitely jump on them this has
given me a lot more confidence in terms
of investing where as opposed to 2008
when I started investing I lost all my
money and that's something I've never
really spoken about on the channel so I
have lost a have learned a lot not lost
sorry have learned a lot in the past ten
years of my life and I'm applying that
knowledge now in 2018 finally to start
getting back into investing on the side
also another thing I learned with the
mining cards themselves is 410 ATT is
you want to set them at about 80 % TDP
rating that'll reduce the power
consumption and set the fence to a
hundred percent also for the ten 80s
they can drop down to like 70 % TDP and
that's a really good sweet spot for them
I found both these cards were
good for the Z catcher or the xancash
they're very sinc they're like the same
algorithm so they'll work well on any
Nvidia graphics card and they'll be very
efficient on NVIDIA Chrome's cards and
so the eight cards were doing very well
the aftermarket cards with three fans or
even the two fans are a lot better than
a reference style cooler there are about
ten degrees lower on average and so of
course that 10 degrees is much better
for the life of the graphics card anyway
guys hope you enjoyed today's video on
the profits involved with crypto
currencies in part two I'll start
talking more about the trends things
that I think are going on in general
with crypto currencies and I look
forward to giving you that video and
today has just been the video where it's
been very successful and so from here on
in I don't know what I'm going to do
with it but I'm definitely going to keep
my interests involved with crypto
currencies anyway guys I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
