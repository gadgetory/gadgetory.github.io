with the x99 asrock extreme 6 with USB
3.1 ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes City this is brian coming back
to you guys today with yet another
asrock x99 motherboard review however
this time it has USB 3.1 so last year
you guys probably know that I reviewed
the asrock extreme 6 and it was pretty
much the answer to all my problems on
the x99 line I was having a lot of
problems with the previous boards that I
used the MSA SLI Plus also as well as
the gigabyte u d4 and when asrock
probably saw this they said hey we're
confident in our product we'll send you
over something that works and when I got
it in it worked flawlessly and since
then I think they've noticed that I
really do expose all the details about a
motherboard and if there's something
that I don't like I will let you guys
know and so today with the x99 asrock
extreme 6 with USB 3.1 i'm glad to say
that it's yet another solid board from
asrock on the x99 line so we'll quickly
go over today a quick flash review of
the motherboard because I've already
done a really in-depth review on the
extreme 6 and this motherboard doesn't
differ that much so if you wish to see
that review I'll put the link in the
description below with a little photo
there or in up here and you guys can
check that out if you want to know every
little minor detail but I'll go over the
things I like and some little things
that I don't like and then we'll move
over to a quick look at the BIOS we'll
do a quick sound test for you guys and
then we'll move on to a conclusion as
well as testing out some USB 3.1 so
starting from top to bottom you get a
big chunky heatsink covering a 12 phase
vrm which has really good components on
a 12 key niche con caps 60 amp chokes
dual mosfet design there but not only
that the vrm stays cool and this is with
overclocks that go up to 1.3 volt I
still had no problems with this vrm and
the heatsink was cool to touch in a
25-degree
controlled environment so really good
job with this variant I don't
see you coming into any problems with
everyday 24/7 overclocks
on this motherboard so looking at memory
compatibility that we've got eight dims
which supports up to a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes of ddr4 memory
you can also tune this in the BIOS very
in-depth as well so you can change
individual voltages on the RAM and stuff
like that so that's a good thing you've
also got two USB three front outs there
on the motherboard if you wish to
connect that looking further down you've
got ten solder three ports there as well
as the solder Express so this is added
in from the extreme six standard edition
you've got these solder Express port
there as well which will actually cancel
out aside of three port if you wish to
use that now also the first six ports
are dedicated to being raid Abul if
that's a word and then the last four
ports there start a three but they can't
be put in raid configurations now
further down the board you've got a
power button and a reset button if you
wish to push it put put this on a bench
as well as you've got the dr. debug LED
light there which can help you if you're
having problems especially if you're
overclocking and coming into problems or
if your parts of faulty it'll read out
codes and possibly the motherboards
faulty from the factory it'll let you
know that so you got all your standard
connectivity ports there USB two front
outs funderbolt front audio out there
you've also got a comm port there as
well as one thing I'll mention is the
dual BIOS designer it's very good
because you can select between the two
different bosses a or B and so if you're
upgrading your BIOS you can turn it to
the other BIOS and then upgrade that and
test if everything's working okay and if
it is you can keep it on that bus
upgrade the previous boss the vice versa
it can save a lot of headaches in the in
the future because in the past they have
had a BIOS brick and it has ruined the
whole motherboard so it's great that
there's a dual blast design though I do
expect that on an ex ninety nine board
so looking in the middle of the board
there straight above the three PCIe 316
speed slots there we've also got an
auxilary power in there which will
supply more power to the PCIe slots if
you especially be going with 3-way SLI
or something like that you've also got a
fan port there and in total you've got
six fan headers on the board which is
great and you can control them in the
bus with the Fant
stick tuna just below that you've got an
MDOT to solder port there if you wish to
use that it is very fast I do recommend
it if you're going within ussd nowadays
you've also got to one speed PCIe slots
there and also a PCI mini slot there now
one limitation about this board is that
if you go to 5820k it won't support
3-way SLI will support two-way but it
won't support 3-way if you want to go
through a sli you've got to step it up
to a 59 30 K now I'm not too sure about
why this is happening but I believe this
is a thing implemented from Intel with
recent BIOS updates so just be careful
of that and be mindful that if you are
getting this board now another thing as
well you've got the besides that the
purity sound - now I'll do a quick test
and I'll talk about the audio because I
do think it's a big part of a
motherboard especially in x99
motherboard you should be getting a good
onboard audio solution and now the
purity sound to it is pretty much the
best onboard audio solution I've tried
not just with the audio out but also the
mic in and as well as the line in
they're both very really good so if
you're wanting to record things and use
a preamp like I do this is a great
onboard audio solution let's quickly go
over to the back of the board now so
looking from top to bottom at the back
of the connectivities there you also get
an i/o shield included which is black
which is good but looking at this you
get a ps2 port so you can plug in a ps2
mouse or keyboard I personally use a ps2
keyboard myself and you can boot that
from the computer so you just press a
key on your keyboard and you're good to
go your computer's boot it up you noted
for a power button anymore you also got
two USB to ports there looking further
down you've got the USB 3.1 C connector
which is the reversible design it's
actually a little bit smaller than a USB
2 port as well and that's giving you
give you future upgrade ability as well
as that tang gigabits per second speeds
which is actually faster than solder
three so that's a good thing you also
got below that a solder Express or a
solder eSATA port sorry and you've got
two USB three is connected to a Qualcomm
Ethernet adapter below that and then
below that you've got the Intel I to 1/8
V Ethernet connector as well as 2 USB 3
ports there now below that you get the
audio options which supports 7.1 DDS
sound I believe also it supports
analog 5.1 our
and you've got your line in and Mike in
there which can run separate which is
what I actually utilizing the audio out
there also it is important to note that
the audio out on the rear sounds exactly
the same as it does on the front so I'd
be using the audio out on the rear as I
think that's where the headphone amp
goes to anyway so some other words in
the past they only go to the front audio
out which is a bummer because I like
using my rear audio out as I don't have
a front audio out on my board as well so
anyway that being said let's move on now
to a quick look at the BIOS and then we
will move on to the actual audio test
and then I'll quickly do a USB 3.1 test
for you guys as well so we'll take a
quick look at the asrock UEFI bars for
the extreme 6 3.1 and now it's very
intricate just like the other asrock x99
boards i've reviewed this one has a blue
and black theme it's got all these
different options that any enthusiast
would appreciate you can even disable
cause disabled hyper-threading if you
want to you can change all your RAM
timings even advanced Ram timers you can
also change the actual individual stick
voltage dim voltages themselves so if
you want this particular Ram to have
more voltage you can change that as
opposed to another stick of RAM so very
good for overclocking there's also the
fantastic profiles there for tuning your
fans manually from the actual onboard
connectors there so anyway that's about
it let's move on now to a sound test so
let's take a look at as rocks onboard
x99 purity sound - now this time I'm
recording it from the line-in over my
condenser mic which is running through a
preamp I was originally gonna record it
on this razor carcase headset but when I
did I found it had a lot of popping and
it would not give you a good idea of how
good the motherboard itself is so I
decided to just test it on the condenser
mic and just show you how good it is and
if you want to hear what the mic and
sounds like over my V motor Pro which is
currently not in my studio at the moment
then just click on the fatality review
and you can hear what it sounds like
there therefore that's worth mic in and
line in are really good they virtually
introduced no noise especially the mic
in when you got at a volume level of 50
plus 20 dB it's you know with noise
suppression off which I
like noise suppression I try to have it
off if I can and it's a really good job
on those two ports the audio out as well
great volume levels there great clarity
it's you know the bass roll-off is not
as it's like some of the best for an
onboard audio solution and so overall
they've got they've done it really well
there is one negative about the onboard
audio and this is pretty much with every
on board on its solution of her to date
is that there is a bit of crosstalk it's
not going to be as good as something
like an and as easier 7k but I don't
expect it to be that's like $100 decamp
solution dedicated DAC and solution I
don't expect them to put that on a $250
motherboard so anyway that being said it
is better than for instance the purity
sound to is better than gigabytes UD 4x
99 and pop Forex for example so a really
good job with their own blurry solution
I like what they've done but let's move
on now to the USB 3.1 testing didn't now
now that I did with this I couldn't
actually max the speeds on this I don't
have the gear here to actually properly
max USB 3.1 so if you need USB 3.1 then
you can definitely utilize it with this
motherboard though what I did test was I
did some real-world tests I copied a
file from a USB SSD to my mainboard side
of three SSD and it was like
instantaneous I was shocked a 1.3 gig
file was pretty much just snap it over
it was instantaneous when I did do some
benchmarks I did edged out some slightly
higher speeds on the USB 3.1 line over
the solder three lines so that was
pretty good to see I liked how I could
actually benchmark that and get a little
bit of extra speeds there there for what
it's worth if you need USB 3.1 it is on
this board you've got two USB 3.1 a
slots over that card and you've also got
a USB 3.1 C there over the actual
onboard port itself so great
connectivity there and for me personally
though I just I can still utilize USB 3
perfectly fine so it's if it's something
you need then if that's the deal-breaker
then go for it but anyway that being
said let's move on now to a conclusion
with this motherboard so in conclusion I
can only say really good things about as
rocks x99 line boards and now one thing
I do want to correct out the ways is
that
rocky knows this rumor on that as rock
is a second-tier manufacturer of
motherboards and with this x99 line
that's come through I'm gonna say that's
definitely not the case I'd say as Rock
is a top tier motherboard manufacturer
and in my case they're better than the
other manufacturers boards that I had
come through here they work perfectly
and not only that run cool really stable
fantastic onboard audio solution really
good and I see on board I mean there's
not much more that I would want from a
motherboard except some little cosmetic
things and I pointed that out those
white clips I'd like to see them just
color coded to the motherboard that's
the only negative that I can really
point out from my own personal
experience with this motherboard other
than that everything is rock-solid on
this motherboard and in the past I mean
as rock have put out those cheaper
motherboards but nowadays they're a
different company to azuz they putting
out top-quality motherboards especially
on this x99 line and I'm looking forward
to what they do with the Z 107 line and
hopefully they can send me something in
there and I'll get some skylake testing
for you done but when it comes to
components features and utility asrock
get it right that's their top priority
with these motherboards and that's what
really makes me happy as a tech reviewer
is when the company gets the product
right because hey I'm looking at my
screen like 99.9% of the time I'm hardly
ever looking at my rig so I don't care
about cosmetics at the cost of utility
and features and so this board gets it
right where it just gets features and
utility smack-bang
top priority and that's what I would pay
money for personally and that's what I
recommend people paying money for when
we compare that to the unifor for
example there's fancy LEDs on board
terrible on board audio solution in my
opinion Mike ins has noise coming in the
line in has noise coming in then you've
got crashing on going on when you're
trying to overclock your computer even
on stable overclocks
so it's good that they've got it right
here and that's what I really like big
thumbs up to asrock now the USB 3.1
that's the main feature that's added on
here so the pricing I think it's about
$300 around but a bit below that though
you are getting USB 3.1 with the adding
hard there two USB 3.1 a slots you're
also getting that USB 3.1 C put directly
on the board so you've got your options
F for USB 3.1 and man USB 3.1 is fast
it's faster than your solder three ports
that you're connecting your hard drives
to so it really is fast when I stopped
and scratched my head I was like hey
this is actually really fast so a good
job in implementing that you've also got
the adding card there so if you don't
use USB 3.1 you probably just grab the
card and sell it on eBay whatnot but if
you don't need USB 3.1 there's also this
standard extreme six out there there's
also the extreme four which would be my
would probably be my best value for
money choice because a lot of people
wouldn't use the dual ni C and a lot of
people imagine wouldn't even use eight
dims of memory so you might even want to
step it down to an extreme three but
anyway they've got all their pricing up
there they've actually got really good
pricing in Australia as well for the
Aussies so that's something that I like
that asrock are doing is they're giving
good international pricing on their
motherboards sorry that's that guys I
can't say enough good about this
motherboard or the asrock x99 line if I
was going along the x99 line from a
fresh build I'd be getting an asrock
motherboard simple as that anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this review please give
it a thumbs up if you have any questions
or comments and you probably like what
about as loose boards and EVGA boards I
haven't tried them and you know they
loose and EVGA they're welcome to send
me a review sample even if it's just for
review and I'll post it back to them so
there's my offer to you guys in the
meantime I am gonna chill out and give
you guys when work on another tech video
for you guys so if you want you can
check me out on social media if you want
to support the channel and keep its
sponsor free then you can check out my
patron as well as giving this video a
big thumbs up and if you haven't
subscribed already then hit that
