second 27-inch Korean monitor that I got
off eBay which is just a little bit more
awesome than the previous one that I got
off eBay this is the 27-inch sac WA from
cross over from a seller called dream
seller on eBay
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
techie city today I'm gonna quickly talk
to you guys about the 27 inch sack what
in the background here I'll do a quick
review on it then I will talk about
Korean panels in general some of the
risks and some of the things associated
with buying one of these panels and some
things to look out for so the 27 inch
sack will will run you up about $300
though there is an option for an extra
$10 to get the pixel perfect option
which I'll talk a little bit about later
though for the money you're just getting
panel and you're getting a lot of it
you're getting a 1440p LG eh IPS display
these things are gorgeous they're like
the best panels I've ever seen in my
life for a computer monitor they even
beat the 4k monitor that we have at work
that's a Philips so these things are
definitely really good panels when it
comes to viewing angles when it comes to
color reproduction and just comes to
getting a beautiful picture in general
so what could we talk about this monitor
and what it features and I will go a
little bit more in depth in the
conclusion as well so let's talk about
this monitor it's got a DVID only and no
scaler built in so it'll have to be
powered from your GPU directly and so if
your GPU doesn't support it then this
monitor won't work so to see which
monitors do work with this monitor then
go to the auction and check the GPU
compatibility list though I will say
that my GTX 970 supports both of these
monitors absolutely fine now another
thing about these monitors is that this
one has speakers built-in though they
are pretty bad they do sound bad I don't
recommend using them unless you are
really on a tight budget and you're
saving for some speakers so next I will
quickly talk about the gloss versus
matte thing and also quickly talk about
these two here the differences between
these two because you probably thinking
at all they look pretty much the same
and they are pretty much identical the
panels are identical the input lag is
identical except the PDC coating used on
these and that's a plasma disposition
coating it basically lets you have that
gloss look with reducing reflections and
I must say that with the Sakura I really
am impressed it's a little bit better
than the ds2 70 in that it makes the
blacks a little bit deeper a little bit
richer so if you guys are looking for
the one of the best gloss panels you can
get few especially for the money then I
can recommend the Sackler based on that
alone so then that raises the question
of witches for you gloss or matte now
some people just hate gloss altogether
they can't stand it in any conveyor
meant and that's that's a subjective
thing for me I love gloss I love it I
think the colors pop more I think
they're more vibrant I just like the
feel of a gloss panel over a matte panel
though I recently got a matte panel in
and that was the Dell and I thought that
had a really good light sort of matte
coating on it that looked really good as
well so I'm a big fan of some matte
coatings and that depends on you though
these for what it's worth are gloss
panels though there are some other
Korean panels out there with matte
coatings so if you want a matte coated
Korean panel then you with the LG 8h IPS
panel in it then go check for them I'll
put some links in the description below
let's talk about other now or things to
consider when buying a Korean panel and
now if you're in the market for one of
these things and I'm gonna clear this
out of the air straight away it's in the
sellers best interest to get you a panel
that works especially if you're paying
through eBay and PayPal and that's
because if you get a broken panel it's
not just a hassle for you it's going to
be a big hassle for the seller to
process that returned they're gonna lose
I'd say they were going to lose a lot
more money than you are if you've got a
broken Korean panel so just keep that in
mind especially with eBay's new policies
so if you're buying one of these things
I just keep in mind that I don't think
the sell is gonna deliberately send you
a screwed panel so I've got two of these
panels here and they're really good like
they've got no dead pixels this one did
have one stuck pixel when I closely
examined it that was over a year ago I
massaged it really hard got it out it's
no longer a problem so both these panels
work perfectly fine the backlight
bleeding and the other issues like
yellow tinting I think that's something
to look at I mean when I inspected both
these monitors at first it looked like
there was black backlight bleeding but
then I looked at it from a different
angle it's like okay maybe that's just a
little bit of shift I'm not too much of
an expert in backlight bleeding but for
what it's worth when I'm looking at a
normal picture on both these monitors
when I'm watching movies when I'm
watching games everything looks pretty
damn uniform so it's pretty good I mean
out of the one thing I will say about
these monitors out of the box is that
they're really accurately color
calibrated so that's a bonus especially
if you're a video editor these things
are really good out of the box the next
up let's talk about postage though this
is I think a lot of the panels would be
damaged in transit this is a huge thing
to talk about because in my experience
when I posted things to Australia
especially things over 2 kilograms for
some reason a lot of the time they've
come roughed up I posted a computer one
time and man I couldn't believe it like
the actual corner of the case had been
bent in like the corner of a case is so
freakin strong on a PC case how the
poster how it got damaged in post like
that I have no idea so keep in mind that
some of the countries in the world have
postage systems which are really
susceptible to roughing up your items so
if you're in a country like Australia
for example you may wish to ask the
seller in advance like hey I'll give you
an extra $10 can you package this thing
extremely well like better than well
because I don't want to get a banged up
panel and so I think that's a lot of the
times I think a lot of these panels come
damaged in transit as I said before so
depending on where you live I would say
take some precautions research how many
of these panels come damaged and
shipping one more thing to consider as
well is the actual item when it arrives
check out the box if the box is really
banged up you may wish to just consider
returning it then and then not even
accepting the package don't even sign
for it just say look send it back to the
seller the box is in disgusting
condition because when I got these to
both the times I got these the boxes
were unmolested they would just there
wasn't even a fingerprint on the boxes
so I mean I live in Japan where the
postage system is considered very good
I'd say it's probably the best in the
world so it was no surprise to me when
both these panels came they both worked
perfectly so that's something to
consider anyway that being said let's
move on on to a conclusion where I'll
talk about a few other things so in
conclusion the 27 inch sack WA is
amazing I mean for $300 you're getting a
lot of panel for your money one thing to
consider though is that
are some other options out there
especially the g25 7 hates you if you
live in America
this thing's recently hit the market 25
inch panel 1440p over clocks and that's
it on that note
I will say that both the panels are have
in the background here didn't overclock
that well at all the one on the right
here over clocks to 67 Hertz
this one only clocks over clocks to 63
Hertz so if you want to overclock some
of these Korean panels then you might
want to invest in one that has support
for like a hundred Hertz I know some of
them can go up to like 120 so you may
wish to consider that though another
thing on that note is that if you do get
an overclocked panel just keep in mind
that sometimes the response rates or
that the ghosting is not that good and
so if you're overclocking the monitor
you just may get this blurred image
especially I noticed it a little bit
when I was overclocking this I
overclocked at the sixty seven Hertz and
I thought the ghosting in battlefield 4
was a little bit worse than it was at 60
Hertz so I turned it back down to 60
Hertz so something to keep in mind if
you're overclocking your panel just make
it sure that it has decent ghosting
that's why TN panels are generally
considered better for a hundred and
forty four Hertz because they have lower
response times though let's talk about
quickly the monitors here they only have
one input so if you basically this input
goes out I've had an input on my monitor
go out before on my a saw and it had a
HDMI port still working well the DVI
port went out so it had a HDMI port
still works so the monitor could still
work if the input goes out on this you
pretty much fat out a lot because it's
got no more inputs so that's a negative
of only having one input I'm scared I'm
hoping that either of these monitors
don't go out another thing with these
monitors is they come with a big power
brick as well and something that I've
managed to hide even though you may be
able to see it but I've managed to hide
them and the seller does include an
adapter for your country so they are 100
to 240 volts so they'll work in most
parts of the world anyway
when it comes down to it if you get one
of these panels for $300 and it comes
and it works really well then they are
just absolutely phenomenal value for
money
I love these Korean panels so much
they're like my new bread-and-butter
I video edit on this one and I play
games on this one and it's such an
enjoyable experience
the only downside at the moment is that
they're 60 Hertz and that there's a
little bit of ghosting and though the 60
Hertz thing isn't such a big deal
because I'm gonna need more graphical
power to power it to 120 Hertz if that's
the case and if I add another graphics
card in there well then things in this
room will start to heat up it'll start
to become a toaster oven in here it's
already actually pretty hot in here 31
degrees and it's only spring so yeah I
better get an aircon in here soon
so anyway guys that's about it for today
if you enjoyed this sort of sach WA
Korean panel Q&amp;amp;A then please give it a
thumbs up if there's anything else you
want to know about the Korean panels
then feel free to drop me a comment in
the comment section below or check me
out on social media and I'll answer you
guys straightaway there for what it's
worth I absolutely love both these
panels behind me they're phenomenal
they have like I've had this one for
over a year now working flawlessly
hasn't missed a beat
I'm sure this one's going to have a good
life as well so two things quickly
before I go and I forgot to mention is
that they are vesser mountable and also
to take the stock stand off the one that
comes included with the monitor is
actually a big pain in the arse it's
actually probably the only thing that I
don't like about these monitors I wish
they would change that because it came
on both to different models from
different makers the same bad mounting
system and so you've got actually
unscrew all the screws on the back of
the panel and then get inside of the
monitor and unscrew two screws to get
the stock mount off so you can VESA
mount these things anyway also another
thing is that even though it's silver I
did take off the front bracket which is
very easy to take off and I resprayed
that matte black so it looks similar to
the other one anyway that's what I've
done for that and I'll catch you guys
later peace out for now bye so when I
first got asked to review this
microphone I looked at the website and
immediately I was like whoa I've got to
get this thing I saw that it had a ten
mil diaphragm and what this means is
gonna capture your voice a lot more than
a lot more warmth and get a lot more of
a natural time coming out of it then
something with a smaller diaphragm say
these so knees that I have here also</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
