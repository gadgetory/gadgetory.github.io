makes the incredibly popular Yeti
microphone and the Yeti nano which we
recently reviewed links up here is now
getting into the game of high-end
headphones with the LR and yes I'm going
to refer to her as a she in this review
and yes I did just assume her gender
so Ella isn't your ordinary dynamic
headphone she utilizes what's called
planar magnetic technology which puts a
magnet on either side of a plane and in
theory reduces Distortion and after
listening to these headphones I must say
my ears weren't suffering from some sort
of loud ringing and they say tinnitus is
caused mainly from loud volumes so I
would definitely agree that these
magnetic plane our drivers dramatically
reduced Distortion
though the Ella has a further distinct
feature about it it has a built in 250
milli watt amplifier which helps drive
down the resistance of the 50 millimeter
planes from 50 ohm in passive mode to 10
ohm with the amp on aka active mode and
I will say that it is basically a
requirement on the likes of smartphones
and most onboard motherboard audio for
example to have this onboard amp as
magnetic planners are usually harder to
drive than typical headphones the
amperage however is cleverly placed on
the input jack itself which you can turn
from off to on and then to on plus which
adds more low-end to the headphones
though more on this later however since
it does have an amplifier built into the
headphone itself it therefore requires a
battery but the lithium battery inside
will give you approximately 12 hours of
listening time in the standard on mode
and just shy of 11 hours in on+ mode and
that's charged via a micro USB cable
that takes approximately 4 hours to
fully charge from flat anyway straight
into the sound itself the most important
thing of any headphone well I'd like to
hope so especially with something more
expensive like the yellow that never
know RGB might be catching up nowadays
but what can these headphones deliver
for your ears here I was honestly blown
away by these headphones I absolutely
loved him but this seems to be a
subjective thing my video editor use of
for example agreed on the sound quality
but wasn't blown away by the sound
signature though I personally always
prefer a strong mid presence on my
headphones and this certainly has it I
would think of them as an upgraded
Fidelio l1 with more clarity better
transient response and slightly better
soundstage and these are a closed back
headphones so you will have a hard time
hearing anything both
inside and outside listening to songs
like filter trip like I do and certain
electronic songs like Peter Robinson
language really just made my ears wiggle
and squiggle in joy and it was like a
relaxed comfortable type of joy one that
you could listen to for hours on end
moving through to rock another favorite
genre of mine saw these headphones have
a little bit of a weakness especially
when being powered through the mayflower
Electronics DAC amp combo which in
itself has a very flat frequency
response and when turning down the
volume on the arc itself and then
turning on the on+ mode with its extra
bass on the L are made rock turned a
life so they do EQ very well however
there is a weakness to their sound and
that is the low end and especially rap
even doing the on+ deep sub bass and
long drawn-out acoustic bass notes they
just weren't hitting that hard
even though rap was enjoyable it wasn't
as enjoyable as it would be on some
other headphones for instance this is
where my Fidelia l ones would actually
pull ahead of the Ehlers though of
course what about gaming the Cisco is
the first game that comes to mind Audio
plays a huge role in positioning enemies
and coupled with the Mayflower Arc de
Kamp combo and these headphones in
passive off mode I was positioning
enemies so easy and pulling off some
great plays there definitely going to be
great for competitive gamers who like
loud volumes but don't want to damage
their ears especially on longer play
sessions this is where the low
distortion attribute of the plane are
magnetic drivers starts to make a lot
more sense compared to traditional
dynamic headphones dota 2 was also a
great example as well voices and sounds
of shadow blades going off was so easy
to position to however not all was
perfect and the balance at 1000 Hertz
was slightly off from left to right
speakers by about 1.5 decibels when
manually measured I first noticed this
when listening to some Daft Punk but I'd
like to see this balanced a little more
as it does indicate that there will be
some variance in model to model and
ultimately how the ellas will sound may
therefore actually differ slightly from
pair two pair
interesting right though anyway to sum
things up for the audio it has it all
with an exceptional sound signature that
I personally really enjoy for EDM rock
and alternative and the built-in EQ mode
on the arm plus brings rock to life
though for rap listeners and slow bass
lovers it does leave a little bit more
to be desired for me personally it has
such a solid mid presence coupled with
such good clarity that isn't too
intrusive or bright and will leave your
ears pleased for hours on end as we
mentioned before
it also doesn't spike any frequencies
and the on and on plus modes add warmth
to the headphones which really puts a
smile on my face though coupled with
something like the Mayflower Arc de Kamp
combo desktop users are going to have an
immersive experience of course this
headphone review wouldn't be complete
without talking about the build quality
this is where Ella in this part of the
review gets a name change from Ella to
Stella because the build quality is
exceptional with an all metal frame and
six different points on those frames to
adjust things it is easily adjustable
from small to big heads it has a medium
clamping force so it is easy to wear for
hours without getting uncomfortable
however it is quite heavy coming in at
485 grams and the cables included where
there are three weighing 220 grams for
the micro USB 1.2 meter charging cable
three meter speaker cable for standard
operation weighing at 30 grams and then
the 1.2 meter smartphone 4 pin with a
built-in mic and volume operation that
weighs in at 40 grams can be used with
most popular smartphones and consoles as
well with ease there is also an adapter
for 1/4 inch jack which connects on the
standard 1/8 inch jack and the cables
are all braided with their unique skin
and come in a soft velvet carry pouch
the ear cups and the top headband
feature very soft pleather and the outer
cups are made of hard plastic the logo
will also light up as soon as you open
the headphones indicating the headphones
are now switched on and if you have the
knob on either on or on plus it will be
an auto smart power saving feature so
you don't accidentally drain your
battery when you don't have to however
with the built-in amp these are designed
to be used with smartphones and
ultimately intended to be portable F
feel however I wouldn't see myself
personally constantly lugging around
185 gram neck weight and if you are
doing any sort of running or going to
the gym then with the medium clamping
force you will probably have some
trouble with these slipping off not to
mention they do feel and look a little
awkward when wrapped around ones neck
though all in all phenomenal build
quality with seamless adjustability and
functionality and they also come in that
gorgeous original black and silver theme
so here we are conclusion time and
headphones are probably the most
subjective thing in tech right here in
this very studio we had opposing
opinions on the sound signature and
listening experience that we both agreed
that these weren't really for rap
listeners and yousuf has a lot of rap
chill hop and other slow deep bassy
songs in his playlist me on the other
hand I like my music hard fast and
straight to the point and they certainly
do deliver though the biggest thing for
me is the loud listening experience
which didn't leave the ears of ringing
when I stopped playing music or went to
bed this is my first experience with
playing on magnetics and certainly it
left me impressed though honestly it or
two with the price tag of 699 US dollars
or in AHS 899 AUD it is quite an
expensive ask and you will in my opinion
want to couple it especially for desktop
use with a proper DAC amp solution which
will add more costs over those easier to
parent cheaper dynamics though just like
anything in life except of course for
Zeon's you get what you pay for
they aren't going to bring you the best
value for money but they will bring you
a really enjoyable and smooth experience
yet detailed listening experience one
that I certainly appreciated and with
all our slide I hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that grazed like button and let us know
the headphones you are banging in the
comments also have you tried playing on
magnetics did you like them hate them or
love them love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
the next one peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
