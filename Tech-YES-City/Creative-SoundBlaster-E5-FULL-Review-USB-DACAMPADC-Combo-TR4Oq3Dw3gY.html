take a look at the Sound Blaster a5
welcome back to take us city ladies and
gentlemen this is brian coming back to
you guys today with a review of the
Sound Blaster Eve 5 from creative now
it's been a little while since I've
tried a product from creative and they
definitely do know how to make some good
features especially when it comes to
gaming though I think with this product
they're essentially taking a shot at the
audiophile market so today we're going
to have a look at the unit itself what
it features how much it costs and then
we're gonna run it through some
benchmarks and I'm even going to do a
mic test for you guys and also test out
the internal mic which comes with this
product so as soon as I got the product
I noticed that it came boxed extremely
well it also came with two bands to
strap it to something like an android
smartphone or an iPhone and also came
with a Toslink cable and a red and black
USB to micro USB cable as well as an
international warranty card and a manual
to get you started also included in the
Box is a stand which will allow you to
stand up your unit as well as the
included thread there which will allow
you to screw it into a microphone stand
to use this sort of like a hybrid
condenser microphone at your desk and as
we test later the microphone isn't too
bad so looking at the top of the unit
it's got three microphone holes there
which two of them will work at any given
time it's also got the crystal voice
branding there and the sound blaster
which is branded over a sort of machined
alloy there which gives it a nice antic
touch to the product looking further
down is this wireless signal there which
lets you know that is a Bluetooth
capable device so looking at the side of
the unit it's got these assented edges
as well with the indicator there for the
battery which lights up white and let
you know how charged the unit is now did
take around eight hours to fully charge
it so off that charge it lasted a long
time I've still been using it for
probably about 20 hours now and the
batteries only gone down to two so
interestingly enough it'll last you a
long time off a single charge looking at
the side there you've got your low and
high gains there your high gain being
for high impedance headphones low gain
being for everything else you've also
got these soundblaster button there
which says sbx on it
and it allows you to toggle on the audio
processor which will allow you to get
effects like crystal voice sound blaster
surround and also bass though a little
bit on that later when we look at the
software it's also got the power button
besides that if you press it for one
second will turn the unit on press it
for two seconds it'll enable bluetooth
and then you press it for four seconds
it'll turn the unit off so looking at
the front of the unit it's got two
headphone out ports here and as you
guessed it that'll allow you to listen
the two pairs of headphones at the same
time so great if you're traveling with a
partner or something like that and
you're listening to the same music and
to the middle of that you've got the
volume knob there which is free rolling
it doesn't have a start or finish there
but when I thought about it that
actually makes sense since you plug this
into different computers the volume will
be different set at different levels so
and also when you're on the desktop it
will have a nice little UI that will pop
up there and let you know the volume
level so that's built into the bass
driver as well so as soon as you connect
that to the computer it'll do everything
for you now looking onto the bottom of
the unit you've got a nice rubber base
here with sound blaster there and this
will allow the unit to stick on any
surface without slipping so I really
like that they've done that a nice touch
to the unit so looking at the rear of
the unit you've got the line mic and
optical in so a three-way purpose prong
here and this enables you to plug in say
for instance a v-moda boom Pro which is
my desktop mic that I use for sort of
chatting to people casually and I'll
allow you to put in a line in from a
preamp so allowing you to use a
professional desktop mic now I have
tested this line in and it is pretty
much noise free so it's a great mic but
you'll have a live test on that later
you can also use it as an optical in if
you want to use a Toslink cable to get
audio into the device and I'll actually
talk about this one I'm talking about
the sound itself looking at the line
optical out here if you wish to use it
as a pass through then you can do that
with this unit to the side of that
you've got the USB host there if you
wish to use it as a USB out then you can
you've also got the USB in there which
is a micro USB and I'll talk a little
bit about this later in the sound so
ultimately it's a pretty solid unit I
like what they've done with the design
and let's go on now to how it sounds so
let's talk about the actual
specs on board this a5 for the DAC
that's the digital to audio converter
that's the signal outgoing to your
headphones this unit uses the Cirrus
Logic 4 3 9 8 which is an impressive DAC
posting some numbers like 120 decibels
of signal-to-noise ratio which means
you're not going to hear any noise in
your audio coming into your headphones
also on that note you've got the Cirrus
Logic 536 one on the ADC which is also a
very good unit in itself so you're gonna
have no noise going in no noise going
out now for amplification this is the
most impressive part of this unit you've
got the TP a 6-1 to 0 a 2 from Texas
Instruments there which will just amp
pretty much any headphone in the market
and do it really well so I all the
headphones I have here I literally
couldn't even turn this Beaulieu knob
over 40 otherwise I'd risk blowing up my
eardrums I'll give you guys a quick
noise test now
so when I tested the soundblaster 85 the
actual sound had started listening to it
I noticed that the USB was not as good
as the Toslink in for some reason so if
I was listening to this device I would
be definitely using the Toslink in and
when I did some room EQ sweeps I noticed
that the USB had some sort of
interference going on there it was all
over the place even the onboard audio
was posting better results though when I
posted the Toslink in there the results
were pretty impressive though you will
see there that does look like there's a
little bit of color in the treble
section there so it does have that boost
to the trouble though for what it's
worth this unit does sound really good
so if you've got some warm headphones it
will sound great with those headphones
now let's talk about crosstalk now
recently I tested the fatality properly
with room EQ and that posted some really
impressive crosstalk figures so did this
so we're talking like 60 DB difference
there pretty much the bars didn't even
move when I was testing crosstalk which
is very impressive it means that sound
is not going to leak from your left
channel to your right channel when
you're playing music also onboard this
unit is the sba xx1 sound processor
which processes your things like
surround sound in games and also the
crystal voice effects in the crystal
voice settings there so enough on that
we're gonna move on to the software
suite and see how this thing performs so
let's take a look at the Sound Blaster
e5 software suite not only that I'll be
using my V mode of boom Pro plug
directly into the e5 to test how good
the mic in port sounds also later on
I'll quickly change over and plug the
mic out and we can test how good the
internal mic sound though our further
ado let's get in with the software here
so you can download it just go to their
website you can download the software
very easy to navigate and then once you
get it you install it and I must say
when I first installed it I was
impressed this is by far the best
implementation of their software to date
I mean I've tried some creative
soundblaster software in the past and
it's kind of been a bit buggy or it's
been a bit ambiguous this is pretty much
simple yet it's got all the options and
features that I'd want from a sound
last a software suite so we'll go
through it and I'll explain everything
that's included in this software suite
and we'll have a look here first of all
we got the SPX pro studio which you can
actually turn on and off by pressing the
device itself or you can turn it on and
off via the software so it's your choice
basically though what this will do is it
can give you a cool surround effect
which I do like to use in some RPGs it
kind of gives you an artificial surround
sound though for my fps I will actually
turn this off and I will just use a good
pair of headphones that have good 3d
imaging so that's something that you
guys may wish to think about though if
you've got a bad pair of headphones this
may give you a bit more of a sound or
give you a bit more soundstage and maybe
give you an advantage in FPS though next
setting here is crystallizer this is the
setting that I actually like here for
sort of giving your rock a bit of a kick
I definitely like it for some sorts of
music and give you a different feel what
it's worth I don't use it a whole lot
but I do like it as opposed to the bass
setting which I don't like where it's
kind of in my opinion it inflates the
bass and makes it blow d though if
you've got a pair of headphones with
weak base and you kind of just want more
quantity then this may be an OK setting
I just do not use this but setting
personally I do however use a
surrounding crystallizer from time to
time let's move on now to the next
setting here we've got crystal voice so
you can hear you can choose between the
external mic and the internal mic which
I'm actually not going to change at the
moment because I'm recording for you
guys from the external mic here so we've
got here 66 percent this for me seems to
be the about the sweet spot where if you
blast it all the way the 100 you will
introduce some noise so if you keep it
around this setting I find there's no
noise being crowd well then no there's
no noise it creeps in a crystal voice
this is another interesting setting so
if you turn this on this will allow you
to get noise reduction so you've
probably just heard that then there will
be a change in my voice though
personally I don't use noise reduction
though if you have a bad microphone that
introduces noise you may wish to play
around with this setting personally I
don't use it so I'm going to take noise
reduction off though but here is a cool
thing about the crystal voice panel you
can press effects and then what you can
do here is you can change your voice too
neutral you can change it to a
male-to-female I actually don't know if
this will register in the program but
hopefully it does so you guys will be
able to hear if I sound like a female or
not we can also change it to deep voice
so I can sound like my balls have
dropped too much or you can just turn it
off so the settings are really good
there you've also got some other
settings there that you can EQ your mic
if you want you can play around the
volume there you can also do acoustic
echo cancellation moving on now to the
next Settings Scout mode this is
essentially their setting I'm actually
not going to turn this on because it may
interrupt with my recording it actually
did before so if you turn this on in fps
it can essentially identify those
footstep frequencies and give them a
boost which is actually a handy tool to
have I've actually tried this out in
advanced warfare and it actually works a
little bit like it's actually a good
little boost though it's nothing that
you can't do with an equaliser anyway so
it just saves you time I guess so it's
actually pretty cool moving down though
is speakers and headphones now if you
press direct mode it'll essentially
cancel out the SPX chip on board which
processes the audio tip through the
software so if you want direct mode you
can do that for just a pure audiophile
listening experience and I'm gonna say
that it does give a good listening
experience you've also got the other
setting there your s/pdif out direct as
well so great feet great functionality
there moving down a mixer you can mix
all your settings here this is basically
like your windows control panel in the
bottom right corner there this is kind
of like the same thing just through the
actual sound blaster software moving
down now to equalizer something that I
like and then you can play around with
the EQs here you've got many different
settings to choose from the presets are
all pretty cool Rock actually does a
good job on rock which I'm pleased to
say but personally I do like to leave EQ
off and play around with different
headphones for the best experience
now all that after you've configured
your profile so this is my profile for
instance and I'm just gonna go down here
I can then save this profile and I can
call it main well whatever I want and
then that is now the profile that I'm
playing with so this is really cool that
you can have different profiles set up
for instance you can have RPG and
you can change to that profile and then
you can have it with surround settings
on and whatnot so very good job there so
what we'll do now those will quickly
turn over to the internal mic and you
can see how that sounds and then we'll
move on to a conclusion with this
product so we'll just quickly do a test
on the internal mic on the Sound Blaster
e5 this time that's the mics that
actually come included in the unit now
there are three microphones on this
device with only two of them working at
a time for a stereo config and it will
change depending on how the device is
orientated so if I go up close it will
sound probably a little bit better
though if I move farther away it will
sound maybe not as strong so it's a good
solution if you don't have a microphone
and you just want to play games and you
want people to hear you so it might be a
good choice anyway that being said let's
get on to that conclusion in conclusion
what can I say about the Sound Blaster
a5 while I'm left here pretty impressed
with this unit it posted some good
figures especially over the Toslink
cable though I was a little bit
concerned about the USB figures there
they were sort of a little bit sort of
over the place there and one thing I did
notice about the Toslink it's sort of
like when I look at the figures closely
it did sort of relate to what my ears
were hearing and that was a little bit
of color and there's a little bit of a
boost in the treble there though for
what it's worth there was no crosstalk
the crosstalk was so low which is a
great thing and I would expect it though
from a product that costs around $200
though with that being said everything
else on this unit was impressive it's
like the first unit USB DAC amp ADC
combo that I've seen that doesn't
introduce delay when I was playing a
game like Call of Duty advanced warfare
I noticed that there was no delay when
I've tried other USB DAC amps in the
past I've noticed that they've
introduced some delay which is typically
why I've kept to using my onboard audio
when I've been competitively playing
games another thing that I forgot to
mention was I tried to hook it up to the
PlayStation 4 and to my surprise it
worked and it worked a lot better than
the controller did that had on or there
so if you guys are looking and you got a
PlayStation 4 and you're looking for
better audio you're looking
for a better mic in option then this
thing will serve you well with that
being said I'm guessing it's going to
work on the Xbox one as well and not
only that you can plug it into a
smartphone a Mac so it's very versatile
and I will say that the drivers and
software are really good as well not
only that's got some cool novelty
effects there and the surround feature
will work well in games so all in all
I'm pretty impressed with this unit it's
the first USB DAC amp combo that I've
had come through that's a legitimate
replacement for competitive gaming not
only that you've got an ADC onboard and
I kind of wonder why they don't
advertise the low crosstalk as well as
the ADC on the box because there are two
big things that I'm sure a lot of people
will appreciate and the ADC is not only
just the normal mic in it's a really
good noise free mic in port which will
allow you to do professional recordings
if you've got a condenser through a
preamp in the line in there so kudos to
creative for making a good solution
there's some little negatives I will
point out there is this kind of little
rattle going on there so I don't know
what's going on with that but otherwise
and that the build quality is very good
and also I will say there's a little bit
of color so if you've already got treble
heavy headphones and with that little
bit of coloring over the Toslink it will
give it a little bit more treble so
they've treble heavy headphones will
just go super treble though with that
being said nice unit good job from
creative and if you guys liked this
review then please give it a thumbs up
if you have any questions or comments
about the Sound Blaster 85 then be sure
to drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
