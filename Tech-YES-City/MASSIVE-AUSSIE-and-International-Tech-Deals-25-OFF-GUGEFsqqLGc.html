we drop the deals videos and when we do
drop them there are bargains to be had
especially if you are an Aussie but
first we'll get the international deals
out of the way with if you are on an Ivy
Bridge motherboard h61 or h77 some of
that there is an e3 1270 Zeon going for
$85 shipped internationally pretty much
an i7 2670 need an upgrade if you're in
the u.s. GT X 1080 going for 490 us
pretty good deal considering current GPU
prices especially for new GPUs and then
we've got the Sennheiser gaming headset
which is one of the best out there the
mics really good too sound quality is
amazing 148 dollars shipped to your door
and then if you're in the UK 112 quid
for a GTX 1050 and now it's not a great
deal but it does seem pretty good
especially if you're getting into PC
gaming but let's get the Aussie deals
out of the way
welcome back to take us sitting the
deals in Aussie are to be had on eBay
they've got a sale going for twenty to
twenty five percent off you can get a
free trial sign up to be an eBay member
plus and you'll get twenty five percent
off which I do recommend you guys
seriously do to get that extra discount
and you can cancel the trial but first
up here we've got a GTX 1070 TI go on
for close to five hundred and fifty
Aussie dollars once you use that coupon
code as well I think it's proxy I'll put
links in the description below for you
guys absolute bargain this will sell out
pretty quick then they go to GTX 1080
which is a little bit better but it does
come in around eighty dollars more
expensive getting close to six hundred
dollars after you use that coupon code
which again high-end gaming has never
been this cheap before now what if
you're on a hard drive and you got a
sluggish response time your computer's
pretty slow where you can upgrade to an
SSD for really cheap 120 gigabyte
Kingston SSDs going for just under 30
Ozzie same with a 240 gigabyte SSD which
comes close to around $60 just after you
use that coupon code but what if you
want massive amounts of storage but you
wanted in the SSD type well there's the
MX 500 from crucial I've tested this in
the past a really good Drive especially
for the money really good deal
considering that's completely and freely
shipped to your door but what if you
want more power and you've got more
money GTX 1080p I just go on for under
$1000 if you get 25% off and what's
better is this is a custom cooler as
well which is a good thing since the
1080i does put out a lot of heat since
it is one of the best graphics cards out
there at the moment for gaming but what
if you want to step it down to the
mid-range GTX 1063 gigabyte going for
just under three hundred dollars great
1080p gaming card especially for getting
high settings on a lot of games out
there though a lot of the times I see
people buy high end graphics cards but
they don't have the monitors to really
enjoy that power well it's all gonna
change a sub predator go on for just
under 800 ozzie you get this for close
to 750 high refresh rate 1440p also IPS
panel as well gorgeous display absolute
bargain at this price especially and
since that is shipped to your door as
well but what if you want to go to ultra
wide 1440p ultra wide 21 by 900 hertz
azouz have you covered with the design
oh this has gone for close to nine
dollars after you use that coupon code
again another bargain and now we're at
that stage where you may have the gaming
graphics card in the cart you've got an
SSD but you need a CPU and a motherboard
while AMD's rise and CPUs are on sale
and they're really good prices 2700 X
pretty much AMD's flagship eight core
sixteen threaded CPU going for close to
four hundred ozzie shipped to your door
and it actually includes a really nice
cooler to the prism RGB looks flash and
it performs really well to boot and a
great motherboard to match that RGB
bling with the cooler is the gaming
ultra x4 70 from Oris really nice board
especially coming in close to 240 or
just a little bit under 240 dollars but
what about the CPUs if you don't need
the eight core then you can get the six
core for just under two hundred and
eighty dollars which is really good if
you're just a gamer because sometimes
those eight cores and 16 threads won't
be utilized as well and you will be
wasting that money considering you could
have got away with a six core 12
threaded CPU if that's the case 2600 X
is going to be for you and over to the
Intel side of things I could really only
find a decent deal on the core i5
8400 coming under 250 Aussie dollars
includes a cool up 6 cores 6 threads
does really well in games really power
efficient you can couple this with a Z
370 killer SLI motherboard this thing
looks good it's got a nice vrm and the
boss is really easy to overclock
to even though you can't overclock on
today's CPU but you can upgrade in the
future to a better CPU that is
overclockable and that's the thing
coming in at under a hundred eighty
bucks this is a really good bargain to
be had and that about wraps up today's
deals there is eight gigabytes of ddr4
as well gone for 110 a little bit
cheaper than the retail stores so it is
technically still a deal but I will
update the description as well with more
links so if you want any of these links
