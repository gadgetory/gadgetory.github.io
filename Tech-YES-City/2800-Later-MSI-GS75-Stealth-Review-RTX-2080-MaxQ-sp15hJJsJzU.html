Euler the msi rep came to the Gold Coast
and she wanted me to show her around and
I did indeed do that I took her on a
used parts hunt but during that video
she was telling me how good msi laptops
were and my response to her was I
wouldn't know I haven't tried it yet
however at CES earlier this year I did
check out all the laptops at the msi
booth and i thought this one here the GS
75 stealth was one of the very few
systems that I'd actually be interested
in since it does have a small footprint
it is portable yet it does pack some
heavyweight hardware inside with an r/t
X 20 80 max q and also an i7 8750 H
which is a 6 core 12 threaded processor
though it is very expensive coming in a
2800 USD and 4200 Aussie dollars and
you're probably thinking like me at this
price point this thing better be perfect
and that's exactly what I'm going to do
I'm gonna put it through all the paces
testing out the monitor the hardware
inside the gaming benchmarks also tests
like onboard audio to see if this thing
is worthy of that price tag which is
already really high with outside let's
get straight into it
so we just finished out testing this
panel on this laptop and it's coming in
from a company called Eno locks and it's
a 17.3 inch IPS 144 hertz panel with a
3h hard coat matte coating on the panel
itself measuring them with a rating of
300 CCD nits of brightness but when we
did the uniformity testers going up to
441 so that's very good with only a 9
percent difference in the worst to best
lighting zones so it was very well
controlled the backlight bleed wasn't
noticeable at all and there was no
visible cross hatching with an orange
background out of the box this monitor
is set to a mode called srgb and running
it through the color accuracy test it
was actually quite surprisingly on point
with the only noticeable thing being
pretty much the white balance being a
bit too high in that of favor of the
blue levels but basal if you needed
something that could game and it was
pretty accurate for photo and video
editing this screen will definitely
deliver now looking at the total system
input lag and also the response times
whilst testing csgo with a 1000 fps
camera it can tell us both these figures
and for the average input lag we got
twenty five point six milliseconds with
a best drawer of 22 milliseconds and a
worse drawer of 30 milliseconds across
ten runs and then moving on to the
response times we analyzed this within
the same set of results and we see here
that the best frame transition is four
milliseconds worst frame transition is
five milliseconds so the advertised
three milliseconds response times aren't
too far off however it is important to
note that there is no overdrive setting
on this monitors so femicide were to
work with the panel manufacturer and
implement an overdrive feature I believe
we could get the response times down to
three milliseconds but in the past we've
seen desktop machines here come down to
as low as nine milliseconds so if I had
to guesstimate input lag for this panel
it would inherently be between ten to
fifteen milliseconds basically what I'm
trying to say is the input lag is pretty
low and the response times are pretty
good but now it's time to get on to the
gaming benchmarks since this thing does
have an RT X 2080 max-q inside which is
essentially designed for power
efficiency so you do lose a bit of
performance compared to the desktop RT X
2080 but how much performance do you
lose let's take it through the paces and
also try and over
and see what numbers we can get
so we're now finished up the gaming
benchmarks here I tested three different
games at 1080p max settings and I gotta
say that I'm not too impressed with the
r-tx twenty eighty max Q even though the
power consumption is pretty good so this
laptop when you've got the adapter
plugged in it will juice around 170
watts with the total including the
screen if that's set to the lowest
brightness setting max brightness
settings 200 watts but if we move into
the gaming numbers we can see that the
max Q 2080 is below that of a desktop
variant of the RT X 2070 and darrid said
becoming closed around that of an RT X
2060 desktop variant now for the
overclocking on this laptop is actually
surprisingly decent in that the form
factor itself is so small we've got a
two point one five kilo package and 820
grams on the adapter so it's less than
three kilograms to travel with this
thing and the size is 26 centimeters by
thirty nine and a half centimeters and
then at the front it's 21 mil tall and
then 24 milto at the back so the form
factor is phenomenal and what they've
crammed inside its just with that RT X
28 Emacs q naming scheme it's sort of
nowhere near a desktop variant of a 2080
they're like two different worlds apart
and I think it's kind of close to a $350
RT X 2060 even though you pay a big
premium to get a 28 Emacs Q in these
laptops over that of a 20 70 max q the
speaking of the noise and cooling
solution in this laptop the graphics
card maxed out at around about 70
degrees and then the CPU did go up to
about 96 degrees however it does have a
dynamic throttling depending on those
temperatures and also how many cores are
in play it will throttle the CPU
according to that so all calls in either
64 was averaging out about 2.3 gigahertz
Cinebench was getting up to around 3
gigahertz and ER these scores we got
1018 Cinebench on the initial run
followed by about 930 points on the
subsequent runs so once it does get hot
it does throw a little bit but in games
the CPU will boost up to higher speeds
to that of around 3.8 to 3.9 gigahertz
the noise itself doesn't get too loud on
Mac's fan speeds are measuring about 30
eight to 40 decibels when we're inside a
game and the fans were ramping up the
ventilation of this system is quite good
though if you are using this for long
extended periods of gaming and you are
at home for example I would recommend
getting a notebook cooler where you can
put it on the tray with the fans
underneath and allow cooling where the
bottom of the laptop was getting the
most hottest and that's where it was
during the air in and since it is very
close to the ground itself with a low
def height allowing more air to come in
the bottom would help with cooling I
believe the last thing I will note is
that the keyboard does get a little bit
hot when you're gaming so if you have
sweaty hands already the heat from this
keyboard will come out due to the
components underneath that like a GPU
and CPU pushing out heat so that will
add to the heat factor on the keyboard
anyway guys there's the gaming
benchmarks done and dusted now what I'm
gonna do in this last part of the review
is go through everything else USB 3
speeds the Knicks as well as the discs
and the audio and test that out and the
keyboard and also the onboard touch pad
to see if they do pass the tech yes
benchmark test and also will test that
battery life so let's get on with it
and now here we are with the final set
of tests and for me personally these are
probably the most important things with
a laptop it's all those little things
that matter now we'll say there is a
thin bezel on around the edges of the
screen but one thing I will point out
straight away is that this top part here
is extremely sharp to the point where
I've actually cut myself three times
during this review and then finally on
the third time I noticed oh wow
this must be coming from the laptop
because I was doing some things in
between but I never usually cut myself
with components like this so I was quite
surprised to see that this edge here is
actually very sharp and I would like to
see them just file it down so it's a lot
smoother because using a laptop you
probably gonna be in a hurry that's
probably one of the reasons for getting
a laptop and if you're quickly opening
it and slicing yourself up with like
harsh paper cuts in this case razor
sharp bezel cuts and I could see that
being a big problem especially if you're
a diabetic but now moving down to the
keyboard they've teamed up with
SteelSeries to implement scissor
switches and I must say that both the
RGB and also the feel and typing
experience on this keyboard was
phenomenal
my first time having a go at it I got
over a hundred words per minute so it's
very easy to type on I like that they've
included a full numpad and then
rearrange some of the keys to still give
you those delete and insert and page
down and page up Keys for example
however I will critique the windows key
placement I always love having that on
the left hand side having it on the
right hand side was just so awkward for
instance I believe they could have made
the control button smaller and then fit
in the Windows key on the left hand side
of the keyboard then moving down to the
touch pad that is a extended sort of
extra wide touch pad with the buttons
integrated into the actual pad itself I
do prefer the left and right click
separated from the pad itself but that's
just me personally I did have a little
bit of a hard time using it we keep in
mind I usually just plug in a mouse
wherever I go because it gets things
done
a lot quicker but if you need to use it
with just one hand and I guess I can see
the appeal with this implementation
right here though under the speaker
quality and also the onboard audio
they've implemented in audio left and
right stereo speakers and they do a
great job of just
in casual audio if you are an audiophile
you will be seeking that base and also
that detail and that's of course you're
not gonna get that on a laptop though
the onboard audio these headphone and
microphone out were of kind of a concern
here where the crosstalk levels were
just pretty much the worst I've seen to
date and I had to actually plug in a
pair of headphones and hear this for
myself
because I thought the software was
bugging out initially and sure enough
it's pretty much the left channel is
just coming on through the right channel
and vice versa so if you're gaming with
a pair of headphones on with this thing
with its own DAC and also even a DC
solution since the microphone port
itself is very shaky and when you change
the decibel gains there's some heavy
noise suppression but not only that you
can see the quick change when you do
change the DB meter is very harsh so in
other words your voice will come through
very tinny the frequency response curve
with the onboard audio after seeing the
crosstalk levels I thought wow this
might be true because they're all over
the place I plugged in an external
microphone reading just to make sure it
wasn't the line in or the recording in
on this laptop and sure enough the
mayflower decamp solution with its own
ADC onboard was showing the same thing
it was just terrible numbers coming out
of this onboard audio solution despite
the fact that they're using the realtek
12:20 which is actually a decent DAC
it's just the implementation of the amp
and also the other components on this
onboard audio needs some work or maybe
it's just getting too close to other
components and it's causing interference
anyway touching on some other things
with this laptop the USB 3 speeds are
good going over that of 350 megabytes
per second the nic speeds however with
the implementation of the killer nic
that were getting consistently half of
that of a proper 1000 megabits per
second nic solution dropping down to
half the speeds averaging out around 55
megabytes per second on a consistent
transfer speed and when I
cross-reference this with my benchmark
rig which has an Intel NIC that was
going over a hundred megabytes per
second so I'd like to see them remove
the killer NIC and install something
like just a simple Intel NIC the
dissipates however in this case they're
using a one terabyte rated Intel
solution and the speeds were actually
very impressive with the reeds going
consistently above 3000 megabytes per
second all the way through the file
transfer test and then the right speeds
even though that dropped off after about
45 gigabytes of transfers after the
burst speeds were done which was above
that of two and a half thousand
megabytes per second they did drop down
to around 1200 megabytes per second but
the consistency of the write speeds was
still there there was no big dips it was
a pretty smooth line so the actual disk
performance on this unit itself is quite
impressive and we're almost at
conclusion time but before we do we'll
go over the inputs and outputs on the
right hand side you get HDMI out USB
type C and then USB three type a you get
two of those as well as a Thunderbolt
three out move over to the left hand
side you've also got the NIC the power
adapter in and also another USB 3 a and
a micro SD slot as well as an audio out
and audio in port there's also a
security lock feature at the back
right-hand side of the laptop itself and
with all that aside here we are now with
a conclusion on the msi gs70 585 G with
its max Q 2080 and also the 8750 h6 core
from Intel and I gotta say straight away
the price performance is definitely not
here I mean if you're a desktop
enthusiast like myself you're never
really gonna get price performance out
of a laptop but I must say what MSI have
done with the form factor and also the
way they've implemented the fans and the
noise is actually quite impressive
the included 144 Hertz IPS screen is
also really good you get a webcam you
get a nice keyboard with RGB bling
that's good to type on the touchpad is
pretty good however there are some sharp
edges that I'd like to see fixed and I
think at this price point where you're
going to be spending around 2800 USD and
in Australia 4,200 for a laptop like
this I'd like to see MSI use their
economies of scale and include something
like a leather carrying pouch I think
that would really set this thing aside
just add those extra quality add-ons
with the laptop when you sell it because
all you get in the box is the adapter in
the laptop itself like to see some extra
goodies included at this price point the
implementation of the NIC and also the
onboard audio do leave a little bit to
be desired to but other than that it's a
solid laptop considering they're working
with
constraints of the max-q itself a 2080
max-q is pretty much similar to that of
an RT X 2060 at least from the testing
I've done here today and you may be
thinking well it's got the laptop CPU
that didn't really affect performance
that much since the GPU itself was
pegged near a hundred percent for all
these benchmarks that I conducted here
today and I guess that's about it for me
today if you enjoyed this video then be
sure to hit that like button also let us
know in the comments section below how
did I go with this laptop review I
haven't reviewed a laptop for quite some
time but I think I hit all the marks on
the head if you're looking to buy one of
these things and you're looking for
those details I think I gave you the
deets
but speaking of more of the dates also
before I get on out of here the software
implementations really good the way that
they've got the app running it's very
lightweight gives you all the statistics
and they read out accurately and also
the keyboard software is very good too
for controlling RGB and making your own
macros so some pretty good things
they've done here but there are some
things that we could be upgrade as we've
said before and with that set I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
