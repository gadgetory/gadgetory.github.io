video today on how to I guess what to do
to how to tame your buddies they've got
a mail and um someone asked me you know
how to tame your buddies like how did
how did you tame your buddies like that
so I basically it wasn't really me so
much but we bought them when they were
really young like I think the one on the
left was actually he was like I have
weeks home very young the one on the
right was about seven weeks but they
were at the pet store and they
interacted with humans there as well so
that was a great bonus I know after
speaking with the bird doctor that after
eight weeks if they haven't been near
humans then it's virtually impossible to
get them to become tame like this you
know where they just where they just
jump on your finger and they're really
you know that are they're really easy to
control so you know he comes on my
shoulder so you know he's really he's
not he's not afraid of humans so yeah
you're just not scared of humans and yep
he's flying now so basically if you want
to be friends with your birds you're
trying to get a get them young or you
get them from someone who has tamed them
already but yeah the first eight weeks
of their life is crucial for taming the
little ones now from here on what do I
do I'm gonna actually try and teach my
Birds little tricks and how to talk but
that's work in progress for me but
basically taming a bird there's just
there's pretty much a line and that line
is like eight weeks so if you're on that
line then great if not then
unfortunately it's gonna be a really
really hard to tame him or her depending
on what you've got it's here yeah if
you've got any questions guys leave in
the comments below of course subscribe
could keep the Brian easygoing but yeah
just basically I wanted to show you guys
about my little two birds they're
they're really tame like here's chilly
up here she's up she's a little bit shy
they still but
she's still not afraid of humans look
she dropped down hey chilli she's still
a little bit shy but she's you know
she's okay that man - chilli
come on my shoulder there we go she's
just there she's a little bit shy
probably shy of the camera didn't like
that may be but you know nonetheless
there are two healthy little birds in
there I mean I will I do plan on getting
a bigger cage soon I just got so much on
my mind at the moment so we're gonna go
get him a bigger cage pretty soon
probably this weekend and yeah keep them
happy but yeah they're both pretty tame
Birds
in the whole grand scale of things so
basically yeah if you wanted looking to
buy a budgie and you know I recommend
getting one that's been with humans in
the first eight weeks of their life or
of course buying one before eight weeks
and being spending a lot of time with
him or her so otherwise if you're after
an or eight weeks with a budget if eclis
unfortunately you gonna have a Renault
maybe if you spent like three hours a
day with the budgie you might be getting
somewhere but it's gonna be hard you
know because it's instinct habitual who
they like and who they don't like after
that eight weeks so anyway guys I
thought I'd just let you know and yeah
and uh good luck and taming your budgie
I'm gonna of course if you guys got any
hints on how to do how to make him do
epic tricks and how to make them talk
I'd love to know as well it's not okay
and that's about it but for now so say
bye bye chilly say bye bye bye bye okay
so okay guys and peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
