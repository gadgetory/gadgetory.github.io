from other countries well do you just
want to remain anonymous while you
download an illegal content or even just
remain anonymous while you're on a
public Wi-Fi connection well if the
answer was yes to any of those questions
then you might want to check out this
video when a company called IP vanished
asked me to take a look at their VPN or
private Internet access client I'm more
than jumped at the opportunity
considering I'm moving from Japan to
Australia and literally a few weeks I
thought it'd be a perfect time for me to
get a VPN so I don't get encumbered by
any of those new internet policing laws
that are coming in to astray by the now
pretty soon Japan on the other hand is
actually really really relaxed in this
regard so there isn't too much of a need
for a VPN here unless you're into some
really really weird stuff like tentacle
porn there was that aside the program
here today is called just like the
company IP vanished and is really an
absolute breeze to operate it's also
relatively inexpensive coming in at
around $78 a year
the best thing about this program all
you have to do to get on it is go to the
website download the software input your
username and password select your
country and you're now browsing the
internet through a proxy anonymously so
you can then go on torrents your IP
service providers won't known to what
you're downloading and there's also no
bandwidth on the VPN itself so you don't
have to worry about how much you
download through this VPN client another
good thing about this service is it uses
a socks5 proxy which is actually very
popular for online torrenting as it
usually allows you to connect to a lot
more people in the swamp less
interruptions and whatnot those for the
list of IP addresses there are heaps of
different countries to connect to with
the US having the most broad-based range
of selection I also found the speeds via
VPN to be quite fast when doing a speed
test also which means you won't be
coming into any problems if you want to
game anonymously or even if you've got
something like circumventing an IP ban
which you shouldn't be getting banned
and also downloading large files with
illegal content in them not like you
should be doing that either the auto
setup works really well and there's also
the option to change
IP address automatically every 45
minutes or up to 3 hours so you can have
a new IP address and feel safe at home
knowing that someone's not trying to
track you and get down and boogie with
you so all-in-all ipvanish
very simple and very effective I've
actually been using it for over a couple
of weeks now and I can highly recommend
it except for one thing and that is that
it doesn't circumnavigate the Geo
blocking put in place by Netflix and
actually a lot of different VPNs are
having trouble with this at the moment
so that's a deal-breaker for you then
you might want to look for another VPN
though if you like me and you just want
to use something that's quite simply
awesome for everything internet then
ipvanish
I can highly recommend on that note
