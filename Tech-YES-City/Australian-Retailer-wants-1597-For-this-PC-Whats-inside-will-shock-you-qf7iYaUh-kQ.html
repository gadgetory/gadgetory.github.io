myself and then I'm just a shopping
around at my local shopping center and I
went into a retailer just to take a look
at what things were like in 2019 and
some teenagers called me over they said
hey man come and have a look at this
this is a PC that they're trying to sell
here for nearly 1,600 Aussie dollars
which is about eleven hundred and thirty
US dollars and so as I'm walking over
I'm thinking to myself well it's
probably a retail they're probably
charging a few hundred dollars more they
offer the in-store warranty and better
service and they can help you pick the
PC you need and then I stopped and I
paused when I saw it and I almost had a
heart attack because this PC had a
graphics card in it there was nearly
five years old this is a GT 730 and
furthermore it's not just a graphics
card that's over five years old it's
like the lower end of that five-year-old
spectrum not to mention they don't state
which of the three models it could be
because two of them have ddr3 memory
that's right on a graphics card there is
ddr3 memory in a PC that's being sold in
2019 now some of the other specs on this
PC are questionable like eight gigabytes
of ddr4 memory and there's some other
things that we'll take a look at later
and also if you're in the market for a
brand new PC I'll give you guys some
hints and suggestions on what you can do
instead of getting ripped off like this
PC that we're seeing in the photo here
but without a side I've got a GT 740
here which is actually a step up from
the GT 730 they're putting in that PC
and we're gonna quickly boot it up and
see if it can play a title like apex
legends at 1080p high settings which I'm
sure is what you would expect if you're
forking out this kind of money on a
brand-new system let's check it out
so we just finished playing apex legends
at 1080p with the lowest settings and
we're getting around 20 fps at best but
when we got to a battle it went down to
like under 10 FPS it was a horrible
experience so forget about 1080p high
settings gaming here for 1600 ozzie
dollars what you're gonna get here is an
absolutely horrid experience and I don't
know where this piece is going and
that's the thing sure they could say
it's not a gaming PC it's not intended
for gamers but putting a nearly
five-year-old graphics card in a
computer with a up-to-date 8th gen Intel
processor and even then Intel have been
releasing their nice generation
processors this year which are better
than the 8th generation processors it
makes no sense to couple that CPU with 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory because I'm
sure maybe there's people out there that
want a high-powered office PC and they
want to do a bit of video editing
they're not gonna be doing pretty much
any of that with a gigabytes of ddr4
memory and now here's where things get
worse because maybe you like ok Brian
this PC is clearly overpriced but if it
goes on sale for half-price I might be
able to pick it up and throw some
upgrades on it and this is where the bad
news comes in because it's a Lenovo PC
and it's past the 4th generation of
Intel processors essentially after the
sixth generation Lenovo I believe put a
heap of sensors in the actual power
supply units in the computers themselves
and now this stopped people from
essentially changing the power supply
around and are putting it in a different
case where if they did that and they
managed to somehow still bypass some of
the proprietary adapters that still find
themselves with a motherboard that
didn't turn off properly or had all
these errors so this is pretty much a
proprietary system from the ground up
and then you could probably only upgrade
the memory to 16 gigabytes or maybe 32
if you're lucky and put in a
middle-range graphics card that is still
of low power consumption something like
it may be a 16 60 TI but other than that
if you guys are in Australia and you're
looking for a new gaming PC you want the
warranty
and you don't want to have the hassles
of building something yourself well on
eBay there's people selling gaming pcs
that will perform much better in games
for instance one seller for under 500
Aussie dollars which is like three
hundred and fifty US you can get
something with an rx 570 a gigabytes of
RAM a risin 320 300 X as well as
something that will be upgradable so
this sort of value for money compared to
the 1600 Aussie dollars that you're
seeing here is a night and day
difference now keep in mind I believe
with the eBay PC you'll still have to
add windows 10 on which is some
additional cost but even if you're just
after the i7 8700 you're like look I
just want to have a gaming PC with an
intel 6 core processor there's other
sellers that are selling for around
eleven hundred and forty dollars pretty
much the same thing but with a gtx 1060
so you can save nearly $500 and still
have a much better gaming experience and
who guys in closing out let us know in
the comments section below
what you think of a PC like this with
this kind of specs I think this day and
age in 2019 this kind of stuff has to
stop and now I do get it with retailers
they do charge more because they have to
employ staff their bricks and mortar
stores that require a lot more cost than
that of an online store but at the same
time this is just on another level of
not practical for anyone whatsoever I'd
even like to see them maybe put on
another $400 on the price tag and just
beef up the specs like the graphics card
in the memory then they wouldn't have
had such a problem and even the PC and
the photo beside that is still very
questionable in terms of its value for
money and I believe that PC beside it
will perform better than the GT 732 off
the top of my memory but it decides
naming and shaming the retailer I'm not
going to do that I sort of want to give
them feedback and have them read the
comments and see if they can improve on
their product because I believe in 2019
consumers are not that stupid they're
gonna see this and they're not gonna be
fooled by this and at the same time
they're just giving their own brand a
bad reputation by trying to pull off
stunts like this and when those young
guys called me over and said take a look
at this they were right this was
something that people had
see because it was a bit too much beyond
the scope of getting that extra retail
experience and without said guys I hope
you enjoy today's video if you did be
sure to tap that like button for us if
you enjoy the content around check your
