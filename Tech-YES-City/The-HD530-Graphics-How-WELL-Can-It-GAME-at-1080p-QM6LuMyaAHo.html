for you guys a lot of people were very
curious about this the G 4500 with the
HD 530 graphics onboard
that's right pronounced with a H naught
H so today I'm gonna be running some
more tests people want to see if the HD
530 could play World of Warcraft Legion
and also overwatch and I'll run that for
you guys but I'm also going to test a
single channel ddr4 memory stick versus
in dual channel to see if it actually
affects graphics performance and if so
by how much what we attack CD this is
Brian coming to you guys today with a
video on the HD 530 graphics in the G
4500 now this is a cpu that honestly is
pretty damn awesome for the money and
it's actually surprising how far those
HD graphics has come in years so the
first test I did here was WOW Legion I
booted it up 1080p settings with the
graphics slider set to 2 and I was
really shocked because this was actually
a playable experience at 1080p even with
the view distance set all the way to 10
I was getting a decent experience one
that I could actually enjoy on this CPU
if that was all I had for gaming though
when I dropped down to 720p it was
butter smooth so that was really good
moving over to overwatch that was a
similar story 1080p with the render
scale set to 50% on all those settings I
was getting around 40 to 60 frames per
second dropping that down to 720p again
increased those frame rates to a really
smooth experience both experiences which
I could handle if this was my only
solution that I had so that we have it
1080p overwatch and wow Legion this CPU
can definitely handle it now moving on
to memory for single channel versus dual
channel actually did a different test
here where I took out one of the six of
memory so essentially it's gonna be four
gigabytes versus eight gigabytes but
still I decided to boot up titles like
League of Legends and csgo which
essentially don't need more than four
gigabytes of memory and so the first
test here was League of Legends which
was the pretty much the apples to apples
because I went on the same Lane I had
the same hero and what we saw here was a
significant difference between single
channel versus dual channel on the HD
530 graphics so that was a big
eye-opener for me
because it made a big difference the
significant difference in my opinion and
then we've gone to see us go it made a
big difference in this game as well
actually being the deciding factor
between a choppy experience and a smooth
experience so it's kind of interesting
to see that if you're using the onboard
graphics you'll definitely want to go
with dual channel memory for the onboard
HD graphics against skylake CPUs though
as for the actual playable experience
this thing handled those games
absolutely fine and since it is the
cheapest solution with the HD 530
graphics onboard that's the same gravity
solution going in the 6700 C to 700 K I
was really impressed with what this
brings to the table especially when I
compare it to like four years ago I
remember building a PC back in 2012 I
think it was where I was waiting for the
GTX 670 to be released and I think it
was 2011 man I forgot then it was a
while ago but I had a 35 70 K and I
remember I built that before the GTX 670
release because you know you should
build your computers before big graphics
card releases because the prices will go
up off if the graphic card releases but
that's another story for another day but
I remember building that and then I was
like yeah they're you know the 35 semi
KS onboard graphics that should hold me
out until the GTX 670 s is released and
boy was I wrong it couldn't even play
World of Warcraft at the lowest settings
on the lowest resolution I was getting
like 15 frames per second it was just
complete nightmare was so choppy I could
not enjoy this sometimes dipping down to
like 8 or 7 fps it was an absolute joke
needless to say nowadays the HD graphics
you can actually play games on them
reliably
and competitively if you drop all these
settings down to low I know a lot of
people in the comment sections like
Brian you should be playing a 720p of
you're competitive with everything set
to low and that's the funny thing this
thing will get you good frame rates so
there you have it guys HD 530 graphics
are no joke nowadays and it's actually
good to see this is a really good CPU I
picked it up for like $50 second hand
and then I chucked it in the desk mini
so I can highly recommend it to someone
who wants to set up something like a
desk mini on a budget and have
power savings there and just have
something that's really portable sorry
guys I hope you enjoyed this video if
you did please hit that like button if
there's any questions about the G 4500
and its onboard graphics still let me
know in the comment section below and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
anyway I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
cost box especially in something like
this something like something like they
did they did that yes so I can highly
recommend it to someone who wants to set
up something really small mini power
conscious if that's even a word</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
