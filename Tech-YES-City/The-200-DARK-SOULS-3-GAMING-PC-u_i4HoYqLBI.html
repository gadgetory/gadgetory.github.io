welcome back to tech yeah City this is
brian coming to you guys today with an
interesting bill this bill comes under
$200 and it can play the recently
released titled Dark Souls 3 and as per
usual let's get on with the parts and
how much they cost and then we're going
to go to the cleanse and then the build
and then the benchmarks
you
now we could get away with just using
alcohol wipes on these parts here but it
just wouldn't be a build without a
proper cleanse from brake cleaner
so now we're just going to do a quick
boot test just to make sure everything
is working before we put it in the case
and that should be the case hopefully so
let's check it out so we just gotta wait
for a signal to pop up on the monitor
and we should be good to go
awesome we are good to go let's begin
this bill
you
Oh
so there we have it a PC that came under
$200 and played Dark Souls 3 at 1080p on
high settings with actually really
decent frame rates so I'll surprise that
what this thing could actually do for
the money and I would have to say
there's probably one of the best use pcs
I've built today especially in that
mid-range segment though another good
thing about this PC was that all those
we got lucky in that there was no
problems with the parts in general I
thought the prices of all these parts
were pretty fair when we look at that
CPU motherboard and cooler combo even
though it seemed like a really good deal
on the surface it actually had a busted
cooler and the motherboard wasn't
exactly the best motherboard for
overclocking since it had no vrm
heatsink on there as well
though I was still able to get a
respectable overclock out of the CPU and
the best thing about this whole build
was that graphics card the 7870 from
sapphire that thing went up to 1.2
freaking gigahertz then lastly we talked
about the games their Dark Souls 3
actually a really enjoyable game and I
can recommend it since the combat system
is really good then we got csgo their
high settings in multiplayer mode there
we really got some impressive frame
rates on high graphics settings at 1080p
though you're probably wondering what
the downsides are to this PC I mean I
did have to zip-tie that cooler off
which I'm pretty sure that was the
reason why the person who had it
originally would have been selling it
because it would have been overheating
without proper cooling on the CPU though
besides that everything else now works
really well and I'm really impressed
with this build so I can highly
recommend it if you can pick up
something similar anyway that's all for
me today guys if you enjoyed this video
than you know what to do hit that like
button if you have any questions or
comments about today's dark souls 3
gaming PC then be sure to drop a cone in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can and with
that said I'll catch you in the next one
