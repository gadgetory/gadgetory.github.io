that I do some things differently to
other people who build peace season in
fact it's gotten to the stage where I
have what is called the tech yes cleanse
process and when you're cleaning up the
putz
it's otherwise known as tech yes loving
where we take old dirty parts and we
make them not only look like new but
also work like new however today is
going to show you what's been updated
since last year in the year before that
but also how I build a PC very quickly
and I'll talk about the new additions to
the actual process here because if you
guys haven't seen the last video I'll
put the link up here where a lot of the
sort of improvements over the years come
down to simply efficiency because for me
time is money and basically the faster I
can hustle the faster I can get a deal
clean it up and then build that PC the
faster I can flip it so basically
everything I do on the channel here is
built around efficiency if you look at
even things outside of the channel like
my car for example I Drive a sports car
so now they can get to A to B but in
that time I can get from A to Z if you
look at the computer I use in the
background 18 core I need that and it's
overclocked so I could edit out 4k
videos faster than ever
however that aside strap on in and let's
take a look at what we've got on the
deck here but before we do a word from
today's video sponsor Skillshare is an
online learning community with thousands
of classes covering dozens of creative
and entrepreneurial skills explore
classes in everything from photography
and creative writing to marketing
productivity and more and basically the
Premium Membership you can get unlimited
access to high-quality classes from
experts who actually do work in the
field and can pass on those skills and
how they relate in a real-world scenario
for me personally I'm watching classes
on how to better my social skills on
social media since I'm a bit of an
introvert and that's one of those things
I've been working on over the last
decade for instance just me being myself
and then learning how to express that on
social media I actually had a few
barriers that I'm overcoming so these
classes have helped me out in doing that
sort of not being afraid to do it and
now the best thing about Skillshare in
today's video is that they're offering
the first 500 people who use the link in
the description two months of premium
access for free but with us said let's
get back to the tech yes cleanse now
first off we'll go from right to left if
you're looking at this through the video
is probably gonna be left or right then
this one here is an electric screwdriver
and I absolutely love these in Australia
they cost around thirty dollars in the
US this is when I actually found out
about using one of these this was back
at CES earlier this year I was in Target
and I saw they had one for around 20
dollars
it's pretty much the exact same thing
and you can twist it around to change
the angle and size it also has a little
torch on it so if you're building pcs at
night it'll then help guide you as well
as torque adjustment so you can set it
from very hard to very soft I always
tend to go either one or impact depends
on what I'm screwing in now with that
said I do have a custom extension here
that I bought from my local hardware
store this enables me to use it in
builds for screwing down motherboards
dismantling pcs but also it does come
with a lot of attachments of its own I
also have a bigger one for screwing in
fans for example and a little one for
when I'm working on graphics cards now I
will pause the video right here
and I do stress this be very careful
with these tools do not put this in
impact mode while you're screwing down a
graphics card back plate for example or
screwing the cooler back onto a GPU
as you can risk damaging sensitive
components and now I learnt this the
hard way when I was working on car parts
back in the day I actually had electric
drills there was a corded one and I
screwed down I think it was an air flow
meter way too hard and then it didn't
work after that so basically with these
how you do it is you put it on the one
setting and when you're screwing down
sensitive components just have a very
soft grip and so the actual drill will
start spinning after it's tightened it
too much that's generally how I do it
this one's also USB charged
so it's very easy to use you can charge
it from your computer and it's honestly
my new best friend this thing saves me
so much time when I'm dismantling a PC
as well as building a PC really loved
what this tool is about now right beside
that is a hex screwdriver
this is for our standoffs in the
motherboard trays since a lot of cases
will have different screws some won't
even have these standoffs screws
pre-mounted so having something like
this is so easy just to quickly undo
them and redo them as opposed to using
an attachment on a screwdriver which
let's face it is just a massive pain in
the place you don't want to go and now
the next two components beside that go
hand-in-hand
these are little snips I've actually had
these around for quite a while but I've
been using them lately because they're
so handy so quick and easy to actually
cut zip ties off and other things as
well I don't just use it to cut zip ties
I'll use it to quickly cut wires that
are surrounding the cables too if I open
up a case I just want to quickly snip
that off instead of untying it which can
save me 10 seconds at a time and don't
laugh because this is what
micromanagement is all about ladies and
gentlemen then we've got zip ties I
absolutely love these pretty much the
zip tie will do the work for you when it
comes to cable management's so you
scratch the cables together to make
things neat and also increase airflow
especially if it's at the front of the
case and use these to simply tie down
the cables and make them more neat now
beside that is double-sided tape I
actually started using this especially
in a lot of budget cases where
the SSD mounting either the locations or
the way of mounting the SSD is
questionable so getting some of this
tape is just super quick and easy slap
two quick pieces of this on the back of
the SSD peel it off whack the SSD in the
back and then it's good to go then to
the left of that is now the tech yes
loving tools these are necessary for
getting the job done but as well as
bringing the product up to pretty much a
showroom condition this one here is
pretty much the bread and butter of the
channel over time I've learnt to use
this not only to clean and save brake
cleaner which is much more expensive by
the way but also to just give it a new
look shine at the end of it now this
stuff here is non conductive non
capacitive I sprayed it many times even
on live electronics it does not
short-circuit anything so you don't have
to worry about using this stuff and
causing any damage to your components in
America it's hard to find this stuff
because it does differ from brand to
brand a lot of people are telling me to
use the ECC wd-40 but I'm not sure if
that's electric capacitive or conductive
or not maybe someone can chime in on the
comments but wd-40 itself will be safe
though people are telling me that the
American formula is a little bit too
greasy and leaf sticky residue this
stuff here is really good actually a lot
of the time evaporates but this leaves a
nice very subtle shiny coat on the
pieces that you're working with
absolutely love it especially for
cleaning - if you've got like a little
bit of dirt a little bit of grime on a
piece of hardware say for instance a
motherboard and use this and combine
with a brush make sure it's just a
normal brush and a non wire brush and
then you can quickly clean up
motherboard VR ends and things like that
and also make it look new in the process
so this is pretty much an old purpose as
it says on the thing multipurpose spray
and that it can do everything from
cleaning to finishing off a product
absolutely love it it's about four Ozzie
dollars a can here in Australia so that
would be about 3 USD now for you guys
know internationally like the UK and the
US for example good formulas to use like
this be sure to drop them in the
comments and I'll add them in the
description but if you're in Japan for
example I know CRC 556 and
solutely phenomenal to work with to now
to the left of this just like wd-40 is a
really important tool I've been using
this since I started in 2015
dismantling pcs cleaning them up and
then putting him back together these are
alcohol wipes they're pretty much the
initiation phase if you've got something
that's way too dirty and you know it's
filthy
then use these and the reason being is
because they're disposable so you just
get a heap of different dirt all on
these alcohol wipes and then just chuck
them out not only that they're really
good for just cleaning cases and inside
things that you know will just
completely mess up a cloth or it'll
completely mess up a sponge and you
don't have to go and then rinse the
sponge or clean anything up algol wipes
with the residue they leave on a case or
components will evaporate after a little
while and then pretty much leave
everything clean for either a bit of
brake cleaning which we'll get onto soon
or a bit of multi-purpose spray but
speaking of the brake cleaner this one
here is pretty expensive in a stray so
you may have noticed that I've stopped
using it as much as opposed to when I
was in Japan where I'd pretty much just
use that stuff like it was going out of
fashion over there it was literally like
a dollar fifty a can and it was bigger
than this can here but in Australia this
stuff cost around $90 which is like
seven USD a can making it quite
expensive but I do use this nowadays for
cleaning out things like dust and dirt
in between VRMs especially VRMs and also
dyes CPU sockets Ram sockets and also
PCIe slots and USB slots of the rear but
otherwise just has that gunk that you
otherwise couldn't get out with alcohol
wipes or the multi-purpose spray and
since it does have a very hard spray
pressure it is great for cleaning up
thermal paste especially if it's
metallic thermal paste around a GPU die
when you're cleaning out GPUs so
something I use also in tandem with a
toothpick since this is wood and it's
very soft it's not going to damage the
little SMDs around the GPU and I have
seen people who have posted me photos
where they've busted off the SMD s
basically once you bust these SMDs off
the component whether they be resistors
or little caps that component is going
to be very hard
Fix if you don't have good micro
soldiering skills I know for me
personally I can't micro solder if the
world depended on it
so for me working very closely around
these components I need the right tools
and a wooden toothpick and brake cleaner
is great for getting the job done and
then taking away any capacitive or
conductive elements and with that said
you could also fix up a lot of
components where someone's previously
put some thermal paste that's otherwise
capacitive and it slipped over the edges
of for instance an am-3 CPU on a
motherboard and then it's cause the
computer to stop booting once I've
cleaned it out with brake cleaner
everything's worked perfectly and that's
fine and then I've gained myself one
really good deal but now here we are
with the last component on the table
this is the data vac this thing is so
good and in fact I've used it so much
that I've had to repair the data vac
itself
it started shorting out and actually
blowing out the whole circuit here in
the house and so I opened it up and I
realized that there was a positive wire
touching a negative inside I don't know
how that happened over time but this
thing here is so good for just pretty
much getting dust out of any component
whether it be a graphics card
motherboard or a dirty case and when
people bring over their trade in PCs for
example they watch me use this thing and
how quickly this thing can dust out a PC
as well as dust filters and everything
in between is phenomenal as well as that
you can get the ESD model so if you're
worried about static electricity
building up and this thing will have you
covered now it is the most expensive
component that I've listed here on the
desk they come in at around 80 US
dollars if you're in Australia they do
cost quite a bit more since they have to
convert it from 110 volt to 230 volt I
managed to get this from PC case gear
and it's been good ever since I've got
it now another thing I do as well when
I'm finishing off a product and I don't
have enough time to use some CK
underwear I use the multi-purpose spray
combined with the data vac to give it a
quick once-over and that really brings
out things like motherboards say for
instance there's sharp edges and things
like that and you don't want to touch it
brings it up looking like brand new
pretty quickly so absolutely love the
data vac beautiful tool to have in your
inventory now with all this out the way
I thought I'd put these
to good use here today and quickly
dismantle a PC as well as put it
together and make it look like brand-new
for you guys just to show you how quick
the tech yes process is so what are we
waiting for
let's get that music rolling and those
computers built
so there it all is we've built this PC
all in an afternoon and the Sun hasn't
even gone down yet that's what it's all
about it take our city is saving time as
we sit in the intro timers money so
we've got to get the best looking
product built as quick as possible and
all these tools that I've showed you
here today are all part of making you a
more efficient PC builder but with that
aside there's also some things that I
forgot to mention before and that is the
silicon here this stuff is when you're
in a real tight situation last resort
and you've got a few hours to spare
usually when I use this it'll be when a
screws cross-threaded or something like
that I'll stick it down leave it
overnight and the pipe will be working
perfectly
then of course we've got the hammer you
can never forget the hammer when you
just need to bash things this is always
a good tool to have and then we've got
the thermal paste at the moment I'm
using the corsair TM 30 they are a
sponsor of the channel it's doing an
okay job I would like to see a little
bit more viscosity in this stuff just to
quickly - it down it is non capacitive
non conductive which I wish they'd say
on the packaging itself since a lot of
people do need to know this when they
are using thermal paste but in terms of
mx4 that stuff's pretty good I've also
got a video coming in the next few weeks
where I'll be testing out all the
thermal paste for you guys making
recommendations on which one's the best
performance making some recommendations
on which one's the best for Hustler's so
stay tuned for that and then of course
we've got the pliers this is such a good
tool believe it or not just for doing
little nitty-gritty things especially if
you need to take things off bend things
into place or something stuck and of
course you don't want to potentially cut
yourself like I did in a video last year
and you guys that's it for the tech yes
2019 hustlers process if you enjoyed
this video then be sure to hit that like
button also if you want to learn more
skills outside of PC building then check
out today's video sponsor skill share
links in the description below and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
