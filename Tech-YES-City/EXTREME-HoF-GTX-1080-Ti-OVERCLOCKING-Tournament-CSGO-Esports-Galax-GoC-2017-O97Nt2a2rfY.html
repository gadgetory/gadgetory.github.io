Plaza and actually did they use PC parts
hunt here recently a few days ago but
today is the gal axe OC event or the
overclocking carnival they've also got
the galaxy sports carnival going on at
the same time so with all that aside
let's go inside and find out what
extreme graphics card overclocking is
all about with liquid nitrogen today was
an epic event that served two purposes
but the typical hallmark that any tech
event should definitely incorporate
first off we had random scrubs getting
pwned in pub G competing for Galax
Kravis cards then there were hot models
showing off all the lineup of products
that Galax had on display some of which
I have never even seen before ranging
from SSDs to thunderbolt connected
external gtx 1060 enclosures then there
was two tournaments 1a csgo tournament
and the other and extreme graphics card
overclocking event partaking on the main
floor both featured enthusiastic
announcers in a massive big screen to
see all the action happening live and
there were plenty of seats available to
there more on that later
the first event the extreme hall of fame
overclocking competition featured ln2
which is a liquid used to cool down
components to extreme levels so that the
silicon doesn't warp when temperatures
get too hot and this was an event that
really holds true to the enthusiasts
nature of Technology and is sadly one of
the last few live competitive
overclocking events that exists in the
world especially for graphics cards MSI
and gigabyte etc have stopped doing
these events which is quite sad since
the competitive atmosphere here was so
intense and you definitely know that to
be true when guys are working up a sweat
around liquid nitrogen which cools
graphics cards anywhere down to minus
190 degrees however coming into this
event there were 12 contestants who made
it through the pre qualifiers and it was
their job to get the top scores across
four different benchmarks these being x
by x by extreme GPU pi - one b and
Geekbench
all four benchmarks definitely threw a
curveball in every direction - the
overclockers
as they all behave differently and
stressed not just the GPU but also the
cpu in different ways so it is important
that the overclockers learn their gear
fire
and then implement the best overclock to
get the best score in that benchmark and
in this case they were all provided at
GTX 1080i Hall of Fame graphics god
galux ddr4 memory yes you heard that
right Galax do make ddr4 memory a 77040
X CPU and an intact 1300 watt power
supply the contestants were all allowed
to bring their own motherboards but it
was interesting to see that practically
all contestants were using the exact
same X 299 board this is the Zeus apex
though basically with this competition
some competitors were going very hard
from the start
hairdryers in hand temp sensors all
ready to go though one competitor just
had it going on that day and that was
Alex Rowe who really took the ball and
ran with it from the start of the
competition other competitors ran into
crazy problems with things like USB
ports blowing out cold boots and weird
press problems that stopped them from
finishing the race and honestly this is
what makes competition like this so much
fun to observe and with only 5 hours to
learn their gear and also overcome bugs
and work within a limited time frame the
competition was fierce and for me
personally it opened up my eyes to just
how overclocking just like anything else
competitive should be considered a sport
it requires an immense amount of skill
and learning as well as being fast on
the hands things like pouring ln2 in a
certain way spreading pace with the
perfect amount and covering your gear
with the right materials can mean the
difference between getting that world
record or even winning that round and
scoring the victory and with 5000 USD on
the line for first place it is easy to
see how this would encourage the
contestants to be even more competitive
on the day seriously though if you ever
have one of these events that is local
to you and appreciate overclocking then
you have to make a reservation to go
check it out the galaxy overclocking
carnival was a blast it was also good to
see world records being broken too and
this was done on the Galaxy GT X 1080 TI
hall of fame graphics card which Galax
put a lot of hard work and time and
effort into making sure that a cannoli
overclocked to extreme levels but also
making sure the cards don't clunk out
when under pressure it also isn't
uncommon to see these cards burning more
than 700 watts power on their own it is
also great to see galaxy graphics cards
doing so well in Asia too and with
graphics cards that can withstand
over 40 degrees ambient temperatures day
and day out it is easy to see why also a
fun fact live Galax is that they
actually called KF a2 in Europe and this
was because they couldn't trademark the
word Galax so they have two brand names
under the same company though besides
overclocking in the half there was also
a judge panel that consisted of three
talented individuals first Posse from
future mark yes the guy that pioneered
3d my fire strike my favorite synthetic
of all time
they're also kind enough to hint that
there will be another benchmark dropping
in 2018 so stay tuned for that
then there was peter from hardware bot
which is software that is used to
validate hardware and also overclocking
world records
peter was very friendly and kind enough
to take some time to talk to me through
the challenges and obstacles faced by
overclockers and also provided me with a
lot of substance for today's video thank
you Peter
Laz was mad from Galax it was part of
the Hall of Fame development team and is
responsible for making the Hall of Fame
products as good as they are today it
was also extremely friendly and all
three of the judges made sure the
overclocks were confirmed and validated
before posting scores on the scoreboard
though also did get some time out with
Matt and other execs of the Galaxy
company and here's what they had to say
so now we're in the conference room of
the galaxy vent here and I'm joined by
Matt Alex and Richard and I'm gonna
throw some kind of different questions
at them so the first being of course one
that's on my mind is why Nvidia and not
AMD I think from first day we do graphic
art we already chose Nvidia and in the
past 70 years we cooperated with NVIDIA
we are very happy so we have never think
about other choice so now that we're in
Thailand here I've noticed the eSports
is growing it's just been officially
recognized as a official sport in
Thailand and now I've also noticed when
I was shopping around here for PC parts
I think Galax is the number two selling
brand in Thailand at the moment so with
that what makes the galaxy and sell so
well here what do you think before I
think of course the products yeah
our tight end friends lost so much
just like the xof series and also our
EXO C and the X series yeah because
those product we use the over cooking
yeah an idea another brain yeah also our
gaming gear like the keyboard mouse and
also the mousepad
there people love to now also a lot of
my viewers out there they want to know
with Galax why are their products not
being sold on Amazon especially in the
u.s. at the moment is there a reason for
that and can we expect the products to
become available on Amazon in the future
yeah actually we did yeah we did it
before
yeah but because of some communication
problem yeah maybe we will soft later on
that's awesome to hear I know my viewers
definitely in America are keen on
getting a Galax Graham Scott they'd love
to try one out so that's good news that
it will become I know there's a store in
the US as well with that so I look
forward to being for it being sold on
Amazon's I know a lot of my viewers by
products of Amazon that's just coming to
Australia as well so that'll be awesome
when that hits however there is a
question I have with the chief
consultant for the Hall of Fame series
and that is mainly with the 1080 t eyes
when these graphics cards are first
released the highest performing gaming
graphics card there's usually the best
overclocking series like you've got the
lightning at the Hall of Fame however
they are usually delayed and what's the
usual delay on these grams cards
compared to the initial release of cards
and what makes this delay ensure the
quality of our performance 1080 ty which
can which is composed of a 12 layer PCB
which will probably take five to eight
weeks for production so I was 16 plus 3
faces we got a lot of assembly to do so
probably for the whole production to
complete it takes Elise at least ten
weeks so that's why we usually have a
very long production period for that
series
just to ensure performance if it will
yes so in the future with the Hall of
Fame series of space
ashle announced it's definitely directed
at overclocking extreme overclocking as
well but a lot of people also like to
buy it because of the massive air cooler
it's got three fans included and that
keeps the temperatures down they can get
good over clocks even on air is there
any plans to maybe perhaps rush it to
Marcus I know a lot of the enthusiasts
want to buy the best card day one in the
future do you see yourself releasing
maybe the Hall of Fame series graphics
cards a little bit sooner than that
usual delay frankly one thing as I said
before we want to ensure the quality of
the product okay not not being just
throw up something you were you would
need the arm a for you know you know
what I mean right
so maybe we were shortened by probably
20% faster in the near future hopefully
kill one you will see a fast production
then and see our product soon in the
market alright awesome guys that's great
news so basically Galax aren't doing
bang jobs so there we have it guys and
the final question I have is a higher
resolution or higher refresh rate which
would you prefer higher refresh rate yes
yeah it's a gamer - everybody's high
refresh rate I go to agree so now the
overclockers and the panel were hard at
work and after a long day there emerged
three winners with first place being
Alex Rowe who took the ball like I said
before from the start and just ran with
it very consistent and scored 5000 USD
in first place
second place was OGS who came in with a
smooth 4000 USD prize money and then
there was third place with Phil who
scored a solid $3,000 though the next
tournament on the floor was the csgo
tournament two teams one called beyond
op Mabel Club and the other M ith we're
playing extremely competitive and I
haven't seen anything like this beyond
was only just one match point from
winning and cleaning up the whole series
in the second round but mi th we're not
going to give up and managed to pull off
one of the biggest comebacks I've seen
the plays on both sides were really good
though I would have liked to have seen
both teams play T a little more
creatively they seemed to have both
tanked on the team matchup though
nonetheless it was
very exciting to watch the ants been on
to me and around this event galux have
actually designed their own and had on
display their mechanical gaming
keyboards gaming mice and also mouse
pads and they certainly looked and felt
of good quality though another curious
product in the line up was the XIII 70
motherboards which are circulating in
China at the moment so I'm looking
forward to seeing if they can copy the
successful gravis card formula over to
these products and release them in the
US I was in UK for example ultimately
though this was an event that was quite
simply epic there was lots of energy in
the crowd
open boost for people to play pub G on
international streamers and great
competitors and hosts that all came
together to make the galaxy o C and G EC
2017 events won for the record also a
big thanks for Galax for sponsoring me
to come to this event and allowing me to
experience the action through the eyes
of a spectator now let's finish the
video up on the showroom floor so there
it is guys we are just finishing up now
at the gala lakhs overclocking
convention here in 2017 in pancha Plaza
in Bangkok Thailand
now as for next year it is rumoured that
they may be heading to a Malaysia or
Vietnam it's yet undecided but if the
atmosphere is like anything like it was
today
then these events are an absolute blast
you'll definitely want to come check it
out especially if you're a local
I was just mind blowing live
overclocking graphics card event because
there's so many more factors to consider
versus a overclocking event out of a CPU
you have to deal with a CPU and a GPU
and actually with the GPU overclocking
is actually a whole new ballpark in that
compared to CPU overclocking you've got
to now worry about another factor
because a lot of these benchmarks that
they do incorporate sometimes GPU and
CPU overclocks so it's a very intense
atmosphere I like to think of it as like
a race course where you have to get the
best position rather than just a speed
lap where whoever gets the best lap in
terms of breaking a record so it's a
very good comparison to see this live
and see everyone just going at it a lot
of these guys were just sweating like
literally having sweat pouring down
because they were just trying to beat
the mark and you may be thinking why are
they trying to do this and the reason is
because there's five thousand USD for
first place up for grabs
there was also four thousand dollars for
second place and three thousand dollars
for third place
however events are only
made sweeter if there are World Records
broken and there was one world record
broken here today with the GPU PI - one
beast score this was done by a
contestant named OGS and he just smashed
the record however unfortunate for him
he did it after the time limit collapsed
on the competition so he did get the
world record but it didn't count towards
his final score so that may have tipped
him over the edge I'm not too sure but
that was really cool to see so the
prizes here actually trumped that of the
pro gaming event with the CS girls
really surprised the winners who were
MIT H they scored a massive comeback in
regards to the other team
beyond maple Club and they only won two
thousand USD roughly I think it was
fifty thousand Bart so the overclocking
event here for the Grammys cards had the
biggest prize pool so it was really good
to see that overclocking is a lot of fun
as a lot of fun to come to these events
and witness the extreme overclocking so
hope you guys enjoyed this video today
if you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below if there's any questions
for gal axe or if there's anything you'd
like to see in next year's event I was
just completely blown away with his
event it was a lot of fun and I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
