phone if you're looking for a graphics
card I think right now is a perfect time
to be buying a gravis card for price
performance purposes and today I present
to you six graphics cards ladies and
gentlemen six in no particular order
because they're all really good value
for money
in their own way shape and form and
these gravis cards are readily available
you can go pick up one for a pretty good
price I'll put some links in the
description below as well let's get on
with the list coming in at number 6 and
again I'm gonna stay no particular order
readily available this could be the best
deal out of all the six gravis cards
here depending on what settings you want
to play and what's your budget
now rx 470 RX v 7t RX 580 R X 480 I
categorize these all in the same field
because they generally perform similar
to each other there's four different
models and they're going out at really
good prices because the theory and
mining on gravis cards is no longer
profitable it's not a good choice
there's a sick mind is out there and
they're doing a much better job and
they're leaving the miners who mind with
grabs cards gaming grabs cards in the
dust and so this means you can pick up a
really good deal and now first of all
you're probably gonna say oh but they've
been mined on their destroyed I've been
picking up a lot of mind grabs cards and
they are really good value for money
generally people who bought them for
mining took care of them they under
vaulted them they kept them running at a
hundred percent fan speed so they were
running really cool I have yet to see
one go out on me or know of someone who
was mining or his board of mind card
have one died on them and generally they
could be under warranty still a lot of
these cards are relatively fresh but
what you can pick up even on eBay let's
take a look a hundred and sixty nine
dollars buy it now that's on eBay that's
right now nitro sapphire version as well
really good some of the best you can get
quiet really good cooling performance
really good clocks out of the box but
then we contrast that as well to some of
the deals that I've picked up recently
in this part I'll put the link up here
where I picked up an RX 480 in US Dole
terms for under $100 absolutely
phenomenal price really good deals to be
had this one is definitely worth keeping
on your watchlist and here we are at
number 5 a little bit of an
underappreciated not so in fashion car
but really good performance nonetheless
this is the gtx 750ti
it's got a 2 gigabyte vram buffer so it
will play a lot of those titles like for
night csgo absolutely fine at 1080p and
it's got more performance than the GT
1030 now it's coming in around $58
shipped to your door this is anywhere in
the world so this is a great thing about
Aliexpress you generally get it shipped
to your remote island and you're still
going to get pretty good price
performance and of course another good
thing about this graphics card is its
low power consumption so if you've got a
potato and you don't know if that potato
needs a new power play generally you
won't have to worry with the gtx 750ti
and just slot it in to any PC even those
small OEMs a lot of the time they'll fit
in there and they'll work and you've got
great gaming performance and now coming
in at number four is a little
alternative to the GTX 780 Ti and that
is the r7 260x very underappreciated
graphics card is coming in a little bit
cheaper so if you're on a real strict
budget but you want great graphics for
the money then the r7 260x
will deliver coming in again faster
performance than an r7 360 and also a GT
1030 this is bound to please a lot of
people now some of these will need a 6
pin connector as well just keep that in
mind so this is why I would probably
prefer getting the 750 Ti over the r7
260x but if you have that power supply
and it's got a 6 pin on it then this
card is definitely worth a look
especially at $50 u.s. shipped worldwide
and it's readily available and here we
are with pick number 3 the gtx 1060 of
course this was going to make the list
very popular card for both gamers and
miners this one was getting sold out
just like the gtx 1070 and we'll have
that very soon but these cards you can
generally pick them up for pretty good
prices on ebay at the moment again
they're getting sold out a good prices
in my deals hunts i've been picking some
of these up for 200
dollars which would be like 150 u.s.
I've recently got some mining deals on
gtx 1066 gigabytes and their phenomenal
performance at 1080p high or ultra
settings just like the RX 400h series
cards these are going to deliver and
because not only a mine is getting rid
of them but people may want to upgrade
to the RT x mm seriously
this is a perfect time to snap up these
graphics cards while they're being
pushed out the door in droves and here
we've got pic number two on the fence
this is the gtx 1070 and it's going for
a really good prices as well
mine is generally especially theory -
pick these things up in Mass and so now
that mining is no longer profitable
they're gonna be sold in mass so if your
wallets ready you've got a thick wallet
it's still gonna remain relatively thick
after a purchase look on eBay 289 US
dollars that's Buy It Now for gtx 1070
dirt cheap now in australia some of
these cards have been dirt cheap as well
i've been picking up gtx 1070 s off gum
tree i see a listing for 400 ozzie
similar price people are getting rid of
them maybe in attempts to get up to an
RT X 2000 series card or of course mine
is looking to get rid of old stock and
here we are with pick number one of
course the card if you want it all you
want some beast performance at higher
refresh rates higher resolutions GT X
1080 Ti the Big Daddy at least for
another few more days until the RT X
2000 series is released but here's the
thing these can be had for under five
hundred US dollars and so that's
ridiculously cheap for a card that is
rumored to perform similar to an RT X
2000 series card the 20 80 for example
now the RT X 20 80 TI we know that's
going to be quite a bit faster than the
1080 GI but that's also gonna cost a
considerable amount more money this here
at under $500 if you can pick them up
they're bargains now in Australia been
picking some of these 1080 T eyes up as
well on eBay sales snap bang use the
coupon code similar prices absolute
bargain considering we know how they
perform and to take a bit of advice from
Tom's hardware with the
hei at these prices just buy it
except we actually know how this car
performs and we know at this price point
it's really good value for money anyway
guys there's the list done and dusted I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button
also let us know in the comments section
below what's your price point for a
graphics card how much would you pay for
a gratis card to this date love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always but
also we're gonna quickly talk about the
mining whole situation as I said earlier
in the video I buy cards off miners
because they're ridiculously good prices
if the price is right and it's a deal
I'm gonna take it because that person is
I'm telling you now they're gonna be
losing money on their graphics card that
burn is already teaching him a lesson
for overpaying when those cards were
high prices and I will quickly reiterate
about buying cards off miners if you are
really worried and you don't want to buy
a card or from I don't well you want to
make sure you're not going to get hosed
then ask the minor the question before
you buy it just say was this graphics
card set at a hundred percent fan speeds
and also was this card underpowered was
the power limits lowered if they respond
and they say yes then it's definitely
worth a purchase especially if the price
is right however if that person gets
back to you and they had no idea about
those settings then that card could have
been run and for instance pre
overclocked factory cards like ZOTAC
amps and gigabyte OC models and stuff
they could have been run at those speeds
24/7 and that's generally not that good
but I don't again know any miners that
have done this with their gravis cards
so the bargains are there to be had if
you've that cautious just ask the seller
those two questions and you'll
definitely know if it's worth a purchase
or not and I hope you enjoyed this one
also there will be all the links that
I've mustered together in the
description below so if you want to have
a quick peruse for yourself then please
feel free to do so and I'll catch you
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
