joined by dennis and now one question
before we even get into any enthusiast
tech at all I've been a longtime fan of
Zeus however Dennis here says it's
pronounced many different ways with an
official ruling on the name as from four
years ago yet yes so say it with me
together a sous a sous yeah so something
we're constantly trying to educate about
now I come from IT way way way back in
the day when i bought bored so in the
very beginning I said asus and then I
came to this industry when it was a sous
but as you mentioned for the last four
years plop four plus years it's been
asus asus I don't know I've got that's
gonna take some time for me to work in a
Zeus ASIS ASIS ASIS ASIS ASIS I'm going
to try and remember that so we're going
to move on now to some enthusiasts tech
knowledge and questions here the biggest
one of my mom was the Zeus tricks really
the brand on the say that the GPU cool
is there really i mean i bought a gtx
1060 Wiles here and a gtx 1070 really
good focus on those strict schools with
that fat flat base was there anything
was that thing coming back from the DC 2
series so yeah so the strict schooling
does come in direct to you 3 as well as
directs to you too it's got the you know
the patented wing blade fans on it but
it's actually been a really exciting
generation for us because we've got a
lot of stuff that enhance what i call
gamer roi so return on investment from
the gamers point of view right so adding
things like customizable or RGB lighting
that can be synced with motherboard now
so for us like we've been doing we've
been doing gaming a long time right so
we feel that we have a pretty good
understanding so it's not lighting for
the sake of lighting right it's like a
very sophisticated look choosing the
right shade of color that you want to
match a perfect build right beyond that
we've got the first graphics cards with
actual 4-pin pwm fan headers on the card
itself so when you're really
overclocking when you need that extra
cooling you can plug fans directly into
the graphics card and map those three
the GPU temperature see that's what we
like to hear the PWM fans beautiful
design they're coming from Azusa ases
okay rewind it back a sous so we get
that i'll try to a sous i'm going to try
and get that right from here on in so
yeah I've definitely been impressed with
the cooling solutions on those GPUs the
RGB lining I know a lot of people aren't
big fans of that myself included though
the OCD market out there people who want
that new lighting on the on their
graphics cards asus is taking care of
that with the RGB lighting as you said
yeah so again it's all about
customization and personalization right
so not just having ok you have one
pattern one color and that's all you get
right so the people that want lighting
they can turn it on they can tune it to
exactly what they want and if you don't
like it you can shut it off right this
is going not just through the GPU cool
as the motherboards as well on all the x
99 lines e170 lines so is there anything
else that's going to set asus aside from
the other brands out there and really
sort of or anything in the works that's
going to really that maybe the
customization in the software or whatnot
so within or RGB space you're definitely
going to see that ecosystem expand from
our side engineers are basically working
on tirelessly on getting all that
synchronized and a lot of that is with
the mindset of like okay so if you want
the or RGB you don't want a ton of
applications open to control each
individual one right so you're
definitely going to see that space
expand as well and we were also the
first ones to actually put that 5050
header right on the motherboard so you
can easily add LED light strip and have
that sync up with everything else in
your rig definitely one thing with the
motherboards as well I've noticed the
order overclocking features very great
if you're a complete noob with
overclocking asus will take care of you
in that you just hit the auto button and
you're pretty good to go right yeah and
that was really something that came
about with all silicon really not being
created equal right like you remember
back in the day used to be able to find
an overclocking guide match all the
settings and you would be able to hit 4
gigahertz 4.2 gigahertz right it was
pretty general and you know in terms of
that but you also needed to have a lot
more knowledge back in those days as
well like a note especially with
overclocking as well but nowadays i vs
asus have the market covered if you're a
complete new bra yeah so I mean that's
where we've invested a lot in five way
optimization and particular what you're
talking about
auto tuning right because at the end of
the day like okay so there's there's the
speeds and feeds of gigahertz but we
found that most consumers are just
looking to get the performance that they
paid for right so with auto tuning you
can basically extract 95% the cpu's
potential performance just with one
click essentially and that's what people
are looking for right they just want to
know okay I bought a case series
processor I know I should be
overclocking I just want to click a
button and have it happen right and so
that process that I could take up to
like two days before to get to that
ninety-five percent level and then if
you want to you can start playing more
with ratio V Corps and like even pcl k
if you want but a lot of people are
happy with that ninety-five percent mark
right exactly Ryan that's that's what
matters to the masses if you don't know
anything about overclocking as well but
nothing I've noticed here is the rogue
series of the laptops coming out with
that big GTX 10 series push their the
desktop graphics cards coming into the
laptops Zeus are definitely taken care
of aces are definitely taking care of
that market right so we've got two
things here so ROG we made an acronym so
it's actually not raag it's ROG but yeah
we've got the Hat we've got all the
Pascal refresh laptops you're really
excited about that we've got the g7 five
tues with the the GTX 1070 this is
actually the first north american
exposure for the g 800 so that will be
compatible with the external water
cooling dock and that's running a
desktop GTX 1080 now that that is your
definite desktop replacement but like
over in the sports area for example
we've got GL 50 tues running so that's
the more ultra portable gaming laptop
that still has you know all the
performance that that you want so the
definitely the cooling on there as well
you go thats tricks design the shallow
fans as well coming into the laptops as
well specifically the the ducted cooling
so what goes out the back the exhaust
right because you don't want the heat
going into well nobody use a laptop on
their lap anymore but you know just so
it's not cooking your desk so you don't
need to have a bulky cool or underneath
it definitely all those laptops as well
as the desktops here we got the VR on
display here and all those new series
graphics cards supporting VR so
definitely this have a mini or micro ATX
size and also a full-sized midsize ATX
case coming out premades as well guess
you guys are really covering
pocket everything enthusiast yeah
absolutely i mean what we've really seen
is being the whole vr trend is causing a
renaissance in pc gaming right so people
are becoming more interested in it again
and so we're kind of here to remind them
like if you build your own pc there's a
lot of things you can do with that pc
you haven't just built a console right
and so that's super exciting for us
right no consoles no consoles but you
know on the pre-built side we do have
like the g20 right which is a small
form-factor we've got the standard mid
tower g11 and then we've also got you
know sli gtx 1080 GT 51 the beasts yeah
and also last question we got here is
the 4k seen as well as asus have any
plans to really push anything other than
i think i heard rumors about a 4k 144
hurts monitor in the works is that
obviously you guys want to get that out
in just a pstn or what not i'm not
really sure about that is there is that
got an expected release date or anything
like that no information just yet it
does kind of depend on the panel tech
but to be honest like where we meet
investments like in the ROG curb the PG
348 Q is having ultra-wide quad HD right
3440 back working 40 and the reason
that's important rice you don't run into
that 60 Hertz issue right so that that
panel that monitor can do 100 Hertz and
so that's that's really been the main
limiting factor displayport 1.2 and
being capped at 60 Hertz at 4k so once
we start moving to like DP 1.3 and
things are going to be very very
interesting than yeah that's definitely
things to look forward to from a asus
there i got to say that right i'm going
to change my vocabulary to match the
official pronunciation now i'd like to
thank Dennis very much for coming on
this interview and if you guys have any
questions or comments for either of us
about this interview and be sure to drop
a calm in the comment section below and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon any final words before
we get out of here I know thanks for
making the trip and visiting us in the
asus rog booth
the asus rog booth catch you guys in the
next tech video thanks for tuning in bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
