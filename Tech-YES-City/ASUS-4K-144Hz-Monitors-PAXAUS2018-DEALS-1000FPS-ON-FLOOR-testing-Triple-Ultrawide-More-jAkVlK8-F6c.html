booth coverage here for 2018 own tech
yes City right now we are at the azuz
ROG booth and the biggest focus here
today is their monitors on display I've
been checking him out they've got three
ultra wide synced up 1440p over a
hundred Hertz gorgeous now recently we
did a video where we looked at World of
Warcraft on triple surround and that was
awesome at 1080p on three budget
monitors this thing is next-level
to the point where I don't can't even
see out of my peripheral vision but
let's take a look at what's new on
display here with the Zeus's monitors
but also talk about the tech that goes
into them and one really good thing is
if you're at PAX Australia they've got
some really good discounts going on to
the point where if you're here on the
last day you can even pick up the demo
models for nearly half price and you all
know me I love myself a good
so right here I'm on the showroom floor
looking at the prices I can't believe
what I'm seeing here 879 ozzie dollars
which aziz are a lot weaker than the US
will pull up the u.s. pricing for you
165 Hertz g-sync Monitor 27 inch IPS
panel low input lag so if you guys have
seen the Zeus monitors it going around
they've got extremely low input lag we
took a look at the 35 inch ultra wide
that was really good not just in its
input lag but also on his response times
as well as Zeus really implement the
overdrive feature really well so that
means your response times are going to
be good on top of the low input lag not
to mention the inbuilt color profiles on
the monitors themselves look absolutely
gorgeous if you're an end-user game up
so what this means is you can lock in a
really saturated high contrast profile
and you'll be good to go now speaking of
the new monitors there go the PG to 7vq
that's going on sale much lower than
MSRP but on top of that they've also got
the r edition which is stands for HDR
now there's been a big thing about HDR
and there's a few different ways of
implementing the technology one way via
contrast but there's another way by a
multi zone lighting so I believe they're
PG to 7uq monitor which is very
expensive I mean it's coming in at two
thousand nine hundred ninety nine
dollars Aussie but this thing is 4k a
hundred and forty-four Hertz it's also
g-sync HDR as well but the HDR featured
in this monitor is the multi zone
lighting now I'm told this makes a
bigger difference and will actually give
you a really nice experience as opposed
to the other versions of HDR are going
through their other lineup of course
they got the VG series which stands for
value the G standing for the gaming
features as well things as we mentioned
before the low input lag the response
time but the V Series doesn't have the
option to enable the ultra low input lag
which is definitely a great feature if
you're a console gamer you want to use
one of these monitors but we're going
through the list they've got many
different features many different price
ranges for monitors so I think it's a
big focus of the ROG going into the
future with gamers I would notice the
difference between a low input lag
monitor and a high input lag would be
like literally over
hundred MMR and heroes in US and that's
huge going from a 1700 to an 1800
raiding bracket and that was just input
lag alone when I changed monitors
I lost my my rating dropped I'm not
gonna talk about which brand that was
started with an S but that was a hundred
and twenty Hertz and I went up from a
sixty Hertz monitor so the sixty Hertz
monitor was better in other words input
lag makes a big difference but we also
on top of that have the refresh rates
when we go to talk about you can
implement high refresh rates but if the
response times are bad as you've seen in
the monitor that I reviewed recently
then that's those refresh rates are
probably gonna do you more harm than
good because your eyes are just going to
be constantly seeing blur the whole time
you're looking at the monitor now
besides that azouz implement really good
overdrive features there you got your
pixel response times so the faster these
transition the better it is for your
eyes and also getting a sharper image so
as we've seen with a 240 Hertz monitors
there's some really good refresh rates
going on and what we can do here on the
showroom floor is actually take some a
thousand FPS footage for you guys and
even analyze it on the showroom floor
impressive what we're getting out of the
Zeus monitors is really good and then of
course to boot they've got the thin
bezels which we saw here they've got a
triple surround ultra wide display 100
Hertz monitors I was playing on this
thing jaw-dropping I mean to be honest
it's really big I didn't even think my
peripherals could see everything that
was going on and we just did this after
we did the world of warcraft bidat where
we used three budget monitors so me
coming from the budget monitors to the
triple surround altra wide I was like
damn I'd love to get on some of this
stuff in the near future so I mean I
kind of do but I don't at the same time
because if I do you might just not see
any more videos out of me I'm taking a
city so 4k high-end premium stuff is
there but it does come at a significant
cost looking at some of the other budget
choices though we look at the PG to 7 v
QR and this has the contrast HDR
implemented on it in 65 Hertz IPS panel
as well so they're going with the good
IPS panels that you've seen with those
very fast transition times and response
times cover with the ultra low input lag
this would probably be the monitor I'd
go for personally if I was looking for
high-end game
and wanted high refresh rates but also a
gorgeous picture and as we seen with the
azuz monitor reviews in the past they've
got the color profiles pretty much down
pat they're pretty accurate especially
for gaming monitors if you want to do
photo or video editing they're not too
far off but when it comes to gaming and
you want that high saturated contrast II
look they really get it out of the box
with the cinema mode in my opinion so
ROG definitely know what they're doing
with monitors anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's booth coverage of the
monitors with RG if you like this one
then be sure to hit that like button and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
