is brownies coming back to you guys
today with an optimization guide for
gamers for Haswell so I've been doing a
lot of testing in the last three weeks
and I've come to the conclusion that
Haswell is very good for games it is a
good CPU it does run hot but that all
aside it you know once you get it set up
and you get it tweaked it is a really
damn good CPU for gaming so let's have a
look at the settings here this is the
first things I've done here frame
latency test so basically if you look at
this graphic period what the hell is
this this is frame latency testing so
what I'm doing here is I'm actually
testing all these dots here are
individual frames so when you see a big
like this one here a big chunk out that
means that there's usually a micro
stutter and so this was like I think the
map was like loading up some text on the
screen or something so you can see
that's consistent through all the frame
latency testing here but you can see
that some of the frame latency testing
is better than the others and now this
was just playing with a setting called
the ring bus or some other motherboard
manufacturers called the Encore I think
of Zeus calls at the cash ratio whatever
you call it it's a setting and it needs
to be tweaked and so this is the first I
noticed with if you have your core clock
at 4.2 gigs and you leave this on auto
ring bus this produced a decent result
as we see of the frame lazy testing here
is pretty damn smooth if you now we
moved on to having the the raine bus at
the same speed as the core clock and
this actually produced the worst result
as we see here 147 FPS versus 149 point
five and not only that the frame latency
in my opinion was worse as well so I
recommend not clocking if you're gonna
clock your core clock don't core clock
your ring bus to the same speed as your
core clock that's just my recommendation
what I did find though is that having it
a hundred megahertz below your core
clock gave the best results and I tested
this a numerous times and this is what
the best result was having it a hundred
megahertz below you can see here it
produced 150 3.1 fps very good so that's
what you want to have it any clock you
have you want to have it desirable 100
megahertz below that's the best setting
now let's move on with our now we've got
that optimized core clock and ring bus
we then move on to the memory so I
wanted to test the memory how do memory
speeds relate to gaming with has well
as we see here the first setting we've
got the auto and you know the results
are smooth and then we move on to the
XMP profiles in the end we managed to
get an extra four fps and it was we see
here the lines are actually very damn
tight so the frame latency it's I mean
it's debatable which is better I
personally think the XMP profiles was
the smoothest and moving on last to my
optimal this is my tweaked 1866 memory
clock this is the one that I had this is
one that I poured it over from my SD
77535 70 K and you see here the has well
I just think it doesn't like even though
the FPS is higher at 162 the has as well
just doesn't really like the higher
memory clocks for gaming so we see here
the frame Lancie in my opinion is
actually worse than the other two so I'm
gonna test this a lot more in the next
coming weeks I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this 1866 versus 1600 but in the
meantime I'm gonna suggest maybe 1600
speed XMP tight timings or if you can
get your timings even tighter then go
for that so yeah I found that it made
you know four frame latency it made the
smoothest experience on XMP now moving
on to temperatures how this has well
behaved how does this beast behave in
the temperature Department now this is
the interesting thing our tested memory
speeds it made no difference to the core
temperature as expected the rain bus
also surprisingly made no difference in
temperature regardless of what you had
the ring bus setup as you can see here I
had my core clock at 40 to 4.2 gigs at
the auto ring bus it didn't change the
temps and when I said the ring bus the
4.2 gigs
didn't make a difference also at 4.1 it
didn't make a difference either the VR
efficiency interestingly enough I turned
the VR efficiency often boils and that
consistently made a one or two degree
difference in temps so I'm gonna
recommend if you guys are overclocking
turn off VR efficiency so for some
reason that made a one-degree temp like
consistently so that's what I found with
that and now moving on to the most
important part with as well is the
voltage versus the clock speed versus
the clocks for temps so as we see here I
have my four point two gigs at one point
one to one point one two volts this is
my four point two gig clock for this
summer maybe
an overclocked tutorial for you guys
showing you guys that that nice clock
there and we've got the four point two
at one point two four volt now when we
do that when we up the voltage point one
two volt it just increases the temps a
lot so we got there 79 degrees however
at that same voltage we were able to
manage to get four point six and when we
got four point six it only increased
four degrees which is very interesting
because it just says that it says that
Haswell is very voltage dependent so
just be careful with your voltages watch
your voltages it's the most crucial
thing for heat in Tazewell I thought
with ivy bridge I mean off my memory I
thought Ivy Bridge ran both like the
higher the clock the hotter the the core
got but also the higher voltage I
thought it was equal this is definitely
more slated for voltage so watch your
voltage carefully I probably wouldn't
recommend going over 1.3 volt that's
just my recommendation even 1.25 volt
for a 24 stable overclock 24-7 stable so
it's a one point two five volt would be
that limit if you're looking for that
nice 24/7 stable overclock obviously if
you've got like a custom water cooling
kit you've deleted you've got liquid
pearl whatever on your core and you're a
real enthusiast you're probably gonna
you know go for that 1.3 volt but yeah
be kept very careful with the voltage
and Haswell so anyway guys that's how
Haswell behaves so this is how this
beast behaves I'm gonna say in summary
and if we just go through that again I'm
gonna recommend having your ring boss or
your cash ratio whatever your
motherboard manufacturer calls it 100
megahertz below I'm gonna recommend for
now the XMP profiles at 1600 megahertz
I'm also going to recommend turning off
VR efficiency and I'm gonna recommend
keeping your voltages as low as possible
so don't use the auto overclocks on the
motherboard manufacturers because they
tend to over volt and this is it's it's
a lot more crucial on Haswell not to
over volt your cpu so I guess I hope you
enjoyed that and if you have any
questions about this guide please leave
a comment the comment section below or
if it's urgent please p.m. me and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can and if
you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and if you haven't ready
subscribe to tech yes City this is the
place of the yes may
and yes woman sorry guys I'll catch you
soon with the 4.2 overclocking tutorial
when I get some time I'm gonna go get a
coffee now it's a Saturday and 7-eleven
they make some awesome coffee here
anyways
peace out for now bate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
