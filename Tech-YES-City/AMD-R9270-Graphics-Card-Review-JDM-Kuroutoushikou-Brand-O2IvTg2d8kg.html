dark coming back to you guys today with
an AMD graphics card review this is the
AMD r9 270 now this is from a brand
called Kudo Tallchief I think and
they're a JD M brand that means they're
Japanese domestic market brand so you
won't find them anywhere else in the
world now when I first unbox this thing
I was a little bit kind of surprised I
mean it came boxed really light there
was actually like no accessories
included in the box it was just pretty
much a graphics card and a CD driver and
that was it picking up the card itself
it kind of felt a little bit lightweight
I mean I thought the cooler could have
definitely you know definitely after
pick me up this brand I can see why it's
cheap I mean it was the cheapest r9 270
I can find now I can definitely see why
people prefer to go with gigabyte or
Zeus models over this particular brand
because the coolers are just heavier
they feel better built and not to say I
mean this thing didn't feel too bad
build it doesn't rattle it doesn't shake
it feels pretty solid but it does have
that feeling of a little bit of a cheap
feeling to it so that's something I
didn't like about this particular vendor
however let's move on now we'll move on
so I've done a heap of benchmarking and
of all and I'm also going to be
splitting this video into two so I'm
gonna be doing some mantle benchmarks on
this card comparing this card against
the DirectX 11 against mantle and seeing
the performance differences but however
this video here is just the review of
the r9 270 and I'm gonna be comparing
this against the GTX 780 I know it's not
a fair comparison but I'll just give you
some reference points anyway and also
one more thing before we jump on to the
benchmarks is that the r9 270 and the r9
270x there are not many differences
they're essentially the same graphics
card just the r9 270 is cheaper and it's
clocked lower than the 99 to 70 X now an
important thing that I noticed when I
was overclocking this was actually
capped in the BIOS to 1.05 gigahertz or
1050 megahertz so it had a cap in it it
didn't have any voltage unlocked
controls so I couldn't find any voltage
unlocking controls in there and yeah
that was I guess that's the main
different
so if you want to get the maximum
potential at its card you have to flash
the bios so anyway let's move on with
the benchmarks now so for gaming
benchmarks I just decided to quickly
test to graphically intensive games they
are battlefield 4 and Crysis 3 now both
of these games are generally optimized
for AMD graphics cards as well so I
tested the reference speeds here and
we're just gonna look at the average
because the average on battlefield for
single-player was sixty five point eight
four and then the average when I
overclocked it was seventy two point
eight eight now that was actually pretty
impressive that as you can see there the
overclock pretty much scaled and what I
had the overclocked I'll put the
overclock and the reference clocks in
the description below but essentially
the overclock was about a hundred
megahertz over the reference overclocked
reference clocks so the overclock scaled
really well and you're gonna see this
throughout this whole look at these at
these scores the reference 780 lightning
I've got them confused so Indy 780
lightning reference was one hundred and
forty two point six and when I
overclocked it in battlefield 3 it's got
one hundred and fifty three point two
now for Crysis 3 when we move over to
Crysis 3 we had on ultra one times SMA
enabled at 1080p we had twenty six point
five two and also we had thirty on when
we overclocked it so again we can see
that the overclock on this card scaled
really well it was actually good I
really liked if you're gonna get an A
nine to seventy then definitely be
overclocking this thing as much as high
as it can go now when we looked at the
Crysis 3 for the Nvidia reference we had
sixty point two four and then we had
sixty seven point two so again the GTX
780 was scaling as well and was a bit of
a beast and you probably like why did
you show this well I'm just showing you
guys this is the other card I have to
compare it to so you guys can get an
idea of value for money and this card
the r9 270 definitely does stack up as a
very excellent value for money card now
keep in mind that cross is real so I
mean on ultra this thing is just a beast
so the fact that the online 270 can do
30 FPS is actually really impressive so
that was actually good if you scale
these settings down to medium or high
you'll still have a really good
experience
and around 60fps now I'm not gonna
really test 1440p because I think you
should have a better graphics card if
you want to game at 1440p I'd say
something like at least an r9 280x so
let's move on now to UniGene valley
because we've got a few different scores
here we've got the power consumption now
when I tested this I'm also going to
quickly say under idle there wasn't much
of a difference between this and the GTX
780 they both idle at around 110 watts
on my overclocked for 670 K of 4.6 gigs
and it's also overclocked
the rams overclocked to 2,000 megahertz
for these particular tests now we have
here I'll mount to so many reference it
was under load it was drawing 326 watts
this is total consumption you got to
remember this is total power consumption
of my whole rig under load when I
overclocked it it went up to 341 watts
this is under UniGene valley extreme HD
so there was about a 15 watt difference
in power consumption which actually
wasn't I mean that 15 watts is damn
worth it so if you're a gamer you should
definitely again be overclocking this
graphics card an extra 15 watts for like
an extra 10 percent performance was
really impressive same with the GTX 780
although the GTX 780 just started to
actually chew a lot more power I mean a
good shooter an extra 50 watts over the
reference speeds which was actually
pretty surprising but I mean again that
was a good extra almost 10% increase as
well so this has got kind of fair value
in total power consumption of the rig
when I'm gaming in graphically intensive
games so definitely with the uh nine to
seven you definitely do want to
overclock it and get the max FPS you can
out of this card because wont be usually
it might be using that much power let's
move on now to UniGene Valley the scores
okay so this is obviously this benchmark
is known to be Nvidia favored benchmark
so don't be too worried but I just
giving you an idea mainly of the scores
of the overclocked settings here so
essentially we had UniGene valley
extreme HD it's called a 1313 with
average FPS of 31.4 and then when I
overcooked it scored an average FPS of
34.2 so that was actually really
impressive this the again the overclock
scaled pretty much like in a straight
linear line which was actually really
good and it scored 1430 as well so as
you can see here that the overclock on
this thing was nice and smooth
something to note about about the
overclock those I could only max it out
at ten a hundred ten fifty megahertz so
it just wouldn't go over that I think
it's biased locked at that so when we
move over the 780 to the GTX 780 is
obviously a beast of a card I mean
obviously a commands a beast price as
well but when we saw the average here
it's called sixty six point six so
there's the devil's address right there
when we move over to overclock that
scored seventy three point eight this is
on extreme HD 1080p and the scores with
two thousand seven hundred eighty nine
and three thousand eighty seven
respectively so it did really well the
780 but these scores here I'm going to
be adding in the also gonna be adding in
the 750 Ti if I get to purchase it in
the near future so I'm gonna be keeping
these benchmark scores here okay so
moving on now to the 3d mark scores I
will just show you guys these score the
slides directly ignore that system infos
too old I'm just I've have a version
that's a few months old and I couldn't
be bothered updating a bit
we have either grabbed his score seven
thousand five hundred and seventy and
this is with the CPU clocked at four
point six gigs the rams also clocked at
two thousand as well 2000 megahertz so
the physics core there represents that
it's a pretty basic physics core four
four six seven TK when we overclocked
the for when we overclocked the r9 270
we saw the gravit score was eight
thousand three hundred six so it's
scaled pretty much in a straight line
upwards which was really impressive so
again you want to overclock your r9 270
if you have it the physics school was a
little bit higher for some reason this
time around as well at four point six
gigs in two thousand megahertz memory
when we move over to now to the
lightening this scored on reference it
scored fourteen thousand two hundred
eighty two not the best score for a GTX
780 but the physics score was nine
thousand two hundred eighty again it was
a little bit low this was called two for
my sis gigs and I think the memory was
at two thousand as well this was my this
is my usual here's my usual this is what
I usually run my rearguard this is my
GTX 780 overclocked
it's called sixteen thousand two hundred
and twenty one which is a beast grammar
school that's pretty much as high as a
780ti what's some of the reference
overclocked models the physics goal was
higher as well so it managed to score
nine thousand five hundred forty eight
at four point six gigs so this was a
pretty the 780 Lightning was a bit of a
beast so when it was overclocked anyway
let's move on now to the conclusion
where I'll talk about a few different
things so in conclusion this card is
great value for money I thought there
was some things that also I'm going to
talk about some little things that I
noticed jumping back on an AMD card
especially at battlefield 4 when I
compared it directly to my 780 I mean I
did put it on low settings for this I
noticed that was the occasional AMD
micro stutter I mean that still kind of
plagues the card I mean this card anyway
so there was that occasional micro
stutter and another thing as well I'll
talk about it in mantle in the mantle
video when I put this on mantle there
was some really big like drops in frame
rates that were measured on the frame
fps calculating tool so I don't know
what was going on there but essentially
it's not a bad cut for 190 dollars I
mean if you're in the States you
definitely want to get the twin frozen
model I think that's a hundred and
eighty dollars so I mean there's some
options there I'd probably recommend
sticking to a better brand this brand
here was kind of the real budget end I
mean it wasn't bad but when I
overclocked it something I didn't
mention as well as that they eat the
heat pipe here even though it only said
70 degrees this thing got really hot to
touch
this heat pipe here was like aha so I
haven't had that in my rig for a very
long time that actual really sizzling
hot touch so something that this car did
I mean I'd say it's just unique because
this cool is probably not the best but
all in all it's a good card for the
money I can see myself recommending
these things the next step up would
probably be a GTX 760 I may buy a 750 Ti
as well since I've got these benchmarks
here I can then compare the 750 Ti to
these benchmarks and another good thing
about this is is that the overclocks as
you guys saw scaled really well so if
you get a 790 you want to pretty much
overclock it to at least seven I am 270x
speeds so that's something you don't
want to do so it's a good card for the
money and I really enjoyed it so if you
liked this review please give it a
thumbs up and if you haven't already
subscribe to tech yes City and I'll come
back to you guys with a mental video
very soon anyway peace out for now and
