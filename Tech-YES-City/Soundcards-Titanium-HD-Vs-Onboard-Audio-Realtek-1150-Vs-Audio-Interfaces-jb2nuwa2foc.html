easy coming back to you guys today with
a comparison comparing a sound card this
is the titanium HD versus the onboard
audio it's a real tech 1150 versus an
external USB external audio interface
the m-audio fast-track now there's
recently been some good articles that
have come out Tom's did a blind test
article where they essentially volume
matched all their sources and they found
that people couldn't tell a difference
for listening to music between a cheap
onboard audio solution versus even like
a $2000 docking up solution so I found
that was pretty surprising in defense of
the audio files I'd like to see more
testing done and I'd like to see Tom's
to maybe allow the audio files to bring
in their best and then that would make
for a really interesting read but I'll
put that article in the description
below for you guys you can check it out
for yourself also Tek syndicate Logan
from tech syndicate with his friend I
believe called Tyler they made a video
called audiophile myths and I thought
overall the message of this video was
really good in that be careful of all
the snake oil that is in the
that exists in the audiophile industry I
believe me there's a ton of it out there
but I did disagree with him on some
points and I will elaborate on that
today in particular the sound cards
being useless I thought I did
disagree with that but anyway let's talk
about music listening first because this
is where if you're listening on easy to
drive headphones there's not much of a
difference
okay so this is the first comparison
we're going to do we're going to be
comparing this sound card versus the
m-audio versus the on board for music
and more particular listening from
headphones now when I hooked up my HD
five nine fives in stereo to my sound
card and my semi onboard audio my faster
there was virtually no difference at all
I couldn't tell a difference if there
was one I couldn't really tell now this
is a normal listening levels however
when I did got my Fidelio X once I did
notice that there was a slight bit of
bass roll-off as these are real bass
heavy headphones I could notice it and
same with my JT s5 three 5s they're
actually seismic headphones so I could
notice that bass roll if it was there so
if you guys are on easy to drive
headphones or moderately easy to drive
headphones then there's not much of a
difference to be had at all if you're
listening in stereo now one cool feature
that the sound card did have over the
other two is that it up mixes the 5.1
and I thought that this actually sounded
pretty fun and a lot of the music I was
listening to some people say this might
call the music but hey beauties in the
hot air of the beholder in this case and
I actually enjoyed the 5.1 up mix from
even just for music listening of course
I had cmss 3d turned off however one
thing that the m-audio fast track and
the sound card did do is that they had
much higher output so they could power
harder to drive headphones with more
ease as opposed to the onboard so that's
that I think that's the biggest
difference to be had if you're on
headphones now for music listening
another huge difference is if you have
analog speakers when I hooked up my
Logitech Z Falls to the sound card the
signal was so clean and powerful the
bass was just coming out it was just you
could feel it shake in my room it was
the
good when I hooked it up to the onboard
audio it just lacked that punch it
lacked that drive the onboard audio I
thought wasn't sufficient for powering
decent 2.1 or 5.1 speakers for that
model the m-audio did do a pretty good
job but I just thought the sound guy
just did a phenomenal job of powering
speakers so if you're on analog speakers
that's something you may wish to
purchase a sound card Oh
overall for easy to drive headphones
onboard audio was really good value for
money and there wasn't much of a
difference to be had let's move on now
to gaming ok gaming let's move on now to
gaming and this is a really interesting
topic because this in my opinion and
what is where this sound card the
titanium HD came to life and it beat the
m-audio fast track and the onboard audio
by a big shot now Tek syndicate they
came out and said the sound cards were
useless but they were using a 2005 I
think it looked like a pretty dated
sound card so I would like to see them
maybe go out and buy something like a
titanium HD and do some testing because
I think that will be surprised I thought
this sound card was damn impressive so
essentially this sound card had a
feature called cmss 3d it also allowed
the audio to be up next to virtual 5.1
surround now if you guys want to hear a
demo I've got a link in the description
below that tests the stereo versus the
cmss 3d so you guys can hear it for
yourself make sure that your speakers or
your headphones are in stereo mode
though if you're listening to this so
when I did this I was surprised the
positional audio of this sound card was
phenomenal to say the least I thought it
just did such a good job I can position
where people were so accurately and if
you've got a pair of HD 5 9 5 you will
know how good these headphones are in
terms of soundstage so I thought the
sound card won hands down if for gaming
the onboard audio did a good job I
thought it did a much better job than
the m-audio fast track and you're
probably like why is that they've both
got stereo I thought this had a bit of
delay I mean when I was playing friends
I was playing Call of Duty ghosts
quickly I mean I could hear someone's
footsteps and all the sudden I've got
knifed so I was like what the hell's
going on so maybe I hear some gunfire
and then I'm actually dead and then I
hear a little bit of gun fires like okay
this thing actually didn't introduce a
little bit of delay and it was pretty
noticeable so for gaming I'd either
stick to a sound card or on board audio
if you've got the money I'd recommend a
sound card because the positional audio
again I got a I've got to emphasize this
it was phenomenal I think I think
Logan's friends said that it was just
color it was useless but I got to
disagree I mean try it for yourselves if
you don't believe me because I thought
this thing made a legit difference
whatever if they if they are coloring
the sound then they're doing a damn good
job and they're doing it in the right
direction so the wind for gaming
definitely goes to the Sound Blaster
titanium HD so let's move on now to the
conclusion okay so in conclusion I will
say that sound cards are not by any
means useless I thought especially
something like this the titanium HD did
a phenomenal job of positioning it was
so accurate oh man my man my headphones
almost fell off my head when I don't
know was shocked I was shocked at how
good this thing was let's talk about
though for music listening because it is
important listening and stereo honestly
there was not much of a difference at
all there's a little bit of bass
roll-off but is it worth $150 hell no as
you guys didn't know I'm more of a mid I
love mids so I'm more of a mid
orientated person in that my HD five
nine fives are awesome headphones and my
favorite headphones so for me if I was
just listening to music and stereo I
would not need a sound card but since I
gave a lot and I like to game
competitively at least try to game
competitively something like this really
did impress me and the virtual art mix
the 5.1 was really damn good not to
mention for music listening as well I
thought with cmss 3d turned off it was
actually offered a fun sort of feature
for listening to music so a sound car
ball means is not useless so if you guys
think so then maybe I implore you to try
one for yourselves and then make up your
own mind of course if you are listening
to audio on a junk pair of headphones
then you're not going to notice a
difference at all but if you're
listening on something like HD 595 s
then I think you will notice a
difference as I did so basically you
know in a nutshell I want to try things
for myself and I think that the sound
card is not useless the m-audio
I thought this thing was useless for
gaming especially compared to the
onboard audio it introduced delay at
latency which was noticeable so I can't
recommend this for gaming it is good for
a musician and obviously a musician is
going to know who they are so that was
its kind of really I'm going to bump
this out of the comparison so another
good thing that the sound card did was
that it powered analog speakers really
well it gave them just such a strong
clean signal and so if you love
listening to music or sound from analog
speakers then you may wish to get a
sound card as well so anyway to sum it
all up sound cards are pretty damn cool
I did really like this I have tried the
creative Z and I sold it I didn't really
like the creative Z but I thought the
titanium HD I'm you know I think it's a
keyboard it's a really good sound card
anyway if you guys enjoyed this video
please give it a thumbs up if you have
any comments about this comparison
please leave a comment in the comment
section below but yet in a nutshell
beauty is in the ear of the beholder
baby so if you guys want to listen to
things and get them and then be your own
judge that's all I can tell you with
audio it's very subjective but anyway I
found in the sound
was not useless baby anyway these are
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
