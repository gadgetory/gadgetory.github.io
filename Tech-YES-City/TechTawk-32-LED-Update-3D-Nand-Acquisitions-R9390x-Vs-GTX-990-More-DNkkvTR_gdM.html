hardware store that'd just make me look
smarter there she raised my intelligence
to level 9000
welcome back to check its it is Barack
coming back to you guys today with
episode 32 of tech talk and today we
have a big episode so we wise will just
get on with it I'm sorry if I make some
mistakes and advances is quite a lot to
talk about today but the first article I
wanted to raise is LED lighting and I
know it's in Japanese but we're going to
talk about that soon because it's an
article and it's sort of an update on my
video that I made three months ago about
LED lighting and how and I sort of i
talked about the dangers of white leds
these are the leds that are going in the
back here monitors these are the leds
that are going in the house lights that
are meant to save power and all that and
the problem with them is even though
they are meting white light it's
predominantly from blue and the problem
with that is is that your eyes are used
to seeing in our green and red though
they're used to sing extracting a lot of
detail from the green and red spectrums
and so the problem here is is that when
you're seeing detail and blue your eyes
are really working harder than they
should and blue lights mainly for
controlling the mechanism of your pupil
size for example and so when you've seen
detail from this then I think your
vision starts to degrade and for me
personally I noticed that my vision I
had black spots in the middle of my eyes
when I was going to work things were so
blurry I'm going to tell you a few
months on I'm definitely a lot better
than what I was a few months ago so
seriously I've changed all my houses all
all the lights back in my house to ccfl
even the lights now that i'm recording
with their ccfl now when I'm in front of
a computer monitor like now I'm using a
blue LED protection glasses and now why
I came about this is because of this
article i think it's not particularly
this article but my arm wife came home
from work one day and she said well
there's this guy in japan he had all his
fish and he changed his led to changed
the lighting that they were getting two
leds and he noticed that all his fish
were dying or getting deformities and so
this was only in four months and then i
started researching about it and you can
see that the dangers like here's the
dangers of LED lights it's just so you
guys should get this article and have a
read because if you're in front of a
computer monitor which is predominantly
emitting blue light then you should be
protecting your
rise and that's another video in itself
right because you'll notice that I'm
wearing ten dollar hardware glasses from
my arm so 10 dolla pc glass from a
hardware store because they actually
work and that's another video that I'm
going to release soon where the results
are going to be pretty shocking I've
just got to get some more evidence and
be concrete because when I come out with
the video it's going to be again I think
it's pretty shocking anyway so basically
let's move on now to another topic but
yet in a nutshell protect your eyes if
you're if you're using white LEDs in
your house as your lighting source
change them get rid of them if you're
using a whitetail if you're sitting in
front of a computer screen like I'm
doing at the moment with its primary
source of lighting as white LEDs get
some protection for your eyes I have to
stress it like really do care about you
guys I care about my viewers I also care
about my own eyes and that's why I'm
starting to do it in the last few months
I've noticed a big difference so
seriously take care of your eyes I mean
for me personally out of the five senses
sight is the most important for me and
that's why I'm just so I guess I'm being
OCD about it but you guys have to
protect your eyes so anyway let's get on
with the first piece of tech news here
and this is an SSD endurance experiment
done by the tech report it's actually a
really good read because some of my
viewers pointed me towards it and saying
that you know not all SSDs are created
equally before it's worth the Samsung I
think the 850 pearl something did the
best but there were some real early
casualties and I'd like to look at this
because I think this is the most
important thing is which ones died first
because if you're paid money for an SSD
you want it to last and so we can see
here that the Intel 335 even though it
did sort of last long before it actually
died it started showing errors after 100
terabytes written which if you're
recording like I'm doing using the
drivers a temporary recording drive you
can't have this happening so after 100
terabytes for me this drive would be
practically useless because I'm do using
as a temporary record storage drive to
record things like tech talk for you
guys though you can see it's 600 tera
bytes written that's not all that bad so
the guy who came next was the I think
it's a kingston hyperx
that's not too bad i mean 600 terabytes
isn't too bad i could live with that
though it's still a little bit low after
a thousand terabytes though if you're
getting a thousand terabytes written now
do you drive without any errors that's
not all that bad really I'd say I'd
probably use maybe a terabyte a day and
that's pretty heavy like I'm a heavy
user probably more but the hundred
terabytes from the 335 i think we can
all agree this is the real loser heel so
I'm actually shocked because I've got
one of these drives at the moment the
240 gigabyte 335 and I noticed i did it
in the bx route 100 review recently
where i showed you guys the big graph
and the 335 was actually chugging it was
tanking man when it came to those full
hide you know well i think it was 10
gigabytes i did a 10 gigabyte transfer
where the dips in the rights were really
showing so for a professional
workstation I'd stay away from the 335
anyway let's get on with the next piece
of news here and that's AMD's going to
launch their jairo falcon actually i
don't know how to pronounce this so
maybe someone want to chime in but
they're bringing out their own 64-bit a
RM their own server sort of their own
competition to the server market with
their own Jairo Falcon sock or
system-on-chip which is actually really
good because it's starting to see the
AMD are starting to say hey we need to
get back into the game we need to start
actually producing products for the
server market where a lot of the money
is we need to start diversifying our
business so this is really good that
they're bringing out this arc addition
they already got a sample ready so this
is legit so hopefully we can see AMD
start to pull some actual legit sales
now though let's get on to the next
piece of news and as rock introduces the
fatality 970 performance and 3 plus
motherboard targeted at gamers and this
was something that I think like when I
recently reviewed the be 85 pro gamer I
was so impressed with it because I think
this is what a lot of not just a gamer
but a lot of desktop enthusiasts on a
budget would want from a motherboard you
know just you've got the room to
overclock it's got an A+ two phase power
design there so it'll be able to
overclock pretty well you've
got the purity sound on this particular
motherboard you got the purity sound too
really good on-board audio solution
absolutely phenomenal and it's all
eighty dollars so you've got a good n IC
on there as well and you've only got you
don't have to pay and video those SLA
licenses or you're not paying for xfire
you just going with a single GPU and a
lot of gamers why don't know any pro
gamer that uses sli or crossfire and a
lot of the pro games i know only use a
single GPU anyway so if you're
competitively gaming you're probably
only going to want to use a single GPU
anyway so I like it that they're
releasing these motherboards and to be
honest I really like the look of it like
it looks so plain and looks so clean I
just like to see them change these clips
and color-code the actual clips there on
the sockets that would be really good I
think this would I mean it already looks
really good and I think it's going on
sale that's recommended retail price of
one hundred dollar you can pick this
board up for eighty dollars which is
going to be my new recommendation for FX
8320 users or people who want to get on
the AMD side of things so know a lot of
people love AMD and they always want to
get there they want to get on that eight
core so if you're going to go with the
FX 8320 especially if it's going on sale
for a hundred bucks you can go get that
you can get the FX 8220 go get this
motherboard for eighty dollars and then
go get a animax t44 like thirty dollars
and for about two hundred bucks you can
have a really solid pc so that's
something i like about this motherboard
there's motherboards making things
possible so kudos to a drone I'd like to
see more motherboards come out like this
well we don't need SLI we don't need
actually no 20 sided ports we only got
you know minimal amount of SATA ports
and a minimal amount of features that we
don't I guess the average person would
only need so that's koo doze there
anyway let's look at USB 3.1 it's been
benchmarked here and the speeds are
really good like you've got more speeds
but the best thing about USB 3.1 is the
reversibility or the connectivity of it
basically you put you can put it in any
way you like you can put it in you know
I know for instance when I've been you
know putting it in in the dark it's been
sometimes awkward you know like you'd be
like oh you know you can't see and so
you got to figure out which way your
things got to go in
and no sexual references here at all
guys but USB 3.1 will eliminate this
problem completely because you can just
put it in both ways and it'll be
absolutely fine it'll be an enjoyable
experience so anyway that's USB 3.1 it's
a good thing right the speeds are a lot
faster than USB three and one thing I'm
going to say about this whole thing is I
wish manufacturers would actually start
supporting USB and 3.1 properly because
I've got like for instance the webcam
I'm using at the moment it's a logitech
c920 it only supports USB to really it
can work on a USB 3 port but it's
natively USB 2 and so I can't record
1080p roar out of this otherwise it will
start cutting because it can't actually
transfer that amount of data over USB 2
so I'd like to see manufacturers
actually support USB 3 properly because
I mean without the support like you know
bench like benchmarks like this are
really only just for benchmarks they're
not for the real world because what are
the devices at the moment is still only
using USB 2 so anyway that being said
let's move on now to the next article
and that is until gets ready for their
10 billion dollar alterra acquisition so
you can see here that until arm really
want to solidify their place in the
markets that they already have a
domination or a dominant position over
and so with it with them acquiring this
company they can use their 40 nanometer
technology and they can also use their
sort of Altera's system on chip design
and bring it together and then you've
got an even better system on chip which
is what Intel intends to do with the
acquisition of alterra so next up here
we've got Intel and microns new 3d NAND
technology which could triple SSD
storage so basically what they're doing
is they're stacking the nail on each
other and it's going to allow for more
denser nan which in turn will be cheaper
and it'll use less power though i think
the power savings aren't such a big
thing especially for home users where
SSDs are only using like 2 to 3 watts
anyway and stand by the using link once
the point 8 6 watts so the power saving
thing isn't such a big deal here but
definitely the
the cost is so I got asked from one of
my viewers are mostly Commodore 62-56
whether he should sell his SSD now or
wait and then just wait for this and
then you know obviously pick up a deal
or just keep his SSD and honestly if you
already got a 256 gigabyte SSD then keep
it because what's going to happen is
this man right it's going to be cheaper
it's going to be more cost effective
than what's out there at the moment but
you're still got to realize that all
those other costs that the cost of the
PCB the cost of retailing the cost of
shipping all those other associated
costs with an SSD are still going to
remain so all you're going to be getting
is just cheaper nan so the cost of the
SSD will still be a little bit more than
a you'll only be at best three times the
storage for that same priced SSD so what
we have to realize is not going to be
such a huge thing it will be it will be
a really good thing but it's not worth
freaking out about I mean it's not going
to magically make your current SSD
redundant don't a few years time when
its mass in mass production and
everything's getting released like this
it is the way forward but it's not I
guess it's not worth panicking over and
going out and selling your SSD just in
preparation of this because the SSDs are
still going to be expensive don't like
don't mind that I think where you're
going to get the biggest benefit out of
this is from those really large SSDs
like if you already got a terabyte
ssdnow that costs five hundred dollars
you could probably expect a 3 terabyte
SS data maybe costs six hundred dollars
I think that's where the biggest
benefits going to be appreciated from
this 3d NAND technology so anyway
netflix has been released in australia
and officially and a lot of people
really like it however there's this big
concern that it won't curb piracy
especially in australia and so i think
the question I think we're asking the
wrong question here is I mean I think
the question that needs to be asked is
is a teenager with no money who's
pirating staff or is getting free
content if he can't no longer get that
content is he going to go out
pay for it and I think the answer's no
because he's got no money anyway so I
think the problem is I think the answers
that they need to look at are a lot more
I guess they've got to research it a lot
more than otherwise what they're doing
now I think they need to offer content
really cheap for people with no money I
think that's something that they need to
do to curb piracy I mean because the
methods at the moment where yeah they're
just not working I mean look someone
with no money is not going to pay for
content because they got no money anyway
so I think that's the main question that
lobbying groups against piracy have to
ask themselves so anyway let's move on
now to the next article and that is
samsung may acquire AMD now I've been
wanting this to happen for a long time
now and I think it is the best way going
forward and especially since Samsung in
the video now have this big rivalry I
think it's great i think if Samsung did
acquire Andy it would be a fantastic
thing for the tech community for the
enthusiast community especially people
who love AMD graphics cards I think
because Samsung would put a lot of
backing behind that however I don't
think in reality i mean i think it's
just rumors at the moment i don't think
it's gaining any real traction i mean if
we look at the share prices of AMD
shares they're moving nowhere there's
nothing to suggest takeover of any sort
and then there's a lot of other
questions that viewers have raised as
well what happens with the x64 licensing
there you know there's there's other
questions that need to be raised and I
don't think at the moment it's not
looking like it's a reality if we look
at alterra for instance the company that
Intel acquired you can see that huge
jump there you can see that massive jump
that's the that's the news actually
having you know that's the news being
true right so you can see there are 10
nothing it's like a ten-dollar jump in
the share prices so that reflects a
takeover generally as opposed to AMD
which we're not seeing much at all here
there's nothing happening though if the
price does get cheap enough maybe
Samsung will consider a choir I mean I
hope I'm just
full of this and I'm sure a lot of other
people are because they know that AMD
are falling behind i'll talk about this
a little bit later but let's move on now
to free sync versus juicing where i'm
going to actually say a lot of good
about andy and that is free since been
released and pc perspective and this
time I'm going to directly quote their
article sorry for the previous time
where it didn't directly quote their
article but because they make really
good stuff they make this is a fantastic
article I recommend you go read it but
if you don't have time then i'll quickly
detail it for you and basically what's
happening is that when free sinks
working it's working really good when
g-sync works it works really good
however below a certain i think it's 37
frames on g sink and on freezing it's
currently 40 FPS or 40 Hertz when the
frames go below that the monitor doesn't
on free sink is specifically the monitor
doesn't change at all and so below 40
Hertz you're getting a bad gaming
experience and sometimes worse because
the refresh rate of your monitors now 40
Hertz instead of 60 hertz and that's
something that they pointed out it
wasn't a good experience under 40 Hertz
g-sync on the other hand below 37 hurts
it starts doing a unique thing and that
it starts duplicating frames to fold and
then below i think it's like 19 or
something like that it starts tripling
the duplicate frames and so you're
getting an effective as you see in the
graph here you're getting an effective
frame rate that looks like you know 20
frames per second for example so
basically in a nutshell g-sync is
working really well a moment though
there's one problem with juicing and
that doesn't have the vsync off function
and a lot of competitive games want to
see this surpassed 144 hurts especially
counter-strike gamers they want to be
able to turn that off so they can get
more frames coming to their game so
that's something that i think in video
work on but free sync for what it's
worth in that in between that bracket
there 42 i think 75 frames per second
it's working really well and so it's
good because it's free it costs the user
nothing to take advantage of free sink
and that's something that i really like
as opposed to juicing which I think
costs on average
fifty dollars from what I'm hearing so I
mean I'd like to see the cost of g-sync
come down and I think that's what free
sink will ultimately do though fries
think is a great thing for the market
and I'm really impressed i mean it's
it's the first release pretty much this
is the initial sample the initial
release phase of free singh ji sings had
a lot more time to work and so I like
I'm liking what I'm seeing from both
juicing and freezing and I think it's
only a good thing for the gamer so
fantastic article from pc perspective if
you want to see more about it then i'll
drop the link in the description below
sorry let's move on now to some new news
with the r9 390 x and probably this the
only information i can get out there is
that there's like some i'm translating
some Germans site here and I've got no
idea how to speak any German but
basically there's rumors that it could
be a dual GPU the 3939 TX could be a
jewel GPU configuration like they did
with the 295 x2 but however I don't
think that's true i mean honestly
they've got a single GPU king in the
works i think so if we look at this
article here this is also in german as
well i wouldn't see here the stream
processes of 4096 the engine clocks over
a gig so this looks legit and this is
looking what you like what you could
expect out of the r9 390 acts like i
said before then more stream processors
you don't like thirty percent more
stream processors there if the
architecture will as well for the new
architecture if you could get improved
you know improved processing as well
then you're going to see an architecture
that your new card that could allow
indeed up to fifty percent more frames
though the problem with this is that
Nvidia have already released Titan acts
and that is legit like that is a huge
card even though it costs a thousand
dollars it's still a really damn big
card and there's no denying that so with
AMD they kind of I think if they want to
gain the edge as I've said before their
kind of checkmated into dropping or
moving down to a shrunken node moving
down to a smaller notes a 20 nanometer
or even
samsung 16 and man I think they're kind
of check made it into doing this and so
that's the only reason I can think of
for them delaying their product like
honestly if they're going to release
these graphics cards on 28 nanometer
then I believe they've missed the boat
and it's already sailed you know down to
Antarctica because yeah like I just I
mean I'm question I mean some of the
viewers have raised some points in that
they think in AMD have to clear current
stock levels of r9 290 and 290x is
before they can release these new cards
and that's legit but I mean I just like
the more the longer AMD waits to release
the r9 390 X the more they're falling
behind the more they're falling out of
the game the more people with
discretionary income are going to go out
and buy a gtx 980 or gtx 970 so you know
you've got less options there for the
consumer they're going to pick the only
option of the moon which is kinda lay
the gtx 980 if they've got 500 bucks to
blow on a graphics card so that's kind
of like what I mean yes if you've got
two hundred fifty dollars to blow on a
graphics card and I 9290 is great value
for money there's no denying that but
there are people out there with more
than two hundred fifty dollars to spend
on a graphics card and I think you know
AMD are missing out on a huge market
there and I would argue that that market
is the most profitable market as well so
anyway i just i'd like to see Andy
really release this graphic are really
release something solid soon because I'm
sure a lot of the AMD fans themselves
are even you know the die-hard AMD fang
boys out there it kind of getting sick
of waitin for this news but anyway
nvidia on other news and video may
already be may already be working on a
980 TI or a gtx 980 i think the may is
needs to be a raise from that title
nvidia already definitely have a 990 gtx
980 or a 980 TI in the works they've
already got that ready with Titanic's
being released hell I even think they've
got Pascal ready as well they've already
got that prepared as well they're just
waiting you know you don't release
things too aggressively because that's
profit but anyway the 980 TI or the 990
I think it might be called the GTX 990
this time and the reason
being is because there was no GD x 790 i
think nvidia sort of going away with the
dual GPU thing because i think they
realized that if you're going to go with
dual GPUs you're mostly just going to
buy two cards and then you know have
you'll have better cooling you'll have
the option to cool them battle i think a
dual GPU solution I mean I've I mean I
recommended wonder my friend like angles
seven years ago i'm never going to
recommend one again it was a horrible
experience i'm personally not a big
believer in it especially back when I
used to be competitive as well SLI was
just where X file you just didn't go
there as a competitive gamer so I mean I
think the markets sort of shifting away
from Jill GPUs and it's moving more
towards single GPU so with that said I
think you're going to see a GD X 990
being released as a single sort of like
a tight next maybe with one cuda costs
are disabled and six gigabytes of vram I
think that's a possibility maybe seven
hundred dollars if I had to hazard a
guess and I think they're getting that
ready in preparation of whatever AMD has
to release so you can definitely expect
the 980 TI or the 990 to come out though
naming I mean I don't know what they're
going to do it could be the 980 TI it
could be the 990 though I think it will
be the 990 just because we're not going
to you know you saw the Titan acts that
tightened Z sorry the Titans II that was
pretty much a flop so I don't think
they're really focusing on a single dual
GPU on one pc be anymore so anyway that
being said let's move on now until is
going to challenge a video at high
performance computing with Knights
landing so they've got something in the
works as well knights corner was that
previous that previous chipped which
didn't wasn't as good as invidious
solution though Knights landing looks
like its legit so it's good but until I
mean from a business standpoint anyway
it's good that Intel's doing this and
they're there i guess they're trying to
diversify their market as well as
solidifying what they've already got so
they're in they you know they did that
acquisition of alterra this
if I in their place in the server market
you know they're going to have skylight
coming out soon which will be good for
the mobile the laptop sector the it also
be good for the server market I mean
they're really they are they you can see
the future at least in the medium term
they're doing like for me reading this
as a viewer they're doing a lot of
things that are making a lot of sense
though you know I hope sky like I wish
Kylie would hurry I'm get released on
other news but yeah this is going to be
a high-performance computing solution
which is going to be up to three times
faster than their previous night's
corner which is serious business it's
going to run on the 40 nanometer node as
well so it's going to be pretty damn big
so Nvidia have something to look out for
their with Knights landing anyway next
topic I want to talk about was lapping I
released a video on lapping versus non
lapping and you know guys I don't have a
lot of time i'm going to say sorry in
advance look at the testing on the
lapping wasn't as good as it could be
though in coming months when i get a lot
more time I would like to bring in
someone from the overclocking community
and I'd like to work with them side by
side and I would like to make a video
once and for all where we're comparing
lapped versus non lapped we're comparing
p method versus spread method and we're
doing it with a few different pace and
we're doing my ghetto method for
instance versus a full perfectly mirror
flat glass sanded die and sorry i HS and
heatsink so i'd like to see that and i'd
like to test with that particular person
say someone who's Harold in the Overlord
community I'd like to test that side by
side and with the same cooler with the
same CPU in the same conditions and I
think that make for a very good video
though for what it's worth this video
was real just just a real quick test
especially on a GPU diet and as I said
in my workstation vlog i believe the
biggest difference is to be had is how
much thermal paste you spread and also
if there's a layer of insulation on that
heat sink so for instance with that Seth
cooler that i got in i noticed that
there was this lacquer this caught this
um sorry this kind of coat of clear on
there
that was detrimental to performance and
when I sanded it off I noticed that my
temps were better so that's something
that you know i think in as wonderful
you'll pointed out and I sort of asked
myself why did they do this but one
viewer pointed out that they do it to
keep the product looking like brand new
even if it's on the shelf for one year
that makes a lot of sense as well but
thought it's worth I'd like to bring in
someone from the overlocking community
I'd like to make a real big video on it
once and for all kind of settling the
debate where we go testing this thing
for a few days and then we make a really
informative video for you guys so if
you'd like to see that let us know in
the comments below I think that's the
only way to solve things is to go
head-to-head anyway that being said
though puget systems have an article
here that I just pulled up and it's
about the actual because I mean I don't
know why but has just recently I've been
seem to be arguing a lot with people
about spread vs p so puter systems have
an article here where they tested all
the different types of application
methods and their temperature results as
you can see here that this you know the
spread method does absolutely fine and
it's made my thinking is that doesn't
really matter how much I mean so how you
spread it but more so how much spread I
think that's the biggest difference that
would come out of that they also made it
very very interesting article when I was
looking through their articles they made
an article on cpu temperatures and how
they affect performance and on the
Intel's is they have the TJ maxx i think
it's 105 degrees 105 degrees celsius and
so what they found was after a hundred
degrees that's only when your
performance of your cpu started dropping
so before that you could run your say
for instance you could run your CB or 90
degrees and you wouldn't feel
performance differences of post 80
degrees though one thing i'd like to
raise and one thing that I think that's
coming out of this and that would be a
really good would make for a really good
article is how long the processor lives
say for instance if you had a cpu 2 CPUs
side-by-side ones running at 95 degrees
on the same clock speed as one that's
running at 80 degrees how long would
they live for that be a very interesting
experiment furthermore I think
that something to take out of this
article as well is that when you say for
instance if you're sitting on your
computer I always like to be or I like
to have my rig prepared I usually
recommend sitting at around 80 degrees
that's because if you come into a really
hot day for instance in the heat of
summer work and you know ambient
temperatures can get 15 degrees hotter
than what you're normally used to
working in your room and if that happens
you'll see p you can go over tjmaxx for
instance if you're running at a 90
degrees in winter or in spring so that's
something that I like to caution people
about and that's why I always like to
have my cpu kind of at 80 degrees or
below 80 degrees especially if it's an
intel if it's AMD you've got to look at
the different temperatures because
apparently they've got you know they're
not apparently they actually do have
different recommended limits there and
sometimes it's like 70 degrees so that
being said let's move on to the next
article Legend of Zelda for Wii U isn't
coming out this year this is really sad
because out of all the Wii U games and
out of the whole way you think this was
the only game that I was really looking
forward to was Zelda for wii u like the
news elder they'll punching out years
ago they're punching out demos of it and
it's not even going to be released this
year so like what's going on here I
don't know man but like I was really
looking forward to this game I mean
honestly though if they're going to I
mean hopefully they're still going to
release it and it's going to be
absolutely amazing but I'm kind of I've
been waiting for this game and I really
want to I'm kind of anticipating this
game as much as I was anticipating Zelda
64 I remember years ago when I was
waiting for that to be released and then
it was released and it was really good
so I'm hoping this will be just as good
as the original Zelda 64 so lastly ace I
have released the xB 270 Hugh ed TFT
central have a full review of it
basically it's an IPS 1440p monitor at
144 hurts and honestly this review is
absolutely fantastic if you guys want
some of the best say the best reviews on
monitors computer monitors then head
over to TFT central these guys cover
like literally everything you would want
to know about a monitor all in one
review so fantastic I actually was
reading the review and basically what to
come out of the
is that this monitor has some of the
best or lowest display lag or input lag
that's out there at the moment it's
pretty much like CRT levels the response
times are pretty much the best you can
get for an IPS panel only Abby's deck
are using that again only Abby's dick
behind TN panels which is phenomenal so
this monitor is literally the be-all and
end-all for someone who is looking for a
really good experience coupled with a
monitor that can be used for competitive
gameplay though that being said i will
pause for a moment and i will say if you
if you're a competitive game are and
you'll want to go to 27 inch then I
suggest sitting maybe maybe 90
centimeters back from your monitor like
for instance the desks i'm using at the
moment is about 60 centimeters and i'm
using a 24 inch monitor for a lot of my
gaming and I mean I've got to make an
article on that but yeah I'm already
doing better on a 24 inch than I am on a
27 inch because the 27-inch is too close
and I can't see everything in my vision
so that's something if you're going to
27 inch monitor and your competitive
gamer I would stress that I would pull
the monitor back a little bit further
than what you're used to using it out so
anyway fantastic review the monitor is
absolutely like one of the bill and end
all monitors for 1440 peas so that wraps
up episode 32 I hope you guys enjoyed
this tech talk if you did please give it
a thumbs up if you have anything you
want me to talk about in the next tech
talk or anything you want to discuss in
this Turk talk as I love talking to you
guys in the comments then drop a comment
in the comment section below and I'll
catch you guys in the comments section
anyway I will talk about the next
episode I will be talking about AP is a
little bit more I'm actually kind of
waiting for a bit more development in
both dx12 and Vulcan before I talk about
it again though I am looking forward to
talking about that more in death as a
few people message me telling me to talk
about it more in depth and telling me I
sort of really just lightly glanced over
it and that's completely understandable
so anyway I will be talking to you guys
very soon anyway and I know we'll be
releasing another tech video very soon
as well and I'm sorry for all the mess
here at the moment but there's just like
a lot of testing I've actually got to
finish off the X 5650 benchmarks as well
we'll be getting that out for you guys
very soon as well as a used workstation
guide
and that's about you guys yes I protect
your eyes as well that's something the
biggest thing to come out of this
episode anyways I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon and peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
