after a little while of using it this
bottom edge he has started digging into
my palms for years and years I've been
looking for a replacement for my
Logitech g3 now couple of years ago I
did buy a Logitech G 302 and it was
pretty good but it was still lacking
that g3 feel that proper fingertip grip
snappy Mouse and until recently I it's
2019 it's a new year and I was talking
to a rocket John Linder on Twitter and
behind the scenes and I said look man
can we do another collaboration where I
asked you about some different mice and
we sort of test things out and see
what's a change since the last time we
collaborated and he said sure thing so
I'm gonna go jump in the tech yes
'mobile right now and we're gonna go pay
a rocket jump ninja a visit if he does
didn't know he's a mouse reviewer pretty
much the god of mouse reviews on YouTube
and he's also a good friend so we're
gonna ask him a heap of questions and
hopefully pick me out a brand new Mouse
so let's get on with it
we are now at the rocket jump ninja
studio where all the magic happens and
what you see on the camera is exactly
what goes on behind the scenes this is a
mouse addiction ladies and gentlemen
how many mouths internal do you have I
would say so anyway guys before I came
here I cheated a little bit there's the
G 203 that I bought in America for 25 US
dollars it's actually called the G 102
in Australia and you're no but it's the
same Mouse exactly the same just
different regions don't stress about it
okay cool
and you're saying he's also saying
Robert genuine is saying the g 305 has
the exact same shell but it's wireless
so I'm gonna go through now with Robert
John ninjas we're gonna take a look at a
couple of these mice but also a new
recommendation he has as well as at the
zowie the Zoey as to Zoey at s2 it's
essentially an FK - it's shorter Davina
is it the pink mommy no okay so it's a
pink dick they'll come up with another
version so we just call it yes - for now
okay so I'm gonna try this pink mouse
out and also try this - Logitech mice
out and see which one is going to be my
new heaven mouse so now here I am
actually recording on XY's setup this is
absolutely amazing
we've got the four mice here the
candidates that we are going to be
taking a look at while I'm playing the
mouse accuracy and point click training
and then from here I'm gonna decide
which of these is the best so previously
the last time we had the FK - so we're
gonna redo that first to get a baseline
score then we're gonna test out these
two Logitech mice and then this other
Zoe Mouse so let's have a look here
first up
big guy is this one let's start this
okay we definitely need to change some
options here let's go alright now it's
open so here's now the FK - we got 21
targets and we must collect 14 times
first time's a charm we're gonna go with
I got instinct here let's push that
aside next up now is our Logitech G 305
this is the rocketjump special this is
the one that rocketjump thinks will be
best for me let's give it a go just get
used to it make sure it's all good to go
oh man this is actually pretty old
that was good that was like really good
that was better than the FK - we're
gonna push that aside I won did that
ones winning that ones winning the pack
28 targets missclicked six times now
we've got the G 102 this has the cable
so we've kind of got to organize this in
a Tsar your email cut that uh-huh
sorry for that technical difficulty we
have again Rach we are back now with the
third attempt here it is that G 102 this
is the one that I currently have at my
house so I'm sort of I'm thinking if
this one does the best I wouldn't be
surprised but let's give it a go
hmm I got more targets but i misclicked
more as well so is that better or was
that bad okay so the G 102 we got twenty
nine targets versus 28 but we did miss
click four more times so I'm gonna
sideline that I think it's currently
like close to a draw between these two
at the moment so now we're gonna try the
is it the Davina this one what's the
pink one the Zhou es - okay
Zoey yes - here it is guys we're gonna
try the Zowie yes
- let's try this again I'm ready this
one feels pretty good this one does feel
good I'm gonna give it
and give it a little bit of a warm up
here give this one a warm up this is
this is it this is it
no 27 times and we missclicked 13 times
so currently the logic checks are
winning the race here so we're gonna
bring them back for a rematch we've got
G 305 versus G 102 here these are the
ones that naturally I did better in the
two runs they came close this one got 28
but six Miss clicks this one's got 29
but 10 miss clicks so that was actually
really good we got 31 targets we missed
click 4 times on our second run with the
G 102 let's now try the G 305 this is
the wireless option he goes nothing 29
times an 11 miss clicks so I didn't I
did not deliberately do that I sighs
just looking at me but okay so the G 102
looks like it was the winner got the
four miss clicks on 31 targets so I
don't know what it was about these two
they felt of course the shape and the
weights pretty similar this one felt a
little bit lighter for some reason I did
enjoy this one a little bit more I
thought the battery in here just I don't
know I'm very sensitive to these kind of
things and then this one had a slight
bit of acceleration and now something
about me personally since I do actually
prefer playing RTS it's like my most
favorite thing acceleration isn't a bad
thing in RTS so I mean a lot of FPS
shooters people hate acceleration I
understand that but RTS is actually not
a bad thing so and MOBAs as well so this
mouse with its light I guess I'm
guessing it's slightly inbuilt
acceleration I'm gonna go with this as
okay yeah okay
okay all right okay okay all right so I
wants a rematch okay well I'm I'm
putting my game face on I'm trying now
I'm sweating here dude
like I'm trying that hard thirty times
and five miss clicks okay it's doing
pretty well now we're going on to a
beautiful budget friend I think I
probably like this one because it's the
cheapest wait I just I want my cables
they're basically the same
get the wireless version if you want
Wireless if you don't know why let's get
the cable version they're the same Mouse
just don't even put any weight into this
at all I'm telling you guys there's a
subtle difference like we look at these
right here have we got the scales
I wouldn't move one is lighter so I'm
onto something so this will actually
show on this camera oh wow that's so
cool so so yeah it's slightly heavier
but you can't get a triple a battery and
just get a converter and get this one
down to 85 as well that's why you
shouldn't base the decision on weight
you can't get this one not the same
weight
mind blown what can you do a triple
weight so if you'd be so kind as to open
up that Mouse take off the cover just
like I showed you inside we've taken out
the alkaline battery we're using a
lithium battery they are lighter they
should last longer as well if you get a
triple-a version instead of a double-a
and just put it in a converter the mouse
will actually be lighter so that's how
we get these mice down a bit lower and
that's why having this battery is
actually a better thing in my opinion if
the battery does die in it you can just
replace it it's fine but the battery I
think lasts up about six months it's an
insane amount of time huge about her
life on these things so for me
personally it's just the bulging shape
on the sides that I've talked about so
much with the shape that I don't like
otherwise I'd be using this as my name
it is that good this is some deep
thought that I need to decide on here so
we just finished out picking the perfect
Mouse and that was so awesome but before
we get into the DM questions for
rocketjump ninja we're actually gonna
get something to eat because I've been
telling us that there's this awesome
Greek restaurant just down the road so
let's check that out get fueled up for
these super awesome questions
so here is now the great interview with
zai there's things that we need to know
about mice because is essentially the
gateway to your PC and there's things
that I need to know personally like for
instance what is better
a rubber cable or a braided cable it
really depends on the manufacturer you
can get really good rubber cables you
get really good braided cables the
braided cables are getting now is super
soft way better than any rubber ones and
the ones from razor also very good but
once from final mouse dream machines and
also the paracord incredible amazing
definitely worth checking out but you
can't really base it on braided versus
rubber it really depends on the make
okay so the next question now with a
mouse and its weight what is the ideal
weight for a first of all a fingertip
grip mouse so depends on the user
some people prefer heavy they say it
studies a hand other people say no they
want as little resistance as possible
they want to have pretty much just a
mouse feeling like it has anti-gravity
and it's just a sensor in their hand
that would be ideal I would say for me
personally go as low as maybe even 40
grams I would love to try a mouse that's
that light obviously I haven't had a
chance to do that yet but again it's
just about the user what do you want
what do you feel comfortable with aiming
a lot of the more competitive players I
guess you could call them they're going
for superlight mice that's why final
Mouse is so popular right now whenever I
go to buy a mouse there's always such a
big slant on senses and for you
personally how important is a sensor in
a mice they used to be super important
but because they're so good these days
it's hard to go wrong it's not really
the focus anymore we're more focused on
shape that to me is the most important
part now shape weight and then cable
because the sensors are just outstanding
the optical sensors 3389 3366 you name
them they're all amazing even the
logitech Aero sensor than you want it's
performing just as well as the 3366 and
most of my testing therefore which one
do you choose
it doesn't matter choose the right shape
for you it's gonna affect your own way
more next question for you personally
are you a fingertip grip mouse or a claw
grip or
grupo I used to use palm grip back when
I was using the Death Adder then I
realized I wasn't aiming as well as I
could so I switched to a smaller Mouse
and now I'll use a I guess you'd call it
a relaxed fingertip grip it's not quiet
fingertip like with the really straight
fingers it's just kind of relaxed and I
guess it's from I throw it back to my
palm grip days where I was always
relaxed but fingertip grip because it
seems to have more control I have more
movements in their fingers and hand when
I'm actually aiming like that as opposed
to palm grip which is pretty much solid
on the mouse now for me personally
there's one thing I've noticed with mice
I've always preferred 500 Hertz poling
versus a thousand Hertz poling now of
course you've got one millisecond versus
two milliseconds but I actually find
personally that the movements are
actually more smoother is there
something you've experienced or is there
a reason why someone like me maybe it's
just placebo or someone like me might
prefer 500 Hertz over a thousand Hertz
poling when you actually look at the
difference between one millisecond and
two milliseconds it's in humanly
possible to even tell the difference if
you can't tell the difference amazing
you should go into scientific testing
because that's a remarkable talent and
skill it's really nothing though I
personally can play at any and I really
don't care again for me the shape is
going to be the far more important
factor then the hurts a lot of people
bring it up finally most actually set
their mice to 500 Hertz on purpose
because they do say it's more stable
with a bunch of other reasons to who's
right who's wrong
I don't know I don't really care I'm
using all these mice and I'm playing
just as well as with any others it
really doesn't matter in my opinion just
again under odd shape and weight and
balance and whatever else it's gonna be
far more important to your aim than
something like 500 loads first 1,000
Hertz but do use a thousand Hertz or 500
Hertz I use whatever's on the mess I
really don't care like it does not
bother me one bit
we need an answer thousand Hertz cuz
it's that's our you cetera I'll just
quickly say that I generally set my
master a thousand Hertz just because
it's habit
there's no particular reason for it it's
just something that I do now with a
wireless mouse I think they're finally
coming into an era
they're becoming more accepted they're
becoming more mainstream and popular a
me personally I'm still one of those
old-school guys that loves the cable but
do you think Wireless is gonna be the
future going forward with mice yes and
no Wireless brings in a whole new set of
problems but nothing major but at the
same time I have heard there's some sort
of hack so if you're a professional
player and you're using your wireless
mouse on the stage and someone has some
sort of disrupting device or something
that could cause a problem I don't know
if that's true it's a rumor that I heard
so it's something to consider at least
be aware of just in case I have no idea
I really want to make that clear
I have not researched this I don't know
I'm just throwing it out there because
these are things you might need to
consider if the technology does come
around generally speaking though if
you're at home use and just enjoying the
game I would rather Wireless because
less cable drag less to worry about with
a me you I mean the new cables are
almost feeling like Wireless so it
doesn't matter but with most cables on
the autumn ice you definitely want to go
to Wireless because those cables do
correct cable drag it to effect your aim
they are a bit of a nightmare to deal
with that time sorry just to be safe I
would rather Wireless but if you're
going into a professional setting
I don't wanna comment on hedges share
because we just don't know I've been
sports sabotage that episode of touch it
could happen that's mind blowing
actually yeah they're doing some weird
things
next question allegedly so now the next
question I've got for you is in relation
to the switches that are implemented in
mice which is your favorite switch and
why so buttons to me personally not a
big deal in quake not something that I
care about too much wanna switches seem
to be more reliable because they don't
get the top clicking issue like the
Omron's do how accurate that is I don't
know but thank you was thinking it was
important enough to recall all their
mice at one point therefore there was an
issue or something going on with your
own switches that's why we don't have
van keys are we on run switches but I
think most of us dependent on the shell
so you can't just rely on the switches
to know which one you're going to like
it's one of the things you just have to
test for yourself and I hope you
get an idea from other people before you
buy because they they different from
every manufacturer different from every
Mouse that you buy even on the same
shell and everything it could feel
different so there's no easy answer with
buttons I don't prefer either way I can
use both but generally speaking to avoid
the double-click issue Kawano seems to
be safer but then they're not used in so
many mice so this is another who knows
answer so with the mouse industry and
the way it's going forward what do you
think the most I guess radical changes
we will see will be to this industry and
say the next couple of years I think
we're going to see a lot more
customization with none orchestra coming
out soon or at some stage this year he's
actually made it so you can replace the
sides with your own 3d printed silence
so you can pretty much design the masks
yourself shape is such a huge factor if
we can start to do that ourselves well
who knows where we're going to go with
that so I think once yes term comes out
other companies will start noticing this
to you and we'll see how it goes but
definitely check out the Astor and while
you can because it looks like it's gonna
be an amazing Mouse and we'll get a
smaller version at some point - very
true I mean we have seen trends with
final Mouse making and big emergence in
the scene I guess with that customizer a
new design so I guess shape is the most
important thing what would be the next
follow up to shape weight is a huge
factor also why final Mouse is going so
far forward and getting so much
attention they've managed to get a large
Mouse down to about 58 to 60 grams
that's about half the weight of the g502
it's incredible and then follow up after
that shape weight and then I would say
cable and again find the mouse have the
new paracord sort of cable it's
extremely soft it doesn't bunch up or
anything for me it's it feels like the
mouse is Wireless I absolutely love
those cables and then fourth bill
quality switches good quality switches
they will go without saying buttons is a
huge factor of course you want general
across-the-board everything in high
quality but in terms of what features do
you want to look for in a mouse because
sensors are so good these days make sure
it's a good one then after that forget
about it
then just shape weight cable they're the
major ones so as I also the last
question do you have any sponsors at all
no what makes you say that
thanks for this interviews I I hope you
guys have been enlightened as much as I
have thank you so much for your time if
you guys have questions ofa's I that
ones that I didn't think of ones that
are really cool and be sure to go at it
in the comment section below because as
I have said in the start of this
interview I think the mice or the mouse
that you're using is your gateway to the
PC it's such an important tool and we're
seeing that with the implementation of
all these mice that are being designed
in recent years oh that's good
good job okay so I ended up getting back
from dinner and pondering on these
difficult decisions but I'm going to
have to go with the G 102 with the cable
and there's actually some other reasons
to it as well so I was using these a
little bit more as well and it's just
something about this mouse and as I
can't rhyme in as well but for me it's
just it's got this looser thrashy style
click which I just absolutely love it
reminds me of this older school mice
something about it of course bringing me
back to those g3 days where they would
it was just amazing that Mouse and as
well as that it just feels a slight bit
better even with the cable attached I
don't know I like I know this one has
the wireless I know it's got the better
sensor I know it's got the better click
technically but for me this is just the
better Mouse I don't know is I what do
you think so mouse choice definitely a
personal preference thing he mentioned
that he preferred the buttons on this
one that's fair enough that's going to
change copy to copy those so I wouldn't
put too much weight in that sense wise
yeah the g3 i-5 is marginally better
in-game though you probably won't really
notice it unless you suffer from a tilt
slide thing check out my channel for the
explanation of that
with the g10 - or g20 3 you will get
cable dragged a little bit if you have a
mouse bungee that will help but just not
dealing with the cable is to me a great
thing so I definitely rather the g30 5
is it gonna make that much difference
probably not again it's a personal
preference thing a budget thing both of
these are really good mice personally I
think the G 305 is going to be the
better choice for most people if you
can't afford it if I had to guess why I
pick the g10 - I would say it's because
it's got RGB here's a complete RGB noob
so if you want a mouse for RGB noobs g10
- amazing embrace it okay just embrace
it for this that's didn't mean to click
twice that was better
it's not a huge difference and that's
one that points with these mice they're
not going to be massive difference but
we choose the right one because we enjoy
it more we prefer the comfort I
definitely prefer the comfort of the S -
I do not like the sides a lot of
stability that's the other thing when
I'm actually aiming and strafing and
doing everything that's actually in game
the ladder of stability of this mouse
doesn't actually fare out to me I do
mess up some of my shots whereas that
doesn't happen with more flat base and
the nice curved sides off the s2 so
personal preference how does your grip
affect it how does your playstyle affect
it what games you playing and so on
these are all really important questions
when it comes to Mouse choice but it
guys I hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then you know what to do hit
that like button also let us know in the
comments section below
what Mouse are you currently using
are you a palm gripper error a fingertip
gripper or a claw a gripper as we
touched on with some of those questions
before with zai obviously for me today
I'm a fingertip gripper and I'm only
looking at fingertip grip mice so that
was something for me to choose out of
all these mice and I ended up picking
the cheaper one because I just liked it
it was just had subjectively I just
liked
mouse better than the rest it was I
guess it got the best score in that
Mouse test too but again that was kind
of more down to my focus and energy in
other ways but anyway I've got a new
winner here
this one is finally going to replace my
g3 as my new favorite Mouse finally and
I'm looking forward to using this for
years to come
hope you guys anyway guys if you want to
get the inside scoop before it hits
youtube's lubed and check us out on
instagram tech yes city and also if you
enjoy the content you want to see it the
moment it's out in your sub boxes don't
forget to subscribe hit that
notification bell and I'll catch you in
the next one
do you want to do the honors peace out
for now bye that was the first time it's
ever been ruined in the history of the
channel peace out for now bye
I think the joke's on you zai because
everybody knows that just like your PC
where RGB gives you extra fps your mouse
when it's got RGB it's going to give you
extra actions per minute
people I like the thrash style click and
I I just I like it better
I'm sorry g3 i-5 uh okay so from my
testing with five hundred Hertz Bertha
verse a thousand no here's the answer
we're actually gonna get assigned to eat
because desires been telling us that
there's this awesome great restaurant
down the road that apparently caters to
RGB noob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
