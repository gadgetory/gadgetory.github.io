have here the fall creators update
optimization guide and you guys have
been going crazy spamming me on Facebook
Instagram and also Twitter in the
comment section about getting this guy
done so here it is today we're gonna go
through this thing pretty quickly I'm
gonna be up here in the top right hand
corner of the screen guiding you guys
through so first thing I want you to do
is type in settings left click settings
and we're gonna go through from the
bottom to the top because the bottom is
probably the most tricky we gotta get
left click update and security and then
on this update windows update tab we
want to go down to Advanced Options left
click that and then go all the way down
here to delivery optimization left click
that and we want to turn this off now if
you've got a lot of pcs in your local
area network you could actually leave
this on but we'll segue later into why
we're turning this off when we disable
some services but let's get back to this
main tab here back to the one where we
have Windows Update we want to go down
to Windows Defender open up the Windows
Defender tab left click on this little
shield and go down to left click virus
and threat protection settings we want
to turn off cloud delivered and click
yes and then we want to turn off the
automatic sample submission so there's
just two little services now we want to
turn off just to make things a little
better so that's all you really have to
do in that tab and now we want to move
on to the next tab in settings which
will be privacy now this is a big one
because you got a lot of crap here so
like simply boot it up general you want
to turn this off off off and we're gonna
be calling a lot of these settings
location there's nothing to call their
camera yep call that get off
notifications off yep and we just keep
going through and we just off a lot of
these now if you need these individual
settings you can turn them back on this
is the good thing about my optimization
tutorial we're not doing any reg hacks
if you find you need something then you
can turn it back on at a later date
that's not a problem so messaging radios
off other devices that should be good
but we can turn that off as well
feedback and diagnostics make sure this
is set to basic and then we move down
here and we want to make sure this is
never Windows should ask my feedback
never so make sure you go basic off and
never and we should be good that should
be the that should be about it and then
background apps with the lost tab here
on its third last time sorry
off just turn them all off unless you
need any of these applications running
in the background I just like to turn
them off and great again this is a very
lean install of Windows I've got my
editing programs I've got all the apps
that I need installed individually which
will run in the background regardless of
Windows apps so I want to turn this off
here app diagnostics and then we just
move back to the Settings tab here and
left click on Cortana and now Cortana
has got some little tricky settings so
use Cortana even when my device is
locked we want to turn this off the
reason why I want turn it off is because
it's a service that's on and it could be
restricting our performance so we're
gonna go to safe search off unless
you've got kids in your rely on
Microsoft's safe search setting I just
like to turn that off windows
cloudsearch off my device history off
and so we're really going through and
make sure this notifications tabs turned
off as well and we're going through
again this is the whole idea of this
power guide is to turn off a lot of
these services that just don't get used
and they are running in the background
even if they're not running they may
have a service that streamlined to
another service and that's running - so
speech make sure that's off and then we
want to move down to the it's one of
these ones here other options yeah play
animations in Windows so on other
options we want to make sure play
animations in Windows is turned off and
then again we going back to the settings
tab into the gaming tab very
controversial because game mode when
I've tested this in the past this can
make a difference in certain games on
certain old hardware so if you have a
really old computer you may wish to
press the Windows key hold down the
windows key press G and then turn on
game mode for that particular game but I
just like to turn it off because I
usually record games with a capture card
so or a shadow play within video so what
we're gonna do here is turn this off and
then I'm gonna go to game DVR make sure
that's turned off as well and
broadcasting that's turn off game mode
that's turned off and true play make
sure this setting is turned off it's a
new service in Windows 10 for creators
update there is an Xbox Live service so
if you use the Xbox Live service you
might want to turn this on but I
use the Xbox Live service at all on my
computer even when I play games or play
games on Steam so I make sure this is
turned off so that's the gaming tab
there time and language settings set
time automatically I like to turn this
off because I'm confident in this as the
time on my computer now if your times
way off you manage to turn this on
quickly and then turn it off again
especially if you're an old computer and
the CMOS battery is dead
just you may wish to leave that on if
you want it I just turn it off because I
don't need it enough for this next one
we can ignore this accounts tab we can
left-click on apps and we're going to go
through here and disable quite a few
things because we can see here just like
last time and every other fault creators
or every other update from Windows 10
there's just a lot of crap that gets
installed app install or uninstall sin
and what is this candy crush thing I
didn't even know Facebook I just use it
on Google Chrome anyway feedback hub see
you later
get help I want to uninstall that but
I'm you know I might need some help one
day so Microsoft's making sure you can't
understand that one they're like look
you got to get help Brian my amen anyway
get office I'm pretty sure I will be
installing office on this computer
anyway so so there's a lot of yeah
there's a lot of just crap in here March
of Empires war of Lords this is a new
one that's just made its way in with the
fall creators update 135 megabytes of
space that is now freed up so onedrive I
don't use onedrive if you need onedrive
of course you can uninstall it against
solar solitaire get rid of that
minecraft look at all these new things
are just permanently installing on here
it's like okay I mean minecraft is a
pretty good game for some people I just
don't play it again if you need
minecraft make sure you leave it on so
you can just see I'm going through here
individually just taking out everything
print 3d if you've got a 3d printer and
you need that service keep it on there
so a lot of this is just again how I
optimized Windows for me and a lot of
people just love it they obviously must
use a computer like I use it so if you
do need some of these settings make sure
you don't uninstall them just say hey
for instance I like the weather setting
I want to keep it on so there we go guys
so that's all the apps uninstalled there
you can go back through if you want
replay the video see what I've done
there but another thing too sometimes is
they just don't understa Laswell
sometimes you'll go back in this tab and
they'll be there especially if you're on
an older computer she managed to rego
through that tab and make sure you've
uninstalled all the ones that I've
uninstalled and then offline maps delete
all maps we can get rid of that don't
need that automatically update maps in
offline maps here
turn that off we don't need that and
then that should be really about it and
that tab apps for websites again I don't
need all this stuff because I'm gonna
use Google Chrome so I like to turn it
all off less hassle so now for this next
one we're gonna left click on
personalization just go down to taskbar
and something I like to do on my
computer is go to never so I never
combined any of these buttons and then
we move back we can go to Network and
left click on network and Internet Wi-Fi
so this computer will need Wi-Fi however
I don't want any paid plans I don't want
anything invasive so I just go through
now and turn off a lot of the crap here
because there is a lot of crap in this
Wi-Fi settings especially like I don't
need a VPN yet if if I do install a VPN
it'll have its own separate app if I'm
in airplane mode I want my Wi-Fi turned
off and turn on remotely as well we want
to turn this off so we don't want any
remote access to our computer as well so
leave proxy on as well make sure you
don't turn that off
and now moving over to phone we don't
really need to do anything in that tab
unless you've got a phone linked to your
Windows 10 for creators update but we
can move over to devices now left click
on devices and we can go down to typing
and there are a few things that I like
to turn off here so I like to leave on
autocorrect as I'm constantly
misspelling words and I like these two
settings but I had to turn off these
other three settings here and then we
move back we're on finally the last tab
and this is system so we go to system
here you can see I've made everything
big arches for this tutorial 150% but we
can ignore that go to notifications and
actions turn off these three settings
here I like - I don't need notifications
about crap that I don't need so the next
one here is power and sleep of course
this is actually pretty important
because we can go to additional left
click additional power settings and we
go to high-performance
like to turn my computer on high
performance now if you have a laptop you
may wish to leave it on balanced I would
recommend that but if you've got a
desktop like me you don't mind juicing a
bit of extra power having everything run
smooth all the time not throttling down
you can just go to change advanced power
settings and turn hard disks off never I
like to do this as I don't want my hard
disk turning off I want them constantly
spinning because I find them starting up
and down is actually not good for them
so I like to leave them always running
so sleep as well hibernate I want to
make sure these settings are disabled
and we can go OK and also the background
sorry the there should be a setting here
with the slideshow I like to have that
paused and we click apply and then
moving along with the storage tab
storage sense I like to keep this off
this is a new service with Windows 10
for creators update I like to make sure
that's turned off tablet mode I just
turn that off I use desktop mode now if
you're on a tablet you can use tablet
mode or you can use the appropriate mode
but I just like to don't ask them don't
switch and I like to use desktop mode
down to multitasking I like to turn that
off though if you do multitask and you
do need these drag settings and you're
used to them then you can keep them on
this is probably the most controversial
setting of my optimization guy because I
know people personally who love having
this on I like to turn it off so you can
trial that one just hotkey that one is a
favorite but moving out of projecting
this PC we can turn this off I don't
have a projector but if you have a
projector you may wish to leave it on
and then share it across the shared
experiences to turn this off this is
another service that's running and we
want to turn that off remote desktop I
like to make sure this one is turned off
as well so you made it through part one
it's time to go on to part two so on the
bottom left-hand corner here we can just
left click that and type in control
panel and then left click that and it
should open up this but this kind of
looks a little bit weird so we're gonna
go up to this view by left click this
and go small icons and now what we can
see here the first one ease of access
and I want you to left-click on this and
untick these two boxes here always scan
this section and always read this
section aloud and see you later and then
the next one we gotta go do is File
Explorer options left like this click on
View and so up top here general
you tab and go down here in the show
sync provider notifications we want to
make sure this is turned off so uncheck
that box there I think I already
unchecked it before this tutorial hmm I
cheated a little bit so make sure that's
unchecked click apply and then we can
move down to the next one which is
called infrared so left click this and
we can turn off all these settings here
I don't use infrared technology with my
computer if you do then you may wish to
keep these settings on again it's all up
to about to you with Windows
optimization and what settings you use
but I like to click apply it turn that
off and then the next time we can move
down to is the security tab and in here
we're gonna find some little nitty
gritties let's change security and
maintenance settings and we want to left
click this so turn on messages on or off
this is again user account control I
don't need this also with automatic
maintenance I don't need this and I
don't use it Windows Backup I don't use
this the others work folders again so
there's four services that we can
uncheck that we don't need in the
background and we don't need running
anymore so we get rid of those
troubleshooting our finds helpful and
the other ones that I've left on I find
it helpful so we can click OK and then
we can go back to the last tab here
which is make sure that's okay yeah I
did ok that ok great so we can just go
back to control panel home left click
that and then the last tab here is
system so left click system and we've
got here four tabs on the left and what
we want to do is left click on I usually
start with advanced system settings and
now once we left click that will pull up
a tab here where we can go to
performance settings and I like to
uncheck the first three and then the
three under that levon peak because it
makes windows look fancy and then also
slide open combo boxes of course if
you're on a real big potato you manage
to adjust for best performance that's up
to you but I click apply click OK and
then we want to move over to system
protection here make sure this is turned
off unless you need system protection
though some people who love having their
system protection on I find it's useless
if my computer's crashed I got my
daughter backed up and I'll just
reinstall windows completely if
something goes wrong remote assistance I
like to go to advanced
and turn this off plus okay allow remote
assistant connections to this if you'd
like to turn that off as well but if you
are using a program like TeamViewer
where you need to remotely access your
desktop make sure this and the other
remote desktop setting before are
enabled so for me I don't use this can
visit my main computer for video editing
I'm always with it I don't need to have
anyone access it from without from
remotely so that is that tab down system
so there's part to finish that was
pretty quick part one was quite long but
part three we're gonna be giving our
computer a little bit of a spice up here
so making things a little bit more
optimized so this peoples tab here I
don't like it right-click on it and you
can just uncheck this show the people
button so that'll bring that back to
normal and then we can right click here
unpin this from taskbar unbend this from
taskbar and then we can also download
google chrome install google chrome and
then pin that to the taskbar so I'll
have chrome and I'll have my folder here
and also I will get VLC media player as
well for playing music and movies that's
my personal choice of two apps that I
usually install when I first install
Windows 10 our next thing we can do here
is type in services.msc left click this
and then we'll bring up these services
here so this is gonna get a little bit
tricky because we want to go on the
startup tab I'll try and do without
having to move myself so startup tab
here we want to left-click that and make
sure they're running so sorry the status
tab so if we left click that left click
that again we'll see now it's all listed
in order of which is running so we want
to make sure we go through now and even
by a name okay it's a little bit a
little bit annoying it's sort of it
should you yeah so you're just going to
click it with name and then start us
until you get them in chronological
order with their all the ones that are
running so now what we can see here is
delivery optimization and remember we
talked about this earlier we can right
click this left click properties and
then we can disable this
and stop it so that one's done we don't
need that it's another service we don't
need any more connected user experiences
in telemetry this is one that's always
been popping up every time you install
an update it keeps coming back and it's
gonna get keep getting disabled as well
so we will play disable that and then of
course there's one more as well
distributed link tracking client I like
to right-click this one and disable this
one as well so there's three services I
like to get rid of of course delivery
optimization you will need to keep that
on if you have any weird problems or if
you need to install updates on your
network and your own terrible internet
even worse than what I've got so now the
last thing I like to do is left-click
here and then go to ms type in MS config
and then left-click this system
configuration and just go over to the
boot tab here and so there should be a
boot tab and we just want to left-click
no GUI boot and click apply and then
click exit without restart in the last
little trick of course I like to do is
type in CMD and then right click this
run as administrator and because we're
in high-performance mode we can then
turn off our hibernation settings and
this will free up so what we do is we
type in power CFG /h and then type in
off and we press enter and we should
have some more SSD storage freed up or
in this case SSD storage if you are on a
laptop and you do have your balance
profile with hibernation then don't do
this command but let's roll off into a
conclusion now anyway I hope you will
enjoy today's optimization guide on the
Fault creators update on Windows 10 if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and also if you have any tips and
tricks of your own then be sure to drop
a comment in the comment section below
and I'll be sure to get back to you as
soon as I can also if you're having any
unique problems then be sure to comment
as well I know I can try and help you
out or someone else in the comments
might be able to help you out if you are
and with that said if you are having
some big problems then you may wish to
revert for the time being I noticed
they've changed a few little things up
since when I've updated and since when I
first checked it out but it is running
pretty stable now with the latest
drivers on my graphics card both my main
rig and on this little rig here which
uses Intel HD graphics
and of course if you enjoy the content
enough then for as little as a dollar a
month you can help support me out on
patron in this YouTube ad pocalypse and
you also get access to a live monthly
stream that I do with a fellow tech
tuber Steve from hardware and box and
with that said I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon and you
guys make sure you peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
