about our prices not being as good as
the US however today is not that day
simply put it we can currently get an
RTX twenty sixty four four hundred and
seventy one dollars mailed to the door
with the coupon code at the moment this
makes it cheaper than what you could get
it for in the u.s. at it's three hundred
and forty nine US dollar price tag so
let's take a look at all the deals that
Ozzie's can get currently on ebay
whether having a twenty percent off sale
with a store that already does really
good prices and that's computer Alliance
but there's also a couple of other deals
in there I'll put the links in the
description below and then at the end of
the video I'll also put in some
international deals for you folks all
over the world let's get on with it
so if you want a bit more power than
r-tx 2060 then there's an RT x 2080
going for 863 ozzie dollars shipped to
your door this is better performance
than a 1080 Ti I've actually bought one
of these myself because I am keen to see
how a retail sample will perform versus
the 2080 founders Edition next up here
if you want some ddr4 memory at some of
the best prices I've seen in Oz but also
with some fancy heat sinks and this is
the Corsair to buy a key bite sticks for
a hundred and twenty seven Aussie
dollars using that coupon code PC 820
and if you need a water cooler with some
RGB bling and it's 240 ml big then this
is the cooler master master liquid light
going for 17 9rz dollars after that RGB
mechanical keyboard and also a mouse
going for fifty-five dollars but of
course there's a lot of guys out there
that want the razer brand and if you do
then that's going for $55 for the
keyboard alone which is still really
good compared to what razer keyboards
usually costs now if you need a new SSD
then there's 240 you buy SSDs going for
$39 I've bought quite a few of these
myself so if you need a larger SSD then
there's the crucial bx 500 going for $79
and then lastly on storage is one
terabyte hard drives western digital
blues these usually go over $50 in Oz
that's Achievers you can find them for
today they going 47 bucks I bought quite
a few of these right before this video
and if you're into gaming and you need
some solid peripherals then there's the
Kingston HyperX cloud - gaming headset
going for 95 bucks but if you want
something that's even cheaper going for
63 Aussie dollars then these are the
corsair HS 50s this is a gaming headset
as well I've tried this I really like
them especially for the money super
comfy good sound and also I think I
heard someone say a gigabytes of ddr4
memory for 63 Aussie dollars that's
right someone did say that and they also
said the eight core Rison 7 2700 with
the brace fire led cooler going for
three hundred and fifty one dollars
shipped now if you want a really good
motherboard for that then there's the x4
70 Prime going for two hundred and
twenty eight dollars after you take 20%
off but what if you want to jump onto
Intel for gaming well they've got the i5
90 400 F doesn't have that GPU portion
onboard but of course if you get a
dedicated graphics card this CPU will be
really good
not only will be a powerful will be also
really efficient from what I've tested
here going for 236 ozzie dollars so
that's a freaking bargain you can also
couple it with a micro ATX prime
motherboard which is going for 68 Aussie
dollars shipped
however lastly if you need a gaming
monitors a 24 and a half inch 144 hertz
panel going for 239 bucks now that's the
deals from computer Alliance there's
also another seller called tech fast who
is selling whole pcs and I do pull this
up last because the seller does have
quite substantial negative feedback now
especially over the last month so if
they can comment on this video and say
hey we've made a mistake or something
like that or with over-provision stock
then I'd be happy to recommend them but
if they are indeed sort of screwing
people over by not shipping things for
like literally a month then that's sort
of not cool but the deals that they've
got going on are ridiculously good
they've got a whole twenty atti rise in
seven twenty seven hundred system going
for 2200 Aussie dollars this is
ridiculously cheap considering you're
pretty much paying that in oz for the 20
80 TI alone but here you're getting a
whole system power supply motherboard
CPU Ram SSD case and the 20 80 TI like I
just I don't know how they're doing it
it's ridiculously cheap they've also got
a same system but with a twenty eighty
going for seventeen hundred dollars
shipped and if you're on a budget
they've got an Rx
570 system with a risin six Corizon five
2,600 going for just over five hundred
bucks so there are some really good
deals for new parts going on in Oz at
the moment I'll be making a video soon
looking at new versus used parts but
also on that note if you're in America
there are some pretty cool deals like
the same Rison 7 2700 can be had on
amazon for 220 US dollars this is a
ridiculously good price for the CPU but
if you head over to ebay in the US
there's also the Rison 7 1700 going for
a hundred and forty six bucks
so these CPUs for the matter cause and
threads you're getting it is
ridiculously good value for
money but also if you're international
and you can't get access to these deals
then there's also an h-60 one
motherboard going for 38 bucks on
Aliexpress at the moment and then
there's a seller selling I five thirty
four seven yeses for around thirty six
bucks and then you've got some ddr3
memory going to buy four gigabyte sticks
for thirty dollars shipped so that's a
really good little combo if you want to
put together budget gaming pcs I haven't
seen better value at the moment
especially in 2019 so this is a
ridiculously good time to buy used and
new parts I put my fleetly links in the
description below and if you're in a
straight up with the coupon codes next
to those links so you know what coupon
code to use and with that said I hope
you enjoyed this deals video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
us know in the scription below if
there's other really good deals you find
and I'll update the description as well
for you guys but with that said I'm
gonna get back to the used parts hustle
where I was actually in the middle of
doing this and a lot of you guys message
me and then I woke up in the morning and
Zhai messaged us like rocketjump ninja
and he's like yo there's deals going on
in Oz at the moment you've got to get on
this I'm like scratching my head others
look at it like yeah I've got to get on
this this is really good anyway I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
