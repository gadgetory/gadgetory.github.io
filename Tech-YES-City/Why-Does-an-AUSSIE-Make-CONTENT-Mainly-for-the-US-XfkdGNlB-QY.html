the u.s. this is a question that I've
been asked here and there ever since I
started doing YouTube and it is one that
I guess is fun to address with some
interesting statistics to follow 11
attacks ed this is brad coming to you
guys today with an odd kind of video of
an odd subject of why me and australian
citizen makes content mainly with the
focus on the united states now the first
and most important reason is quite
simply the support the u.s. is literally
providing over eighty percent of the
channels income and interesting lee
enough is only like thirty percent of
the total viewer base crazy right so
without the generous people over in
America I wouldn't be here doing content
as I wouldn't be able to survive
otherwise on that note as well when I
first started the channel it was people
from mainly from the US who really
pushed me to make more content and never
stop and I'm one that never bites the
hand that feeds whether this channel
continues the grower just falls flat on
its ass I'll never turn my back on
people who have shown me love and
respect it's just the way I am though on
that note I will try and I am in the
process of integrating other countries
into the reviews and prices especially
Australia with including aud pricing and
also availability of products in reviews
so trying to make everyone happy is
always a goal of the channel though also
a lot of companies have their
headquarters in the US and a lot of the
time they will post off in nationally to
me in order to get reviewed now another
thing I wanted to talk about was going
full time with YouTube and a lot of
people have been asking me about
recommendations and even hints about
starting out a youtube channel and it
really is something that comes from
passion if you don't have passion for
what you do then that will come out in
your videos so my first tip would be to
let that passion Drive you to make more
content and videos which at first when i
started doing youtube I never had any
intentions of this growing or becoming
as big as it is I just simply wanted to
help other gamers out and let them know
that I had a different opinion on a
gaming mouse to what a lot of other
reviews had they were basically
fanboying this mouse and I tried it and
I was like really this thing is pretty
mediocre but what about audio quality
video quality and editing software well
i'll put a link in the description below
for all the gear i use that on that note
I will say YouTube is a lot different
when I first started out with the
potato camera nowadays there's a lot
more competition though keep in mind
that our other channels out there that
do get love from YouTube themselves and
you'll see these guys get their videos
plastered on the front of YouTube every
day that is something to do with the
particular someone at YouTube just
favoring that person's videos and
pushing them so there is an element of
luck involved when it comes to growing
your channel but in time hard work and
persistence will pay off they lastly
what about YouTube is making so much
money and just you know having trucks
roll in the back of their driveway full
of cash well I mean to be honest like
for me personally I mean I'm not
anywhere near those levels and even if I
did get to something even considerably
close I'd be giving a lot back to the
community at the moment I'm just on what
I would call a survivable income though
you know it's something that I just love
and it keeps getting better and better
especially with the more people to join
the community anyway guys I hope this
video has talked about a few different
things that normally don't get spoken
about on the channel there being
straight up and honest with you guys is
always something that I put up the
forefront of the channel and something
that I believe sets my channel apart in
many ways and that I don't sugarcoat my
videos and you know sugar is pretty bad
for your health anyway so lastly the new
website is up and it is killing it we
have a forum there so feel free to come
over and join and discuss all things
tech and PC gaming also what about the
yes intact yes City well let's put it
this way officially it's tech city but
unofficially it's tech yes City brothers
always has and always will be catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
