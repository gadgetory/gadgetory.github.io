so I M stands for Intel Extreme Masters
and now this is a pro gaming event that
is worldwide in this case it's hosted in
Sydney for Australia in the period of
May and there is a csgo tournament that
is the main focus of this event with
over 250,000 dollars that's right USD up
for grabs in first place takes out a
hundred thousand dollars in this
tournament but there is just so much
more you can do here on top of just
watching csgo in the main arena they've
also got an overwatch tournament
populace streamers coming in the team's
themselves are signing for fans and
there's VR tournaments as well as free
to play desktop PCs with 240 Hertz
monitors that anyone can jump on and
experience what it's like to game on
Intel and speaking of Intel big thanks
for them sponsoring out this event it's
such a cool experience there's just one
that's completely different -
enthusiasts check although on that note
there is really cool custom modded pcs
which we're going to check out right now
so now on the main showroom floor for
the custom modded pieces and this is the
centerpiece of this event Intel Core i
$9.99 hundred K box in a box but a
workable now yeah a workable PC so tell
us what's inside this thing
so obviously it's running at 900k be
rude not to package it not without you
so we're also supporting the Auris 2080
water force card and the 390 Master
we're running 32 gig of team driven
Excalibur rams and 2 terabyte intel 660
psst
so that's awesome and if you guys didn't
know Ethan did the dark jaja custom
build here on tech air city the jewel X
58 system that was so good I was really
fun and so Ethan is starting now to
branch out into so many different things
and this one is definitely a masterpiece
and even behind it we've got a whole the
skull the Hades canyon skull icon that's
been turned into a massive overblown
build yeah that was scaled yeah so that
was a collaboration with our tag mods
and also simple mods who's also another
model within Australia so these builds
are just absolutely gorgeous custom
water-cooled with hard tubing right now
of course so that's all they're ready to
go they perform really well even better
than your costume air-cool there it is
inside and yeah 9900 k usually idols in
bios at 55 degrees less on your last so
the cooling is good to match the looks
and the performance fee thank you John
so now sitting down on the showroom
floor and I'm surrounded by all these
custom water-cooled builds which is a
store in Australia called Sena calm and
they're doing these as retail
off-the-shelf builds now collaborating
with a brand I've never heard of before
called gof and they look really good
using custom laser etched panels with
LEDs under them so you
then get that effect of the whole panel
glowing itself I gotta say the custom
9900 cave water blocks are they useing
look really good too I mean the RGB
bling it's coming in in 2019 and I think
this is taking that to another level now
let us know what you guys think in the
comments section below about these
builds
now I'm gonna guess how many jelly beans
are inside and I said 889 and I just
want a keyboard that is going in the
suitcase right behind it is a costume
overwatch water-cooled build and they're
actually giving this away at I am for
those who are at I am can enter and get
in with a chance to win this so I mean
considering I just won this keyboard and
mouse eye wise will just get in with a
chance to win this - right behind me now
they are doing mass signings for the pro
gaming eSports team and they are in
Mouse sports so there's actually like
really big international teams here as
well like faze clan as well as fnatic
and Team Liquid but I did meet up with a
team that was local and they called the
Greyhounds
really nice bunch of dudes awesome to
get along with and we just had a chat
for so long and now we're competing
today on the showroom floor against
another team but speaking of the results
this event itself is held over three
days we're on the first Friday May the
3rd they have the quarterfinals
followed by the Saturday which is today
May the 2nd the semi finals and then
tomorrow is the big grand finale the
finals where they got a best-of-five
csgo match we're now here back at the
final day of I am and the finalists have
been decided and that is Team Liquid and
also team fnatic there apparently the
top 2 of 5 seeds who are expected to be
in the finals and go for that $100,000
prize money now funny thing is behind me
they've got a ln2 overclocking event for
csgo so we're gonna go in there check
out what FPS they can get because
apparently they got a 99 hundred K and
they're overclocking this thing to 6.8
gigahertz but let's get into it and see
what they can do
so right behind me we just finished up
with the overclocking event and they
managed to get six point nine gigahertz
on the ninety nine hundred K and that
enabled them to get over nine hundred
and forty average FPS which I believe is
setting a record a world record for this
benchmark that's at least what they are
telling me so that is really crazy six
point nine gigahertz
lnto had this event I was actually
really excited for this so it was
amazing that I are able to Brust that
world record and not only that put on a
show at the same time that's I guess the
perfect scenario the data size let's
check out all this pro gaming stuff and
see what it is all about the csgo
tournament
they killed
one of them is just a down single entity
with dispositions of the sunroom
so now landed back in the tech yes
studio and I am was just so crazy
watching the csgo tournament live
between fnatic and liquid back-and-forth
action and I think fnatic came out ahead
at the start like 1-0 and then from
there Team Liquid brought it back and it
was just an epic battle back and forth
these guys both went so hard in this
final and that's the thing about these
pro gaming tournaments does take so much
skill on this level to pull off these
victories there was one play where the
it was one of us won at the end and he
had seven seconds left to plant and so
he faked the plant and knew the guy was
coming from that angle and then just won
the round by doing that I just liked
some of those clutch plays are really
good when it gets down to this level of
skill and then of course there was so
many good highlights along the way
between these two teams so one thing for
sure is these pro gaming events it does
get pretty heated and especially when
that kind of money is on the line
they're definitely gonna be playing that
much harder so it was a really awesome
tournament awesome experience and if you
guys are ever in Sydney or next year if
I am Sydney if it's around your time and
you've got some holidays definitely
recommend going to this event it's so
much fun and of course I like it even
better because of all the custom pcs on
display as well as all the other cool
things they're doing like giveaways and
just the crowd is awesome of course
being an Aussie crowd it does get a
little bit rowdy does get a little bit
fun and there are some things that are
worth saying and you guys hope you
enjoyed this year's vlog of IEM I did do
a lot of things on social media with the
event met a lot of cool players
especially some of the guys from the
Greyhound gaming team they were really
nice to talk to and just have a chat
with sort of off cameron away from
things and it's just so cool to know
that the Aussie teams are just
down-to-earth guys and they're the kind
of guys you just you know have a chat to
and they chat to their fans just like
normal people
they've you know this it's really cool
being Aussie and in this scene and you
