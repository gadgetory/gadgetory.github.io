gigabyte booth and they have some new
products on display named idli a/b 450
motherboard with practically all the
works included so if you like on a
budget and you want to save a bit of
money you don't want that x4 70 license
you don't to pay extra especially if
you're not using SLI or crossfire right
you don't need to spend the extra money
this is what this offers so we've got an
A+ three-phase power design here also
got onboard audio that's a really a step
up from previous generations you've got
Weimar red capacitors there no one to
give you warm audio and there's also
chemi-con capacitors as well to help
with the audio so this thing is just
feature packed as well with an Intel
Gigabit Nick you've also got the options
to overclock a very solid heatsink
design as well as having two nvme MDOT 2
slots with the heat shields or actually
heat sinks that do do a good job I've
tested this in the past I can vouch for
these however of course one of these is
still going through pcie 2.0 another
through pci 3.0 but they're putting a
new Intel 9000 series Wi-Fi integrated
going to the chipset itself so it's not
stealing those precious pcie 3.0 lanes
from your cpu now this is coming in at
110 USD and it's coming out at the end
of July so stay tuned for this
motherboard it's definitely gonna shake
things up it's got all the features that
you'd want really high-end coming into
the mid-range price essentially but
let's take a look at the other big Daddy
the x3 99
what about to take yesterday right here
we've got the X 399 refresh from
gigabyte so besides the gaming pro Wi-Fi
on the B 450 side this also includes a
store mi license
now you've got direct heat pipe
technology touching the vrm so that's
gonna do some really good cooling for
the vrm we've got a 12 plus 2 phase
digital so it's a step up from previous
motherboards in the past you've also got
three MDOT two slots all covered with
heat shields as well and of course those
massive amounts of Nick's on board we're
talking an acquaint you can give it to a
second to Intel one gigabits per second
included Wi-Fi RGB lighting throughout
and the best things this has got to
eight pins as well so you can overclock
that new 24 core risin to the sky you
can possibly even blow the thing up
because this motherboard has so much
power that it won't be blown up
it'll be doing a good job however as you
guys may know the best does come at a
cost and this is looking at like it'll
be around about four hundred and fifty
US dollars x3 now nine boards have
always been expensive and we're looking
at a quarter three release two so expect
to see this if you are into getting the
best of the best so besides be 450 and X
399 motherboards gigabyte are releasing
new products into the wild some of those
that have already been released include
their SSDs 256 gigabyte and also a 512
gigabyte version coming in to boast 70
and 110 USD respectively now what makes
this different from the competitors
price is they've got an external cache
buffer and a lot of the competitors are
actually taking that away so the SSDs
won't run as well gigabyte assure me
that with a Toshiba 64 layer NAND flash
this will run faster and also continue
with sustained write speeds - so this is
what you're looking for if you're after
an SSD good value for money but now
another really cool thing coming out of
this booth is the power supplies the ap8
50 GM from gigabyte is an in-house
design and as the name suggests 850
watts but 70.5 amps on the 12 volt line
and also a jewel ball bearing 135 mph
and this thing's gonna stay quiet and
cool and the best thing about it too is
it's 80 plus gold now pricing is still
unconfirmed
but it's going to be coming out in
quarter three so if you're into a new
power supply and you want to try
something different then gigabyte
they're not going with the typical OEMs
this time like Delta FS PC Sonic etc
they're going with their own OAM
in-house now you may be sitting in your
chair maybe on the bus you may be on the
training you're like Brian
that's enough new products for one video
I'm gonna tell you wait there's more and
what we got here is ddr4 memory modules
from Oris RGB and there's a 16 gigabyte
kit so - 8 gigabyte sticks
however they're throwing in to fake
sticks as well and now the reason for
this is if you've got four slots of
memory but you only want to get two
sticks especially if you're a gamer
they'll give you to fake sticks which
will still light up will still be able
to be synced with the Auris fusion
software so you can have the bling and
you can also have the performance to
match thirty-two hundred megahertz XMP
profiles Samsung B type memory 1.35
vault and 16 CL timings on the cast
latency so it's fast it looks good and
you've got those nice thick juicy heat
sinks with indentation as well to get a
good cooling effect so I'm really
surprised and for the pricing we're
looking at 220 USD and a release date of
quarter three this year so that's with
the Auris memory also the SSDs I believe
they have a three year warranty too but
anyway guys if you enjoyed today's video
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
what was your favorite product in
today's video and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace peace alpha now bye
my motherboard stand right there I love
you Brian always welcome to Computex
2018 at the gigabyte booth here in
Taipei near the 100 I show you in the
101 yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
