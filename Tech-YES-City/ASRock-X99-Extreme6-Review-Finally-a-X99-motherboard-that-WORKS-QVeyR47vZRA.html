around here brothers with an extreme sex
welcome back to check yet city ladies
and gentlemen this is brian coming back
to you guys today with a review of the
x99 extreme 6 motherboard from asrock
now this motherboard definitely comes as
a pleasant surprise to me considering
the amount of headaches I've had with
other x99 motherboards in the past few
months and ultimately I'm going to be
recommending this motherboard today
because it's just feature packed it's
got a lot of utility and it just works
properly so anyway before we get on to a
conclusion we'll look at the physical
overview of the motherboard then we'll
look at the features then we'll go
through the BIOS have a little look at
that I'll do it I'll even do a mic test
for you guys and talk about the audio
and then we'll get onto the conclusion
so let's move on so as soon as you get
this motherboard you'll notice that it
comes packaged extremely well or pun
intended comes with enough accessories
or your solder cables you even get a 2
and 3-way SLI bridge connections there
however looking at the motherboard from
top to bottom we can see we start at the
top here we've got a big chunky heatsink
with x99 written across the top there
that's blue and silver writing on top
however upon taking off this heatsink we
could clearly see that asrock have
implemented a really good vrm on this
multiple we've got a 12 phase well it
looks like an 8 + 2 + 2 phase design
they're two phases being for the right
side for dims 2 phases being for the
left side too dim for dims there and 8
phases being dedicated to the CPU itself
so upon closer inspection of the vrm we
can see and to my delight we've got
niche akan 12 KCAP seer these are
platinum caps and they're rated at
12,000 hours under extreme conditions
pretty much the best in the business
we've also got 60 amp chokes there and
upon closer inspection of the MOSFETs
you'll actually notice that even though
it looks like a single MOSFET design
underneath the layer that you've got a
dual mosfet packed into one MOSFET so
essentially you've got 24 MOSFETs
flowing across this 12 phase power
design looking at the Dimsdale we've got
four dims on the right as I mentioned
earlier for dims on the left and
continuing on the left here we've got
two USB front out headers but also got a
chassis fan and on the node of chassis
fans we've got four here located from
two at the bottom and two in the middle
that'll give you a total of four fans on
the chassis and system fans and at the
top here we've got a three and four pin
CPU fan connection so a total of six fan
connections or six fan-out headers on
this motherboard also on the middle fan
point there you'll notice a PCI Express
molex connection there to give this PCI
Express ports a little bit extra power
really good if you're going with 3-way
or two-way SLI also on the left here
you've got an ATX 24 pin connection
they're located in a pretty good spot
above that you've got a USB 2 port so I
don't know who would benefit from this
maybe me even though I've got my front
USB port out still there so maybe for
someone who hasn't got front USB 2 or 3
out and they're on a test bed and they
can't get access to their real USB out
so I guess that would make a really good
solution for you if you're that rare
person though besides that we've got the
12 volt CPU pin located again in a
really good spot as well so moving down
the motherboard here we've got can
solder three ports here all on the same
one controller so they've gone away with
using different controllers is you might
be used to in the past like an Intel or
an as media controller and they've just
going with the one Intel controller
there besides that we've got the asrock
heatsink and the logo cooling the
platform chipset hub which is connected
via a thermal pad that's what they've
used for the thermal interface material
and besides that we've got the dr. debug
LED which is a nice testbed feature or
debugging for anyone having problems I
like that addition you got there some
test bed features here the power button
and reset button as well as a HDD saver
connection there even though personally
I don't use it and I probably wouldn't
recommend using it and then besides here
you've got your front panel outs here
your power LED HDD light and just
speaker etc besides that moving to the
right here we've got our chassis fans as
we mentioned before we've got our front
out USB 2 ports and then we've got a
BIOS selection switch which is actually
really good I mean I like that you can
select it so if you come into a bad bias
flash you can then quickly change it and
then flash the bad boss again and you're
back in business so I like that feature
I also like that you've got an actual
manual clear CMOS jumper here as well
for those people without a screwdriver
and then besides that we've got a
comport out in a Thunderbolt out as well
so upon closer inspection here we can
see they've got the
purity sound - and I don't think the
named honestly doesn't do it enough
justice because the bond closure and
especially we've got niche akan caps
which are really good you've got a TI
Texas Instruments dedicated headphone
amplifier which is the NE 5 v 3 - you've
also got the realtek 1150 as well which
has really low signal-to-noise ratios
that's all shielded with an EMI shield
and they've also separated the audio
from the rest of the PCB to reduce noise
again so the audio solution is really
good as you'll hear later with the mic
in test so not only have they got the
headphone out really good they've got
the mic input really good as well to
keep noise down
so for someone like me this onboard
audio solution is actually really good
so moving on into the middle of the
board here we've got three pcie 3.0 16
speeds slots here with the first and
second slot being spaced out
considerably well that's good if you're
going with a dual SLI air-cooled
configuration there however it's a bit
difficult if you're going with maybe a
water-cooled setup or something like
that so looking to the side that you've
got
PCI 2/1 speed slots then you've also got
an ultra m2 slot there for an SSD as
well you've also got your CMOS battery
there and you've also got your dual BIOS
chips right there below that you've got
a PCIe mini I believe and then let's
move on now to the rear of the
motherboard so moving on to the back
here from the top to the bottom we've
got two USB 2 outs we've got a ps2 out
below that we've got a clear CMOS button
which in my opinion is an absolute
necessity on the x99 platform
considering every CPU on this platform
is overclockable below that we've got 2
USB 3 ports below that we've got an
Eastsider out below that we've got a
qualcomm atheros Ethernet out or ni c
and then besides that we've got 2 USB 3
outs below that again we've got 2 USB 3
outs and besides that we've got an Intel
an IC or a Gigabit Ethernet out so you
got two men I seized on this solution I
really like that below that we've got a
mic in line in and headphone out I love
this solution being someone who uses it
and records a lot you've also got manual
5.1 analog out there as well as an
optical out which apparently supports up
to 7.1
channel audio as well now another thing
to mention about this as well as all
these components here are guarded with
as rocks spike protection as well which
they claim I actually can't test this
because I don't have a lightning bolt on
my hands but anyway with that being said
that's a physical overview of the
motherboard let's move along now to the
actual look at the BIOS and we'll look
at the software that comes included I'll
do a mic test talk about the audio and
talk about a few extra features with
this motherboard then we'll move on to a
conclusion so let's take a quick look in
the asrock UEFI extreme six BIOS here
the x99 we can see here that it's
feature-packed it has everything that I
would personally want from a BIOS CPU
configuration you got there all the core
ratios you've got individual core ratios
you've also got the big clock strap
there as well different filters and
spread settings Dhiren configuration
again it's pretty intricate you've got
all the things you could want I mean the
voltages there as well set different
voltages and adaptive mode etc voltage
mode you can put your CPU input voltage
as well and different other voltages
there so you've also got five
configurations and profiles that you can
save to the boss and going on to
advanced you've got more settings there
tools even more settings now one thing I
will point out that I like about this is
you can if you've got an internet
connection from a router or something
you can just pretty much flash the BIOS
without having to do anything just click
internet flash and it will download the
latest blast for you and flash it so
that's a really cool feature that I like
about the as rocker motherboards you get
your hardware monitor their security
options your boot options there as well
and then you can exit Save Changes and
exit as well okay so let's move on now
to some power consumption figures here
and some benchmarks for you guys so I
decided to run a quick sinner bench test
here with the gigabyte X 99 new t4 and
then I ran it with the extreme six all
other hardware being the same or clocks
on the RAM and CPU being the same and as
you see the asrock extreme 6 I'll just
pull up the direct benchmark scores for
you there it won by just a little bit it
was nothing much in it there they
performed pretty much identical although
the ads work estranged 6 did win by a
very slight amount there and that could
be put down to variance however living
on now the power consumption this is
what bothers me a little bit about the
extreme six the gigabyte x99 UD for used
up about 320 watts at four gigs and then
when we contrast that overclocked to the
extreme six that's using up about 380
watts from the wall keep in mind this is
on an 85% efficient power supply or a
bronze rated power supply if you had a
better rate of power play these figures
would be a bit low but it's still worth
mentioning that the XD extremes six it
uses up more power than the x99 UD four
also on idle it was using up around
about 15 watts more than the UD 4 as
well compared to the x99 slight loss off
the top of my head the overclock figures
are a little bit worse than the x99
slide plus as well so maybe that Joule
MOSFET design isn't as good as it seems
or it's good for temperatures but it's
not good for power consumption because I
believe off the top of my head the more
MOSFETs you have all the faster the
MOSFET switch the cooler they will
indeed stay however the more power is
wasted when the switch is going off when
the MOSFET switches from one to another
that's what I believe maybe some experts
can chime in here but so maybe that
Joule MOSFET design although keeps the
temperatures down it might be a bit of a
detriment in terms of power consumption
so let's move on now to onboard Audion
you're probably wondering why I'm
talking on this mic over my studio mic
and the reason is I wanted to show you
how little hiss or how little noise it
was on the mic in as you guys can see
here I'm just using the levels of 60 + +
30 DB gain with no noise suppression and
so what this means is if you probably
did this on a normal motherboard you'd
probably get a lot of his coming through
there's absolutely no hiss coming
through a really good job they've done a
really good job on the mic end and the
line in its well on to the actual
headphone out when I did a crosstalk
tests and I just turned the volume to
max and then I just put my left ear on
there and the right channels playing and
you just listen really carefully if you
can hear noise coming through the left
channel that's crosstalk it's basically
when noise leaks from one channel
to the other there was basically none on
this on board on audio solution or
barely audible at all
just like the and as easier 7k that I
recently reviewed so awesome job has
works done an awesome job on the onboard
audio solution this time around really
good job there anyway with that being
said let's move on to a conclusion where
I'll sum up some of the things that I
like and some of things that I don't
like about this motherboard so in
conclusion what can I say about the
asrock x99 stream 6 well a lot of good
that's for sure I mean first of all it
works it's an X 99 motherboard that
works and it works well it runs cool my
overclocks don't crash wants this once I
found my stable over blocks they don't
crash the motherboard doesn't crash at
random unlike the X 99 UD for from
gigabyte that I got here it doesn't blow
up like the MSI's slide + motherboard
that I had come through and doesn't get
contaminated like that either
so oh and old the extreme sticks just
works it's a solid motherboard let's
look at the good side of things though
the onboard audio solution it's
phenomenal I don't need my Anders easier
at 7k anymore I just bought that and I
was enjoying it and then I tried this
onboard audio solution and I can go sell
the N des now because I don't need it
it's useless now because this has such
low crosstalk as well the mic in was
really good as well the functionality of
the board I like the fact that as rocks
gone with function over fanciness
instead of implementing fancy LEDs on
the board they've given you the clear
CMOS button power reset buttons Julie
and I sees things that make sense and
that's a really good thing as well
another thing I will point out that I
didn't point out earlier in the video
was the they put a sapphire black sole
during mass code on there and I
personally I prefer this over the matte
black coat that a lot of motherboard
manufacturers have been using I mean
some people will like the matte black
coat and that's that's I mean that's
awesome for you but for me it's like
synonymous with cheap I mean I used to
drift cars and when you crashed your car
what did you paint your car with matte
black paint for your on if you didn't
have money to fix it so and that black
to me is kind of synonymous with cheap
that's just me okay so now we looked at
some of the positives let's look at some
of the negatives and some of the things
I think that could be improved on with
extreme six and the first thing is the
power consumption as you guys saw that
it was quite a bit behind the UD 4 and
it was a little bit behind the SLI Plus
as well from memory so maybe the dual
mosfet design even though it keeps
temperatures down it might be working
against asrock in that it's making the
board a little less efficient so that's
something maybe that Azeroth won't might
want to think about in the future maybe
going with a different mosfet design
because I think the gigabyte uly4 has
the most efficient implementation of a
VR ram out there at the moment also the
idle temps suggested this as well as it
was hovering around about 15 watts more
than the UD 4 and a little bit higher
than the x99s sli plus as well so
something as ROC might want to look into
though it may have to do with the BIOS
settings too as you saw there even when
I fixed my voltage at one point one volt
it was still going up to one point one
five volt like it was giving it a 50
millivolt over vault with fixed modes so
that's something that asrock you guys
might want to look into maybe the BIOS
needs a bit of a rework in terms of the
voltage settings there I'm not too sure
but - mine was 50 millivolt overhauled
so anyway okay the next thing is more of
a personal things more of a subjective
thing some people might look like the
look of the extreme 6 however I found it
to be a little bit tacky like things
like the clip of the clips on the DIMM
slots that were white I thought they
should have been color-coded to blue and
black another thing like the silver
badging on the heatsinks the x99 and the
asrock I thought that was a little bit
weird I thought should have been printed
on a little bit less subtle or a little
bit more subtle sorry
and another thing as well as the blue
and black I think it didn't really do it
for me I think you know instead of going
with the in-between just go with a
really simple look like the old black
like the SLI plus or go full-out fancy
rainbow LEDs because in terms of
functionality and utility the extreme
Stix is the best board I've had come
through here out of the x99 series
however in terms of looks it's the worst
so you guys might want to have a little
look at the look of this board and maybe
change some colors up a little bit there
as opposed with the marketing I mean the
extreme ride I've had the Z is 77 the
Brij I had the extreme 4 and when I got
that it's sort of imprinted in my memory
that hey the extreme low girl extreme
brand means good onboard audio good a
good NAC good overclocker though the
extreme six has phenomenal onboard audio
it has a phenomenal ni c it has a really
good boss I can't test if it overclocks
because of you guys know might as well
ECP you lost the silicon lottery so I
can't really test if this is an
extremely good overclocking board or not
though the other two departments really
good so phenomenal and I'd like to see
them maybe change up the naming a little
bit like MSI did with the z87 gaming
that made me hey research the board and
say okay this is better than the
previous generation I'm sticking with
the same naming all the time you're sort
of saying okay this is this this is this
and this is this it's gonna continue on
this way we've got a good onboard audio
solution next gen we've got good though
with the extreme six clearly this time
you've got a phenomenal onboard audio
solution so let that be known with a
different name and make people like
myself research it so anyway guys that
being said there's not a lot more about
this board it works so if you guys want
a motherboard that just simply works and
it's not gonna give you headaches then
go get yourself a next ninety nine
extreme for an extreme six from as rock
because it it just works for me I'm
headache free now when I use and when I
overclock with my motherboard so really
good job there everything else I mean
the field the board have felt solid the
utility and the functionality is board
really good as well so kudos to you guys
for making a really good motherboard and
if you have any feedback or if you have
any comments about this motherboard
please leave a comment the comment
section below and I'll catch you guys
with another tech video very soon as for
the price I think it comes in at around
about 350 in Australia Japan
I think it's under three hundred dollars
there's around about two hundred and
eighty in the u.s. so that price it's a
really good board I mean the extreme
fall is even cheaper I think it doesn't
have the dual ni C though yeah maybe -
the buttons as well but honestly the
same core utility and functionality the
same awesome onboard audio solution is
still there as well so stream for the
extremes
man these are my new x99 recommendations
for motherboards so hope you guys
enjoyed this review if you did please
get a thumbs up and I'll catch you guys
in another tech review very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
