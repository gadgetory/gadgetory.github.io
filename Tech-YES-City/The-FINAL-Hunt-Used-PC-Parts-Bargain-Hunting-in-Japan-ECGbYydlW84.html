mostly staying at a hotel here but I
know you guys want to see one more use
parts hunt for the road and today I'm
going to go on that hunt share with you
guys all the secrets all the tips on how
to get the best deals in Japan so let's
do it
welcome to taxi this is brand coming to
you guys today with the final used PC
bargain hunt and basically today we're
looking for of course those bargains but
I'm also looking for a PC case that I
can pick up for next to nothing because
we've got to build coming for you guys
like tomorrow and that's going to be
like again price performance last build
for Japan but don't worry I'm gonna
still be doing built when I get back to
a stray but anyway we're at pace called
hot off and essentially these are the
ones that I go to and they're outside of
the city now if you're in Tokyo or like
really in a populated city you're
generally not going to want to go to
them those places because a the staff
like know what the stuffs worth and they
generally test it and be you've got to
compete with a lot of people who are
ready hawking those places so the ones
that i go to a generally remote areas in
the country where the stuff don't know
the stuffs worth and i mean a lot of
people don't know what they're looking
for so that's where you're gonna get the
bargains and let's get on with it
so we're just inside this place and
they've just got nothing but trash here
so I mean for PC paths there might be
some other good stuff if you're into
retro hunting or whatnot but like
looking at the deals I mean they don't
have any cases either like they do have
cases but they're like penny ins in
their real old penny ins and they're not
even worth 20 bucks in my opinion so
we're going to move on to the next place
and keep hustling
now we just did a hard off at a place
called fresh paw shopping mall it's in
yatta Kaito I think now this one is one
of my favorites mainly because you can
get some really good deals here
especially in the past I picked up like
cases CPU Ram fans on there and even GP
using there's like 15 to 20 bucks so
we're going to take a look and see
what's inside see if we get a bargain so
rockin up straight into this place we've
got a power supply here which has got
three rails there for the 12 volt line
and that's essentially 500 Watts
available there because they can combine
to put out a lot and that's a dollar
so someone roll the slack voice I'll
take that and now up here we have a
computer the cooler master case for 20
bucks but inside it looks like we've got
LGA 771 am so going to pull this apart
see what's inside and see if it's worth
taking so we just pulled this thing open
and it looks like we got a P 5v in here
which should support LGA 771 Xeon so I
gotta take this just because the
motherboard looks pretty clean it's also
got some graphics card in there but you
got 4 gigabytes of what looks like
overclockable memory inside even a power
splay which is 400 watts but I'm not too
concerned about that because that's
probably what's wrong with this PC is
this thing blew out most likely just
because our clean it looks inside so
we're definitely picking this up now
rocking around the other side here they
got some motherboards but you can see
here like people have gone through and
I'm pretty sure they just played bang
their fingers on the pins because you've
got $30 on this motherboard but I'm sure
they wouldn't sell that with those type
of pins for 30 bucks and ironically
they've just got the motherboard here
that I just picked up off Yahoo for 25
bucks this is the H 55 so1 for the
upcoming build they've got one of these
but again the pins are absolutely
screwed same with this board here like
such nice motherboards that again ruined
on the pins but that's about it for this
place so we're going to grab those two
items and we're going to keep on
hustling oh I just bought this and the
guy said oh there's no power going into
it and I checked the back and I'm pretty
sure that's why someone put it on 230
volt in a country that has a hundred
volt out of the walls
I think that was your problem there but
I'm not regardless anyway the power
supply was like the worst thing in this
build also we had another case in there
a white one and I checked inside was a
$30 one and there just feels 2 gig of
ram and old motherboard really wasn't
worth it so let's keep moving
so we're the next heart off now and I
don't exactly know where this one is so
with that said I'd like to give a
special shout out to my friend Google
Maps what up and also before we went in
here I don't know how to price up that
case we got that case for $20 with all
the parts inside so I'll sing at about
five dollars because I mean I could
easily sell that motherboard in a
heartbeat for $15 so plus has got the
ran the CPU and the CPU fan in there and
most likely Boston power supply but
anyway let's get inside and see what
this place has got anyway we just got
outside of that hot off and that was a
complete Boston they also asked me to
stop filming as soon as I went inside so
don't know what's going on there maybe
they don't want the bad word to be
spread around about this hot off so I'll
put the location in the description
below brothers and avoid this one like
the plague so we're just at a place
called PC Depot now believe it or not
they have some really good deals from
time to time on used graphics cards and
motherboards like that z77 that I picked
up in the past for like $20 I got it
from this exact one here and also the 79
70 and 60 CT eyes I got them from the PC
depots to want a narrator and this one
here so really good deals can be had if
you look around at some of the PC depots
but not just that they sometimes have
really good prices on like 750 TI's and
sort of new graphics cards at a
mid-range and I find as well hard drives
so if you're in the market for new hard
drives you might want to check the PC
depot sometimes they have sales on the
weekends so there you go let's go in
anyway have a look what they've got
so we're just inside now and some of
these deals in here are mediocre I mean
their fair value kind of thing sitting
at that level I don't know how much
they've got on that 1060 armored Edition
there but yeah it's kind of like not
really a bust I wouldn't call it a boss
but wouldn't really call it any bargains
here either so we got a 69 50 there for
around about $60 so kind of fair game
here if you're looking to build like a
fair value use PC then it wouldn't be
too bad but nothing really that caught
my eye here so let's get on to the next
place
so it is a hard off slash hobby off and
this one usually has like they usually
split up all the PC components here and
then put them on the shelves but you can
pick up some decent deals here so we'll
take a look at what's inside see if
they've got any good things cracking in
there and see the other deals on wheels
if you know how I feels so strolling
through here they've got my $5 case that
I was actually looking for but it's
actually got some parts in this I'll
check that one out and also this one
here is $10 so I'll take a look at
what's inside these two and see if
there's anything worth getting inside
them like damn you know like sometimes
the screws are on so tight that you've
just got to walk around the store and go
to the bin here and just pick out a $1
screwdriver so you can open up the cases
inside the store
damn this thing looks like it's got ddr1
in there sir I mean if you get this
thing and just be getting it for the
case so I gotta say though case is kind
of pretty cool for five bucks just so
the next guy can feel my pain
so actually upon opening this really
ugly case it's actually got some pretty
cool hardware inside so I'm thinking
we're looking at around 2006 since this
graphics card is a 6600 GT and also the
gravis looks like it's the first
iteration of PCI Express and we've got
cited one there as well now this is only
ten bucks so I'm guessing it's got a
dual core in there and looks like a
decent motherboard and a power supply
now I would pick this up if I was
staying in Japan longer because I'd love
to give you guys another AMD use PC
build just to see what this thing could
do but you know I've unfortunately I've
got to get parts that I've got to put in
a box and post back to Australia so this
one's kind of not worth it since it's so
old it's not worth putting it in the box
and me paying postage to post back to
Australia so I'll let you guys know on
the description below where this heart
off is so if anyone wants to come and
pick this up then they can so it's not a
bad deal so I'm just looking through
their motherboards now and it's like p45
neo and they're asking like $32 dreamin
like that's a dollar that's not too bad
like if you knew how to retrofit that
onto a motherboard that actually be
really good value for money I've
actually used one of these in the past
on a build really not bad value for a
dollar that's a lot of metal it's
actually two of them here so damn so I
want better get down to this heart off
and pick up some of these deals like I'd
post them back to Oz if they didn't
weigh so much damn so other than that
they've also got this at the front here
as well I 340 130 build for around about
$200 that's not too bad if you were just
to stick like a 750ti in it you'd be
pretty good to go
other than that yet not a whole lot here
that I'd be diving for I mean some of
the stuff is fair value like I think
they have a power supply here at the
back a gold Strider there it is
Silverstone Strider gold that's around
$80 me that's an 850 watt power supply
so that's not too bad as well yeah kind
of like fair game here
so that's about it let's go get on home
and put all the deals out on the table
and talk used parts it's on the way home
Google Maps found another heart off
which is really not out of the way so at
this point in time I'm a Google Maps
fanboy and also we're going to go in and
see if they got deals one last time so
I'm just looking through this place now
and it's like there is nothing here
I think someone's raided this place
already because the junk bins are just
full of like literally junk I mean yeah
I mean what the hell is that like an
Intel hietzing that I've never seen
before also some of the labels on the
stuff it's like that old that it's like
yellowed it's like okay I think that
means they need a kind of like recheck
their deals and maybe change the prices
up a little bit
so I'm finally back at the hotel now and
today was really awesome because I was
looking for a case and also those
cream-of-the-crop deals and I got it all
in one at that place at the fresco so
that was really cool I'm just going to
take all the pots out of this case and
then ship them back to Oz I'm not even
going to test I'm just going to take a
gamble and also that power supply I'm
going to test that pretty soon and see
if that works but um the other places
did have some good deals but I kind of
passed up on them due to the situation
and I went on a Tuesday so I'll suited
and booted and the reason was for that
is because I finished work and I
literally took the car and just went
straight hunting and I was lucky because
it was a Tuesday and there was really no
traffic at all so on that note if you
guys are going to be PC part hunting in
Japan I'd recommend going on a Tuesday
if you're driving because they'll be
leave least amount of traffic and also
go on a Friday if you're looking for the
best deals because on a Friday I find
that's when all the new stock gets on
the shelves so now I'm going to get on
now to building this PC here and get the
final build done for you guys so I can't
wait to do that and that should be out
tomorrow but I have to edit it and
whatnot so I don't know exactly when
it'll hit the channel but I'll get it as
soon as I can so if you guys like this
video then please give it a big fat like
and also if you have any hunts and deals
that you've scored in the past let me
know in this conversation below I love
reading all the comments and I look
forward to seeing you in another tech
video very soon
peace out for now bye alright so the
power supply boots works and also
something else about this power supply
as it was actually five dollars and it
doesn't have any of the connectors on it
so I'm gonna have to splice in a solder
connector on the 24 pin and maybe use it
in like a 70 50 TI build or something
but not to worry $5 is good for a power
supply
put it in a box and post it back to
Australia for what they're worth
that's just what I'm thinking at the
moment so yeah I think we'll give this
one a pass you guys know where this
place is I'll put in description below
so I wanted to come and pick up this one
 some guys telling an overhead
projector not now hang on Steve what's
he asking 150 tally means dreaming yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
