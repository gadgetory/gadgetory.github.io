many nails on the head I'm surprised
they even have a hammer left first they
have the x-37 itachi which is arguably
one of the best x3 17:4 motherboards out
there they've also introduced some
really cool mini ITX boards and now
they've got the x2 99 gaming i9 which
has all the features of the x2 99 Taichi
has but also features 10 gigabits per
second Ethernet so like all the
motherboard reviews around here let's
put this thing through the paces and see
if it is worthy of your money welcome
back to tag yes City and where do we
begin with this motherboard well there's
a 13 phase vrm with Intersil is l99 2 to
7 B MOSFETs
these rated up to 60 amps and you get 13
of them which I believe 12 are dedicated
to the CPU so that allows up to 720 amps
of power available for the CPU now 65
amp magic are 15 chokes these are 65
amps and then you've got niche con 12 K
capacitors so some of the best
components have been put onto this VRM
and when testing this thing out I had
absolutely no problems taking the CPU to
4.7 gigahertz now the problem there was
that the CPU was starting to hit a
hundred degrees at four point seven I
got even boot into four point eight but
honestly if you guys are getting at
7,900 X I'd recommend taking it back
down to four point four four point five
and when I was doing some vrm
temperature tests even at 4.6 gigahertz
this VR and was only getting up to sixty
degrees on the heatsink itself and it
has plenty more room to go they'll see
our hard core of cooker and you do want
to get really high speeds on the 7900 X
which will get insane amount of power
draw then I do recommend maybe upgrading
to some water cooling on the vrm as
definitely this 13 phases will be able
to take a lot more punishment and I know
there will be some people out there that
are wondering is this eight pin power
connector enough for heavy overclocked
and in my opinion yes it has been
upgraded from a typical power connector
so they do put thicker components on
there and that will allow you to get
more power drawn especially if you've
got a really expensive power supply that
8 pin power connector on the power
supply will allow additional power
delivery over your standard 200
30 watt reading I mean even nowadays on
even a standard cz 270 motherboard you
should be able to get a lot more than
the typical 230 what power draw so
before we get on with other parts of
this review this motherboard features a
10 gigabits per second Ethernet port and
now one of these cards one like this
will set you back a few hundred dollars
so the fact that this motherboard hasn't
integrated onboard is a really cool
thing and upon testing out the speeds
they will religious you could get up to
10 units per second Ethernet connection
speed and that's the one thing you will
need very fast storage in order to
properly utilize these speeds so moving
through this multiple we have eight DIMM
slots quad channel memory it supports up
to four point four gigahertz of OC on
your memory however I could only get my
memory to three point three goats which
is limited to the memory itself but
Steve from Hardware unbox who also has
this motherboard said he had four
gigahertz XMP Pro involves working
perfectly fine on the gaming I nine
moving along down the ball we also have
two USB three out and one of them is
angled as well for better cable
management and you go to USB 3.1 a and C
front out first that I've seen and I
actually don't even have a port to test
this thing out down below that is 1033
ports and you also get to RGB headers
and five four pin fan connectors one of
which is they've water pump and civil
support double the power of a typical
four pin fan out and then you get a
power and reset button and a doctor
debug LED BIOS readout however speaking
of the five four pin PWM fan connectors
they can be directly controlled by the
bias itself and now in my bias you have
a lot of things that you can do first of
all is this simple and advanced
overclocking I prefer the advanced
overclocking features you can control
core voltage memory overclock and also
save overclocking profiles on the fly
there's all these ability to instantly
flash your bias if you just have an
internet connection which does save a
lot of time also if we bring in
overclocking tutorial on this
motherboard with the 7900 X so stay
tuned for that and you can also control
the RGB lighting via the bias or you can
control it via the software itself and
in Windows the asrock tuning utility as
well allows you to overclock on the fly
which is great for extreme overclockers
you have to slowly raise the speeds
otherwise their system could crash when
going for liquid nitrogen overclocks
then running along the bottom of the
bottle is you've got to USB to front out
and also a TPM connector and a Texas
Instruments any five five three two
headphone amplifier on the front audio
out which is connected to the Sound
Blaster cinema 3 however that is the
software suite the actual codec itself
is the realtek 12:20 which has really
good audio out when i connected to my b
motor headphones and also the mic input
is really good too
even with things like noise suppression
turned off this sound was really good
i'll let you guys have a listen here's
what the v-moda boom pro mic will sound
like plugged directly into the x2 99
gaming home motherboard with a volume
input level of 50 and a plus 20 decibel
gain and then turning this thing back
around to the center of the motherboard
we have four PCIe 16 speed slots which
support the steel armor which adds
strength to those slots themselves
however two of those slots are only
eight speed and these are all Gen 3 and
then you've got that one speed mini
which according to the boss only
supports up to pcie 2.0 then besides
that we have 3 m dot 2 slots which are
bootable and can be stored in different
raid configurations as for the cosmetics
asrock have gone with a gunmetal and
black style theme and this is pretty
much throughout all directs $2.99
motherboards very subtle and you also
get RGB included on the south heat sink
which is controllable in both the bios
and windows itself and the software is
really easy to use and you can also
configure different RGB lights coming
out of the to RGB headers on the board
so you can seem it to things like music
and also different static and breathing
lighting effects so the last thing on
this board is the rear input and output
you get two USB twos which support a
thousand Hertz polling appears to put
dual band AC Wireless which also has
support for Bluetooth and support speeds
up to 433 megabits per second and below
that you've got a boss flashback button
which on this board of course you have
dual BIOS feature however I must say
that I do prefer the old school bar flip
button where you can just switch between
the different blasters this however if
the boss is faulty on the main you can
just flash back with the backup boss to
the original boss that you had below
that you get a clear CMOS button very
handy and then below that you get three
rj45 in out ports one of which of course
is the Tangier you
per second port there's also four USB 3
ports one 3.8 and one 3.1 types see
below that you have your audio input
output with 5.1 analog support and also
support for 7.1 channel surround sound
so in conclusion if you are in the
market for an X 299 motherboard and you
want to get the extra features of the
gaming eye 9 offers for instance tangu
bits per second Ethernet the onboard
power and reset button which is great
for a test bench it's also got that USB
3.1 front out connection and as well as
the upgraded software suite on the sound
side of things with the creative cinema
3 sound however here's where things get
tricky with the gaming i9x $2.99
motherboard it currently costs 400 USD
which is a lot to ask for a motherboard
however feature wise I personally
couldn't ask for anything more from a
motherboard so it does have it all
however that price is expensive though
keep in mind again you are saving a few
hundred dollars if you were to go out
and buy a 10 gigabits per second
Ethernet add-in card so that is up to
you guys but it definitely offers more
features over the Taichi
if you certainly don't need things like
this in the on-board power buttons and
the USB 3.1 front out then the Taichi
would certainly be a better
recommendation for you and of course the
last thing I'll touch on is considering
how early in the phase it is 4 X 299 I'm
surprised the asrock boards are as
stable as they are I didn't really have
any real big hiccups when testing this
thing maybe some old ddr4 memory not
being recognized but again as BIOS
updates come into play those things will
be supported by memory compatibility and
also any little bugs will be ironed out
that I'm sure of
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
review if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
the gaming ai9 I personally think in
2017 as well have just been doing a
phenomenal job on their motherboards
anyway guys I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
