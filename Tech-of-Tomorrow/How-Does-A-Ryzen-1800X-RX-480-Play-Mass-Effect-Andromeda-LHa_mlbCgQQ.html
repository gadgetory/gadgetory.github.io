news that's right Mass Effect Andromeda
has hit the shelves and this is one damn
flying game now I don't know about you
but I'm a serious fan of this game most
games you just go around shooting shit
up killing shit or little puzzles here
and there i feel that mass effect offers
the most intense game or experience you
can get you do puzzles you meet people
you talk to people you kill shit your
plan you strategize just all in all one
hell of a fracking game now i know
there's a lot of people out there
they're wondering hey man 1800 X's come
out and is this going to be able to
handle my gaming experience so check
this out our system which is the rising
phoenix system it features an 1800 x and
it also features an RX for 80 so now
let's check out and let's see how this
system plays Mass Effect Andromeda for
you folks for wondering what our
settings are you can see them right here
now we were unable to actually get the
game to play on the ultra setting there
were screen tearing ripping just all in
all not a good experience so we notched
it down just to the high settings and
doing this the overall game experience
was pretty damn killer now here we can
first check out gameplay in 4k now you
guys can see 4k gameplay with this game
right now with all the drivers a couple
the 480 is just not cutting it
whatsoever and the reason that we didn't
run crossfire active as we figured most
of times cross buyers not even supported
if the game does support crossfire then
obviously we will probably see some
better specs at the 4k resolution but
for now it's pretty lagging I would call
it playable but not very you know much
of a great experience right
good it what's it the guy's be movement
he'll come off of the week no idea a lot
of people still counting on us of the
day woke up
jump on
oh look through boys it's late anyway I
don't know but they sure what it back
I think already picked out what off well
50 subscription is the wrong usually
comes right off the fuck back just a
little longer
any progress decryption is the facade
for sentencing we've almost got it
could be regrouping for another person
think so
description ninth-inning and security
over us right open the door premier
damage and I need to take a look at it
gosh I need your help over here goes
okay we'll keep a lookout we need to get
this door open on it
i kn--again elegant at Dimona
now at fourteen forty things do get
better everything is playable no screen
ripping or anything like that frame
rates really aren't the greatest in the
world if you people out there you want
solid 60 frame per section and above
then you know this might not exactly be
the best setup good it what's it like I
see movement
he'll come off of the setup we can do it
again a lot of people still counting on
us spider jump up your phone Amy
business you come off your dad
25 the description hurry we don't have
long
Oh
where's my anyway I don't know but if
you wanna back well Jessica Spencer
Krypton it's an unusually competition
and son I can see why we chose the
search I will need a moment to run amok
we are accountable to it that I think I
really pissed i wore off maybe because i
saw him in the face any progress
direction is that Marcus incracy we've
almost got it just a little longer could
be recruiting for another push thanks up
decryption complete I did it the
security override I'll try to open the
door from here damn it's jammed I need
to take a look at it
I need your help over here so what's up
oh well give up check out the 1080p
gameplay it looks frickin beautiful man
frame rates up to 80 frames per second
so this game is definitely playable with
this system at 1080 so all in all you
guys can see this game looks freaking
incredible but if you want to run it on
ultra it looks like it's going to take
just a wee bit more power than we're
seeing here go out and have a negative
story let me supply that right so always
keep you jump jet handy okay
and don't be shy come see me when you
have a chance in a website on tight
irina started an Italian supplies and
they look on salty you another cool a
very good for Senate always will get you
all here when am I ready go
hold on relevant repair requests are
currently on hold until the power
coupling
that's a sexist control
right lien
all personnel be aware of any sort of
activity the curious I killer most am I
going to do is willful is toxic what if
they store oxygen in porous tissue like
quiros rockfish I still recommend
breather gear stowed in that armor
perhaps both life is infinitely
adaptable as our expedition proof
pathfinder rider if you will and discuss
engineering liberian power draw in now
and 100 please report to the Hyperion
come again
better
alright moving on duc tran technicians
please fetch my hearing something
crew she reports the docking area at one
that's stirred I'm wondering about data
calling radiation shoot hyperion butron
now and what is the life all the nodules
intertwined
where any activity security another
heightened alert hey there and Addison
first Pathfinder they've seen in over a
year all she can do is quit observing
your analyses all right folks so there
you have it the rising phoenix system
consisting of obviously the 1800 x and
the RX for 80 now you guys sauce the
video gameplay looks really good not
quite 4k ready but at 1080p men
everything is looking so if you're a
person out that you're wondering hey man
if i get an 82 internet system and i
have a 40 is it going to play my game
