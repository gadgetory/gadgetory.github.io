another day on techna tomorrow me your
host Network Ferris with an introduction
of another new phone for those fools who
use tmobile like myself and that is the
new Samsung Galaxy blaze s 4g phone
using the new 1.5 gigahertz snapdragon
this phone is rumored to have speeds up
to 42 megabits a second that's like
really incredible it's like having files
on your phone we'll see if it actually
actually does that speed that said
though let's hop right in and take a
look at the features of this here phone
alright like we said a second ago this
phone is going to be 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s3 processor this
is still a dual-core processor but
that'll save on battery life and
everything this thing is also going to
have a five megapixel rear camera and a
1.3 megapixel camera in the front now
some of the cool things are it's going
to have a 3.97 inch display with Super
AMOLED technology that helps make the
screen be very very tough and resolution
to scratch it all up although a lot of
people are probably going to go out and
just put one of those zag covers on it
anyways but it's still pretty cool stuff
it's also going to have one gigabyte of
RAM now here's where things start to get
though really disappointing for t-mobile
and fan droids this thing is not going
to have ice cream sandwich on it at all
nope that's going to be completely out t
bulbs also not promising in the upgrades
in this for the future so right now
you're going to be stuck using android
OS 2.3 supposedly this phone is going to
be selling at about a hundred and fifty
dollars but you and I both know that's
 no phone sales front in fig
dollars unless you're going getting into
year contract if so then saying it's
hundred fifty dollars yeah it's going to
be a hundred fifty dollars for somebody
who's signing a contract probably more
like four or five hundred dollars if you
want to walk in and buy it off the
street if you're somebody has been an
existing t-mobile customer like myself
you can just get the upgrade program and
get a free phone if you're doing that
but the hundred fifty dollar price is
being discussed here is definitely going
to be for someone signing a two-year
contract now the bonus with that though
is like huge when you buy a phone for
the people with t-mobile you always get
a fifty-dollar mail-in rebate so that's
it folks the new galaxy 4 S Blaze phone
is going to be hitting the market you'll
see this phone first released march 21st
and you'll see it nationwide by March 28
thanks for watching teka tomorrow I'll
see you folks back here later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
