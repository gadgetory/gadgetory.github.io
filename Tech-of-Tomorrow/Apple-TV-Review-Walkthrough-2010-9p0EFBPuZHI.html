at tech of tomorrow on the YouTube
channel well today we've got something
really cool of you to take a look at
we've got the review of the new Apple TV
a lot of UPC guys are going Apple TV or
check it out it's only 99 bucks and it's
pretty cool thing it's got hdmi out for
your TV it's got digital audio out for
you guys like digital sound it's also
got an Ethernet connection in there so
you can stream all your movies off the
internet right now I have a screen up
right now which is about these movies
currently right now you can rent movies
directly off of itunes for five dollars
a piece now this isn't from Apple mind
you this is from the companies that are
selling the movies Apple themselves are
trying to get movies down to 99 cents
now one of the really cool features
about this new apple TV is its ability
to stream all of these TV programs it
also streams media from the internet and
also constraint to any of your iTunes
computers in the house it will not work
with windows media player but it will
with itunes so if you have a pc and you
have an itunes account you can stream
your music from any computer in the
house in november they'll actually be an
update coming from Apple will you be
actually stream your movies in the same
capacity but right now this is a really
cool product I think for ninety-nine
dollars it's very interesting because
you can get netflix and some of these
other subscription things for like ten
dollars a month and then stream all
those things directly on your TV so unit
can be used in more than one way you can
hook it up directly to your TV and use
it as like your little TV box for
streaming music and videos off the
internet or it can be used and your
Wi-Fi system to stream your music so
it's got two benefits right now I really
do like the ability of having be the S
PDF audio out because you can run that
right into your 5.1 receiver and get 5.1
sound currently you're only getting 720
HD on here I call that mini HD if people
have laughed at that but you get 720 HD
right now it's not the same as the full
but it's still pretty good so let's go
over the facts ninety-nine bucks Apple
TV currently available only
at the apple store it should be
available other places later you can
stream all of your iTunes you can stream
all of your movies and you can do all
that from a little box that's about this
big around so I stayed thumbs up it's a
cool little device I actually borrowed
one of my friends from his site tldtoday
I'm sought to go out and buy my own
today you might want to check out this
review on tldtoday on the youtube
channel as well but here is my thanks
for watching here's a movie it's being
streamed directly right now very very
clear this must be the psychic guy he
thinks he can read your mind I'm getting
your mind and your liking this review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
