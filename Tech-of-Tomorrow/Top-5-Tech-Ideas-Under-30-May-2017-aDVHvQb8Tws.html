fans social misfits and all the
rest of you out there in YouTube land
welcome back once again do teka tomorrow
we have the top 5 little nifty little
gadgets and tech things under 30 dollars
amazon edition yes indeed now I'm gonna
be on to you guys right off the start
looking around trying to find cool tech
items that aren't like more than 25 or
30 dollars actually kind of hard to as
much of like the same same same same
thing so let me ask you guys a question
after today's video I'd appreciate if
you guys would leave links down below to
what you guys think are the absolute
most cool it stuff leave a link to
wherever they sell like what you guys
think is the coolest ass Tech that you'd
like to see in a top 5 video so I can
check it out and bring it here because
like when I'm looking around stuff like
most thing I see is four thousand
speakers thousand headphone styles in
cases thousand millions yeah you know
I'm saying though right it just gets all
washed and mixed so these are the ones
that I found for this much I thought
they were pretty cool things for what
they are but let's jump in and let's
check out the top 5 for the month of May
here on tell you harm raah first off a
phone cover for an iPhone 7 that's right
cuz you know these are
overpriced so you need something to
protect it well the one I have in my
hand is actually pretty cool it's pretty
durable I don't know if it like you know
doom dropping off a bus or anything like
that for general usage and everything
it's pretty cool it's pretty lights that
this kind of made this new material it's
actually pretty effective let's check it
out
I'm talking about the an mesh to dust
and chakras in the case for the iPhone 7
it's made of some weird new Japanese
elastomer that's right elastomer you can
look that bad boy up somewhere now you
guys can see this thing's pretty stylist
it looks cool and all the little ribs
inside of it actually helped to keep the
phone from getting damaged somehow with
the technology behind this thing the way
the case works is that when it smacks
down it absorbs like the impact so that
way your phone doesn't get damaged now
currently these cases are right at the
30 dollar mark and that's why I had to
make the video for under $30 I kind of
want to keep under 25 but that this case
was too cool to miss out on but at the
end of the day if you don't want a bulky
case you want something just really nice
you can access all your buttons on it
without problems whatsoever and it's
still durable you guys might want to
check this out now this next product is
kind
Trippi thing it's the snap power guide
leg now I just want you guys to be
completely obsolete how many times have
you guys been selectively high drunk or
whatever and it's at night time you're
trying to find a plug and you know you
don't want to go to the light switch and
your school air IR you get kind of
frustrated let's check it out this
product will eliminate that completely
unless you're completely blind once you
plug the snap power in it's illuminated
so that in the nighttime once you've got
it going you don't have to worry about
being able to see where to plug your
stuff in because obviously it will be
lit up so we've got a long drunk crazy
party night you got to plug something in
you don't want to smack your head or
fall down
check out the step power and it's
currently 1995 with Free Shipping
alright next up we have a product by
glitchless now know what you guys think
but I hear that name blitz whup I'm
thinking about some frickin heavy metal
man you know going use that sort of
reminds me of having boots whoop what's
the thing about it it's either that or
some kind of some ring getting ready to
come in and blow yo ass up but no that's
not what it is these are actually in ear
earbuds they're 23 bucks and let's jump
in let's just check them up the Blitz
wolf graphine earphones are stereo high
fine noise cancelling in here wired
control earphones with a built in
microphone for all 3.5 milimeter
interface devices so what that basically
means that anything that 3.5 inch plug
can plug in you guys can see that these
earbuds look pretty damn cool they're
stylish and they definitely have a
practical design but not only do these
earbuds look good they're also made with
particular graphic materials they
feature a built-in 10 millimeter
graphene speaker with a graphene
composite membrane this is actually a
really unique construction and it offers
supreme free cuts a response that most
diaphragm speakers don't do another
unique thing about these headphones is
that they're actually made to use less
power so less power consumption means
longer life and with that comes lower
distortion levels as well so that means
when you're playing the music of loud
speakers are going to go out on you the
Blitz witbier buds are also designed
with a 60 degree in their elevation now
this makes it so the earbuds are
ergonomically your ear and that you
don't get a bunch of pain in your ear
when you're listening to things you know
how some of the things are and they just
stick them into your ear sometimes they
pop out and they also cause discomfort
these are mates they fit right into
we're causing no discomfort and if you
need to talk to someone on your phone
the Blitz clips also feature a 1.2
millimeter durable TPT cable with a
built in microphone the earbuds also
have a 3.5 millimeter 24 karat gold
connection that will work in any device
out there that has a 3.5 millimeter jack
you also get different size earbuds for
perfect comfort in your ear and a carry
case alright folks so there you have it
the Blitz list now these things look
cool they sound cool different ear buds
but no matter what kind of hear you have
you know it's going to fit inside of it
the 24 karat gold connection great
connectivity their price is 23 bucks in
the day I think it's a win what about
you next up the Aki app USB wall charger
now the Aki amp is a pretty simple
product so USB wall charger that has a
USB C port for the iPhone 7 iPhone 7
plus LG g5 HTC 10 Google pixel and many
many more
it's 19 bucks it's a really simple thing
you have one port that's USB type-c a
standard USB port it's 19 bucks if you
need something like this it's a very
basic product not a whole lot to it but
if you need it
well then hey you need it alright tech
fans last but not least the anchor
vertical organ AMA Klaus let's stick
this out now I know a lot of people
always tout you know specific things
like saying this is a gaming mouse now
although this probably isn't the best
male Mouse in the world for doing head
shots and stuff like that I spent many
hours playing games in this type of
mouse and it actually is very
comfortable
now this particular mouse is Wireless it
features it wireless dongle has three
adjustable dpi levels 800 1200 1600 and
it also features side controls you guys
can see them they're very easy to access
I know that you're playing those RPG
games where it takes a ton of
spells with stuff you might want to pass
in this but I play a lot of games you
just tower defense and I find that this
mouse is very very comfortable I
probably wouldn't want to use it if I
was joining a competition I'd do a lot
of headshots but for just scrolling the
internet doing that stuff and like
gaming I got to say the anchor is very
comfortable
it's $19.99 and at the end of the day I
think if you're looking for something
different and comfort is your thing you
should definitely check this out take a
look at the bottom of the mouse you guys
can see that rubber feet
which slides easily across everything
you also have a compartment for your
battery you can see the dongle at the
very bottom and at the very top you see
an on and off button alright folks so
that wraps up the month of maze top 5
for under $30 now like I said this mouse
not be the absolute you know gamer mouse
that you're looking for but I got to say
it's very very comfortable honestly one
of the best products that I've seen for
just going around scrolling and doing
internet stuff your hand doesn't get
tired the way it's made you can surf the
internet for hours and hours on end it's
a really cool product this little phone
case right here it's also pretty nice
the way that's made of this new material
it can actually take quite a good
bouncing around before it does any
damage the only caveat that I would say
that it doesn't actually have a total
front screen protector if it had that I
would actually say it would be a 10 of a
10 but as it's about a nine now the
octane obviously a simple thing USB
charger the thing is you either need
this type of product or don't but if you
need it than hell it's a great product
for you right looks just like a thing
also headphones very nicely made
comfortable like I said the way they're
made of this new material it actually
consumes less power so you can have them
on for a lot longer time they're very
comfortable here and you can actually
turn them up really fricking loud you'd
be like on so if you like that these
might be for you and then last but not
least like I said you know if you want
to be able to plug something in in the
middle of the night you don't want to
trip and fall on your ass if you sit
there going trying to plug it in this is
the key I'm Miller you've been watching

beginning of the video if you guys have
suggestions please give me a link down
