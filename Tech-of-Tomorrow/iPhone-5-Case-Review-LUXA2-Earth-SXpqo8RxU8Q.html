your latekka tomorrow YouTube channel
where you bring you all the tech all the
time now I know that many people out
there are familiar with the thermaltake
brand they're very popular they got
their TT esports and all that it a good
stuff but they also have another brand
called luxa2 now the luxa2 products are
very high-end very niche and not that
many people actually know about them but
if you watch a lot of science fiction
movie and you'll see lots of two
products all over the place for some
reason they love to throw these things
into movies so what I have today is I
have what they call their earth iphone 5
phone cover I think this one's really
pretty cool a lot of people have sent me
their phone covers I kind of dismissed
them because I've seen some you guys as
nasty as comments about phone covers so
I try to pick and choose and only bring
you guys really cool ones this one I
think is really cool so let's go and
then package it put it on the iphone 5
and see what it looks like let's go all
right folks so here we have it one
iphone 5 and one earth iphone 5 case
from luxa2 so here's the front of the
case box you can even actually touch it
here has like a leather like field again
since it says please try it flip it
around the back such you guys see the
back earth iphone 5 case product
features you can see them all written
out there uniquely you that's right you
uniquely you foo so now let's go ahead
let's open the package up not going to
worry too much on ceremony here it's
just some plastic stuff so go ahead and
see what I can do it here actually it's
a plastic stuff that's a pretty tough so
try to open the top up here nah there we
go alright then so now we're getting
some cooperation here alright so now we
pulled it out you guys said you've been
missing it at the Cameron missed his
head by that much well maybe that much
but who's counting all right so check it
out inside here we'll go ahead and pull
this thing out that's it for that too
at the Cameron so check it out has a
nice leather like outside feel proper
cutouts for your camera and stuff a
little leash right here so you don't
lose it flip it back around I'll just
open it up like so go ahead and remove
this phone stuff out of here slides in
then this tab right here just simply
slides in right here locking the phone
in and then on the front it opens up and
there's a little thing right here which
is magnetic so you close this up and
you've got a magnetic flap right there
now one of the things though I have to
say that it's just a little bit wonky
now you people over there at Luxa pay
attention to this this right here is not
cut perfectly it's a little bit wonky
it's not exact and some people may
complain about that because you're
trying to take a picture and it's
getting blocked you're going to be
pissed off and be like why did I buy
that phone case what take some pics and
see if it actually does affect it it's
very close it may not but it is very
close beyond that feels excellent has a
nice semi leather feel to it but anyways
this thing is pretty elegant I think
it's very nice as far as it looks now
this thing's kind of one of those things
though you know if somebody's goes all
my car looks really bitchin but is it
fast well this is kind of those things I
think this thing looks really really
good may have a small couple of wanky
things on there you know like we talked
about the cutout in the back but overall
it's pretty nice it's pretty all again
it's very low priced you guys can pick
it up online check out the link in the
description below you guys can pick one
up like usual I hoped you guys liked the
video I've been trying to keep these
phone things as little as possible
because I know you guys only want
specific ones that are really cool so
I'm trying to bring it to you makes you
subscribe so you don't miss hitting the
videos because we got new stuff coming
out every day and you wouldn't want to
miss it so peace out we'll see you guys
back here on the channel here take your
camera back camera man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
