Squarespace what's up I'm Rick Falcon
here on the century sparrow I gave by
one and Who I am it's rather lose
cousins that Han Solo dude you know I've
got a cheaper version of the Millennium
Falcon hence the century sparrow but
that's not why we're here today first
thing off i want to give some advice to
people out there you know a lot of
people out there believe in the force
and all this stuff and i just want to
give some advice you know to all you
kiddies out their kids trust me you just
need what's in your heart and a trustee
ir blaster you know or if you come from
some redneck place you know damn 22
always works good for me son yep so
check this out why are we really here
we've got some really cool 50 cent
streets headphones by SMS now these
things are the storm trooper that's
right the storm trooper Star Wars
streets edition now I just want to state
rob the bat that these headphones are
really a collector's item now yes they
are headphones they've got 40 millimeter
drivers they've got some really cool
things that eliminate the outside noise
you've got some cool things going on
there the plastics must be super duper
durable and twisting all around that but
to be cross with you I think most folks
and like me included people like like to
collect things aren't probably going to
be taking these things out and dragging
the round you're probably going to get
them look at them real quick and put
them on a shelf and go look they go with
my other Star Wars collectibles but with
that said these things are 199 bucks
I've got them right here in my hand and
no we're going to unbox them listen to
them and let's see what they're all
about I think they're collectors item at
the end of the video let's hear what you
have to say let's go all right folks so
let's move over it out of the box and
like I said to me this is kind of a
collector's item I have some pretty cool
star wars so this is a couple of things
I have nothing it's a pencil sharpener
can t dispenser thing all in one you pop
off the head then in the inside in here
you've got some candies
Pretty's up there you've got the old
candies I keep them in there cuz I just
figure what the heck keep it as original
as possible All Star Wars dispenser with
candy now I also have this one this
one's like one of the actual oldest I
have Darth Vader on one side Yoda on the
other nice Star Wars stuff been
collecting this stuff the kid have lots
of it so now these headphones also once
again we see Star Wars first edition
street on ear wired headphones these are
also the 50 cent brand so let's go ahead
and start unboxing them so I guess I
want to show you guys on the box will
show you it it's kind of with velocity
so I'm I'll just take this stuff off a
lot of times the camera tell me it's so
glossy we can't even see it so I'll pull
this stuff off here first so we can
actually get a better view of the box
without glaring inside of your face
sound like a plan alright alright so
it's done we've got this stuff right
here and we'll do the usual voila at the
cameramen and that didn't hurt him
alright so front of the box you guys
already saw that down the side these are
the stormtrooper auditions now I didn't
have a cool costume like these guys I to
make up my own little cheesy or you know
Rick solo costume but hey I'm rolling
with it here's the back of the box once
again just has stuff about them all
we'll just get a close-up of that real
quick just for you folks you guys can
just see it I know how some people are
they like to check everything out for
those who knew the everything will hear
some of the everything spinning around
on this side we see the headphones
themselves and once again just telling
us of the first edition stormtrooper SMS
audio headphones so pop the cap out I
think this thing just pops off or list
out one of the other up well up that's
it just lifts out some of the school to
keep it over there yeah
oh is that would shake and bake nope
I'll just use my hand then nope never
sorry there we go so I can punch it
through yeah alright so we're back
continuing along all right oh wait all
right little blue box what am I thinking
about folks the first person who tells
you what I'm thinking about and you get
it right I'll send your prize it's a
blue box to program that I love to watch
let's see if una gets where I'm going
with this flip the cap kaboom we see all
of our favorite characters here in the
brands of their carrion they've got the
Luke Skywalker in the calm the Rebel
Alliance but it's a little Lukey right
there the storm trooper obviously the
Galactic Empire mr. Vader himself and
then Boba Fett now how come Boba Fett
gets his own name but our boys Luke and
Darth have to be called rebel and
galactic I feel these boys are being
ripped off stormtrooper I don't know
he's kind of generic but that's cool but
Boba Fett what's up it's all the
popularity boba so amazing to be jealous
out there alright then we flip the cap
there you guys since you have football
karimun actually took two steps
backwards in that one he thought i was
serious haha just joke in there mr.
anything else in there anything on the
bottom nope alright nothing on the
bottom in there so we'll just go ahead
move the blue box out of the way get
this out of there kaboom kaboom and out
of the way let's check out what the rest
is in there alright so right here is a
pact with a bunch of cool stuff we'll go
ahead and open this up so if you can see
all the cool stuff that comes in here I
know there's like a poster and like a
bunch of cool stuff so we'll just be
traverse through it and see it's a
little bit sticky there to get it out of
there so pool and get some more stuff
yada yada yada that's actually sticking
to this pretty well well I'm trying to
get out of there it's sticking to
everything I'm trying to pull out now I
think this must be the poster alright so
let's just start off with whatever this
just tells where they are their
distributors no one probably really
cares too much about that
what is this thing right here now is I
derive it be going to be a cleaning
cloth or a caring type product I don't
know which one and it's this stuff is
super duper sticky in fact I have not
seen stuff this sticky before I'm having
one what time of this ticket here there
we go sticky sticky sticky so what do we
got going on here cleaning cloth the
back all right it's a clean cloth so
there we go we get they Star Wars
cleaning cloth in fact I'll go up here
in just uh I can see you folks clear so
the next step we got the SMS audio
there's just like a book explaining all
about the Star Wars stuff and
congratulating you on buying them saying
hey congratulations you just spent 200
bucks I hope you're happy but I think
it's the people will be happy because
the people who look at this the right
way will be cool so actually this is
kind of cool though because they're
quick start guide it pretty much tells
all about the headphones what they're
about kind of redundant stuff tell us
about the audio wire the microphone all
that kind of stuff by listening to music
you know faq I actually I'm kind of
blind i thought it was f ro for a second
i was like what the heck fro it's kind
of weird one but it's a cleaning up my
glasses on but all the information
stuffs inside of that here is the
certificate of authenticity all those
big words you guys you can see that all
part of the collector's item thing sip
it up the side we get stickers check
this out stickers stickers stickers so
if you know that against sticker star
wars' stickers for your car i'm not
going to take any of this stuff off
because I like to collect my
collectibles like collectibles and keep
everything intact I honestly we should
even have to open up the plastic bags
that's just me but I want you folks to
see it so I'm doing it and here's the
poster mr. one so we got big post right
here got ourselves a three of these guys
right here shooting at somebody probably
some Rebel Alliance come probably
sitting a similar
soon days folks beyond the poster and
all the stuff that we just saw right
here now we'll move on and we will take
a look at the headphones themselves they
will gently put all this stuff back away
you guys can see comes completely in its
own little football like carry case
which is pretty cool pretty durable says
star wars on it star wars now I heard
that Carrie Fisher was making a porno
and she was going to be calling it star
whores but I don't have any official
announcement on that as of yet I'll have
to hear that out so we'll pull that out
or put it in whatever carries wanting
these days open up you can see
everything's seal it a nice plastic bag
pop them out internally in the shell we
see once again the star wars
nomenclature present the SMS is on
little zipa and we should move on to the
headphones but in platoon fedun two
little pieces of something in our own I
think they were forward with the heck
done with the camera because he looked
like he would like them alright so Wow
okay these things are very very very
very light and I have to say they have
the very varied item in the city
insulting way but these have the very
very super duper a kind of the Chinese
feel yeah they're they're all right
though member i said that the plastic
they using these supposed to be very
very flexible like unbreakable and I
could definitely you know you guys can
see that I mean this thing's twisted
like I got almost twisted a pretzel and
it's not hurting it in the center we see
a single padded band it's going to go on
the head then we see the two cups inside
of here are the 40 millimeter drivers
one on each side they're flexible for
folding up as we saw before there is a
cable right here with a microphone
attached to it as well so you could be
listening to these and why you're
listening to these things you could
answer your phone or whatever that you
need to do let me pop this out of their
cables are usually about three to four
feet long and just pull it out all the
way that you guys see it I'm surely be a
question about how long the cable is so
looks like yeah looks like it's about I
don't know maybe
this might actually be a five foot cable
so right here in the end you can see an
indicator button and this right here
that'll tell you if it's plugged in and
working right here's the other
connection we also have the microphone
and the level adjuster on here and then
I guess from there let's hear how these
things sound and then let's see how they
feel on my head alright folks since I
saw you guys last I'm loosing some
different music rocking out to the human
zoo right now and i have to say that
these things are entirely comfortable
you can put them on your head and
probably go to sleep and forget about it
because they weigh virtually nothing now
as far as the audio reproduction goes
though very very bassy everything that
we play back for you guys we leave the
equalizer at flat obviously with some
changes around you could increase the
trouble and everything but just like
basically out of the box these are some
of the bassist damn headphones I've ever
heard now for gaming this would probably
be pretty damn cool you want to hear all
the explosions at all that shiz neck so
for gaming these things are probably
going to be pretty damn good but as far
as music goes I don't know I don't think
they're my favorite thing for just
listening to audio but you know what
let's let you guys listen to him what do
you think
this cold and
alright rockers there you guys have it
rocking out once again to the benchmark
song now why do you guys ask about our

there you guys have it want to say once
again thank you very much the people
over to squarespace for helping bring
that video to you today also like I said
these SMS fitness and headphones they're
much more to my eyes a collector's item
than any type of audio file product my
personal opinion I think a lot of you'll
share it if you're not into Star Wars at
all and you're especially under fifty
cents then I would avoid these things
you know and not get them if you have
one hundred ninety nine dollars and
you're looking for a Star Wars
collectible though that still works and
functions and as all around product well
this might be something really cool for
you if you're an audiophile guy you got
100 99 bucks you want to buy some
headphones are going to sound the
absolute best these aren't the best
headphones for hiring nine by nine bucks
trust me you can get some better ones
but for collectors item they are what
they are and is there a true price on a
collector's item because if it's a truly
collectible item if you collect it
become worth much more so in essence if
you have these keep them in their box
you buy them strictly as a collectible
item they should only increase with
value and since Lucas is pouring more
money making more Star Wars movies
hopefully they're not shitty just saying
you know I'm saying if they're really
good movies
hey there'll be more blood pumped back
in once again or the Star Wars universe
and these headphones will become even
more valuable so that's it there are 100
99 bucks if you guys are collectibles
out there and you guys love the Star
Wars universe and uh you know you're
like me you got your little toys and
stuff you like to collect then this
might be something that you're looking
for I'm elric thanks once again for
watching techno tomorrow and thanks to
Squarespace for bringing this video
possible peace see you rockers later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
