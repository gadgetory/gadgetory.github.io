the world glad to see you guys back here
now it's been about 12 days maybe 13
days now since I've been out of the
hospital it's been really kind of an
adjustment period because not being able
to walk normal is definitely tricky and
since I don't have any toes on my left
leg and then my left legs you know when
I can use it's really hard to balance
like no way can I use crutches at all
those are just not for me man me trying
to use crutches is like the the leaning
tower of pizza for Pisa Louie leaning
tower at Leaning Tower anyways but
instead of just going a little bit it
just yep can I smack down to the ground
and bounce my head on the sidewalk so
don't want to be doing that anymore but
health-wise I am doing really really
good and also Jonathan Morrison from TLD
he was totally really cool to start up
this GoFundMe thing so if anybody out
there is like like the person's going
hey man I wanted to help you I'm here's
the way that you can do so so we also
have the patreon thing going on so
there's lots of different ways that can
go on plus when we put links and videos
and stuff like that to Amazon that all
helps in every way to keep going through
stuff I'm doing good though I mean I'm
definitely not used to changing my own
IV every day but it's not really an IV
I've got like this I can't really show
you guys at my sweater on but the PICC
line for you guys out there you know
what it is a PICC line is this thing
that they put in your arm and it goes
like right by your heart and it's how
they deliver medicine so every day I've
got an unhook my vie bag up there change
it clean it and do this and it was very
stressful at first but I've got it down
to a science I changed my diet a lot now
I know a lot of people out there say hey
man you know you got to go strictly
vegetarian to beat the diabetes but my
doctor says that for me right now going
strictly vegan probably isn't the
absolute best thing in the world because
they said my body needs protein to heal
so I've been kind of eating steak
chicken salad steak chicken salad
vegetables steak chicken salad
vegetables vegetables take stick and
salad eggs eggs eggs so every day in the
morning I start off I have some eggs so
I have some nice scrambled eggs in the
morning folded eggs or even whatever or
whatever kind of eggs are served up I
eat those eggs in the morning for
lunchtime it's usually a salad of
sometimes with either chicken or beef
and the same thing with dinner now
there's been two times where I actually
had a hamburger but my blood Sugar's
still
or low because I'd really didn't eat
very much the rest of the day and
climbing up and down the stairs and
actually using this wheelchair believe
it or not using this manual wheelchair
is quite a bit of effort and a good
exercise so as long as I keep busy
moving around and doing stuff and just
you know trying to live as much of a
normal life as possible it's cool the
only thing is though is that I'm
supposed to get this foot back what's
called a wound vacuum it's this device
that hooks on like kind of just like
sucks your wound kind of close by taking
everything out of it and kind of closing
the wound and I don't know what's going
on my doctors have completely messed up
the order and don't know how to get it
and it's just I don't on there and it's
a complete cluster you know the next
word that comes with that so you know
it's just it's not really happening but
when that happens it's going to be very
very more difficult for me to move
around at all because I'm gonna have
this thing stuck to my foot this machine
that goes tick tick tick tick tick tick
tick tick
all the time because you know it's
sucking things away from the footing
that tick tick is pretty much the motor
you know taking it away and pulling it
now I've heard that I can may be able to
sling it over my shoulder it's just
gonna be crazy I'm never this like wound
thing on my foot slinging this thing
over my shoulder and a backpack maybe
who knows you know I mean and that'll be
the only way excuse me there mm-hmm I'm
gonna be able to get around and I'm I'm
it's kind of you know I'm looking
forward they say the wound looks good
like I said I'm on a totally new diet
before my doctor's did mess up on my
diabetes medicine the subscriptions to
it I mean you know I'm not gonna like
point fingers or anything but yeah it
was wrong one of the main differences
was short-acting insulin all they were
giving me was this very long and so on
that didn't work like four or five hours
down the line and when my blood sugar
was high taking that really wasn't
helping with my pills but now if my
blood sugar ever gets over 200 I have
this fast-acting stuff now here's what's
even stranger though I really got in a
briefs case about getting me this
short-acting stuff because I'm like okay
I needed it but since I've been on this
diet my blood sugar has yet to be over
200 175 and 185 or the highest it's
actually been and one of those days I
actually broke my fly in my diet you
guess you could say and I drank at I
iced tea I'm evil I know but I drank one
and my blood sugar was still
solo because everything else I'm eating
is really good for me I really didn't
eat that good in the past I thought I
did but no I really didn't pay attention
to carbs I'll just like okay this looks
cool it says healthy it's natural okay
hey thumbs up I can eat this and that's
just not how it really is however though
even small portions though of rice or
noodles as long as they're taken in
small portions and earlier in the day
time the calories seemed to get burned
off as well as the blood sugar rising as
long as I'm moving around and doing
something so as long as I'm not just
totally sitting still doing absolutely
nothing which I mean sometimes I do is
I'm sitting watching TV but a lot of
times I'm cruising around my wheelchair
like I'm trying to talk to Jesus we're
trying to schedule the videos and talk
about what's going on and then I'll go
up to my room because I got to go up
there I got to put my V in my arm and I
got to take all these medications which
sometimes make me sick and make me pass
out and then I gotta wake back up and do
it all over again so it's climbing up
and down the stairway if you guys want
to see it I can show you it looks like
it's pretty funny I actually have to
crawl like a dog up the stairs like
literally to get up them this is funny
because I can't throw any pressure on my
foot to come down I kind of like just
hop up my butt and then I'm down into my
back down to my wheelchair so they
become portable Elric and the dog he's
running around he says I want to be in
this video he wants to be but overall
everything is good its new it's
different not being able to walk
they say the thing is healing up really
good like I'm not a doctor but they say
that it looks good it's nice and red and
fleshy as what they said okay hey red
and fleshy you don't know but they say
it's looking good now hopefully with the
wound back though it will totally close
and heal I'm keeping my hopes up on that
because I'm really stricken you know
sticking to a diet as much as possible
trying to get as much exercise as I can
and just keeping a positive attitude and
hoping it'll heal but if it doesn't
totally heal what they'll do is they'll
take a skin graft I guess I'll take a
piece of skin off my butt or somewhere
and then they'll put that over that and
then after that battle bet will close it
up and become my new skin but as long as
I stay healthy and don't let my blood
sugar or my blood pressure or anything
like that go up I'll probably heal up
and do pretty good so all you guys are
absolutely great your best wishes and
