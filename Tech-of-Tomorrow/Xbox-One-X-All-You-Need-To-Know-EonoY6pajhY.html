have already been some killer
announcements now the Xbox one X has
been announced and it has all kinds of
crazy features which make it the most
powerful console in the world out of the
Xbox one family the Xbox one X is the
heaviest of them all coming in at eight
point four pounds
now inside powering the Xbox one X is a
brand new custom CPU at 2.3 gigahertz
featuring eight cores no longer we seen
the Jaguar processor that we saw in the
original and the 1s it's something
totally new now the biggest question
everybody's mind however is going to be
what is the GPU well this is actually
the most powerful GPU ever in an xbox
it's a custom GPU which is a base core
clock speed of 1.7 to gigahertz it has
four TCU's it features all the features
of Polaris 6.0 teraflops and this custom
GPU is supposed to be just as powerful
as a gtx 1070 in my eyes however the
biggest feature is the Xbox's 1x ability
to do true 4k gaming that's right 2160
at 60 Hertz this is really cool because
if you have a nice big TV you want to be
able to play the true 4k I mean why not
I mean a lot of people are moving into
the 4k it's not exactly the mainstream
right now but 4k TVs are pretty much
starting to be in households and if you
want to be able to play on your TV it's
going to be great because there's also
an hdmi 2.0 connector for output so you
don't have to worry about any of that
1.4 step now there is also 1.4 in but
that probably is not going to be used
all that much and what's really cool for
you AMD folks out there who have a free
sync monitor that's right the Xbox 1x
Beacher's full free sync support so that
means no more screen tearing just
perfectly beautiful gaming at 60 frames
per second
some other features of the Xbox 1x is it
features 12 gigabytes of gddr5 memory
running at 326 gigabytes a second 8
gigabytes of flash memory a one terabyte
hard drive a 4k UHD blu-ray disc and the
Xbox one X also utilize a 245 watt
internal power supply as far as HDMI
audio goes you get Dolby Digital 5.1
dts-hd through the true HD with that
mode
and if you want to use the spit of audio
you can get Dolby Digital 5.1 dts-hd
that connection for you guys who love
information overload here's a screenshot
showing the difference between the Xbox
one the Xbox 1s and the Xbox one X now
some things between the Xbox one and the
Xbox one X remain kind of the same as
far as the inputs and outputs goes all
we see is an upgrade to 2.0 in the HDMI
and some of the inputs are just slightly
different but overall they're pretty
much the same thing the Wi-Fi has also
remained the same since the Xbox one
until now so if you're looking for
improvements there there's none but if
you're looking for the most powerful CPU
and GPU that you can get in a console
then the Xbox one X is definitely going
to be it now this is going to come out
this November so fans you can bet your
sweet lollies that in November I'm going
to be getting my hands on that Xbox one
X because it just looks totally
interesting and then at that time we'll
actually have a challenge from you guys
the audience to build a PC on PC parts
bigger that will actually be the killer
of the Xbox one X now can this be done
at the same 499 price point this is
being delivered to the market I really
don't know I mean it really does seem
like the Xbox one X is going to be the
killer sweet spot for people out there
now I haven't really owned an Xbox since
the original one I started playing on my
playstation but I gotta admit when the
Xbox one X comes out I'm going to be
buying one and have one in house just
just to see what it looks like at 4k on
my TV because that just sounds totally
bitchin like usual folks if you want
more information about the Xbox one X
we'll have a link down below to their
page but at the end of the day hey you
guys see it man this is a brand new
redesigned Xbox the One X offers most
powerful features ever seen before any
console the graphics alone if they're
going to be 10 70 and you're going to be
able to get true 4k at 60 frames per
second that's going to be amazing at
least I think so
anyways like usual I want to hear your
comments down below do you guys plan on
buying one and do you guys think that
you guys can build a PC that could
actually beat it well when it gets here
we'll test it out give you guys the
scores and then we'll let the games
begin
I'm Network you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow thanks a lot the Xbox 1x is on
its way baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
