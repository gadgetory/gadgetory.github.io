back once again to the channel I'm Eric
and you're on tech of tomorrow what are
we doing today well today we're gonna be
taking a look at a brand new case and
people over at Corsair what is this
well this is one of their obsidian line
this is their 350 D now this is a micro
ATX mini ITX case and this thing's
pretty much decked out you know it's a
real small case you get to three point
five Bay's to two point five Bay's you
can fit in all kinds of stuff for water
cooling 120 a 240 or a 140 or 280 rad
all those different types of Red's can
fit in here it comes equipped a couple
fans but there's actually five fans that
can be totally installed so basically
this is a really small case geared for
the gamer it can also take multiple
video cards so you can do SLI or
crossfire all that stuff inside this
little tiny case so with that said let's
get it out of the box and let's take a
closer look at the product alright folks
so now we've got the case out of the box
and let's Salinas taking out the box
crap you guys don't really need to see
that what's the big deal of that so
let's start here on the bottom you see
you have the courser logo move our way
up you have two bays right here it's if
your hard drives or whatever up here on
top we have our headphone microphone
we've ever also right here our Start
button two USB 3.0 ports and then as we
move down this thing right here actually
pops off so you push the little button
right here and the entire front panel
comes off there's two little slots right
here and you can also see on the back of
this thing right here there are two
little slots that you just put and mount
in there so it's very easy to take up on
and off you can see there's a filter
back behind here it's also totally
removable a fan right inside so I'll
just go ahead and put the thing back
together go ahead and take the little
screen here pop it in pop it in take the
two little notch things right here go
ahead and knock those in like a little
clicking sound a notch in down there
and it's easily just pops in just like
that so let's move along let's go to the
side of the case the side of the case
here's a window got a nice clear window
here for those custom modders and people
who actually want to jump inside the
case and check their stuff out and be
able to see it you'll get to do it all
in there on the back I'm just gonna go
to the back real quick because we're
gonna be starting to take things apart
just take a look in the back right here
you see right here in the back of the
case you have three holes right here
these are all four different types of
liquid cooling so if you had a reservoir
mounted on the outside or whatever you
could have your tubes coming through
there you also have an additional fan
right here you have five expansion slots
one two three four five power supply now
the other side
it's just simple straight black wall
let's flip it around if we take a look
at the top on the top you can see right
here plenty of room for radiator either
inside or out depending on how you want
to build it then go ahead and flip it
around and show you guys the bottom of
the case as well before we get inside of
it so let's take a look at the bottom we
also have another removable filter right
here on the bottom actually it pops out
to the bottom down here so you can
remove that and keep everything clean so
if you're sucking air into your case you
won't get a lot dust and stuff inside of
your case now let's go ahead and go
inside of it so just spinning around
there for your folks everything's
toolless so I'm gonna go ahead and
remove these by my hands as you guys can
see I've really had no problems all some
of these are so tight sometimes that
when I go to get them I can't take them
off it's because of the machines they
use a lot of times in china to put
things on so let's go ahead and we'll
pop this side off go ahead and pop the
other side off and then let's go around
the back first and let's take a look at
like cable management so back here been
the case plenty of room back here for
healed management they're pieces up
inside of up here to route your cables
through
additionally down here we see those same
things so you guys can pretty much see
the back here for cable management
you're going to have a lot of room
inside the small case for hiding all
your cables if that's your thing so if
you're those people you want a totally
clean build you're gonna have that
availability with the Obsidian 350d it's
got plenty of room back here and you
have plenty room to access your cpu from
the rear as well so you need me remove
them of the board tray just slip it
around here you guys can see you have
room right here for your drives also
have inside of here a little box let's
see what's in the little box so in the
little box is all of the additional
mounting hardware you guys can see that
all right there
and so I have a little box marked
Corsair so all those little goodies
right there drive bays
removable now up here on top move the
camera to zoom back up into this area
you can see you've got two more bays up
here on top now let's take a look at
some of the cabling right here we see
the 3.0 connector this is for those
front 3.0 USB connectors that we saw
like I said before you guys can see all
the kill management stuff is still
available here you also have some
additional 2.5 Bay's right up here so
you got plenty of room inside this
little tiny case to put either a micro
ATX or mini ITX motherboard that's what
this thing's totally built for it's
pretty lightweight it's got a window all
kinds of great features for a hundred
and four dollars alright guys so there
you have it the new corsair 350 diab
city and now this thing small but you
can see it's got plenty of room inside
of it to do whatever you need to be so
if you're a gamer looking for something
lightweight you want to take it on the
road this thing's pretty portable or if
you're somebody has a lot of space that
you don't want to take up which I mean
by that is that you don't have a lot of
space actually and you want something
very small to fit in that small space
this could be the case that you're
looking for it actually has really no
negatives I
and actually see from looking at it I
would say just from my unboxing and
overview that for this type of case it's
definitely an editor's choice product
it's got plenty of room for cable
management plenty of room inside for
doing you know SLI or crossfire nobody
really needs you know four cards unless
you're some crazy person trying to show
off two cards is like more than enough
for anybody so at the end of the day I
gotta say VIP City and 350 be awesome
case do you guys like this case make
sure you guys hit that like button show
them that you like this case I'm mark
we'll see you back here on tech Itamar
and if you're not subscribed hey man
make sure you do so she don't miss I
don't need the cool stuff going in on
