with TECA tomorrow I've got a new
unboxing for you this is the max 5g
active cooling hard drive cooler from
thermal take this is a really nice unit
it's it's for 3.5 SATA hard drives its
dimensions are 145 by 207 by 47
millimeters and it's got its own power
source its own USB 3.0 cable and it's
actively cooled so let's go ahead and
open this up and take a look at and just
to let you guys know I've heard some of
you guys don't really care for my videos
but you need to remember I'm the guy
with the knife comes open from here the
top opens up like that this is your
product warranty information you've got
a really nice installation guide right
there walk you through exactly how to
install your hard drive into this so it
does not come with a hard drive keep
that in mind you have to install your
own let's take a look at what's in here
this is your power supply for the unit
you've got an Allen and Allen tool and
yep that is for installing the drive
unit itself and a USB 3.0 cable and that
is a really nice thick cable as you can
see it's very well packaged lots of foam
take a look at the unit itself very
lightweight has a nice stand for it
I'll go ahead and open this up for you
so you want to take a look at it there
at the plastic nice thing about this is
- these are blue LED 18 millimeter fans
this will really keep whatever drive you
have in here nice and cool there's your
power switch here that's where you plug
in your power connector and your USB
connector goes right down there and it's
nice - as you can turn your LED fans on
and off that's a nice feature so if
you're running this at night and don't
want to be bothered while you're trying
to sleep you just check your lights off
well there you go that is the max 5 g
hard drive enclosure from thermal tech
