tomorrow Elric Faris here with my cool
is today jayjay once again from asus and
i know everybody out there always wants
to get the most out of their
connectivity and there's all kinds of
products out there to buy that can
confuse the heck out of you of what you
want to need now these new products in
my hand one works on USB one works by
Ethernet and these things actually give
you really unbelievable range when it
comes to using your in home or in
business wireless connectivity so i'm
gonna hop over i'm gonna let JJ explain
some of the differences of these two
products to you and i'll do kind of a
different little thing here the first
one i have in my hand right here i have
the wireless and 900 so i'm first going
to just basically give you guys kind of
a quick unboxing so not a lot in these
things anyways so i'm just going to pull
the little thing out here there's all
the stuff inside the box and then i got
this little thing in my hand
whoops dropped a piece that kind of
looks like the building at the LAX so
first up I'm going to hand over this one
to JJ and he'll explain some better
features of this thing to you good folks
so here you go JJ have a little mind
control unit thanks so actually as you
were noting this is actually the USB
version so this is the USB n 66 and this
is actually a three by three type
receiver so that means it's a 450
megabits so there's actually three
antennas but are actually underneath
this kind of like little dome
architecture and what this was really
kind of enabled at giving you is the
best overall like you said range and
throughput and signal stability so for
users that are considering a high
performance router maybe like our our TN
65 66 or even new AC models this is kind
of going to hand-in-hand with that unit
really giving you the highest level of
throughput and performance and the great
thing that you have is you're actually
going to have some additional
functionality if you take a look here at
the back of the unit you've got a simple
USB connection that you make with the
cable included inside the box two
options in terms of the power profile
because not all USB ports can provide
the maximum power output needed to give
you the best range in signal stability
so there's going to be a standard mode
that you can go ahead and run this in as
well as there's a high powered mode that
you can go ahead and run this in now is
there also any options at all this like
plugging the additional powers it's
strictly just USB power it's strictly
USB powered but in addition to the
functionality
working outside of just the basic USB
receiver you can go ahead and install
the software and allow this to work as a
software access point so it can actually
serve as two different devices a high
performance wireless adapter that is
supported under Windows Linux and Mac
O's as well as also that software access
point to go ahead and actually just
create a wireless signal for you so
awesome choice for use is looking for
the highest performance USB based
solution so with that let's maybe take a
look at the en 66 alrighty then so much
something extra folks you guys can see
kind of a similar box again just go
ahead and pop the cap on that now this
one comes in a plastic case a little bit
different than the other one one of the
things that's really cool is I know
everybody out there is always looking
for stuff that like really looks good
now this thing looks good I mean these
book pilots say looks like solar stuff
across the floor there here's what comes
in the box you can see the cables inside
of there the instruction manual not a
lot cuz it's pretty really simple easy
to use yes there's a power adapter
that's not right there in the box but it
does Karsa come included with a power
adapter
oh okay so just watching that folks it
does come with the power adapter
now you can see this thing's really neat
looking it'll sit on a desk I guarantee
that if you just sit on your desk
somebody walks by they're going to ask
you what in the heck is that thing on
your desk this one opposed the other one
hooks sixties Internet and it does have
a power cable and then after that I'll
hand it back over to JJ once again so we
can give you some of the fine your
details of this new product so this one
is still a 450 megabits adapter just
like this one so designed for super high
end performance but it's going to
actually be able to allow for some
additional functionality because it's
Ethernet base it's more focused at
different types of connectivity so
imagine maybe you've got an xbox ps3
maybe a television maybe a receiver they
could all have Ethernet ports but maybe
you need to have better wireless
connectivity for those devices maybe
you're looking for low latency gaming
maybe you're streaming you know hulu are
netflix on one of those devices you know
maybe you're streaming over photos
sharing videos whatever it might be this
is going to really allow you to have a
high degree of flexibility of being able
to connect it to all kinds of different
systems so 100% you could totally use
this on like a fixed desktop maybe on
the second floor or on the back end of
your house where you need better range
better throughput better signal
stability but you can totally connect it
to tons of other devices now the great
thing is no software's required here
it's all plug-and-play
you just essentially going to connect
this Ethernet connection to an Ethernet
port on a system you go through you set
up the setup configuration process and
then that is permanently stored inside
here so you get if I let's say maybe
have it set up on my you know desktop
but then I want to go ahead and move it
over to my console there's nothing I
need to do I just have just unplug it
reposition it plug it back in and that's
it because it's all stored inside of the
actual unit this will be a really great
prop or so I'm going to lose in a dorm
so I'll make that in college the right
product special that they can get all
our streaming everything and we tested
these out last night and I'll bring you
guys actually a written review and stuff
but it actually really did improve stuff
quite a bit we went in we did a speed
testing and we hook this up it got much
better numbers and the numbers were much
more stable across the board also we
have some kind of action tech router JJ
we brought one of the routers you can
hop over and check out that video in the
description below this router actually
blew my mind and we bring that as well
so all these products combined lead to
one really very fast and stable wireless
universe yeah and you know just to round
things out in terms of some of the
functionality outside of this one which
is more focused the USB model just being
in a wireless receiver and like I said a
software access point this one would
serve as a wireless adapter and access
point or an actual extender so you can
just use as a repeater yes your repeater
or extender to be able to go ahead and
further the actual range of a
pre-existing wireless n router so let me
let me explain my users so if you guys
are legal that mean so say that you live
in a giant sized house in the very back
of your house is for some reason where
your router and stuff is you can hook
your router up and then put this device
in the middle of your house to extend
the signal further through your house so
everybody in the house says good
connectivity and then little mommy and
your daughters and family will be happy
and not complaining going wait can't
hook up
sounds good bus so we'll see you guys
later
have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
