arrive and they have hit the market I'm
talking about the aftermarket r-tx 2060
cards today we're gonna bring you our
first review we're gonna be looking at
the zou tech amp edition we have other
cards we were looking at as well but
this is the first one on the roster now
many things about this particular card
are exactly like the founders edition
with a few additional changes but Before
we jump in and we check out today's
video let's hear a word from today's
sponsor best tech not all jobs require a
giant vacuum cleaner
sometimes a smaller product can do the
job best the best tech cordless
rechargeable handheld vacuum cleaner is
just that type of product it's very
small and it only weighs 2.6 pounds has
a rechargeable battery and comes with
all the accessories you need to get into
those small tight spots trying to get
the cobwebs off of your roof sometimes
this can be a pain but with the
extension bar that comes in the best
tech cordless you can get to these areas
without a problem the portability of the
best tech cordless rechargeable is
really its best feature you can take it
wherever you want to go the best tech is
also very easy to clean it has a dust
cap that you can easily detach with one
button and it's washable so you never
have to replace it ever again the
rechargeable lithium battery is ideal
for quick cleanups around the house in
your car or wherever you need to clean
something up that doesn't require a
giant vacuum and you can do this all
without fatigue currently this product
is fifty dollars and if you're
interested in this we'll have a link
down below now like I said in the very
beginning of the video there are many
things that are identical to the
founders edition card as well as this
aftermarket car
they both feature nineteen hundred and
twenty cuda cores they both feature six
gigabytes of ddr2 memory 192 bit memory
interface and 14 gigabits per second of
memory bandwidth so all that stuff is
exactly the same now the main
differences you're gonna see in the card
is the way that the card looks obviously
the zotac amp edition is going to have a
completely different look to the card on
the frontal card you can clearly see two
giant fans and these fans have been
completely redesigned so that all the
fins of them produces much airflow as
possible the card is also very simple
nothing outlandish about it pretty much
can fit in any type of system as far as
the length of the car goes it's 200 9.6
by 119 point 3 millimeters it's a dual
slot card take a look at the top of the
card you can see there's a single 8 pin
power connector now this is the same
power connector that's on the founders
Edition the only difference being is
that this particular car draws 170 watts
and the founders Edition drew 160 it's
recommend that you use a 500 watt power
supply though on both cards we clearly
see the GeForce artix nomenclature on
the top of the card as well as the zotac
gaming which lights up once you plug the
card in on the back of the card you can
clearly see there's a very nice
backplate everyone knows that I love the
backplate and love to smack on the
backplate and also you can see where it
says live to game and in between there
you can see the card opens up a little
bit and this is so the heat can actually
dissipate from the card even better a
lot of cards have a completely closed
design and sometimes that can make the
heat stay in the card causing heat
problems now as far as the outputs on
the card there's absolutely no DVI
connection whatsoever on here there's
three display ports and a single HDMI
port you can hook up to 4 monitors to
this card and unfortunately there is no
SLI which is kind of a bummer I was
really hoping the r-tx 2060s would have
that capability but that unfortunately
just isn't happening all in all the card
is a really good looking card now
they're really the main differences are
going to come in the boost clock speed
on this particular clock it has an 1800
megahertz boost clock speed and on the
founder's edition it's only 680
megahertz so there's quite a big
difference in the boost clock in this
card now one thing I want to point out
that before we jump into all the testing
at this particular time a Vega 56 is
three hundred and sixty-nine dollars
I've seen a lot of these cards priced at
that price range this particular card is
the exact same price it is priced at
three hundred and sixty nine dollars now
we get to the numbers though we'll talk
about that a little bit later I think
that you'll see though that as far as
these numbers go this card does beat
that card clearly at the same price
point almost across the board
now our test ism is pretty nice we have
a very nice asus raagh Maximus
motherboard I said
a 700 K 32 gigabytes of memory this is
ddr4 it's really fast stuff we have a
nice very very fast SSD drive for boot
drive and 2 terabyte Seagate drives as
far as the boot space as the time of
this testing we're using absolutely the
latest drivers from both Nvidia and AMD
when we tested these cards we've also
got the very latest Windows updates and
everything that can be updated is
updated to its fullest now with that
said though let's rock out to the new
benchmark song by 7 deadly sins
all right so there you folks have it
everything to know about the brand-new
zou tech amp r-tx 2060 edition card now
you guys can see that this card clearly
at the same price ranges at Vega 56
beats it across the board now you guys
also said a compare it to a 1070 so we
compared those scores as well in this
particular video now really the only
difference that I really saw was in the
heat and this was really no big deal
the zotac ran at 74 Celsius under
maximum load and we saw the founders
Edition running at 72 now for giving
that much performance and that much of a
boost clock speed I don't really see
that being a problem whatsoever the card
really did run quiet the fans keep the
card growing really cool if you're not
even using the cards at all the fans is
you don't even spin so you might look at
your car but this is kind of getting to
be a normal thing on the market a lot of
the designers are making their cards so
if it's not really you know requiring
fans the card remains silent but overall
at the end of the day the only problem I
have it all and this isn't with xot tech
at all it's kind of more with this the
RT X stuff in general because I just
don't feel that there's been a lot
delivered to the table there's been like
small bits of cheese that have been
given out but we haven't really seen any
you know great advancements and RT X
hopefully by next gen we're gonna like
see where all the games support all the
DL SS and all the great RT X ray tracing
features but for now I'm just not seeing
that but as far as sheer performance
numbers go you can see that this car
does beat the Vegas 64 now other people
have talked about it the six gigabytes
of memory that is going to become a
liability in the future you guys know
the new AMD cards coming out it actually
has 16 gigabytes of memory on it so
having six gigabytes of memory is not
actually going to be the absolute best
you know future proof card there is but
it also is an entry-level card I wish it
had sli if at sli I think it'd be a much
better you know a much better deal but
at the end of the day I would have to
say if I was going to choose between
paying you know 349 dollars for the
founders Edition or paying 20 more
dollars for this person this particular
Edition I would buy this card over the
founders Edition just because of those
facts the card is very nice-looking
however there are many people out there
who love the way of the Nvidia
and cards look so that's more of your
look and you don't care you know about a
few more frames per second then you'll
be good to go
I'm Alaric you've been watching Tecna
morrow like usual we'll have links below
down to everything that you want to get
more information on or if you'd like to
buy on these cards for yourself peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
