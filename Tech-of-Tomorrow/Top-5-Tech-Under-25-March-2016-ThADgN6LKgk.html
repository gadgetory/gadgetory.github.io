an awesome video featuring the top five
top five cool tech products for under 25
bucks and let me tell you these are some
pretty cool shiz nicks and you want to
stick around to the end because I've got
a surprise so first up is this little
cube called the mopey eyeball and you
might think all right man this thing's
really small but does it sound good well
for 1799 I have to say this is one
seriously kick ass product and
personally my favorite of the bunch this
thing's a wireless Bluetooth speaker and
receiver that actually has a huge sound
in it for such a small thing and the
coolest thing about it is it has all
these cool little lights making it look
like you're inside of a disco but
seriously on the real for as small as
this product is the Moby I bow is pretty
bad ass it will literally fill a room
with sound we were listening to a bunch
of different techno stuff and it was
seriously booming and the lights and
everything or just something really cool
that your friends are gonna come over
and go hey that looks pretty nifty so
it's only 1799 it's something that I
think will get people attention because
they're gonna go ahead what are those
cool little disco lights
now next up is the app flow I'm sorry
the aunt Wanda sorry ladies out there
but check it out the aunt Wanda is a
12-pack of cable organizers that are
really kind of trippy because they're
different than anything else out that
you basically just take your cable
whatever cable it is and you just shove
your cable inside and check that out
it's actually pretty nifty and kind of
ingenious and kind of simple like a big
giant rubber band that's not rubber but
anyways these products are 17 bucks for
a box of 12 of them and if you have a
lot of cables along after your musician
if your electronics guy or just
somebody's got a bunch of crap around
your house gotta be honest with the
Apple I mean the aunt Wanda is probably
a product you're gonna want to check out
I know some people out there gonna go
with the fact that kind of a weird cable
anything but you know what honestly it's
pretty ergonomic is pretty simple it
throw to the cabin real damn well got
him right in the head that time i'll
probably pay for up the video but
anyways let's check out this next part
this next product is pretty kind of
killer because it not only emits sound
you can listen to it while you're
scrub-a-dub-dub a rubba dub dub
hopefully not three men in a tub but
this product called the aki outdoor
speaker but as we like to call it the
wheel because you guys can see it
seriously looks like a wheel with
traction coming your way down the road
remember and it's pretty cool because
its 22 bucks and it actually has a
really decent volume when I put it
inside my shower and we were listening
to music it was seriously booming inside
the shower which I thought was pretty
cool so if you're a person who likes to
listen their music and sing in the
shower well now you can simply hook it
up and pair it to your smart device and
rock on or just go out or classic out or
funk out or get the funk out of here
whatever you want to do but for 22 bucks
it's completely waterproof so here you
can take it with you everyone to go take
it to the pool take it into the gym
you'd have to worry about getting
screwed up me personally I like singing
in the shower
next up we have something that's really
just fashion jewelry just attach it to
your wrist like so you know it looks
really cool on your arm its fashion hip
you know if you're also you want to wear
it in your head forehead device you know
it also doubles as a hid device no all
right I'm just BSN you guys this is
basically called the joby gorillapod and
what it is it's made for your camera to
hook onto here and I'm used on a desktop
so if you're doing some filming on a
desktop or even doing like your YouTube
channel or whatever you could actually
put your cam right on top of this thing
and you can film yourself which is
pretty cool a lot of these products are
really overpriced you see them all over
the place for expensive this one's only
15 bucks and it can hold up to a pretty
heavy camera I wouldn't say that it's
gonna hold anything really like big like
those DSLR cars it's not going to do
that but if you've got any type of phone
camera or any of the simple lower end
models this thing is gonna work just
perfectly it's about 15 bucks and I
don't know it's kind of weird it looks
like a you know alien crawly things I
thought the cameramen how about this how
about this guy's check this out I'll do
something different look it's like the
alien thing on your face just back in
with you next up and last but not least
the microsoft wireless mobile mouse 4000
yes sir now if you're a person who
travels a lot and you need something you
can take with you and fit your bag very
easy the for thousands of product you
guys who want to check out hooks up
simply by your bluetooth it also comes
in a couple different colors the one
that we got you guys can see is the blue
one and its really really great for
people who have small hands and I've got
kind of big hands so mine kind of you
know completely income for the thing but
if you're a girl or some of the really
small hands I think you'd like this
mouse whether using it for travel or
even as your mouse mainly at home the
Bluetooth connectivity makes it very
easy for you to use on the go and take
anywhere you want and like I said being
small makes it very easy to fit inside
your bag and take on planes and go
wherever you're going to go so but real
quick folks before we bounce out of here
want to give a special shout to the
people over at braintree for make in
