tacko tomorrow I am Eric your host and
today we're here with Nick from Asus to
take a look at their mx2 9 9q widescreen
monitor now this thing's pretty
incredible 2560 by 1080 resolution and
all kinds of great features that are
gonna want to make you put this in your
gaming or multimedia arena so Nick
what's going on bro welcome to the
channel thanks man
yeah we're glad they have you so so tell
me man what are some of the grand
features about this monitor that's just
kind of make an end you just go man I
gotta have that thing it's mine sure so
I think one of the very first things
that people are gonna notice about it is
gonna be the 21 by 9 aspect ratio so as
you can see here very very very wide
that's gonna allow you to give you 2560
by 1080 resolution and that's really
gonna open up the amount of things that
you can do with it whether it's in the
office or whether it's under your
personal life whether it's professional
in the personal life or whether you want
to do some gaming and you undo some
widescreen gaming without having to have
three mongers right and from a business
aspect what are some of the cool things
I'm ready you guys like open up like
multiple screens like right inside there
and view them all next to each other
correct we do have some of those
professionals features so one of those
is what we have called is quick fit it's
gonna be able to pull up overlays so you
can get kind of real size real life real
size demonstrations of what its gonna
look like when you're gonna print it out
so that those professionals that need to
hit target like target sizes for pages
and print ads or and so it doesn't it's
just the perfect seat put it C ymk
balancing or whatever that takes for
like somebody's doing printing as well
it's like the cult that screen matches
that the color reproduction is really
good the quick fit feature is more so
just for the sizing it is an IPS panel
hundred seventy eight degree viewing
angle five millisecond response time so
it does versatile as the IPS panels can
yeah so that means you folks use it for
gaming business now what about splendid
so splendid that's gonna be another one
of our issues exclusive features it's
gonna allow you to basically go through
and adjust the color temperature to a
preset settings so you can go ahead and
set set it to what you prefer for a
gaming or for watching movies or for if
you want it to be a little bit more
easier on the eyes when you're doing
some work I'm you can go dude and hit
the splendid feature and you can go
through and scroll and kind of find
that you prefer yeah so basically if you
want to test out of your most splendid
feature if you go out in the mall where
you want testes Marge's hey the splendid
feature scroll through and you'll see
how the monitor changes now make another
thing that I know that this thing just I
remember at CES that you know our homie
JJ was rambling about the speakers yeah
these things are like a lot of people
say Oh speakers and monitors that's just
plain crap but I understand these things
were actually supposed to be like really
good right yeah so as far as the
monitors go I think this is gonna be one
of the best set of speakers that I've
ever heard on a monitor you're gonna be
your base left two three watt speakers
and the two-channel five watt amplifier
inside and the whole audio system was
co-developed with Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen ice
power so it really gives you that great
great great sound and you can go ahead
and turn it up and you'll get some you
will even get a little bit of bass out
of it really impressive and what we've
gone ahead and do gotten ahead and done
so you can take advantage even further
is on the back you'll have audio through
our audio in and audio out so you can go
ahead and connect up your iPod or your
your portable media player basically
whatever it can take a 3.5 millimeter
jack or I can go ahead and get some
great audio right right off the bat so
let's check that out folks right now
we'll stop and let's hear a little audio
clip of this
so alright folks check it out now this
is also good for audio listening but
also it's really good for gaming so now
we've talked about some of the features
let's actually jump in and let's show
you guys some Crysis gameplay on this
monitor
rock and roll let's go ahead and do that
let's do it
come on it's alright what do you folks
think now we've showed you the features
we've showed you sound we've showed you
some gaming so now you guys actually
have a very clear idea about what the
mx2 9 9 q brings the table now what's
the cost on this right now so this is
gonna be coming out around $5.99 by the
end of quarter two so that we're looking
at around June and July timeframe right
on and and on the back it's gonna give
you everything you need to connect it

media devices through that HDMI port too
yeah basically matching up with all your
video cards have nowadays every video
