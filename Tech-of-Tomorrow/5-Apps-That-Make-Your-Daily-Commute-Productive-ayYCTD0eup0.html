lucky and work from home that you have
to commute back and forth every day to
get to your job I mean this could be up
to six days a week it could be long
distances it could really be a pain in
the butt too and maybe not even be the
most economical or best way for you to
get back and forth from that destination
so today's video I'm gonna talk to you
guys about five different apps that will
help make your life easier and not waste
that time going from A to B and then
back again also how to find the absolute
best route for you to get back and forth
from that stuff so let's check it out
so check this out the very first app
that we're going to be taking a look at
is one that can help you decide what is
the absolute best way to get back and
forth from your place of work now
thankfully there's a transit app that is
available for both Android and Apple and
this app has you completely covered
it features trip options for more than
125 cities around the world there are
real-time options for traveling by bike
by scooter by rail by bus there's also
ride-sharing options all contained
within this app using the transit app
you can make the most informed decision
on how to get to your workplace and back
again easily the app is simple to
install and use and it'll get you the
information you need without a bunch of
fluff I'm sure if you're like me you
have many things that you need to
accomplish in your daily life and
instead of being idle during your trip
time why not get caught up on things I
mean even if you're driving listening to
a useful podcast that can make you feel
like you're at least being productive a
little bit and a great option for
correlating all of your listenable
options or for choosing new ones is cast
box now cast box also works on Android
on the Apple or on the web now what's
cool about cast box for people who are
driving is it's compatible with Android
auto apple carplay and sports north now
sports North has over a million podcast
happening around the world with
information on news sports entertainment
music and more and if your preferred
podcast is in the cloud you can start
listening to your podcast on one device
and then you can finish it on another
the really big thing about cast box is
it gives you a choice and an option of
all the different casting that's going
on around the world it helps you keep it
organized you can schedule things and
this way instead of just sitting doing
nothing you can listen to something
educational and at least feel like
you're doing something many times I
found myself in a situation where I
really wanted to record what was
inspired in my brain but had no way of
doing so and then I discovered this app
called otter voice notes using auto
voice notes you can easily record your
voice and your ideas wherever you are
this can be used to record meetings with
your team to be evaluated later or you
can just go over your own voice notes
for reference at a later time and expand
on your ideas now the otter app offers
600 minutes of free transcriptions every
month and this might be even more than
you need but it's great to just have it
there whenever you need it so you can
access it check out what you're doing if
you're in a meeting with somebody you
can listen to the entire meeting and
write down your notes it's just all in
all I think a really easy program to
take down your thoughts and your ideas
and have them recorded to access
whenever you need them your inbox can
become overwhelming with so many emails
that it's confusing trying to keep them
all in order and manage so you can sort
through them without going crazy in the
process you guys know what I mean
there's so many emails from so many
people from spam to friends to family
that it honestly gets hard sometimes to
manage them all and keep track to simply
take control of your Inbox
email by Edison is a lightweight but
very powerful tool featuring support for
just about every email provider out
there it features a nimble interface and
a bunch of useful features real-time
travel notifications easy unsubscribe
features custom swipes using the email
by Edison app you can get your email
situation under control by the time you
finish that first cup of coffee in the
morning or tea if your bread
every day of our lives we find ourselves
in situations where we are having to
just multitask multitask multitask and
at today's growing world you may find
yourself buried under a to-do list that
is just so overwhelming and hard to
manage you just get lost now the
Microsoft to-do app does just enough to
help keep you on track of what you need
to do without a hassle the app actually
strikes a nice balance between good
features and being simple to use you can
easily manage what you need to do in the
order of importance in a simple app that
offers suggestions and can be shared and
even integrated with Microsoft's out Mel
email client the best thing I like about
this particular app is that will
actually give you suggestions of things
to do like paying your bills or taking
care of your kids and it'll actually
give you suggestions on what order you
may want to put these to do things in
and the app isn't so overwhelming or so
bulked out that it's just confusing it's
simple and easy to use and it keeps your
to-do lists in a really simple order
that is easy to manage and maintain
alright tech fans so those are five apps
that can really help you with your daily
life whether you're trying to streamline
how you get back and forth to your job
or you just want to be productive in
that downtime all of these apps can help
you accomplish those goals now once
again like in every video I will have
links to all of these different apps
down below
I wanted to state this in a record this
was not a paid video in any way shape or
form I just found these particular apps
to actually be very easy to use and to
implement in my daily life so if you
find yourself traveling a lot or just
really you're thinking wow I could be
getting to my job a lot more efficiently
than I'm doing now
check out those apps and try them out
they're all free they don't cost you any
money and who knows you may just find
one that helps simplify your life I'm
