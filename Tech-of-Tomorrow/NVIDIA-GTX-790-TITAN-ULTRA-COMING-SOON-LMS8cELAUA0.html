technology surrounding this kind of
stuff but basically what's going to
happen is you're gonna see the card come

off like you see on the titan now on the
titan ultra they'll all be opened up and

a dual gk110 part brought to to the
market to kill anything that AMD has got

traditionally anything that's had the
word wireless attached to it has really
traditionally sucked ass in gaming you

you get lag it usually sucks but now the
people over logitech are bringing it out
their new g 602 now this thing looks
really cool if you take a look at it the
specs in through our photo gallery you

information about this new project from
Logitech last up in the news today now I
know you guys who follow the channel
know that we bring you guys a bunch of
videos based on gaming at the for
now many people ask why we had the game
set for one at medium settings well for
one thing it takes a lot of power to run
the game at 4k when the settings one
high the game was very very laggy you
guys made comments about the new leg
videos if you guys watch those videos
the lag is really really bad in the
gaming we wanted to actually bring you
guys the full-on gameplay but if you
guys actually want to see how well this
really looks in 4k over on our website
we have plenty of pictures of all these
games in a photo gallery that you guys

original 4k beauty obviously you guys

video theater 1080p monitor it's just
impossible but if you just want to see

looks check out the link in the
description below because we've got some
great shots 4k isn't quite ready for
primetime yet at $3,500 but hey when
