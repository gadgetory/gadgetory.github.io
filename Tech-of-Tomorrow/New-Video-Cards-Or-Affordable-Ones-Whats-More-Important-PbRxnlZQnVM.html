that many people out there seem like
they're really anticipating a whole new
line of video cards from AMD and NVIDIA
and I'm gonna tell you guys why I kind
of disagree with that train of thought I
mean yeah I mean it would be cool if
there were some new video cards coming
out but truly the cards that are on the
market right now play pretty much all
the games that are out in the market
right now when they do it pretty well
the biggest problem that I see about all
of this is availability and pricing
because let's just face it for the last
year pretty much nobody's been able to
afford a video card unless they pretty
much sold their arm or their leg or
their house because the prices have just
been so extraordinary and there have
been all kinds of reasons and
speculation speculation excuse me about
why this is happening you know miners
obviously big-time miners buying
directly from the companies and buying
bulks of video cards so there's none
available in the market as a culprit but
also in my opinion not having enough
cards manufactured is also a problem it
doesn't seem like AMD or Nvidia was
really prepared for what the market was
going to be and if you can't really
afford a video card right now what's
going to happen when they release new
video cards you're just not going to be
able to afford those cards as well
correct I mean because if the prices
aren't going to go down it's not going
to matter where they release new series
of video cards or not for people out
there who don't have a lot of money
you're still not going to be able to get
your hands on a video card that's just
the way it is now as a reviewer I feel
God blessed and very lucky that in many
circumstances I can contact AMD or I can
contact and video and video it's pretty
funny right and it's a new company in
video it's half video card a half
motocross and video let's rock now but
anyways what I'm saying is I'm really
lucky in that respect because these
companies know that I help promote their
products by building systems and doing
stuff like that but honestly if I was a
gamer right now
and I was out trying to build a new
system I'd be still just like pulling my
hair going what the heck is going on
because not only have the video card
prices gone off but gone up but memory
card prices have gone up as well
memory card memory prices sorry guys I'm
still a little bit dinged out from being
six I'm still trying to get back on my
horse completely but you guys know what
I'm saying here the bottom line is if
you cannot afford to buy a video card as
a gamer and build yourself a gaming
system from scratch out of your own two
hands like many people like to do that's
really just a serious sad state of
events all the way across the board so
even if AMD released new video cards
next week and video released new video
cards next week it's not going to really
matter because unless the prices come
down it's not going to change things
whatsoever so sure there'll be some nice
newer video cards but let's be honest
how much do you think those cards are
going to be I mean if Nvidia released
new video cards their top of the line
cards would probably be coming into the
market at about eleven or twelve hundred
dollars right out of the gate so would
be a traditionally you know a $600 $700
you know that would be the top of the
line pricing you're going to see pricing
in eleven and twelve hundred dollar
category and for people who aren't rich
and people who live in other countries
where the exchange rate and everything
isn't great and they have huge tariffs
like Brazil just to get anything into
the thing Jamaica is the same way how is
that going to help you really in any way
it really won't so I really don't feel
right now that the lack of new video
cards onto the market is any real big
deal the 1080i will play just about
anything there is out there at even 4k
at mini games and if you really want to
go even crazy you can get yourself a
Titan XP obviously AMD doesn't have
anything of that exact caliber yet I
mean I'm sure is their technology their
drivers and everything keeps catching up
it'll get closer but it doesn't really
matter the bottom line is if you can't
afford those video cards it doesn't
matter whether it's last generation the
generation before or the generation
coming up if you can't buy it it's
irrelevant to your
tuition so at the end of the day I don't
think that new video cards and them not
coming out is really any you know grand
bad thing about the industry and an
honesty honesty excuse me the industry's
you know kind of stagnated in many ways
I've been in this industry since day one
since the very beginning and honestly
every launch in the past used to be very
exciting because you knew that you were
going to get something that was going to
be very very competitive
well NVIDIA really doesn't have to worry
about being super competitive right now
do they
because AMD is not putting anything out
that is really you know comparable
they're still having products that are
subpart NVIDIA performance so until AMD
can actually come up with a card that
makes Nvidia go oh holy we're gonna
lose market share to these fools well
there's not much they're gonna be doing
about it and as a corporation you really
can't blame them I mean if you're not
forced to put something out to make
video card sales why would you do it it
really doesn't make any sense for them
because they have to retool reef AB do
all this stuff to get those video cards
out and that involves millions of
millions of dollars as we all know so
until we see companies pushing them and
forcing them to release new cards I
don't really see them honestly doing
that I know that they do have new cards
that are in their lineup that are
supposed to be released eventually but
as things are right now even if they
release them you couldn't afford them so
honestly I'd like to hear you guys
opinion down below what you guys think
do you really think that putting out new
video cards right now is what really
needs to happen or do you think that the
market needs to balance the frak out and
bring pricing down to an affordable
level so that people who want to do
their own stuff can do it because the
only way around that for the last year
pretty much has been to go out and buy a
system from somebody like a VA direct or
one of those other companies out there
and get your systems through them so
that you can get your video card now I
don't really think that's really such a
bad thing I know that people want to do
their own hands-on stuff but honestly if
you get a system for on these guys they
do all the cable management for you and
it's human
you get a big enough power supply you
can honestly customize that rig and
modify it to what you want it to be so
in my opinion buying these systems to
these companies it's really not that big
of a deal and if you're a person who
can't you know build a system or don't
have a friend that can build a system
for you that's pretty much your only
route anyways so let me know what you
think do you think new video cards will
solve all the problems of the industry I
don't I think when you lower the prices
and make everything affordable for
everyone what do you think let me see
