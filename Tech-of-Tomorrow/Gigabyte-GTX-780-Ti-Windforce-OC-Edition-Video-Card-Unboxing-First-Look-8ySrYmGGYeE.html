Plus for a free extended two-week trial
period head over to Hulu Plus com /t ot
old fans welcome back new fans welcome
to the channel you've arrived at TECA
tomorrow we're bringing you all the tech
all the time I'm Eric your host and
today we have the gigabyte win force 450
watt cooling edition of their new 780ti
card now basically you guys should all
know but the 780 Ti is by now it's like
basically all the cores are unlocked all
2880 of them we're all unlocked
you know you get full three gigabytes
gddr5 memory i'll clocked high and
everything this is basically the card
that was rumored to come out initially
but hey now it's fully fledged out and
this is the card
we've done some reviews than that
already and so if a lot of other people
so you guys should by now know the basic
numbers now the differences are gonna be
on the cooling and the aftermarket
cooling which is a car we're gonna look
at right now now this card features the
new three fan version 450 watts and with
that anymore do let's jump in take a
look at the card and see what it's all
about let's go all right folks first up
we have the box obviously gigabyte with
the gigabyte I the wind force 450 watt
out there OC version 3 gigabytes gddr5
memory the geforce gtx 780 Ti con waste
too much time on that you guys all know
what that is
here's the back of the box they talked
about it once again basically they talk
about their cooling they talk about the
wind force 3x there's gonna be three
fans on here they're totally adjustable
for their speeds they're made to keep
your card totally running cool even when
the card is overclocked Windows 8
Windows 7 HDMI all that good stuff and
you guys were Nvidia fans you guys all
know what else comes basically with an
Nvidia card I don't need to school you
nothing on this side of the box nothing
on this side of the box pretty much
nothing on this side of the box but the
name so let's just jump into the emboss
could just pop the top right here make
it nice and simple pulling on out of
there pop the cap run up the bat on the
top we see the card anti-static bag go
ahead and pop that off the side real
quick see what else is in the box
all right so we've got a little cap
right here that's holding the other
accessories to molex to 6-pin and
another to molex to 8 pin so you get one
of each molex to 6 molar State so even
if you got some old-school unfasten our
supply you'll be able to connect this
bad boy up inside of your system
gigabyte information stuff the quick
guide graphics card a quick guide what
they're telling you quickly I don't know
but hey it's quick guys here are the
drivers this will also include all their
overclocking software all there
monitoring software and all that stuff
you guys all know that you're going to
go on the internet and get the latest
driver anyways but if you don't have
backs to the Internet
well this is gonna be your key ticket
let's move on to the card and get this
out of the way all in this anti-static
package you guys can see it's completely
sealed from the factory so we're gonna
go ahead and break that virgin sealing
you guys can now call me a true virgin
killer that's right pop this little
thing again
sticky tape already then pull that card
out of there now check it out I got the
bat you guys all have claimed many times
that you prefer a black PCB well here
you go completely black PCB you guys can
see there are four main points in the
back of the card for removing the
cooling apparatus up here on top please
to the two sli fingers down here below
the PCI I'm gonna flip the card around
or you guys can begin to see part of the
cooling all underneath there are the
aluminum heat fins inside there it's
kind of hard to see but they're also
copper heat pipes more heat fins going
all along six pin and eight pin hence
those two power converters that we saw
earlier flip it around the backside
do you guys can see it's a two slot card
but it's actually pretty thin compared
to some I've seen some that are really
bulky this one's actually a little bit
thinner than the other ones then your
long we see the cooling still continuing
along all the way along the card now
here on top we see three separate fans
two fans on the outside one in the
center the center one is a little bit of
a different fan but you can also change
all the different speeds and monitors
with the software we see the wind force
nomenclature right there across the top
the cards actually quite cool looking
it's very well balanced I like the way
that it looks it's very visually
appealing I don't even know if I would
even want to pull the cooling off and
put a liquid cooler on this particular
car because it really does look good and
one force cling usually does a great job
we'll see we get to the test but I'm
thinking it's gonna do just fine
here we get to three ril single DVI
single DVI B standard HDMI standard
DisplayPort and that's everything folks
that comes in the box of the new geforce
gtx 780 Ti windforce Edition from
gigabyte special thanks once again to
Hulu Plus for making this video possible

there know what Hulu is but do you guys
really know what Hulu Plus is because
Hulu Plus is like a whole different
level Hulu Plus is like taking that
standard video card slap in the
watercooler on it and getting the
absolute most bang for your buck just

more information on this card as far as
like pricing you guys want to check out
any more information check out the link

the internet now if you guys are just to

a little on the pricey in for right now

latest the greatest and it's got badass
