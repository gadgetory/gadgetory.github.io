5 the results with the r-tx stuff just
weren't really that great and although
you know I know that everybody said oh
you're only supposed to use the low
setting well there's some that you also
didn't know if he went from the low
setting and then you went to the ultra
setting everything was completely
correct now going from the medium the
high to that no it didn't work but for
some reason if you went from low to
ultra it still worked and those numbers
that we showed you guys were absolutely
totally correct and as you guys will see
now there's a brand new release that has
just come out overture now the overture
update actually does a lot better stuff
with the RT X then you saw before I
think that you guys will be very happy
with the numbers at the end of this
video I was pretty impressed although
even at 4k huh there really wasn't much
of a performance at all from 27 frames
per second to like 36 frames per second
it's about 10% in 4k so as far as 4k
stuff goes really didn't do too much at
all now the 2080 ti and that's the most
expensive card so we decided really not
to use that car because we figured only
the most goober gamers are gonna be able
to afford it and they'll probably
already know it is but a lot of people
are gonna probably buy the 2080 because
that car is at a much better price point
so more people can afford it so we
tested with the 28 and I have to say
that even though Nvidia claimed that it
was only gonna do you know 60 frames per
second you know at 1440 and at 1080 it
wasn't really gonna do you know as well
either and well honestly they were wrong
because it performed actually a lot
better than they predicted at least in
you know an Artest situation our test
system is an i7 8700 K we've got 32
gigabytes of RAM
you got a liquid cooler you know it's
all in all just a pretty nice system
we've got an SSD for the boot drive you
know we've got - Tara - excuse me we've
got - 2 terabyte barracuda drives for
our storage of all the games we've got
the latest windows all the latest
updates and the latest drivers available
at the time of this wants to show you
as in this video now the new driver also
includes supports for upcoming direct
x12 performance optimizations and just
cause for insurgency sandstorm and world
of warcraft battle for Azeroth something
that I actually find is a little bit
even more exciting other than the RT X
performance is the fact that we're going
to get a brand new single-player
campaign that's right the last tiger I
love the single-player campaign so I can
go in there and just do my thing at my
leisure and for multiplayer and for
going in and just honing all your skills
and getting better at the game there's
gonna be all kinds of interesting stuff
in this new thing called a Panzer storm
and that's the stuff I really look for
as well as the RT X stuff okay one more
thing before we jump in and also check
out a brand new song from my band seven
deadly sins called insanity I want to
make sure you guys know that Nvidia is
really focusing on the medium settings
so the things that we're gonna be
talking about right now will be on the
medium settings but we will have the
ultra scores there for you as well just
to feast on and with that said let's
rock
so check this out at 14:40 there is a 29
frames per second device which is better
than a 50 frames per second difference
before the update now when you guys have
r-tx off it's a hundred and six frames
per second and with it on it's 77 frames
per second now at 1080 there is a 40
frames per second difference which is
better than the 60 frames per second
difference before the update 139 frames
per second off 98 frames per second on
honestly I'm really relieved and glad to
see that this new update actually does
take our TX to a new level and gives the
gamers you know performance as well as
all that great visual stuff now at 4k
obviously there really wasn't much for
improvement we've all talked about so
many times 4k gaming in many ways is
just really dead there's really nothing
out there that really is like oh I'm the
king of 4k you know you can spend a ton
of money you know get two cards and go
broke you know when you can put a down
payment on a car buy two you know video
cards or you can just game at 1440 or
game at 1080 and be totally happy the
graphics are great and with all the new
stuff that's coming out it's really not
gonna make a difference so at 14:40
which i really think is where you know
most of the gamers out there or finding
the sweet spot you guys can see even
with the 2080 card you're still getting
massive frames per second even better
than what an Nvidia predicted so I have
to say that on this particular release
it's a win all around with the new
single-player campaign the last Tiger
with the panther storm all that
interesting stuff as well as this great
performance as well as with the new
stuff that's going to be coming out with
those other new DirectX 12 games all in
all I think those so is a success for
more information we'll have a link down
below if you're not sub Hey please make
sure you sub to the channel we have lots
of videos coming out and make sure you
have your notifications on otherwise
you'll never know what we're doing peace
