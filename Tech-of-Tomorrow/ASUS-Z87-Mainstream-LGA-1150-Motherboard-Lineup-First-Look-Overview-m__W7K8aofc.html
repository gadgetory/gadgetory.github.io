back to tech of tomorrow I'm elric and
today's co-host is JJ mr. a sous himself
and what we got going on we'll check it
out you guys all know that has walls
coming out and we've got all of their
desktop motherboards at least quite a
bit of them right here on the desk so
we're going to hand a photo JJ and we're
going to go around these boards and tell
you some of the great features and
things about these new z87 series
motherboards right yeah one hundred
percent so as always thanks for having
me boss oh yeah sure so like you just
talked about you know we've done another
video I'm sure you guys can check out
here on the channel the covers actually
kind of has well or if the fourth
generation series core processors ends
87 the differences and some of the
differences so if you guys want to find
out more about just kind of some
differences compared to z77 xe9 check
out that video guy out here yeah check
out that video what we're trying to
focus on here is giving you guys an
understanding we have an entirely new
line of mainstream series motherboards
so for you guys know asus there's four
different divisions we have our
mainstream series we have our rog series
we have our tough series and we have our
WS series and motherboards workstation
so here we're covering our mainstream
series so the mainstream series kind of
give you some context where it's
focusing at is kind of like the jack of
all trades you know this is a board that
really is going to be great about giving
you a solid gaming platform it can be
that you're a prosumer and you're
looking to maybe some editing on your
system it could be that your general
user that wants productivity you're
checking out youtube videos you're doing
a little bit of gaming you're doing a
little bit of everything you can just be
building a standard box you know you
could just be somebody that's trying out
building for the first time it works
well now our segment series boards like
tough and RG and WS could of course also
do any one of those things but they're
going to have more features and
functions that are specifically catered
towards a certain user but that's going
to be you know overclockers or gamers or
content creation people things like that
I was really surprised that particular
boards on the thing here but last
generation the saber-tooth motherboard
just sold like unbelievable hot cakes
every time I turned around every modern
that I saw actually was going in the
direction of that motherboard so we're
going to have one of those motherboards
also coming up from this series true
yeah of course like we said we talked
about tough and we're going to
highlighting here on the channel Tough
Series ROG and WS as well but this is
focusing on the mainstream series so
mainstream is always going to give you
guys the best residential of what asus
is doing in terms of designs features
that are going to be consistent if you
guys checked out last year's a video we
talked a lot about the design
consistency between what you would get
between let's say like a deluxe the pro
and even let's see maybe over more value
or any solutions like the dash a so with
that let's go ahead and first talk about
what we really have here what's new to
our platform features and designs and
functionality so we've got here are
actual deluxe port if you actually want
to go ahead and take maybe out of the
box we can go ahead and take a look at
it that's why they're look at this book
so we'll do like a unboxing for you here
and here in terms of what you're seeing
one of the biggest changes of course is
that we've gone to Anna ninth entirely
new ID right so we have a new color
thing if being an entirely new color
gold yes there's gold in them thar hills
its goal and that's a pretty big change
because we previously had blue as being
our standard motherboard color design
and kind of a little bit of design story
from there has been that you know we've
felt we've kind of set the gold standard
in motherboard design for years in terms
of the features or functionality and the
overall quality of what we bring to the
table so that's now represented in this
new ID design or you've kidnapped Midas
like I said and had them touch all the
boards you know a circulating here but
it's possible it is not a fan of
breaking any any law so I think maybe we
might have consulted with midas though
let's go with that consultation so you
know one of the things of course you're
going to see is like always there's a
huge amount of connectivity you're going
to see that we maintained our inclusion
of Wi-Fi on a large number of skews so
we have the deluxe we have the expert we
have the pro and we have the plus and we
have the dash a now you guys might
notice that of course here on the box we
don't have p8 anymore right and that's
because we've also changed our naming
convention so the chipset name is now
just see 87 and then the model name no
more p no more p since pentium is gone
why not what does just right in photo
try to make it more simple and we've
also tried to have the naming convention
aligned with maybe understanding where
the board sits so if we go from
something let's say like the plus board
which would be like our our entry level
board right above the a its plus vs
industry-standard you're getting a
little bit more than what you would
normally get right and then pro pro
means you've kind of stepped up the next
level you're a professional user you
kind of really understand more about the
boards design the feature set the
functionality you know probably a bit
more about overclock ability aspects
like that and it's always a slight
difference right between each board each
board has a slight different set of
features than a set of basic features
that go across the one hundred percent
agree that we have a great set of non
negotiable features that are not going
to change between any one of the boards
that you look at and then you're going
to get improvements in functionality as
you keep stepping up because you're
going to probably be a more advanced
user going from the pro board what would
you be after your professional you
become an expert right at something so
that's the expert series and then after
the expert you have the deluxe which is
that representation kind of everything
right yeah um so on the deluxe here if
we take a like everything bagel yeah
like what we have you can see that we've
got our Wi-Fi module which we had in the
previous generation previous deluxe was
82 11n and gave you dual band Wi-Fi so
that was a first amongst any mother
board vendor and we had two point four
and five gigahertz this generation has
been updated to a two to 11 AC so we
have now AC which is the fastest Wi-Fi
to buy two solutions still giving you
two point four and five gigahertz plus
bluetooth 4.1 the board let's talk about
something else though now this board
with this new Wi-Fi also has a different
type of connectivity through the board
right which actually allows us to work
much better and seamlessly through the
board op taking away from any of the
other pci stuff true correct well it's
still linked into a pci express lane but
if we go ahead and just set this guy
down and maybe take a look at what we
have here we lift this little guy up you
can see right here this is kind of the
module and we can show you guys here a
little bit later on the board they were
it's direct slot so the benefit of this
type of design is one is that when it's
house directly in the io backplane we're
not affecting any of your slot expansion
so sometimes other competitors have
Wi-Fi integration but it's done through
an adding card and so if it's something
and adding card and I have let's say you
know I'm communicating maybe three-way
support no that's like as well it's not
actually a three-way enabled board so
our design even though the spec could
quote-unquote be sane it's not really
the same so it's more expense
having a complicated design but we feel
it gives you the best functionality so
that's a great plus point in terms of
the connectivity a lot of the things are
going to be what you of course come to
expect but there's going to be a lot of
consistent asus staple points such as
USB boz flashback so that's our
exclusive technology which lets you
flash the UEFI chip directly no cpu no
memory no graphics card no I think it's
great at the board the test station just
you got it you're just looking to like
hey want to flash the BIOS you can
instantly do before we even start
building your system exactly or if you
had to recover your system maybe from a
failed overclock or a surge of spike
rasekh something you can do that I play
Doran out that was actually really cool
the Intel network controllers which
we've been big supporters of we've
updated this generation to the latest
series so using intel yes but it's now
the intel i Series network controller so
this controller actually has even better
performance more management
functionality it's also you can even
have lower cpu utilization so its
overall a nice improvement to give you
the best network connectivity and best
performance for the audio side a large
number the boards all the way going down
to the pro board are going to feature a
new updated alc audio codec so instead
of the previous 800 series since now the
alc 1150 so that supports a higher level
specifications make a number jump there
for those folks yeah because it's
actually it's actually got a number of
big changes to the codec we still keep
the DTS ultra 2pc sound package so
that's a nice software suite to go ahead
and complement your audio now no I know
on some of the rog boards it was such
you know segregated away from the rest
of chipset is it done on this board as
well is it still separated for so you're
going to get an improvement and audio
compared to the previous generation but
for you guys that want even better audio
then of course rog is still going to
maintain the supreme effects audio
design so that's an exclusive point for
the rog boards now we're still going to
also keep other special functions like
the TPU and the e pu technologies so we
have our dual intelligent for processors
which allow you to have a lot of
advanced controls for overclocking or
for power efficiency how about the
instant overclock I gonna know previous
generation boards there was like a
little but you go and click it like
automatically went to 4.3 and it was
just like that's just in taneous
overclock for like anybody could do is
the same type of thing going on
exactly one hundred percent right so
we've got a two-stage epu because
there's some changes than the thermals
we can go ahead and now switch it into
the second stage and you can have as
easy as a 4.25 degree it's over clock
and the float switch or you can go ahead
and switch the EP you switch energy will
be focus at power efficiency reduce
thermals but it won't affect performance
it will just be an under bolt to the CPU
so if you want to keep stock performance
you're good to go there I know there's a
lot of guys out there now a roaming like
all this Bitcoin type stuff like if you
were doing that you could just switch
that EP you switch make sure you're
getting in those energy proficient set
that thing and forget about it right one
hundred percent now of course fan
control functionality continues to be a
big thing for AC series board so you
know maybe you even take a look at
another one of our boys that we have
here which is the dash aid this is a
value series motherboard but you're
still getting a huge amount of a sous
design quality and something that we
feel we pride ourselves on is fan
control functionality so all every
single one of these headers are all
going to be four pin fan headers and
they all support both three pin and for
pain control so you can control
everything through the bios just like
previous generation very fully through
the UEFI as well as fully in the
operating system through our AI suite
three some of you guys out there you
know you get a motherboard you look a
bunch of fans on you going you're
buyouts you notice like what the frak I
can't control the fan at all I can't do
anything with it you have to go out and
buy like an aftermarket fan controller
you don't have to do that at all in any
of the ASA sports everything's inside
the bios so anything you hook up with
the fans go into the bios you'll be able
to adjust it manually to how you want it
to be yeah and we feel that's it's a
great feature to have consistently even
on something like our dash a series
where this board is going to have great
performance great overclock ability but
even so have that really robust level of
control when it comes to fans now we've
gone ahead and made one other key
improvement for the cpu fan heaters
where i noted that the cpu fan headers
also support three and four pin control
just like all the chassis fan headers
but we even have a new modified fan
header if you look closely right here
we'll have to get a tight inch oh yeah
that's a cutting edge there yeah now
this actually little depressants which
which is right here on the cpu fan
header for you guys are using more basic
tower base heat sink with maybe the only
single fan this will auto-detect the
actual fan itself and allow it to know
whether it's a three pin or four pin
based solution that's
really cool so you don't even have to
actually assign that or configure that
within there so that's kind of just
another layer or touch that's already
integrated with the great person most
guys using those sealed liquid cooling
systems too yeah a really nice touch now
in terms of course all the component
quality we still continue to be leaders
and giving you best-in-class power
delivery so all the boards are featuring
5k rated capacitors that's twice the
lifespan of what you're going to see on
competitors which are generally using
only 2k rated capacitors Stenzel I for
the motherboard yeah it just gives you
overall a better confidence in their
product over time is going to be able to
be reliable but on higher-end boards of
course we're still going to have great
high-end power components so these these
are all our inductors these are fully
molded high-performance alloyed based
inductors really beefy give you a great
amount of power output and you can feel
confident still high-end Japanese
quality components yeah of course at the
end of the day the bigger thing that you
have to kind of keep in mind is what
does that translate into if I by deluxe
versus a pro override a che are you
saying that deluxe because of those
better components is going to have
better overclocked ability actually no
we feel confident that our power designs
across all these boards are going to
give you great overclock ability I've
done 4.8 gigahertz on this dash a board
I've done 4.8 on the pro board and I've
done 4.8 on the dell export all of them
can do that without any issues the main
differential is going to be by the board
that's going to give you the
functionality and the connectivity you
want you know dash 8 and the features
because like you know some users may not
want what's on the deluxe board you
might go oh you know what this
particular system that I'm building is
very plain Jane system it's for an
office I don't need that but I still
want a high quality motherboard then you
can go ahead and get the entry level
board but if you're somebody who loves
the line you want more features then you
just move up the line and take a look at
what your needs are make a decision
that's really the key you know is take a
look at you know dash a zone again I
maybe have six out of ports but if I
have a lot of connections that I need
deluxe is going to give you ten you know
maybe you don't need Wi-Fi whereas the
deluxe and the pro are going to give you
why fine with it deluxe even give you a
toad 11ac so it's we feel that we've
tried to give you a huge amount of
consistency on there and there's going
to be some really awesome features that
we haven't talked on here about the UEFI
as a whole or a a sweet three please
make sure to check out those videos
because those features in terms of the
UEFI and the software are going to blow
you guys away and they're going to be
consistent on any one of these
in terms of give you more functionality
more feature set you know and features
separate the wolf from the lamb I mean
the features of a motherboard these days
are what make it differentiate from
something else and at the end of the day
you know lie people make boards when you
have all the extra features that are
there for the same price that kind of
what drives a user you know in a
direction of buying one hundred percent
agree and that's where we think that
we've spent the most time and effort to
give you guys unique thoughtful designed
implementations that really benefit you
guys so the last two things here they
want to talk about is that you know as
part of a whole lineup we've talked
about from high-end to value on your
product we're going to continue to offer
diversify form factors like our mini ITX
solutions you can see here a lot of you
guys loved the dash I bored we took the
dash I bored and we took a board that
was essentially on steroids and we made
it even better we went from four SATA
ports to six SATA ports on it we've
integrated for full fan headers onto the
board they're all fully controllable for
three pin and four pin operation it has
a tattooed 11ac so dual band Wi-Fi
support with AC and bluetooth you got
that new Intel I series Nick you've got
six USB ports on the back plus two more
onboard the independent power board
solution I mean it's just an outright
beast of a mini-itx solution so you can
see that this is a deluxe board just in
the same vein as the ATX board is but no
compromise this is our attention to
detail where we've done things and we
design them in the right way where you
can see that the space between the CPU
socket and the PCIe slot we actually
give you space that's important because
if you use a bigger cooler if you take a
lot of other mini exports the suck is
actually right above the PCIe slot so if
you use a big cooler there's no way it
fits it actually hits the graphics card
with our design you can actually still
use a normal full power the heatsink
solution I've put in duel one hundred
forty millimeter tower heatsink on here
and it fits I know it's it covers the
water line but it's assault but it fits
you know lasting things out you know
we're always about innovation we're
doing a lot of first year we've done age
of eleven AC we've done entirely new
topology design so we have a new ID we
have new UEFI options we have new types
of software applications and this is
going to be a cool exclusive feature
that we have on asus z87 series sports
it's NFC support so any one of the AC
series board that you're going to see
will actually come included
it excuse me you can climb included with
support for this box the deluxe duel
which features Thunderbolt along the
expert board which also has Thunderbolt
deluxe tool will come included with this
inside the box Wow for you guys that
want it as an option but maybe by like
the dash a or the pro or the mini ITX it
will be sold as a separate accessory
well R allow you to do is you can go
ahead and connect it to one of the USB
ports it'll give you two USB ports
because it's also acts as a hub but
you'll be able to go ahead and take your
latest generation smartphone or tablet
and be able to run some really cool
functions directly through the NFC box
such as logging into your system doing
quick file transfers being able to
launch even application so now the NFC
is near field communications correct so
that means basically like you told me
earlier that it doesn't it's actually
not a protocol itself but it allows
things to use other protocols just to
like basically make a handshake and
instantly connect correct correct yeah
it'll be generally using Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi to allow you to easily execute on
functions that normally require a couple
more steps handshaking authentication
password stuff like so like I'm a guy
I'm in my office i just took in a bunch
of pictures of my dick and terry's that
visited my office you know i want to
really show them off with this thing
sitting a meager is basically go ahead
take my device stick it on here and it
will automatically start transferring
and everything onto my system right yes
at what particular protocol up yeah once
you initiate the share function then you
can go ahead and do that for you what
about for like music and stuff like that
will be able to do that like to like
it's late say you brought your music
device here and place it here would it
be able to transfer that and then play
it through your motherboard well right
now still fine-tuning the level of
functionality we're gonna have available
so there's definitely gonna be stuff
that available at launch for you guys to
check out such as login quick file
transfers remote desktop but will love
to hear you guys is feedback at how we
can keep improving it so let us hear
your comments in the comment section so
okay I'm now Eric this is JJ we've got
lots more videos coming for you folks so
keep watching and we'll see you guys
here on tech tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
