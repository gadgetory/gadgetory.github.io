echo tomorrow now today's video involves
giving you guys a question trying to
reach out to you guys and see what you
guys think now you guys see how many
subscribers that we have in a channel
we're right now to 250,000 subscribers
so that's a lot of people it's getting
harder and harder to like give giveaways
and target these people because it's
just getting narrower or narrower for
people's chances to win and we
completely understand that we still keep
giving stuff away anyways doing it but
now you want to try something a little
bit different now last year we sold a
music pack that's what we sold all of my
music in a pack it was $25 and we
actually gave the Red Dawn system away
some guy named already won it and in
fact since that guys wanted man this
guy's had major health problems right
now he's actually in the hospital so if
Artie you're watching this video man a
shout out to you we hope you get better
man after you won that system that guy's
been contacting me for everyone I want
to upgrade I want to change it so we
want to give the same type of chances
again this year but we want to actually
we want to blow this shit out of the
water like this has nothing to do with
our Christmas giveaways or any other
stuff for doing that stuff's all on full
track we want to give away like four
major systems so we want to have four
major systems and then like six other
prizes so ten prizes completely and we
want to sell this thing for twenty-five
dollars a piece for the music pack so
basically you buy the music packet
includes all of our music that we're
having we actually have new songs coming
out including what you guys have been
asking for the AMD fan song that's right
that jisne coming you know don't hold
your breath but hey it's coming very
very soon so we guys are going to have
that so we want to sell the pack give
you guys a code and then for the people
that buy this we want to have only 500
people do you able to be in this and
then we want to be able to give systems
away we want to give this system away
the Blitzkrieg system away we have
another assistant that we've been
working on this kind of geared for a
home theater and we have another system
so we want to give forces Lou the way
and in these smaller prize but before we
will do this we want to see what you
guys think about it because I don't
really want to waste time doing it and
then just get a bunch of hating a bunch
of negative feed
back like there's a couple things that
we've done where you guys have just gone
completely crazy and we just end up
dropping the project and it's like wow
that much negativity so if you guys
would be down for something like this
let me know it's $25 you buy the music
back you're actually buying the music
back I want to be very clear about this
you are not buying a raffle ticket I
want to clearly reiterate this this is
buying the music back it's $25 for the
music pack and with that you get a code
that lets you be in this raffle for this
stuff we're not selling raffle tickets
per se so if you guys are into this type
of thing let us know we're looking
forward to your answer because hey this
way we can get cool systems and cool
things to a limited number of people for
a very small entry price let it snow I
know it will see you guys back on time
tomorrow
he will be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
