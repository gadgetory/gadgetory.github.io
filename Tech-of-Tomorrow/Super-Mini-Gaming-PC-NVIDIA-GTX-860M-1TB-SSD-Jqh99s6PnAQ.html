I'm trying to shave man it's not time to
fill me in 760 review yet is it so the
funny thing is though is that some of
you guys out there have been asking me
what I shave with and Harry sent me
there Winston KITT I want to thank those
guys for making today's video possible
now like me I think that almost all of
my viewers are male and if you're a guy
then you obviously have to shave now one
thing that's really cool about the
Harry's kit is that all the raises are
made by custom German and ziering and
trust me these things are sharp and they
will last more than one time the thing
about Harry's is that you get a great
shave at a fair price now I know a lot
of guys don't like to go out and do a
lot of shopping so one thing about this
it's very convenient now the kid I got
obviously man this is like the
rolls-royce of kids if you guys want
some do it right to your door and get
five bucks off all you got to do with
the checkout is enter tomorrow and you
guys will get five bucks off your first
purchase and they've got stuff to fit
every budget takers trekkers and gadget
freaks
oh who the heck am I kidding y'all are
the PC master-race and I bow to you so
what's up do you guys like that intro we
thought it was kind of cool a way to mix
our Harry's ad and with the little fun
because we like to keep things fresh
around here cuz I'm The Fresh Prince of
TECA tomorrow that's right
so what's going on today alright you
guys had seen we brought you guys a
ton of those little PCs and so far none
of them have really been up to the kind
of things that you guys think of as
gamers but now we've got something in
house that's totally different
what's the same but different you know
kind of like a chocolate with Chris
Peter chuckling this time we've got the
zotac C box e n 760 and this bad boy we
Specht out all the way I pretty much
made this thing the most badass monster
mini PC that you're ever going to be
able to get your hands on and yes this
thing does actually gain as far as the
CPU goes this little bugger has an i5
4200 you it's a dual core processor not
a super bad boy but still powerful to do
your
has 1.6 gigahertz at standard clock 2.6
gigahertz as its boost now like I said
this thing plays game so what's powering
it to play games well obviously this
thing has a dedicated video card this
time it's by Nvidia and is an 860m this
thing has 2 gigabytes of dedicated
memory that's right it will play games
pretty good not even a cheesy one
gigabyte actually 2 gigabyte so at 1080p
you're going to be doing really good now
this thing features 640 processing units
core clock of 1020 boost clock of 1097
and 5000 megahertz on the memory clock
so that's pretty powerful for unit
that's just the size of your hand now as
far as expandability goes inside of this
bad boy you can put in m SATA you can
put a single 2.5 hard drive and you can
do up to 16 gigabytes of so-dimm memory
and believe me I flex this thing out I
used for my storage media drive the
latest Kingston HyperX 960 gigabyte SSD
did he just say 960 gigabytes whoo yes
he did
now for my boot drive I use a 256
gigabyte m2 drive by Plex err now this
shit's going to be off the hook fast for
anything accessing things booting up
everything in fact this machine boots up
in less than 10 seconds it's quite
incredible and everything transfers and
goes SuperDuper fast I'm actually really
impressed with what this system has as
far as memory goes stuck with Kingston
once again use some of their 1600
megahertz this is their HyperX so dim
that's right hyper X comes in little
mini sodium's now as well like I said
this machine for me is decked out as
hardcore as you can get for you guys out
there you do not have to do this at all
and the system bare-bones is actually
priced pretty well so real quick before
we jump into that gaming which I know
you guys are all dying to see let's take
a look at the outside of the unit and
what it has to offer feature wise on the
front side of this little guy we first
see a microphone and headphone jack then
a four and one card reader the first of
the four USB 3.0 you see your hard drive
LED and your power LED up above that you
have your start and reset button on the
other side of the unit we see a single
USB 3.0 port as we take a look at the
back of the unit right here on the top
we can see the Wi-Fi and
the next to that we see the spit of
digital audio then we have to land ports
two USB 3.0 ports the DVID connection
the HDMI the Bluetooth and then finally
the power connector at the bottom now
the one thing that I really didn't like
about this unit though is you guys can
see this thing is a fingerprint magnet
so make sure if you're going to be
leaving out where somebody can see it
you're going to have to clean it or
don't touch it so that's the unit folks
now one thing I want to mention because
I always see this in the comments over
and over go and I'll say it now instead
of saying at the ending I know that you
can build a bigger system trust me we
all know that you can build a bigger
system you've got to always take in
consideration though this thing is the
size of the palm of my hand it's
basically not even bigger than two sides
upon my hands it's very lightweight you
could throw it in a bag and take it with
you anywhere in the world it's totally
portable
and let's jump into what you guys been
waiting for this thing actually does
game pretty damn good so let's check out
those
right still locking out to the benchmark
song so that's it folks now I don't know
what you guys think but I think that's
pretty impressive especially with
Bioshock being over 60 frames per second
as high as setting now I know some of
the other games dip down below 30 frames
per second at the ultimate highest
settings but take this in consideration
when you're playing with something this
small you can't stick a Titan inside of
that so if you're looking for scores
like a Titan it's not going to happen
but if you just back down and scale down
just a little bit just put it on you the
high setting or a little bit like that
you're going to be able to have
unbelievable gameplay
this thing's quiet it doesn't rev up at
all like some of you guys were talking
about it doesn't overheat this thing
actually runs and stays cool the entire
time that I'm using it and with the
parts that I'm using like I said
everything on here super duper
incredibly fast it boots up in like 10
seconds I barely take a few presents
like holy it's already up and going
now base unit for these things you can
get for about 531 bucks for a bare-bones
unit and for a couple hundred bucks more
you guys can throw parts in there you
don't need to use all the crazy stuff
that I did I just want to do that
because I had these parts I want to
review some like hey I can review them
oh alright sorry personal crazy moment
there but you guys know what I mean
you guys can always put in a little bit
smaller harddrive a little bit less
memory you don't need to use an m2 for
your boot drive or anything like that
you guys can see but playing simple and
still get great gaming because at the
end of the day what really matters is
that 860m video cards that's on board
that's what's propelling you through
everything and just like always within
video you get all the things that come
with Nvidia get all their CUDA all their
shadow play all those great things that
Nvidia fans love all come inside the
unit so like usual everything that we
talked about will be down below that
description down below like button which
hopefully you guys really did like this
video because this is the kind of stuff
you guys have really been asking me to
bring the table so I bring it to the
table
hey I hope you like the food so eat it
up I love you guys we'll see you guys
back here on Tekken tomorrow thanks once
again for the people over at Airy shave
club for sponsoring today's video um you
guys can see I came out pretty damn
clean and pretty right alright we'll see
you guys back here in TECO tomorrow for
more tech goodness very soon and we've
got all
some more killers coming so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
