tomorrow we're now bringing you guys our
thoughts and all the latest big releases
this year and today we're talking about
a game that was originally planned to
just be a minor add-on to its
predecessor but was then turned into a
full-blown sequel so sit back and see if
this game is worth picking up on its own
as we talked about one of the raunchiest
silliest and most hilarious games this
year Saints Row 4
so saints row a series that originally
started off as being just a slightly
more wacky or sandbox alternative to
games like Grand Theft Auto went through
some major changes in the third game
which made it a lot weirder and whackier
and the fourth has pushed this even
farther door it's more or less
unrecognizable compared to what it
started off as which is also an inside
joke the game likes to poke fun at as
often as possible on the service and at
a first glance there really isn't a
whole lot to differentiate between
Saints to the third and four outside of
some new clothing options in an expanded
city with alien occupants the engine is
the exact same with the same visuals
that are far from gorgeous though of
course that isn't exactly the main goal
or strength of the series now running on
our system at Ultra settings we averaged
around 97 frames per second during
regular play with a few parts slowing
down here and there just because of how
many crazy things were happening all at
once now if you guys want to check out
the exact system specs we were running
it on make sure to check out the links
in the description to check out all the
individual parts of our build now
getting back to the game character
creation is still just as robust and
while it's only real changes from the
third including new clothing and tattoo
options it's still just as drawing to
work with the sheer number of options
available the music has received a
change but that's only because the
soundtrack is of course all pulled from
real-world songs used to create various
music stations most of which are really
enjoyable those summers on Rosano TISS
ibly lacking even though they were
present in the third game like the metal
stations now what additions i've
mentioned so far are pretty minor in
terms of how differentiates it from the
third game but there is one single
addition that really changes up the
entire flow and that is superpowers now
this one thing really does change how
the game is played mainly because it
adds a lot of new offensive abilities
like being able to do things like freeze
enemies or throw cards at people using
telekinesis but also adds a lot of
exploratory options like super speed and
jumping which more or less makes all
cars in the game useless outside of the
occasional tank
now while this not only changes the
game's core design it also adds a new
list of activities like trying to cause
mass destruction telekinesis completing
speedy time trials on foot across the
city or even a superpower Fight Club
where you fight against two other people
with well superpowers now along with
superpowers there are also a number of
new weapons that have been added along
with old favorites and some of which
seem to exist just to demonstrate how
silly they wanted this game to be with
my personal favorite being the dubstep
gun
the game's main campaign is also a
distinctive move from its predecessor
mixing traditional missions involving
shootouts and car chases with levels
that depict characters personal hell's
coming in a variety of ridiculous forms
like text-based adventures movie
parodies and even old school style
side-scrolling beat'em ups what plot the
game has is heavily based upon mocking
numerous other franchises whether that
involves the ability to romance every
member of your team at any given moment
or doing any number of plot events that
mock popular movies never mind the fact
that the entire concept of the Steelport
simulation is more or less the matrix
with some aspect thrown in none of it by
any means is entirely original and not
everyone is a fan of purely referential
comedy but it manages to do so many
different ones at once with its own
Rajee twists they can't help but find
yourself enjoying every absurd moment
now the truth is I really can't give you
that many objective reasons for why
Saints Row 4 should be considered a good
game it's by no means visually stunning
the gameplay is more or less identical
the Saints for the third with the
exception of superpowers and what comedy
there is is very much based on how many
different pop-culture references you can
catch that being said I can't help but
have just the biggest stupid grin on my
face while just doing stupid things in
the game which is really what its end
goal is I can't make any other strong
argument for it other than the fact that
it is pure simple fun and it lasts you a
healthy twenty hours as long as you're
just doing the main campaign and as many
missions as you can but can last even
longer if you're willing to go into
co-op doing not only competitive
missions but also just causing massive
chaos with all the sandbox options my
really only huge problem with the game
is a flaw that shares with the third and
that's that you can't replay any
missions which is especially tragic in
this one considering how many
interesting unique ones were offered in
your teammates personal hells it's also
really pathetically easy on normal
difficulties thanks to an already
unbalanced combat system getting the
addition of superpowers which just
throws it all out of whack so if you're
looking for some degree of challenge out
of the game you have to make sure you
raise the difficulty immediately now in
the end the one thing I can say to
recommend Saints Row 4 is if you're
looking for something that is just
simple dumb fun it doesn't require any
kind of grinding time to build levels
you don't have to work on your skills to
play in multiplayer modes you just get
to run around right away and do stupid
it's not the deepest game by any means
but it'll have you laughing plenty as
long as you enjoy a referential humor
and even if you don't there's enough
purely raunchy err just dirty jokes
we'll get you anyways well that was my
review of Saints Row 4 if you want to
grab it for yourself so you can do some
stupid make sure to check out the link
