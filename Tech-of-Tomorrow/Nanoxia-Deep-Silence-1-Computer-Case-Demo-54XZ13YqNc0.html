anoxia the German brand we are doing PC
cases and today we are on CES show and
we are representing representing our
case on the Swiss tech booth so at first
I'd like to introduce with the case it's
generally it's a more isolated case
which is completely sealed with gentle
material inside so we just start with
the phone in the front you got a upper
door it's got noise isolation form on
top you go three times can't control
with that bottom of course and is easy
to have any closings for the OD d slot
this can be closed thank you on the
lower area we got two sets of fan oldest
which can be opened easily and here you
got some cast filters inside which can
be taken out as well you can easily
remove the fans you got two friends in
front of the case right out of the box
close it like this close it again and
then you can simply close the door
inside the case we got this car
destroyed cages you can easily remove
the other ones of these bowls to get
better airflow through the chasis and
you can unscrew it this one the one on
the bottom
if you unscrew this one you can attach a
240 millimeter Fender radiator in front
of the case these are the drawers which
are vibration isolated as well and it's
fit to 23.5 in 2.5 drives you've got two
or three full 5.25 OD d bays and this is
detached now but normally we got a
slider here that means if you take off
this this cages to mount the radiator
right behind the intake fans you can add
the hardest K
is here one-by-one to stock up like
maybe four five or six harddrive this
depends of course of the space you got
here away from the motherboard you can
also attach a radiator and front of cap
on the case like the people from
terrific ed here you see we got a set of
different mounting holes through it you
can attach a fan tooth count to fans of
120 or 140 millimeter fans on top all
this radiator like here and as you can
see you got a lot of space left so you
don't have any incompatibility issues
with the motherboard the hundred forty
millimeter fan on the in the back side
there's also stock fan also controlled
by the fan controller which is provided
right out of the box you got eight times
PCI slots and the width of the case and
total is 220 millimeter I'm talking
about the unique feature we called the
air chimney that means to have a leave
design a clean design it's closed like
this but if you like to attach fans or
if you'd like to add in variator you can
open it easily by sliding like this and
also the i/o panel can be attached or
just put just pushing it can also be
easily closed like this again yeah on
the back you can see now we got this
this grommet - just to add some tubes
inside and in case you like to have an
external external components for your
water cooling stuff but it's also
included this close rubbers to cover it
here so it will be closed later on and
we got enough space for cable management
beside this side tray which is a side
panel which we can show as well and this
is a kind of additional possibility to
to get the air out or intake air intake
even if it's closed here on top
so every unscrew the side panel and take
it off you can show you easily there's
enough space to start the stapler the K
rates even if you got a large amount of
cables to get everything in order and
here you can see the panel got some be
tuning for noise isolation against the
vibration and the noise in total this is
the case we developed for nearly a year
and it's available in Europe since
October in 2012 and this will be
available in the United States mid of
February approximately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
