could be better but that's not what
we're really here for today we're here
today to take a look at the LG 34 um 67
- P
let's check this monitor out the LG 34
um 67 - P is a 34 inch monitor featuring
an ultra-wide 21 to 9 aspect ratio this
thing has a lot of features and actually
features AMD freesync technology but
before we get it all the features let's
actually take a look at the monitor
itself from the front you guys can see
this thing's very cleanly designed and
features a very very thin bezel hence if
you're using multiple monitors like
monitors and three this thing would be
really great because having a wide angle
on the side makes the viewing a little
difficult with this thin bevel and thin
edge it makes it more seamless than ever
before turning on and operating the LG
um 67 - P is really easy in the very
front of the monitor there's a little
toggle switch down below to access the
options all you do is click the button
access the features you want click the
button again and then change it to your
satisfaction you also turn the monitor
on and off from this place as well it's
very easy to use them one of the
simplest things I've seen on a monitor
no more looking around for buttons on
the side it's all right here and while
we're still on the further monitor let's
talk about the resolution the monitor
features a 2560 by 1080 resolution this
is an IPS monitor that for the
brightness has 300 CD response time is 5
milliseconds refresh rate is 60 Hertz
but as you guys can see I was actually
able to set the refresh rate to 75 and
the contrast ratio is 5,000,000 to 1 as
far as the stand goes now this is
something about this monitor that I'm
not really thrilled about at all I don't
really think that many people are gonna
cheer about this feature because it's
very very limited offers minimal just
tilt features you can't really raise the
monitor up and down for height there
anything like that so it's very minimal
in its design now as you spin around to
the back you guys can see that this
monitor offers a vase amount but if you
were actually to use that vase amount it
would block some of the ports in the
back of the monitor making it actually
kind of useless on the back we can also
see that the monitor features 2 HDMI
ports and a single DisplayPort
for some reason you are a gamer out
there who doesn't have a set of speakers
the um 67 - P has two seven watt
speakers located in the front of the
monitor so you get stereo sound it's
seven watts it can be pretty loud the um
67 also features freesync technology
from AMD now if you don't know what that
is basically what this does is there's a
difference but sometimes between the
refresh rate of your video card and the
refresh rate of your monitor that adds
screen tearing you'll see that on the
monitor with this type of technology it
eliminates it all together now I gotta
say something really kind of stranger
though I wish that AMD and NVIDIA would
get on the same page because it seems
kind of census to me that if I want to
have this feature with an AMD card I got
to buy one monitor and if I want to have
an Nvidia card I gotta buy complete
other monitor this has nothing to Attell
G but I'm just saying Nvidia ATI you
guys really need to get your
together and quit this pissing match and
get together I only have to buy one
monitor for my gaming needs and use any
video card I want so let's get rid of so
let's get rid of g-sync let's get rid of
freesync
and let's just have sync I'd say in sync
but that's that boyband embarrassing all
together alright moving on
view 167 also features dynamic sync now
what is this well this is basically it
helps those gamers throughout they're
getting that headshot it allows your
mouth to smoother transition onto the
screen so you'll actually have you know
smoother gameplay trying to take that
headshot and get it and be more accurate
so that's a pretty cool feature you also
get the black stabilizer feature now
what this does is sometimes you're
playing a game you get into a dark area
of the game you can't actually see the
characters making it a real pain in the
butt to kill them or actually getting
killed by them in return so this allows
you to actually see the characters much
better changing the way that you view it
in dark areas the UM 67p also has game
mode which features four different
settings gamer for personal
customization FPS mode one for optimal
scanning and brighter daytime settings
and FPS mode two for effectively
surveilling in darker nighttime settings
there's also RTS for realtime strategy
games such as Starcraft 2 Warcraft and
League of
one of the biggest disadvantages of LED
monitors back in the day when they first
came out especially for guys who did art
was RGB calibration because think about
it if you're doing Photoshop and you're
printing stuff out the color has to be
right otherwise it's gonna come out
wrong and you go to print it
now this monitor features 99 effective
RGB which means you can pretty much
color match your things almost to a
hundred percent this is great for people
out there who doing art people are doing
video and just people who need the color
to be matched productivity on the UM 67
is also pretty incredible because you
can split the screen into four ways
that's right I said that four different
screens at one time but I do have to
mention there are some caveats with this
one thing is the text is almost
unreadable on this monitor and I really
wasn't expecting that text to be all
that great since this thing's geared for
gaming and that's where it actually
really shines but still if you're a
person out there and you don't really
read in the text and you're just doing
colors and stuff like that having the
ability to open four windows at one time
can lead to a more productive day back
in the day flickering monitors gave
everybody and their brother a headache
now with their new flicker free
technology you can look at your monitor
and not have to worry about that
happening to save those headaches now as
far as gaming goes you guys can see that
this thing looks really incredible and
the fact that it's a widescreen monitor
means that your peripheral vision gets
much more in it so gaming is much more
intense and like I said before you can
put three of these monitors in
conjunction together making the most
insane widescreen experience one has
ever had with the 21:9 aspect ratio it
just looks incredible
so at the end of the day this monitor
comes to market at about six hundred and
forty nine dollars you can get it for
different prices we'll have a link down
below for you guys who are looking to
buy this thing for yourself now for
gaming this is actually a really
incredible monitor having that
widescreen 21 9 aspect ratio that's
really cool stuff now if you're looking
to surf the net you're looking to read
text and do stuff like that I know I'd
stay away from it just it's not even
really worth talking about as far as
that stuff goes but then really you know
the monitor doesn't come out and say hey
we're a you know
monitor for text it says gaming monitor
inside with gaming the colors all look
great you guys heard about all those
features there are all great things in
your gaming that black feature is really
cool because if you're like in a dark
area and someone's going to do a
headshot but coming around the corner a
lot of times you can't see that and
having that feature and being able to
see that person is really really cool I
think a lot of people are going to
actually like that particular feature
quite a bit especially when they're in
game the ability to have multi screens
open is also a very nice thing about
this monitor if you want to have
multitasking and doing multiple things
that work like four things at your same
time at work that's gonna be a pretty
cool thing for you I think people like
that aspect as well and for those people
who are going to use this monitor for
editing pictures and stuff the sRGB is
an excellent feature as is the
availability to do four screens at once
definitely have the ability to work on
four things at one time makes things
more speedier than doing one thing at
one time and that's a seriously good
feature about this monitor so folks that
pretty much covers everything about the
34 um 67 - P before I bounce out here
though let's take a little stroll and
play a little bit of the game I'm
actually gonna turn the speakers back on
and let you hear what it sounds like as
well as lets you see what it looks like
I know it's gonna be over my shoulder
but me just capturing the screen and
then putting it on the net is not the
same thing as it's gonna be the same
thing as your monitor the only way to
even really see the widescreen is for me
to do it this way so hey come on behind
me let's do some GTA 5
sorry to the steel brothers car but I
gotta do what I gotta do
he called me an asshole
son of a bitch
maybe we should find a hooker hooker
yeah yeah that's good mining looker
gotta be once on there
pulling out of here they're probably all
the hookers in the city but it can be
fun this game they do fun stuff
Oh somebody can't drive me that's so
funny
but you guys can see it widescreen
beauty it's really nice gaming on this
monitor is excellent I have to save
folks so what's that crash and fall out
of my car I'll see you guys later thanks
for watching take it tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
