probably at work on Oh what the I'd
rather be doing anything else but this
so with that said I thought I'd bring a
little tension relief to your day and
bring you something cool I'm Eric Farris
welcome back to tech of tomorrow and
today we're gonna continue in our
Monday's videos which is basically
battles of the Titan that's right here
on Monday we're gonna continue on with
our battles bringing you the Titan today
versus the sapphire toxic HD 7970 toxic
edition now this is a six gigabyte card
just like the Titan card Titan card six
gigabytes this one six gigabytes Titans
around $1000 this card's around $700 but
hey they're both single GPU so that
makes it a pretty fair little battle
there you know there's no dual GPUs no
sli no crossfire nothing going on there
just card versus card so it's a mano a
mano in the card astronomic that
who knows alright so anyways that said
you guys know I'm using the red dawn
back behind me it's a dual Xeon system
features dual 2660 processors I know
there is a slight bottleneck I'm saying
with these because they're only a 2.2
gigahertz you and there's two of them
but I'm still seeing a little bit of
bottle making with those other people
scores tend to be about 15 frames per
second more than mine okay whatever I
still like my system and so you know
I've got 80 gigabytes of RAM back there
dual kingston you can see them I hear
the HyperX SSDs right there those are
the 480 gigabyte ones using a PCIe card
from the people over at OC Z that's
inside the system you guys know about
that
so I mean pretty much is my Red Dawn
system and we're gonna show you guys
today half of the scores that we've ran
the other half we have in an article
over on our website but with that said
let's jump in right now and let's check
out some of the benchmarks as we play
the song the human zoo from me and John
Morrison the cameraman
hi folks so there you have it the
Sapphire HD 7970 gigahertz Edition six
gigabyte card that thing is doubly damn
good but it cannot keep up with the
Titan even though we're at it in its
belief limo there a couple different
modes you on the card we're and it's
lethal kick-ass supposingly mode but I
guess it wasn't that lethal because the
Titan gun Johnny yeah one so you guys
can see that
so head-to-head battle there is a three
hundred dollar difference though
obviously between the two cards the
Titan is 300 dollars more but it is win
it so far we see that the Titan is the
fastest single GPU card in the world now
I have heard that these two cards in SLI
will smoke over the Titan you know now
if you can get those things on sale for
about five hundred ninety-nine dollars a
piece you fear at the $1,200 range
versus a thousand dollar range so for
$200 more you can jump ahead but that's
the way the price game is thousand
dollars the Titan or you know you can
pay around 12 to 1000 dollars to get
yourself two of these cards which would
beat the type but for now the crown goes
out to the Titan and what we've seen it
kicks ass in every single game like I
said we showed you five of the games
here we also have additional screenshots
you have more shots of the card all
kinds of other stuff over on our website
so we hope that you guys would
appreciate us and you guys are first off
hit that like button hit it smack it
beat it
make sure you preciate the video and
then if you wouldn't mind going over and
checking out the article I know a lot of
people have to say if I wouldn't every
day I would let them buy a magazine well
you know you're not gonna sit in your
crapper and read my review unless you've
got some portable like you know stuff
reader up your phone you can probably do
that but I like the big screen so with
that said go over and check it out all
the details are in the link in
description below so you guys we want to
go over and do that I appreciate you
guys love you guys see you back in the
channel if you're not sub K what the
hell make sure you do because next
Monday we're gonna have more vowels with
the tight hmm - Titans vs whoo that's
right you'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
