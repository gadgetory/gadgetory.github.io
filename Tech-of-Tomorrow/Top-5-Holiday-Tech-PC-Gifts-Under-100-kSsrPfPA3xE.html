and this time we've got the top 5 tech
gifts for under a hundred bucks that's
right so if you've got a little bit
extra cash you can jump into these find
deals and these are base for the top
five I can find and they're actually
pretty cool so let's jump in and let's
check out these gifts for you so first
up we have a complete 2.1 speaker system
now this thing's by people over at a ver
media these guys make a whole lot of
speaker products this is the ballista
unity hmm palouse to unity but check
this out these things come with a
complete break out box and on the
breakout box we can see that on top is
the power on button then we have the
volume knob then we have a bass knob for
that in ham space then we have a
headphone a mic and a line out jack so
this way you can either listen to your
headphones you can run this thing
actually to a different set of speakers
and the ones you're having or you can
talk into it and as we flip the unit
around the back you can see there's a
mic out you have audio in speaker out
and another power on button why there's
two different power on buttons I don't
know but it's there you also get the
included sub woofer and a set of
satellite speakers and best of all this
thing is under a hundred bucks you can
have all these killer speakers there
black and red colors new people out
there doing that ferrario that asus
republic of gamer build or just a red
and black build these speakers are going
to be a nice addition to your system now
are these things like over-the-top super
high-end audio stuff no they're not
there's pretty much a nice set of mid
and speakers that sound really good and
are not pricey to break the bank so if
you're looking for something is pretty
cool right in the middle of the road and
won't break the bank but still sound
good check out these ever media's next
up I got this little round black ball
and no it's not that thing from phantasm
coming to kill you and pick your brains
out it's actually a bluetooth NFC
speaker from the people over at Sony now
on the top you guys can clearly see
through the unit that there's a speaker
there as we flip it around to the right
we have a mic you can actually talk into
this unit as well the power buttons
there as we flip it around to the bottom
you can see that you can power it on or
pair with another device and then last
but not least we have the volume control
now this unit is very very like I said
unobtrusive it's very small it'll fit
anywhere and pretty much no matter what
type of device you have it'll hook
up to it and give you sound so if you
like Sony and you're like cool
non-obtrusive then hey this is something
you want to check out okay now this next
one's for that person out there who just
has the massive amount of USB device
this is the anchor 13 KY reminds me that
movie Ocean's thirteen but no it's the
anchor 13 completely powered USB hub now
this thing's pretty killer man 13
connections it has a power plug right
here you connect to your computer you
plug the power into the wall and you're
up and going and with USB 3.0 you want
to make sure what this may things inside
of it you want it to be powered so they
can handle all that device to repeat
your electrical and get device failing
so the only thing about its kind of
crazy though is that to me a 13 s kind
of an unlucky number you know so is it
lucky 13 or unlucky 13 you tell me but
anyways anchor 13 13 points of USB 3.0
you okay so next up you like logitech
you like gaming mouses well then check
it out we've got the Daedalus G 303 now
this thing's pretty killer you can
program all the lighting inside of it
and it's actually pretty basic as well
there's two buttons on top a scroll
wheel a button for changing your dpi
which by the way you can get this up to
12,000 DPI which is quite a bit of
scrolling power and on the left hand
side you've got an additional two button
so all in all it's pretty simple but
still elegant and is a great price so if
you're a fan of logitech stuff the data
list might just be the mouse you're
looking for alright folks last but not
least everybody out there I know likes a
great set of cans now these ins right
here are from the people over at Patriot
these are their Viper series headphones
these things are pretty cool they offer
7.1 simulated audio so what that means
is that instead of having actually seven
speakers inside of there it actually
simulates the sound you also get a mic
which is right here on the side very
easy and these things are very nice and
comfortable on my head extremely
comfortable I got to say the pads on the
side offer really really nice you know
softness on your ears and stuff don't
cause any problems whatsoever and
they're also adjustable so fit in any
head size and on the left hand side of
the headphones where the mic is that you
actually get a couple different options
you can turn the mic on and off you've
got a volume control and at the top
you have your power button so all in all
these things are pretty ergonomic
they're really comfortable like I said
in your head they have a nice mic and
they sound really good so if you're
looking for a set of cans that won't
break the bank that are 7.1 simulated
which is great for gaming who needs a
true 7 but when it's kind of the same
thing anyways you're just trying to hear
the footsteps behind you in stuff in
gaming and so if these things do that
then they succeed so that's pretty much
it folks this was the top 5 of under 100
I just want to send a very special
thanks to the people over at braintree
