see you guys all back here once again on
tech of tomorrow we've got something
pretty cool for you AMD fans out there
now everybody who doesn't have a lot of
money is always looking for a killer
budget card
now when I say budget card for gaming
I'm thinking about a card that's under
$200 range cuz usually cards that are
under 100 bucks aren't geared towards
gaming incomes the Sapphire Radeon r7
265 a card price between $119 on $159
119 being the used price on an $59 being
the top you know you know new price that
we could find on Amazon so this is a
pretty well priced car it actually has a
lot of kick for the buck as well this
card has some nice features I think you
folks are gonna really like it and for
AMD fans you guys are really gonna want
to pay attention to this now you guys
all know back behind me I have the green
horror usually in the you guys videos
you guys ask a lot of questions about
that well we have a really cool guy from
design for Paragon who has kicked us
down these awesome cables because we're
gonna be changing everything out in
there we're gonna make me a custom
window we're gonna be gutting it out
painting everything making it match up
and well we got kicked some awesome
cables now hopefully these things will
fall around but all these cables match
the build now each one of these was
handmade I know you guys might want to
see each and every one of them but
they're all each actually individually
marked taped up what they are
individually and he measured every
single one of these to match the parts
that we gave him for the system which is
going to be really cool so we've got
stuff for two video cards the power
everything often this really cool guy
and I just wanted to give him special
thanks before we jumped into the video
so with that said though let's dig a
little bit deeper and let's see what the
r7 265 brings the table and why you are
going to want to check this thing out if
you want a card on a budget that games
as we first take a look at the card we
can see that it features a black and
silver color scheme and right on top we
can see two fans that clearly say dual X
this is totally sapphires type of
technology they have the proprietary
rights for dual like stuff hence the
named as we go and we look along the
side of the car we can see a single heat
pipe radiating out from underneath there
as well as a few components and then
down below that we can see the PCIe now
as far as the size of the card the card
size in it 228
by 109 by 35 millimeters we'll also have
this translator 2 inches for those folks
who use that measure requirement the
card features a 900 megahertz core clock
with a boost clock of the 925 megahertz
the card is also made on the 28
nanometer chip and features 2024 stream
processors it features 2 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory and a 256-bit memory
interface with a 50 600 megahertz
effective memory bandwidth the card also
is based on a 2 slot design and requires
a single 6 pin power connector to power
the card as we spend the card around we
take a look at basically the rear end of
the card we can see in the right hand
side is that single 6 pin power
connector I spoke of a second ago and to
the left of that we can see where the
power is being provided for the two fans
on top via that fan connector right
there as we spin around to the side of
the card we can clearly see the sapphire
logo a few more of the components in
there as well as you guys can see all of
the heat pins and everything and then
once again we see the heat pipe reading
out again off the side as we flip the
card around to the backside we can see
they use an entirely black PCB and there
is a single crossfire connector to do a
crossfire connection as far as there are
out goes we see a single dvi-i and a
single DVID connection as well as a
single HDMI and single DisplayPort
connection for those users looking to
use multi monitor technology via I
affinity 2.0 this card supports up to 3
monitors and if you use this technology
you can get resolutions up to 4k if
using just the DVI ports alone you get a
maximum resolution of 2560 by 1600 at 60
Hertz now that we've seen the specs we
know what the cards about let's jump in
now to the benchmark song and let's see
how this card actually
all right folks so there you guys have
it the AMD radeon sapphire version of
the r7 265 in all its glory now this
thing not only has a lot of power it
doesn't run very hot either under idle
it was running it 34 Celsius and under
full load 59 Celsius so this thing runs
pretty cool
AMD fans out there gonna be particularly
interesting this card especially if
you're looking to build a system that's
not gonna break the bank and still give
you guys a lot of power like I said
previously in the beginning of the video
this car can come to market at as low as
one hundred and nineteen dollars used
I've seen online and up to one hundred
and fifty nine dollars we'll have all
the links and everything down below like
button which hope you guys like this
video you guys will hit we'll have all
the information about this cards if you
guys are looking to buy one or just any
more information about it we'll have all
that down there below also a lot of you
guys know we've been trying to get a
hold of AMD for a long time to try to
get a support and it's been kind of a
treacherous road because we just really
can't get too much responses so I want
to ask a favor of you guys fans you guys
always want to see stuff on our channel
about AMD so if you guys want to help us
out
you guys can contact Roy Taylor and AMD
comm send that guy a message all you
have to put in the hashtag is pretty
much as hey give tech a tomorrow some
support so this guy knows you the fans
want to see the stuff here if AMD sees
that you the fans want to see more of
that stuff here then obviously they're
going to give us better support as it is
right now we can't even really get
driver support that's right it's that
bad we've emailed them hundreds of times
we've contacted them by phone no
response now I don't know really what's
going on there I don't want to kick aim
to your saying anything bad but
something Funky's happening somewhere so
you as the fans can help us out by
contacting AMD and reaching out and
saying hey support tech of tomorrow so
I'm Elric thanks for watching I hope you
guys like this card and I hope you guys
like the video we'll see you guys back
here on tech of tomorrow for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
