TECA tomorrow we're bringing you all the
tech all the frack in time what's in the
tech table today
SteelSeries 9h gaming headphones now
these things are 200 bucks but these
things are pretty bad ass for one thing
they're seven point one they're totally
cover your ears their sound cancelling
they come with their own sound card
that's right 7.1 USB sound card comes
included with it so if you have some
crappy sound card or don't want to use
the standard USB this one comes with a
really good USB sound card right in a
little thing you stick in your thing and
up and go but let's stop talking let's
jump in and let's check out what the 9h
is all about from SteelSeries alright
folks so here we have the Box lying out
in front of us
SteelSeries 9h gaming headset now one
thing interesting though works with Mac
Windows iOS and Android so basically
will work with anything you want
whatsoever that means you can plug this
thing into your Mac go plug in your PC
use whatever the heck you want go on the
road premium tournament gaming headsets
scats premium deck category
turn nullus whatever the heck that means
it's still serious you know what take it
means mean the same thing on the side of
the box nothing just shows the
microphone which we're going to talk
about which actually tracks nicely in
there which is very very interesting
let's real quickly chap around at the
top here because they have these things
that are an association with other world
champion professional gaming teams the
native the Nonie's or what is that
not as then Siri then we got the ninjas
in pyjamas those guys sound like tuff
motherfrakkers the tyloo and the fnatic
all their rock and roll others none of
the box basically the same thing here is
the back where it says winning is
everything steel series I inch gaming
head that supports Dolby Pro Logic 7.1
has it's own audio mic compression you
guys are always wanting to talk about
the mic oh I guarantee the mic on this
one is going to
because it has all but sewn stuff that's
geared towards that specifically so this
thing supposed to have increased clarity
here is the USB connection and the 3.5
millimeter you get both so if you have a
really good sound card and you don't
want to use the USB sound card you don't
have to use it that's enough of that
folks so I got my trusty little knife
here kind of little cool little ninja
star knife here
make a cut little insertion here yeah I
snare another one right here
that will do cut through there we go pop
that little thing there
kagome kagome kagome are we got a little
free-floating thing here free floating
free phone to throw at the damn camera
man that's how free floating it is pull
these headphones out you guys haven't
seen that in a while that's right
because we have mr. Jesus tech behind
the camera again
took a little hiatus but he is back so
there's nothing else in there we'll toss
that off the side too and look here's
the headphones look how beautiful they
are
so look design black is beautiful
alright just kidding this isn't it this
isn't it either in fact we got right off
the bat right here let's go ahead and
pull it out and check it out is but in
by doing by doing this my friends is the
USB soundcard
that's right believe it or not this is
all it in a little nutshell pretty
interesting little thing here then we've
got more cables adapters and such more
adapters 3.5 adapters adapters adapters
so basically all the plugs everything
you need in the drivers should be right
inside of here if there is any drivers I
don't think there isn't required doing
this whatsoever I believe it's just plug
and play there on a Mac and a PC so no
it's just basically a little will guide
here SteelSeries 9h get this stuff out
right so I know you guys really want to
see what's underneath the hood here so
here we go that knee for the doom
yay so here we go oh you know what
totally wrong on that folks I thought
that this part back here was the actual
sound car but this is just the
controller for it so my bad I'm going to
go back and address that real quick I
see that now
remember I've never seen this before
either until I just open it up so this
is basically the on and off switch the
volume control but not the sound card my
bad my apologies
here is the actual USB soundcard
download software here so basically you
do have to download software to use that
here's a lot of different plugs
SteelSeries USB sound card version 2
Dolby alright now
check these out now one thing I want to
say right off the bat folks is we tried
to find out what size the drivers were
in these and we couldn't actually find
them now I believe that they're going to
be 50 millimeter they look bigger than
40 millimeter but there was no
information available for that hopefully
by the time I get the review up for you
guys you'll be able to see it now very
very flexible you guys can see it like a
twisty little pretzel very flexible all
up inside of here all up inside of here
I said on ghetto now now all up inside
of here now to be some poet some shit
that's right to keep it soft alright but
there is it's all nice and padded inside
of there and these are very well padded
this is very very soft very subtle so
it's not going to be like making your
ears uncomfortable or anything else the
drivers underneath these little foam
things here so here on this side
we see the retractable microphone you
just take your thumb like this and you
can move that little bad boy out
and it's totally flexible to move to
wherever you need it to be here we see
the SteelSeries there are logos right
there on the side they're named rather
but
they're very nice I'm going to go ahead
and put them on my head okay folks I got
to be honest the amount I put these on
and felt like I was getting a massage
almost these things are so soft and
comfortable Wow yeah these are very very
nice they're not very heavy at all they
feel very comfortable on my ears right
here like I said it almost feels like a
massage it's just really really soft and
nice no hard edges nothing to be
uncomfortable at all the retractable
microphone like we said pulls in and out
can place it up by your microphone if
you don't want to be in the way
whatsoever you can just shove it back up
all the way in there I don't see these
things being uncomfortable at all for
long periods of time whatsoever they're
comfortable so basically folks it's you
know these headphones right here all
these goodies basically here in my hand
man and that's what comes in the box all
right folks
hope you guys like that like I said the
beginning of the video these headsets
are coming to the market at about a
hundred and ninety nine dollars you
might be able to find them on sale some
more out there if you guys interested in

the information for you folks to check
