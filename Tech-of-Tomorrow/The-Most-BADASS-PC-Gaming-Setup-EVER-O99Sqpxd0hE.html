news the hard news the tech news here on
tech of tomorrow I'm Alec your host and
on the for here is our chief
correspondent bud e-dawg that's right
you guys can see him taking a chill why
I do the hard news for you folks that's
right so what's up we'll check it out
man you guys all know that we had this
contest about a week back round you guys
all submit these cool desktop areas of
your area and some people thought it was
for money but it was never about that
whatsoever and I just want to start off
by saying thank you all those folks last
week due to the heat I've been kind of
sick all week long so I didn't get a lot
done I apologize it's my bad my lag hey
I'm sorry I will get that stuff up and
shows off but Before we jump to that
check this out this guy here that we
have found has the most badass ultimate
looking desktop area in the world now if
it was all about money
this guy would definitely be the winner
but I told you guys it wasn't about that
and this has nothing to do at all with
our contest this guy's out of that thing
but his is rockin I mean check out
these pics that we have this guy is a
badass system look at this man
all of everything is separated video
cards by a ribbon cable outside of the
motherboard hard drives
separated SSDs separated everything in
this room triple monitors check that out
three monitors set up computer basically
hanging from a wall looks like something
out of Star Trek or was it Skynet no I'm
just kidding it was Star Trek looking I
thought it was really cool so what do
you guys think you guys are always
looking for like the most badass and
ultimate well this guy obviously
spent a lot of time and a lot of effort
and we hear Tekken tomorrow give that
guy a solid thumbs up for all the energy
that he took in to the time to do this
now obviously this guy had the money to
do this and he spent a lot of time to do
it and we give him thumbs up for doing
that now if for some crazy reason you've
got a bunch of money to blow and you
want to emulate this guy and build it
check out the link down there below the
like
we have in the description all the parts
using this guy's build so if you want to
be a copycat and copy this guy's rad ass
 well then hey check it out all the
parts are down there so you can do so
you know what though be original make
your color blue don't copy em be red
make yours all blue right alright so
next up in the news Apple rumors now you
guys have all heard that they're trying
to expand into the bigger market four
point three to six inch phablet type
things these guys are working on but
they're rumored not to come out until
next year now there's also some other
story it's kind of interconnected with
that there's been rumors of the new
iPhone 5s now will the iPhone 5s
actually make adeb you or will we see
the iPhone 6 actually hit the market
that's kind of like what the little
grunge there is in between that right
now what is Apple going to do do you
know do you care I know some of my fans
do some of my fans don't now next up is
long in that same realm let's talk some
information about Samsung in the last
week samsung has released not only the
Galaxy gear but the Galaxy Note 3 specs
wise the gear is rocking a 1.6 inch 320
by 320 resolution screen with 4
gigabytes of storage and 800 megahertz
processor 1.9 megapixel camera as of now
it is only compatible with the Galaxy
Note 3 but software updates are coming
for the galaxy s4 and Note 2 so what's
up with pricing and availability well
this thing is coming to market at $299
and it'll be coming out on September
25th now do you guys think this is a bit
pricey and a little bit much for this
because I know that a lot of the things
people are trying to get are more
affordable so what do you guys think is
that too expensive or is it within your
range now as far as the Galaxy Note 3
goes it's rocking a 5.7 inch screen with
1080p resolution in the US and other
compatible LT markets the device will
feature a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 800 CPU paired with three
gigabytes of RAM the 3G only version the
smartphone however features an octa-core
Samsung Exynos processor clocked at 1.9
gigahertz so there are some small
differences they
we also get a 13 megapixel rear facing
camera and a front-facing 2.1 megapixel
camera both of which support full 1080p
video recording and amazingly enough in
the LTE version of this gadget the note
3 takes 4k video so what do you guys
think we've seen 4k TVs we've seen 4k
gaming on a Zeus's monitor now we're
going to have 4k recording so picture
that man just imagine the detail in that
you'll be able to see everything so
close-up it'll be realer than real so
that's it guys
those are all of today's stories like
usually we bring you guys a Sunday video
we have the deal of the day and this
time it is dirt 3 for under $7 now dirt
3 is actually a really incredible game
if you guys have ever played it but it
has lots of levels you can play all
kinds of different types of missions we
either build your character or just go
online and screw around play multiplayer
but it offers a lot of different things
I actually love that game I'm going to
be buying this myself because I don't
know what happened but somewhere along
the line when I was doing that stupid
damn Microsoft online thing I can't
figure out my account so my dirt3 game
won't let me save any of my so
I'm gonna guess buy me a new copy and
move forward so anyways like usual all
the information links to all these
stories everything will be down below
that like but which I know you know what
to do by now and that's about it if
you're not subbed make sure you do so
next week we got lots of interesting
stuff coming for you more stuff on that
95 90s coming and we also got this
little apex keyboard back behind me you
guys can check this out
this keyboards got lots of cool stuff
we'll be unboxing this bad boy tomorrow
so be on the lookout for that on Monday
morning I'm Elric I'm going with buddy
dog to the park and I'll see you back
here on the channel
