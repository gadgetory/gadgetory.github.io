daily I get many many companies
contacting me wanting me to show off
their product on the channel but
unfortunately a lot of these products
just don't fit they're like kitchen
knives and weight stuff and food stuff
and just stuff that really isn't tech
related and fits the channel but some
companies offer products I'm like hey
okay you know maybe my fans might want
to check these products out most of
these are by Chinese companies that you
normally don't hear about because
they're just getting started and rolling
the ball and you know building their
their name brand and all that stuff and
so most of these products in today's
video are from that category obviously
you guys are gonna know who Corsair is
but I believe the rest of these
companies I think two of them you
probably get to know you'll know HP and
you'll know what Corsair but the other
three companies you're probably not very
familiar with so let's jump right in and
let's check out this top five video of
five different products all for various
uses ranging from $20 all the way up to
almost $300 so let's check it out first
up we have a product by a company called
best egg we've actually worked with this
company before and their devices were
pretty well designed now this particular
device is we're looking at today this is
a smart plug you're going Elric a smart
plug what what do my homework do my
coffee no it's nothing like that
but what it will allow you to do is you
can plug it into any wall port and then
be able to control a device off of that
so you could plug in a lamp your coffee
pot whatever you want it to do you
download it install the home app
activate it and then it will control all
of those different products now one
thing that's really cool about this unit
is that it'll work with Google assistant
or to work with Alexa so if you have
either one of those things in your house
you don't have to worry about buying
additional equipment it will integrate
directly into that and the USB charging
ports are smart port so if it needs
additional electricity it'll charge it
really fast if it needs less it'll do it
all automatically and best of all this
product is only seventeen dollars so if
you're looking for something that's
really affordable really economical easy
to use and control as many devices as
you want
check out this smart plug next up we
have the an ADIZ prismatic mechanical
gaming keyboard now one thing you
you're gonna notice right off the bat
about this particular keyboard is that
it's very small and its size it's very
portable you can take anywhere you want
it can even work with different smart
devices so if you have your phone or
other stuff like that you can actually
hook it up to that device and use it so
not only does it work on your PC Mac
it'll also work with your phone or
tablet and that kind of stuff as well
now the Prismatic gaming keyboard has an
ultra-thin and light design featuring 67
keys with the latest calif white
switches if you're into RGB well the
prismatic gaming keyboard is RGB
overload it has multiple RGB custom
backlit modes 13 modes for RGB lighting
8 modes for side lighting and 5 modes
for customization the prismatic is also
very well built this RGB gaming keyboard
is constructed of metal alloy and abs
with plate mount and mechanical keys
which will stand up to tough gaming
conditions for years on end the bottom
line here is this if you're looking for
a keyboard that's mechanical and build
that a lasts a very long time has lots
of RGB features good tactile feel to the
keyboard and is under 60 bucks this is
definitely something you should be
checking out I feel that for the price
it's really well priced it's not in a
hundred dollar range it's not over a
hundred dollar range the fact that it's
portable and you can take it wherever
you want to go with you and does it take
up a lot of space that's pretty cool
it's well-built and like I said really
one of the most important features that
people really don't talk about it's a
tactile feel now each one of these keys
like I said features a different type of
switch technology but it's very easy on
the finger does not you're clicking and
clacking and doing all that it's
actually very very smooth and like I
said earlier best of all this keyboard
will also work Wireless through
Bluetooth or work wired through your PC
so you get the best of both worlds next
up we have the corsair hydra series h100
i pro now this is a 240 millimeter rad a
nice all in one compact design for a
hundred and nineteen dollars which some
pretty decent features now inside of the
block itself you get RGB so if you like
lighting and all that stuff you'll have
lighting now the fans
those aren't the kind that have RGB
lighting in it but you could easily
change them out to two different fans if
you wanted to and support that for this
particular product will also work with
pretty much any socket that's out there
in the current market right now so it
doesn't matter whether you have an AMD
system whether you have an Intel system
this particular product will work with
it the installation is also a breeze
it's almost just like the old school
ones that you just pop in and plug there
is a little bit of technical difficulty
in it but not enough to send anybody you
know screaming and pulling their hair
out it's very easy to install and the
fact that it's an all-in-one unit means
that you don't have to fill it up or do
anything like that
you pretty much just install it in your
system make sure it's working properly
and away you go now this is a brand new
product from the people over at course
there will be doing a build with this
particular product very soon in the
future but honestly for one hundred and
nineteen dollars this is a very
well-made product I'm sure with the
radiator being two hundred forty
millimeter dual rad it's going to work
really really well it's gonna keep your
CPU running well I know a lot of the
ones that just have you know a single
little fan of small rad those don't work
very well but this one should work just
in you know just basically perfect for
you it's not going to be able to get you
know crazy crazy overclocking like
you're doing ln2 and stuff like that but
it will keep your system running cooler
than the ambient temperature in your
house and that's pretty much what you
want to shoot for um you may not know
this but it's pretty hard to cool your
CPU down very much beyond the ambient
temperature in your home so if your
home's really really hot and you're
getting 10 you know degrees below the
ambient temperature then you're doing
very well so check this product out it
might be something you're looking for to
install on your PC now this next product
is from HP and no it's not one of their
printers I know many people have to go
oh my god ill Rick I can't stand HP
printers well this is not a printer this
is from HP but it's a digital photo
frame 10.1 inch screen 1280 by 800 and
the resolution it's completely Wi-Fi
which means you can hook it up to your
internal Wi-Fi in your house it's very
easy to change the pictures and stuff on
it's very you know ergonomic to use if
you're somebody who doesn't want to have
you know a bunch of solid pictures on
your wall and you do a lot
digital photography of your family this
particular product can be really nice
because you can set it up to just
basically show all of your pictures of
your family it'll show them you know
like pretty much like like a show you
put the pictures in it'll you know jog
through every single one of those
pictures and show all those different
pictures off that you want to show off
for your family and stuff so if you're a
person who does a lot of digital
photography you're looking for something
to pretty much show off all those photos
that you take this might be the perfect
product like I said it has a 10.1 inch
screen with a resolution of 1280 by 800
so your pictures are all going to be
nice and crisp and clear you can upload
them either from an SD card you can
upload them through the Wi-Fi so there
are a couple different options that you
can use to upload your pictures pretty
much if you have a wireless source or
you've got an SD card you can load any
amount of pictures that you want onto
this unit I don't really think that
you're going to run out of space for
pictures anytime soon internally this
photo frame has 8 gigabytes of storage
which is 20,000 photos now 20,000 photos
is a lot of photos but you can also put
music on here as well so you can listen
your music
watch your photos share all this stuff
with your family through the Wi-Fi all
in all a pretty good device like most
Wi-Fi devices this particular one also
has an app that you can download and use
to make things really easily now all the
pictures have a sixteen to ten aspect
ratio and this particular device also
features a touch panel which makes
interacting with the device very easy
and intuitive ok last but not least we
have the mini go smart robot vacuum
cleaner
no it's not that kind of robot and no
it's not gonna give you a danger Will
Robinson coal but still it's a pretty
nifty product and let's check it out
about now you're probably asking
yourself the same thing that I asked
myself when I got this product in what
exactly is a smart robot vacuum cleaner
I mean it can't do dishes that can't
have a conversation with you so what
makes it a smart vacuum cleaner well one
of the best things about this particular
model is that it features gyro
navigation and with this particular
product it can actually map 99.9% of
your house making it very very efficient
when doing the cleaning there's also
five cleaning modes we have auto clean
mode spot cleaning mode zigzag cleaning
mode edge cleaning mode and scheduled
cleaning mode for targeted cleaning now
what targeted cleaning means is that you
can actually program this particular
product to only clean a certain area so
if you have like your living room which
gets a lot of traffic you can actually
program this vacuum cleaner to everyday
vacuum that particular area of the house
now this particular cleaner can also run
for close to three hours per battery
charge and recharges up pretty quick as
well one thing I have to say about this
particular vacuum cleaner is that if you
have a giant house with really
SuperDuper thick carpet I don't really
think this is the puck that you're going
to be wanting to have it does have a
sweep mop robot for hair it works really
well on thin carpets and hard floors and
you can pretty much program it to do
whatever you want it to do cleaning up
my floors in the house all of the
hardwood floors and the floors in the
kitchen this thing does a really great
job of cleaning that up and it makes it
really easy to do plus it run ins if it
runs into something it bounces right off
it and just continues along its track
until it cleans that entire area and
like I said earlier you can map out all
of these areas with the device and you
can have it go wherever you want it to
go and clean exactly where you want it
to clean up now for a person who has a
small office or a small home this could
actually be the perfect product for you
it comes in the market at about two
hundred and forty nine dollars it's kind
of the most expensive item onto
a list of products but it also has a lot
of different options that for the
certain person this could be a great buy
now like I said I have a really big
house I have a lot of animals with a lot
of hair everywhere all the floor is like
you know thick shag carpet and for me
this particular device just doesn't make
sense because my house is so big that
I'd be changing you know the cleaning on
it constantly I mean you guys can see
this model is very small it's very
lightweight so there's not a lot of room
to store all the waste that you pick up
so for a house it's like a really big
house like mine you'd be changing that
all the time unlike a regular giant
vacuum cleaner that has you know much
more space for storing all that stuff in
it but like I said for small areas you
have thin carpet maybe just one pet not
a tons and tons of hair this might be
the perfect product for you you can
pretty much program it leave it alone
and it will vacuum wherever you want it
to vacuum whatever you want it to vacuum
first off before I bounce out of here I
want to give a special thanks to all the
companies that provide their products

these products get more information or

products actually fits your lifestyle
