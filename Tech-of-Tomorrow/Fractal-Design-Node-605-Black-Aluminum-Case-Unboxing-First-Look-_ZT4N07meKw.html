back once again to tech of tomorrow
where what will we bring you all the
tech all the dang time that's what we do
here now check out you guys all know
that we're trying to build our own type
of playstation 4 and we've gotten a
couple cases in consideration and the
one my fractal that really struck us the
most was the node 605 but we did a poll
people said oh that case is like really
too big for doing the playstation 4
build so instead we thought we were
going to use this Winstead for doing the
steam box type project so we're going to
make another system it's an htpc /type
steam box type thing that's bigger that
there's really no limitations on that we
can just make as bad as as possible for
the ultimate cool machine so with that
said let's go ahead and let's take the
node 605 out of the box let's take a
look at it this thing supposed to be
really cool suppose has some cool
scandinavian designs really interesting
you know smooth and sleek look so it's
going to look like a piece of furniture
or a piece of stereo equipment more than
just a computer case so with that said
let's jump in unbox this thing check out
the features and hey let's just get to
know the node 605 alright folks like any
good unboxing I know people want to see
the box so here is one side of the box
this one has some of the things about it
we are not going to flip it to the other
side right here this has all the
features which I'll be talking about in
depth as we take it out of the box so
you guys can check it out well flip it
around the other side of the box give
you guys full box unboxing flip it
around show you guys the left side then
I'll have the cabin just readjust up
here on the top where I'm going to take
this little trusty knife right here the
old fat man night
you can insertion right here go ahead
and pop the cap right here pop it
alrighty then the slam to slam so inside
you guys can see let me get this thing
over here for you folks so you can see
everything nice and well packed inside
so no damage from shipping everything so
if you order this you know it's coming
in the mail you know it's not going to
get screwed up that's always a good
thing so we just flip this over once
she'll just get everything out of here
there we go slight little bang one box
for the right the Cameron Cameron
prepare thyself oh alright good catch
this guys getting better and better
every day so they take the sides off
hang out one side under the rock era oh
man missed him by well you know what I'm
saying more oh she got in that time no
dodging that what about this right now
yes that's part of this unboxing hi
let's go ahead now you can see it's
covered completely in plastic by the way
so now we're go ahead take this to the
side right here you shall go ahead and
take it out look at that how nice that
is ok so prob the bat I think we'll talk
about the accessory pack so I'm going to
move that out of the way here we go grab
the bat we have the fat design node 605
accessory kit now this thing contains
nine motherboard standoffs 13
motherboard and psu screw 16 HDD screws
16 SSD screws for fans Kris proximal
fans five cable ties one on Ed bracket
therefore I need skis force great
learning practices it's all right here
in the back of the box in case you
missed it alright let's try the weight
then we also have right here the node
605 computer case manual and guide it's
your guide to the stars take a tour of
the case via the manual that's right
rtfm always a good thing remember that
all right after that let's go ahead and
let's take the case let's put on the
table let's remove the plastic siding
and now let's talk about the features of
the case alright folks so now we have
the case out of the box
the node 605 everybody so check it out
we're going to start off by measuring
here in the front from the ground up and
we can see that this case is six and
three-quarter inches high now let's see
the depth the depth is 13 and a quarter
inches and the width is lastly but not
leastly 17 and a quarter inches and like
usual like I said well have always
translated in millimeters for you folks
so that's the size always important now
let's start out right in the front of
the case you guys can see that this
thing's totally sleek it's like
basically like one of the things you saw
in the two thousand the cool really like
nifty stereo units you guys can see
there's a power button right over here
to the right power buttons right here
now the scene unit that you can use in
here it's geared to use the like ones
using kind of laptops little mini ones
so if you're going to use something
that's going to be practical you want to
find that now I've heard that it will
take a regular CD drive but then you
won't be able to use full size ATX
motherboards this thing will support
most Louis now let's flip down show you
guys the front alright folks now that
we've pup little thing down here you
guys can see this nice and hit if you
want it move it out we've got the
slimline CD right there moving over
we've got firewire we've got headphone
and we've got microphone two USB 3.0 and
we have card reader all here on the
front of the case as well as like I said
before the power button so now I don't
just a little bit different here let's
flip it around and let's take a look at
the bottom of the unit now just like I
said you guys have seen nice stereo
equipment you see the same type of feet
on those type of units so this thing is
really geared to be not only a PC
component but a high-end electronic
device you know I mean something really
really cool all right folks is now we
continue our tour the outside of the
node 605 let's take a look at fan
availability now we see right here
there's a fan selector switch has three
positions did we see 1 2 i'm going to
flip it around the other side
3 4 120 millimeter fans that can be put
in there's actually two that I saw
inside there we'll get to that in just a
second and then in the very back into
this little bit it'll move to more right
here then we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 open
slots that's for all of your
upgradeability and here's your power
supplies are going to go right here and
with that said now I'm going to remove
the top couple screws right here I've
gone ahead and loosen these a second to
go to make it easier for me after that
we should just be able to pop the top
off here and we do and also inside we
can see the sound dampening material
this will help keep the system running
very cool and quiet they use this on a
lot of their define series cases so this
is really cool stuff I like when a case
runs very silent so we'll step that off
to the side and then let's flip this
thing up onto its side and let's take a
look on the inside inside over here it's
kind of hard to say i'm tryna get the
camera to zoom in here like i said that
thing has two hundred twenty millimeter
fans inside of here here's one right
here and i'm going to move the case
around the other side and you actually
can't see I don't think very well I
don't know if the camera can even get in
there but you know what maybe i can get
you to see it let me see here so i'm
going to go ahead i remove those two
screws i'm going to remove this right
here keep this out of here now this
right here are where your drive bays and
stuff are going to go into the
accessories in that little box we talked
about before there's two of these in the
fan is actually blowing across these now
you guys can almost see the fan so let's
just go ahead and keep taking this out
so then I kind of the cameramen bring
this really close up for you folks so we
can take a closer look at everything set
this off to the side now maybe the
Cameron you can really zoom inside here
now right off the bat you guys can see
here's that fan I was talking about
and now inside the case last but not
least here is the entire wiring harness
now i'm not going to disassemble this
thing completely for you folks but let
me go ahead and take visit tie off so
you guys can get a better look at
Cameron can actually get the camera in
there so here basically folks is the
entire wiring harness so you guys can
see all that like I said before inside
you guys can also see this will take
pretty much any size motherboard and
that's for some reason you want to use a
CD player and you guys can see there's
this little thing over here this is
where the rear I of your motherboard is
going to go so your motherboard's going
to sit in here uriah is going to be
right there power supply mounted right
here now they spoke of using a full-size
CD player in this I don't really see how
that's going to be possible I think the
camera can zoom in there but you guys
can see right here but I don't see how
that's really going to be possible I
guess maybe if they mean that you're
going to mount a big giant one inside of
here I guess you could do that by taking
the front panel off but looks like the
mini 0 DD one's a you're gonna be the
best thing that I can do alright so hey
there you guys have it fractal designs
node 605 like I said the very beginning
video you guys can see this thing is
very elegant looks kind of like a piece
of furniture or like a stereo unit
doesn't really look so much like a PC
case you know because it was usually
standing you know straight up and down
now for we're going to use this for it's
going to be really cool it has great
front connectors so what I want to use
my xbox 360 wireless controller I can
hook that up my wireless keyboard all
the connections are right on the front
the little things about it that kind of
electricity out a little bit is because
the fact that it has to use a very very
tiny you know slim drawer type of DVD or
CD player that I wish I could use a
regular size minh and you know large
board but some sacrifices must be made
but there you guys have it folks this
thing's coming to market at about 200
bucks so look in the description below
where you guys can check out where to
buy this thing it's your choice also
hope you guys like this video make sure

not subscribed hey make sure you do so
