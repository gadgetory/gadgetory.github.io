tech of tomorrow I'm Howard Faris your
host and today we're going to be taking
a look at the new speed our accel
mousepad by the people over at
coolermaster now I just want to say that
it's rumoured that if you use this mouse
pad you get right off the bat all of the
hot bitches from you also are gonna get
the awesome and latest automobiles have
the coolest computers and wealth beyond
dreams
alright well probably it's not going to
do all that anyways we just let it be
some funny isn't it they're throwing
there anyways for your folks
so anyways check out this is a very very
large mousepad it's gonna be very thick
neoprene rubber and it's really made for
a very large gaming service so let me go
ahead right now I'm going to pop it out
of the box about the Box put on the box
you guys take a look at I'm in first I'm
gonna look at it and you know telling
truth the doc is going blind I had to go
get glasses a lot of times like I knew
you guys complained sometimes about
dough
he doesn't know a proxy in truthless
sometimes man I can't read it I might to
get some glasses or some bionics so
check it out on the side here I'll let
you read it since you don't like me
reading it I'm gonna bring this up at
the Cameron so that you can read this
yourself so I'll probably gives you guys
enough time right there now here on the
other side right here it has the
dimensions
it says surface type is a dura cloth
dimensions are 450 by 360 by five
millimeters base is 100% natural rubber
so once again I'll let you guys read the
features section right there okay so
that's pretty much it folks
so it's the box basically the front of
it one more time just for those folks
who may have missed it in case you were
away at that exact moment in time and
space and you couldn't get a hold of
Doctor Who to bring you back in that
case alright let's bring it over I'm at
the Cameron shift angles now and bring
it over to the desktop for will actually
pull the thing out of the box so let's
move over here alright folks so part two
here we're gonna basically take out the
old knife this one was very fast it's
going to go ahead and make an incision
here very nice and easy then I will
carefully put the knife away and then
stab the camera with night clothes oh
right
he didn't like that he's giving me dirty
looks folks don't worry I'm taller than
he is alright so here we go gonna pull
this thing out of the box it rolls out
you guys can see the top has a very very
smooth cloth feel to it now the surface
of the entire mousepad on the top is
very smooth all the way you guys can see
it's very very large a lot of people
like that because it gives them lots of
area to put their hand on it and do it
some people like smaller ones it just
depends on what your taste is you can
see right down here see him store my
coolermaster and folks there is one
thing I want to definitely say you know
sometimes you open a box and something
has a smell this thing definitely has a
smell can you smell it Jesus mm-hmm
there's just something there it's like a
really strong rubber smell it's kind of
trippy about it so let's flip it around
here's the rubber bottom tab almost
looks like you know the stuff inside
your bathroom sticks to the floor it's
wet
don't try it with this though and listen
you want to make some crazy ass video
but that's it so you guys can see the
top in the bottom and basically if you
want to take it with you you just
re-roll it back up again and some people
out there asked for me to do not only
unboxing videos they asked me to do rhe
boxing videos so you guys asked for the
Reebok Seng video so here we go here's
the box it is now inserted back in the
box I closed it it's back inside the box
I will have the cam and refocus back in
on me so there you have it folks an all
in one video both the unboxing and
Reebok Singh of the new speed rxl from
the people over at coolermaster we'll
see you guys back here tomorrow on
