the Monday night edition of tech o
tomorrow that's right why there's no
we've still got shizen going on over
here on the channel so what's going on
right now we'll check it out we've got
some cool news stories and also a prawn
video this really cool new direct Cu
minicar from people over at a suit so
what's up well right off the bat we've
heard that three new processors are
gonna be released for the Ivy Bridge - e
platform that's right now these things
are supposed to be released in September
and they are going to be the new
high-end desktop CBO that means they're
going to be quite costly and they're
also going to be very very powerful so
let's jump in right now and let's check
out what's coming out the new Ivy
bridge-e CPUs are based off the 22
nanometer lithography and our dice rank
off the sandy bridge-e processors now
we're seeing three of them that are
going to be coming to market first CPU
is the core i7 49 60 X it has a base
clock of 3.6 gigahertz and as a turbo
boost of 4.0 next is the core i7 it also
has six cores and twelve threads and
this is the core i7 49 30k base clock of
3.4 gigahertz a turbo boost of 3.9
gigahertz last up is the core i7
48:20 now this has 4 cores 8 threads has
a base clock of 3.7 gigahertz and a
boost clock of 3.9 gigahertz now these
CPUs are all geared for those people who
want the absolute most in their platform
like the sandy bridge-e before them
these things are going to be the CPUs
that everybody is using all those
top-of-the-line killer high-end systems
for just the average gamer and stuff
you're not gonna really need to actually
use these processors but if you're
somebody who really does a lot of
multitasking gaming and everything else
then you're probably really looking
forward to these rumor has it that there
are about 10 to 50 percent faster than
the previous generation CPUs that were
released so if you guys want to see the
full article on this check out the road
map and all the rest that stuff that'll
be over on our web site
www.kpbs.org/news/evening
marcom alright so what's next let's keep
it going on CPU since we've got that on
the plate everybody knows that Haswell
is coming out just right around the
corner the launch it'll be here in
everybody you'll get their hands on the
new as well now check it out there's
been aside out there
osya holics that has released
information saying that they've been
able to overclock the CPU to 5.0
gigahertz using only 0.9 volts now I'm
gonna say this right the bad I wrote the
article and everything about it but me
personally I don't really think this is
going to happen from what I've seen from
working with others and from working
with JJ on some of the videos that are
coming out in the future 4.6 24.7 seem
to be like a kind of stable area but
what that was a you know at a much
higher voltage so for me personally I
think this is probably bs+ in the
article they have hyper-threading
disabled so if you're really being a
true overclocking then you know I don't
know disabling hyper threading for me
just to get a score the CPU is not
getting the best performance so I'm not
down with that so either way the
articles over there on our site WWE Tech
you tomorrow comm used to check it out
see what they have they have a little
screenshot of their I don't think it's
really possible I think that 5.0 will be
able to be hit on a lot of Haswell CPUs
but you're gonna have to have much more
increased voltage probably more like
around 1.4 volts if you're talking about
5.0 gigahertz and that's what's really
adequate cooling because of that it it's
fry time and we ain't talking fish so
check it out
next up prawn video brand new product
from the people over at asu's this is
their new GeForce GTX 670 Direct see you
mini that's right so I've got the card
right here in my hand but let's jump in

going in some system I've got them I
make really really small to take
advantage of its minion as' like mini me

of the regular card but a little bite
size many things so what's up

pretty much a lot like a 690 in a matrix
so they're gonna have it it seems like
the new gtx 7 7 and 780 as far as
reference cards go are gonna look pretty
much like we've seen in the past now we
all know people like a soos gigabyte all
those type of folks you know even EVGA
out there may you know make some
aftermarket type stuff to make the card
run much cooler and much more awesome
because the clew of the card runs the
