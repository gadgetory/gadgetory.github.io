tikka tomorrow we're bringing you all
the tech all the time and today is the
Sunday edition now I know some people
out there weren't totally music but I
spent a few days at the NAMM show and I
thought was pretty damn fun post an
article on it not too many people seem
like they're really into that kind of
stuff so I guess you guys out there my
fans aren't a biggest bunch of musicians
but oh well I had a good time
so anyways NVIDIA fans some good news
all around for you folks that's right
now I know it's been leaked and it's
been out for a while at Nvidia you know
it's possibly going to come out with a
black edition of the Titan card and also
a dual card gtx 790 so this thing is
pretty much been you know confirming
that's kind of a leak but these stories
been rotating around an Nvidia needs new
lifeblood in their lineup so you guys
know these cards are going to see the
light of day soon basically this GK's
chipset is on the end of its life
they've pushed it as far as they can so
these are good probably gonna be the
last cards we see in this lineup so few
folks out there who haven't heard
anything about this a lot of you guys
probably have but for those you who
haven't at all check out this
information down in the description
below like button we'll have the full
story over on our website now also next
up still in the Nvidia news new 750ti
coming out that's right now this 750 is
supposed to be the first based on the
Maxwell so this should be pretty
interesting stuff it's supposed to be a
car it's gonna be coming out around $200
and should be pretty interesting stuff
for those folks out there who are into
the whole Nvidia thing so if you're
Nvidia fan 2 great stories for you folks
right off the bat and all that
information like I said will be down in
the description where you guys can see
these full articles and check out the
information if you want to know more if
you already know about it then hey
thanks for watching anyways peace out we
love you but hey those are stories
they're for people who really like them
also more information is coming out now
about new stuff all the time now for
years people have been out there doing
this Bitcoin thing I'm going to publicly
admit that I feel kind of just that I
didn't do this earlier bunch of my
friends that were kids said hey man you
should get into this you should get into
this like I should have got into this I
should have done more with wearable tech
I know there's some things I'd kind of
like missed down but I'm gonna jump into
things but this thing I didn't do but
now bitcoins tigerdirect you can
actually go and buy your computer parts
with Bitcoin I mean what I mean come on
that is awesome
now I looked into this now and like if
you want to get into Bitcoin mining now
it's not like the old days you have to
actually go out and buy expensive
equipment there's like these cards you
guys are releasing they're like $2,000
to $10,000 to do this so if you're
willing to this Bitcoin thing and you
want to get into it more now it's
actually gonna cost you more Duckett's
than it ever has before because well
obviously it's caught on there's also
some stories out there about Bitcoin
mining versus a real money millionaire
or billionaire or something like that as
comparisons about that so obviously this
stuff is catched on so if there's
somebody out there who's spent years of
diligence hats off I salute you you can
now spend your money a tigerdirect and
get yourself some peace cards my man I
think that is awesome stuff also before
I bounce high to the Sun day lots of
cool deals on games lots of cheep cheep
cheep cheep cheep games I know you guys
like games and I know you like cheap so
cheap games when I say cheap games I
