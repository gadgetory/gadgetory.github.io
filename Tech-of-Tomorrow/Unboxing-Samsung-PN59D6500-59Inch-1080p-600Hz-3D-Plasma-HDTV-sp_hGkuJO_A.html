up let me go ahead and cut anyways maybe
me and Romero's sake here can get this
thing open with crack up you guys always
say their marriage looks Asian nah man
gay you know a border brother all right
Wow okay first of all we'll take out the
base this is the base for the TV it
comes inside there this says 59 60 and
64 ng TV metal base will work with all
those different TVs it's very solid very
nice-looking plexiglass thing there
Romero Sango set that over there so we
keep going let's see what else comes in
your way down here at the bottom
yeah okay here we go
way down the bottom got a little bag in
there we're gonna pull that out this has
the remote control
go ahead and pop the Heather I know I'm
kind of a little ways away from the
camera you guys have anybody any
close-up scenes of this right this
second but we can get those in the full
review but here's the remote obviously
it comes with the batteries to the
remote inside there as well
you've got batteries for the remote as
well as two little wire connection
things to manage your cable management
and then for those people who have old
school stuff we have the RGB red green
and blue I don't know if anybody's gonna
use anymore but somebody might now the
TV is Billy I would imagine so you also
get the manual in here you know all the
technical stuff that you're going to
need Ford the warranty all that stuff
Center including a cleaning cloth
actually there's a clean cloth right
here to clean the TV
so we've emerged just set these over
their back without of the way then we'll
come back and we'll actually get to the
meat of the matter the TV so let's see
here we're gonna do this I get mr. Brian
you'd better save it I'll grab a side of
it can't we do that I pulled mine wow
this thing's huge
what do you want to set it let's set it
down and move the box we show the
grounds with the longer alright guys
whoa so here we're going to go I'm going
to make this plastic screen off of here
this is that it's very thin only two
exes at then can you hold it up I got a
thing go ahead get the TV on to its base
thank you - we'll try a picture - what
about this plastic pieces right here I
think that's what it sits on isn't it
we're gonna find out here no this piece
has to be removed that's what I wrote
but I guess we're not gonna really good
today it what I will do is I will put
this thing around a couple times show
you guys it they're gonna take a little
bit more than that good for the
nightstand what you guys see how
thinness and the science when you smooth
at direkt a little bit more but you guys
see it's a giant really nice TV got this
TV for $1,500 it's a high-quality plasma
TV it's really heavy
even unboxing this thing was really hard
in a couple days I'll set this thing up
I'll show you guys a picture all the
features of it and why this is a pretty
cool TV I got this personally for myself
wasn't given to me as any gift I bought
this for money I'd save it for some
guitar gear and decide to just go with
something else so thanks for watching
