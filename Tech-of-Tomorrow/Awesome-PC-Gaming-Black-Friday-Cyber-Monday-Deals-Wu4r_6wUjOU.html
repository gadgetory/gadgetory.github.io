gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of

out of here folks I just want to say a
couple things I know that some of these
prices may seem crazy but we actually
wouldn't looked at eBay and some other
places and a lot of these products are
actually selling for a lot more money in
other places so even though they may
seem like
just some off-brand Chinese stuff most
of stuff in the world is actually made
in China we don't see every single
solitary brand and that does not mean
that any of these products are bad in
any way but if you guys purchase these
things I definitely want to hear back
from you and hear where these products
were good or whether they were bad now
let's check out a product from the
people at Noma this is a Kickstarter
project that came out the really
interesting project now this is my hand
this is the Nomad you're like what the
heck is that thing well check it out
this is actually a 23 50 milli a power
charger that's a lightning cable
all-in-one and when you plug it in it
not only will charge your iPhone or any
other smart device that's in that you
know type of realm it will also charge
the battery so when you wake up the next
day after charging your phone all you do
is pick up the Nomad hop on the road and
boom you've got your phone charged and
you've got a battery with you at work or
on the road so you can recharge your
phone once again it's very lightweight
very easy to use Thurs base is just a
little turn on button right here and
that'll start to charge up your device
and then you can plug it in the wall and
charge both things at the same time so
it's actually a pretty interesting
product it has Black Friday pricing so
you guys can get this thing for a deal
and a few people out there that in the
iPhone world and love everything to do
with lightning winged guess what this
may be a device that might suit your
need
just great another Kickstarter project
that we came across is a company called
snap and we have two different versions
of their devices now the first is a
thing that covers your wall charger but
it's also a USB charger at the same time
so as you can see on the side of the
device is a USB hub you just plug this
into your wall plug your USB and you're
up and going pretty simple stuff right
now the other one offers a nightlight so
if you're like itll in a dark room or
whatever you can actually see where to
plug all your plugs and stuff in now for
the right person this can be an awesome
product like if you don't have any type
of USB charge or anything like that
you're in a dorm room or whatever but
you got a light socket well guess what
you instantly got yourself a USB charger
without any clutter do anything mess or
anything in the room in fact probably
most people don't even know what the
heck it is because they'll just be like
it's plugged into the wall and for those
people who you know can't see really
well and don't have a little well-lit
house but still want to be able to see
their plugs this might be a nifty device
as well both these kickstarter products
we showed you are on
sale for Black Friday and we'll have
links for those as well so there you
have it folks a bunch of different
products on sale to save you some money
from today through the 30th I'm elder
you've been watching Tekken tomorrow

week which includes lots of PC stuff
camera stuff all the good stuff that you
folks love until then all the
information about this will be down with
that like button hopefully we go Jackie
Chan style on that and we will see you
