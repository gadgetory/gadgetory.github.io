Faris here in the tech go tomorrow
channel coming you guys live from sunny
Southern California we're hopefully not
too many cars to come by well there goes
one right there because it's outdoors I
have no control of it but that said
we're going to look at product here this
is the you control you see a 202 now
this product is a USB interface that
allows you to connect two sets of
speakers you can use headphones it has
digital output and it's all connected to
the USB it works on both Mac and PC and
comes to market about $35 do you guys
like to pick one of these up yourself
take a look in the link in the
description below but basically what it
is is a product that if you're like are
having problems with your like product
like you can't get your sound to work or
whatever like a lot of people have this
thing they like the sound card or go out
or the chip will go out well this thing
will replace it and it's cool because if
you want to have decent sound or you
want to do digital speakers you can take
it wherever you want to go just plug
into your laptop plug it into your PC
plug it into your Mac whatever you want
and go this one's actually for our
cameraman guy because he actually I had
problems with his hackintosh we don't
know why but he longer had sound so we
give him this he plugs it in an off he
goes so let's take a look at this thing
it's 35 bucks and it's pretty good
because if you need something like this
it'll solve a lot of problems if you
don't it's worthless but you people out
there looking for something that's USB
cheap and easy to use well this
behringer product is it so let's unbox
this bad boy so here it is folks let's
show the Box to you control you see a
202 ultra low latency to in to out USB
audio interface with digital output
Barringer's are coming makes pro audio
stuff this is pretty cheap product for
them so I'm sure it'll probably work
pretty well here's the back of the box
you can see some of the connectivity
there
Riesling a suicide one more side I
brought out one of my trusty nice bring
it up here as you can hear it nice clear
camera click get back in the camera
range see here was a little cut there
outdoor unboxings are kind of weird guys
cuz I get nervous just like there's cars
driving by people walking by it kind of
gets wacky so here's the inside of the
box you control once again you can see
the USB connection the little box this
is the manual here's your USB cable
that's pretty much it so let me get this
stuff out of the way and I'll hand it
off the Cameron so we can do something
with it so now we're going to see the
actual product itself so I'll go ahead
and just remove this single plastic
piece that we have on here is a just
tries to zoom it in this gear angle and
all the speedy little cars keep going by
so let's check it out first let's let's
cool like this kaboom here's for your
speakers you connect up to a mixing
board to a set of speakers how everyone
to use it got a button right here that
button is for off on for monitor so
that's what this one is we'll flip it
around the front so you guys can see
that here's the off on monitor and the
off on botter button here's your USB
connectivity lets you know that it's
working now you get optical output so if
you happen to have a really cool set of
digital speakers you can just plug those
bad boys right in there got your
headphone jack right there and a volume
jack right here to control your volume
so for 35 bucks if you don't have any
audio and you need an audio interface
this is a lot cheaper than a lot of the
sound cards out there and pretty much
honestly most of the USB audio sounds
about the same they pretty much all use
the same kind of chips and everything
else so it's just a basic sound but
it'll work if you're editing videos just
want to hear some music you don't want
to deal with any problems just plug in
the behringer and you're off and going
so I'm Eric Ferris we'll see you guys
later here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
