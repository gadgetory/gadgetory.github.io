Southern California and for gamers the
day is even better we want to know why
we'll check it out nvidia has been doing
streaming gaming with their grid service
for a little while you guys out there
who own shield products you guys know
what I'm talking about the shields are
really cool handheld device you can
stream and operate all your games either
on the shield or through your TV by
operating it with the shield pretty cool
stuff now in the past the most that you
could stream your games at 1280 by 720
but now in video with their grid
services changing the playing field and
few people out that for some reason just
don't know what grid is will think steam
for NVIDIA because that's what it is but
now you're going to be able to do 1920 x
1080 streaming it's exciting right look
the dog decided so we're panning that's
excitement for him so that's really cool
stuff the thing is though there are a
few caveats with that though you have to
have at least a 30 megabit per second
connection on video themselves they
recommend 50 and I can see why because
streaming obviously takes a shitload of
bandwidth but just picture this now 1080
has become the standard for gaming so
before it was only offering at
seven-twenty thing we're kind of like
you know although behind the times so
you can say now in videos totally couple
of times because 1080 is the standard I
know there's some 4k out there and
people are using some widescreen stuff
but hey 1080 is the sweet spot
everything is geared to run
superintendence team all your games
doing videos grid at 1920 x 1080 so I'll
see you online next up you guys all know
that I'm into the smart home I had the
August smartlock and now this other
company out there called it Umi is
bringing it to a whole nother level I
think by now most people out there know
how to use a tablet are very familiar
with the tablet and the basic for this
whole thing is off this really simple to
use tablet and the whole thing around
this entire project is its simplicity
it's basically really just plug and play
and some things
won't even have to be plugged in to
match up with the system basically you
take this simple and easy-to-use tablet
take it up to the devices trying to use
and it will automatically match up with
it it'll create a dialog box which
you'll be able to use and then operate
that device they have cool things like a
light that plugs in and changes all
kinds of colors I mean this stuff's
really cool if you want to use like
another light in the socket you
basically remove the plug from that
socket plug in their device plug the
device into that and then automatically
it connects through the tablet and you
have full control also something really
cool I know everybody is lazy out there
and their couch potatoes with this
product you can totally operate and do
things in your TV you can cheat and
check out your stuff from netflix and
operated all from the easiness of your
living room chair I mean that's pretty
awesome stuff smart homes to me are the
way of the future Ivan wanted to really
get into it I think this is the first
product that's ever going to really
change the game so right now you can
pre-order the product and there's
actually three main packages when you
guys can save yourself some cash and get
your smart home on the go so check out
Umi on their IndieGoGo site and also
over on their website boo me home calm
next up in the hot news and this new is
actually quite devilish that's right the
people of RIT g.skill have now raised
the ceiling on ddr4 memory speeds you're
going to be able to now get your hands
on 3666 megahertz memory which is quite
delish ah so for those people out there
looking for super duper high speed
marrying the ddr4 round we'll check it
out G skills got it for you the new kit
comes with Intel XMP 2 point 0 support
as well so for those of you have an x 99
chipset you're in like Flynn next up in
the news a company with a weird name
this is pic stars or fixed stars i think
it's IE asleep but check this out these
people are going to have a six terabyte
SSD that's right I said it six terabytes
just imagine all the stuff you could
store on that thing so many people know
what I'm talking
out there lots and lots of storage now
obviously at six terabytes this thing's
not going to be cheap and no sir they're
figuring the price tag when this thing
drops in the market in between anywhere
between eighteen hundred and twenty four
hundred dollars now that's a lot of cash
but six terabytes an SSD that's a whole
hell of a lot of storage now as far as
speeds and feeds and all that stuff goes
we'll have to see when the product hits
the market but hey six terabytes like I
said is a lot of storage you'll be able
to store pretty much anything you want
and think about how many games you'll be
able it on there so gamers those who do
photos video editing for those people
out there hey this is gonna be something
you're going to want to check out
personally I don't think for that kind
of money I'm gonna be looking to get one
but somebody out there who's really in
the business of doing this and as the
cash you might want to check this out so
