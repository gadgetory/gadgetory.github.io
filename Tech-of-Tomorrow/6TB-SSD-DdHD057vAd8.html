Southern California and for gamers the
day is even better we want to know why
we'll check it out and Vidia has been
doing streaming gaming with their grid
service for a little while you guys out
there who own shield products you guys
know what I'm talking about the shields
are really cool handheld device but you
can stream and operate all your games
either on the shield or through your TV
by operating it with the shield pretty
cool stuff now in the past the most that
you could stream your games was at 1280
by 720 but now in video with their grid
services changing the playing field and
a few people out that for some reason
just don't know what grid is won't think
Steam for NVIDIA because that's what it
is but now you're gonna be able to do
1920 by 1080 streaming it's exciting
right look the dog decided so we're
panning that's excitement for him so
that's really cool stuff the thing is
though there are a few caveats with that
though you have to have at least a 30
megabit per second connection on video
in themselves they recommend 50 and I
can see why because streaming obviously
takes a shitload of bandwidth but just
picture this now 1080 has become the
standard for gaming so before it was
only offering at 720 they were kind of
like you know
although behind the times so you can say
now in videos totally couple of times
because 1080 is the standard I know
there's some for case out there and
people are using some widescreen stuff
but hey 1080 is the sweet spot
everything's geared to run
superintendence treem all your games
through Nvidia is grid at 1920 by 1080
so I'll see you online next up you guys
all know that I'm into the smart home I
had the August smart lock and now this
other company out there called Bhumi is
bringing it to a whole nother level I
think by now most people out there know
how to use a tablet are very familiar
with the tablet and the basic for this
whole thing is off this really simple to
use tablet and the whole thing around
this entire project is its simplicity
it's basically really just plug and play
and some things
even have to be plugged in to match up
with the system basically you take this
simple and easy to use tablet take it up
to the devices trying to use and it will
automatically match up with it it'll
create a dialog box which you'll be able
to use and then operate that device they
have cool things like a light that plugs
in and changes all kinds of colors I
mean this stuff's really cool if you
want to use like another light in a
socket you basically remove the plug
from that socket plug in there device
plug the device into that and then
automatically it connects through the
tablet and you have full control also
something really cool I know everybody's
lazy out there and their couch potatoes
with this product you can totally
operate and do things in your TV you can
cheat and check out your stuff for
Netflix and operated all from the
easiness of your living room chair I
mean that's pretty awesome stuff smart
homes to me are the way of the future
Ivan wanted to really get into it and I
think this is the first product that's
ever going to really change the game so
right now you can pre-order the product
and there's actually three main packages
where you guys can save yourself some
cash and get your smart home on the go
so check out ooh me on their IndieGoGo
site and also over on their website boom
ehome.com
next up in the hot news and this news is
actually quite devilish that's right the
people of rit TCL have now raised the
ceiling on ddr4 memory speeds you're
gonna be able to now get your hands on
three thousand six hundred and sixty six
megahertz memory which is quite so for
those people out there looking for super
duper high-speed memory in the ddr4
round will check it out
gee skills got it for you the new kit
comes with Intel XMP 2.0 support as well
so for those of you have an X 99 chipset
you're in like Flynn next up in the news
is a company with a weird name
this is fixed hours or fixed stars I
think it's is a hit but check this out
these people are gonna have a six
terabyte SSD that's right I said it six
terabytes just imagine all the stuff you
could store on that thing so many people
know what I'm talking about out there
lots and lots of
storage now obviously at 6 terabytes
this thing's not going to be cheap and
no sir they're figuring the price tag
when this thing drops in the market in
between anywhere between 1800 and 2400
dollars now that's a lot of cash but six
terabytes an SSD that's a whole hell of
a lot of storage now as far as speeds
and feeds and all that stuff goes we'll
have to see when the product hits the
market but hey six terabytes like I said
is a lot of storage you'll be able to
store pretty much anything you want and
think about how many games you'll be
able put on there so gamers those who do
photos video editing for those people
out there hey this is gonna be something
you're gonna want to check out
personally I don't think for that kind
of money I'm gonna be a little gonna get
one but somebody out there who's really
in the business of doing this and as the
cash you might want to check this out so
