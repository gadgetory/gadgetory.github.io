of tomorrow YouTube channel bringing you
tomorrow's technology today now what are
we gonna be looking at today you guys
all know Ivy Bridge right around the
corner very soon indeed today we're
gonna look at the MSI z77 a - GD 55 now
this is one of the introductory level of
your bridge motherboard that's coming
out this motherboard has a lot of new
features including their military class
3 hardware which is basically a
terminology they created for using
really good hardware in the motherboard
itself so that said let's jump in and
let's check out some of the features and
what comes in this box of the new MSI
z77 a - GD 55 motherboard
okay like all good unboxings we'll take
a look at the outside of the box first
now I don't know if you guys really
noticed a theme but everything seems to
be three this generation it's you know
we got the new PCI 3 PCI gen3 military
class 3 or 2 SATA 3 USB 3 everything is
on the threes so you guys see in the
further box supports the new 22
nanometer Ivy Bridge processors this is
their one second overclocking their
overclocking genie we'll take a look at
that the motherboard they got their
click BIOS to this is just basically UAF
BIOS you can click through let's turn
around let's take a look at the back of
the box back the box shows more their
features there dr. Moss - solid ferrite
choke hi-c cat and solid cat all
high-end Japanese components once again
we have the overclock in one second
booster overall system performance this
is the OC Genie 2 is basically just cook
a little button away you go they have
over here their supercharger this is for
plugging in all your stuff for us Beatle
charge it all up they have this Winky 3
right here what basically the Winky 3 is
is it is their own version of Linux
software that works through their stuff
actually works with their board
developed from them kind of crazy txx
true studio pro audio this is provided
by the real tech chipset they actually
show you the rear i/o here they talk
about gen 3 PCI stuff you guys all know
that's alga maining when I've your bitch
gets there so without any further ado
though let's take a look at what comes
inside the box the cat first so as we
pop the cap in the box we'll start off
showing you guys all the stuff that
comes in the box I'm gonna set it out
here one by one so starting off we'll
see right here we have the user's guide
that's the first thing comes in the box
then we have their software application
guide shows all their stuff once again
on there here's their certificate of
quality and stability this is basically
saying that their board is what it says
it is we've got the drivers manual it's
a beta you can see two SATA cables set
those down one SLI bridge here's a giant
unfolding thing I'm not gonna fold it
off this is basically an instruction
guide quick installation guide if you've
never actually had a PC before this is
your first build this could come in
handy
he gives you steps and installing your
CPU your memory even install into the
case so it's pretty much a pretty good
users guide right there
here are quick connect these are for our
front panel connectors here's the rear
i/o through and those is clearly labeled
everything says what it is clear CMOS
HDMI everything is well explained on
this so if you go in there to plug your
cables in you won't have to go or do I
plug in a kit tells you very clearly on
this rear i/o where to plug it in that
way to set that down now here is
something actually interesting a premium
release MSI Intel z77 blah blah blah
platforms overclocking guide so inside
of here they give you a bunch of
different things on overclocking these
I'm just trying to get this thing out or
so you guys in sealed kind of get it
back so we got that the BIOS
overclocking options then once finally
in the CPU core speed overclocking and
memory speed overclocking so this is
basically all the content all the camera
just shoot back down in the table real
quick you guys can see it now we'll get
this out of the way and let's take a
look at the heart of the matter the
motherboard ok so now we have the
motherboard go ahead and remove it from
its anti-static bag and I think I'm
gonna go ahead and just set it down the
table so let's start at the top of the
board we see right here they have their
OC Genie to their military class three
hardware this is their cooling solution
that's covering all the MOSFETs and
everything else as far as the CPU fans
go here on the very top of the board we
see one right here we see another one
here this is the OC Genie button right
here then you have your power and your
restart buttons right here these are all
great when you're testing on a test
bench I'm gonna go ahead and take this
little sticker off here
move over the ZIF socket here is our
memory this takes dual channel ddr3
it'll take up to 32 gigabytes and then
put back on the board let's talk a
little bit about the power connections
here's our first being right here this
is the 8 pin power connector located to
the left of the ZIF socket we have the
24 pin power we have another fan header
right here and then right here on the
board this is where you can check all of
your voltage
to get right in close up there this is
where you could just hook a bolt into
connector right here to this and read
your motherboard great for overclocking
or just testing the board and regulating
it pretty cool stuff put the board back
around again we have a giant sticker
coming all the stuff on here so I'm
gonna go ahead and remove this sticker
now and just take it man set it off to
the side somewhere as we start working
our way down the PCI slots so the top we
have one PCIe times one there's two more
of those three more of those so we have
one two three four PCIe 1x slots now
these slots will either run 16 16 8 or
they'll run 8 8 and 4 depending on how
you set them up on the motherboard so
you getting the thx audio right here
provided by the realtek chipset and move
back over across the board here we see
another little MSI thing this is doing
additional cooling and then let's pop
back up here and let's go take a look by
the ZIF socket now I'm gonna go ahead
and just remove all this stuff you guys
can see we actually have another fan
header here which is very close to the
ZIF socket now this is a socket we'll
take all the previous generation Sandy
Bridge processors and all the new Ivy
Bridge processors which are based off
the 20 nanometer process kind of flip
back down again take a look down the
side of the board we see right here our
USB 3.0 connector and now we're going to
get to a part of the board where I feel
the board is kind of lagging now this
board says that it has both Intel and as
many controllers on board but let me get
this sticker on here they put stickers
all over everything let's board I
actually find it kind of knowing because
you guys sit there and rub all the
plastic stuff off so let's check this
out though there are three SATA
connections SATA one and two these are
based off the SATA 3 the other two right
here are based off SATA 2 and there was
another SATA 6 gigabits and it was
supposed to be right here I believe this
would have been with the as media
controller but they've left it off the
board you guys can see there clearly the
chip is completely missing and it
flipped down go to the bottom of board
we have one two additional USB then we
have the I Triple E has some additional
ports over here including one more
system fan over here and our final audio
connections last but not least let's
take a look at the rear i/o right here
we have legacy ps2
and mouse combo port below that two USB
2.0 ports here's the reset seemed
awesome I try to get this up by the
Camerons you guys this closer a little
button right here as you can see that
pad let's keep the board up here here
right here is optical and it spit it out
now if you're on top we can see we have
two more USB 2.0 connectors and then
below that we have an HDMI connector now
this board has no display port at all I
find that disappointing is I use
DisplayPort monitors but some of you
that won't matter at all here right here
we see additional USB ports these are
the 3.0 variety we used to the rj45 LAN
I was reading the manual and it said
this thing support a lot of technology
for shotgun you know lan and that's just
not available here on the board so I
don't know what that's about but here we
see DVI standard VGA and then finally
your analog connections alright folks so
that's it this was the unboxing and
first features review of the new msi z77
a - GD 55 look for more reviews next
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
