now with Nick from a suit she's going to
show us something really interesting
there are new transformers tablet which
is supposed to be the talk of the town
Nick tell us what's this thing all about
I heard it actually transforms it does
so in our true transformer fashioned
kind of like on the notebooks and
laptops that you see how it disconnects
we have this 18.4 inch screen 1080p
resolution IPS display it is going to go
ahead and pop out so you can see the
transformer function it's got a nice
little handle right here along with a
little stand that you can adjust on
different angles so you can get it down
on the table top at the at the angle
that you'd like to have it also since
the tablet is Tegra 3 based we're going
to have android 4.1 point one jellybean
it's going to have about five hours
battery life when it's undocked and
we're also going to be able to remote
back to this pc base station to use the
windows 8 since these are based on core
i3 core i5 and core i7 based on the
configuration that you're going to have
so through splash point you're gonna be
able to row back in through direct Wi-Fi
connection as long as you're within
range so Nick are you saying there's a
processor built into the base depths of
the base you can think of as its own
computer so it's got hdmi out if you do
happen to take the android tablet away
out of this enmity connect a monitor to
it you still got a full computer out so
let me talk about this folks like I've
been talking about this actually four
years how you could take a small device
and then bring it back to your home and
make it into a more powerful device well
now with this you can obviously do that
since you can remove this take this
anywhere you want use it you've got the
power that's combined but the Tegra
built into this but if you want to go
back home and get more power you just
bring it back set it inside your base
and away you go with more power go ahead
at that blue button or
two windows it where's the old blue
button there right here so now you guys
can see it it's transformed into the
windows 8 we've got the little tile
screen here for those people who love it
goodbye there you go there you go now
what's this thing gonna be coming to
market at so this going to become in
March met around 1,200 bucks right on
all right man well thank you very much
Nick no probably the great show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
