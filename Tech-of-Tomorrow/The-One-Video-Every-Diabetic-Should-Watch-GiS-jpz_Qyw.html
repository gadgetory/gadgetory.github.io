world are diabetic and whether you're
type 1 or your type 2 one of the biggest
absolute drags about being a diabetic is
the fact that you're always having to go
through a bunch of steps trying to check
your blood and I'm going to talk to you
guys about something today that I feel
is pretty much the most life-changing
product that I have ever used there was
no money paid pretty by this company it
was paid for out of my pocket not even
through the insurance and before we jump
in and I tell you about this product
that has completely changed my life
let's hear a word from today's sponsor
best Tech the new best tech surge
protector power strip has eight outlets
and six USB ports allowing you to charge
up to 14 devices all at the same time
and with these six intelligent USB
charging ports they can automatically
deliver the optimal charging speed with
over 2.4 amps per port the best tech
power strip also switches off
automatically when it detects any kind
of short circuit overload or surges so
you don't have to worry about any
devices being damaged when something
happens the unique tower design gives
you more desktop space and also saves
you from any kind of cable clutter plus
it just kind of looks cool right so
check out the best tech power strip with
the link below all right so if you guys
are into that little plug we'll have a
link down below so like I said in the
very start at the beginning being a
diabetic in itself is really a pain in
the behind I'm just telling you it
really is you have to constantly monitor
your blood sugar constantly watch what
you eat you got to make sure that you
always are taking care of yourself and
one of the biggest things about it that
I could just never stand especially
being a person who plays guitar a lot is
the fact that there's all of these
procedures to do to check your blood you
know they give you this little answer
thing and it's got a poker in here and
you pretty much know you got to insert
the little poker in here put your top on
you know and then hopefully you know get
the setting that's right
between you know feeling like you're
stabbing yourself in the finger with a
dagger or not being able to get any
blood then
there's the test strip you know you got
to pull the test strip out put it in
your machine you know I've tried by the
way all kinds of different machines I
have a bunch of different kids you guys
can see there's a bunch of mer of tried
they're all pretty much the same but
getting your blood and then getting your
blood into the strip and getting into
the machine to work even that can
sometimes be a hassle because let's just
face it a lot of times it'll just give
you an error which means that you just
poked your finger you got your blood you
stuck it in the Machine and it goes boom
and gives you an error which means you
got to start all over again in fact I
was just at the supermarket the other
day and I was talking this girl about
her father and she was complaining over
and over again that her father hated the
exact same thing and so I reached out
online and I've been reaching out to
people I've been talking to him pretty
much everybody feels the same way this
finger poking stuff it just really sucks
and the big thing is you got to test
your blood before you eat you got to
test your blood after you eat and you
got to do it multiple times a day in
reality you could actually poke your
finger about six to seven times a day
think about that
would anybody really want to have that
in their life where that six or seven
times a day you're gonna have to poke
yourself in the finger and depending on
the medication you're gonna have to
actually probably give yourself some
shots so you got even more poking going
on so you got you know four different
types of shots you can give yourself two
types of fast-acting two types of normal
insulin that you might have to take
along with all this so just think about
that that's a lot of poking in your body
per day so just recently I got a new
prescription to get a new type of meter
and so I was looking online and my mom
brought something up about you know if
you hate doing it on your finger you
know why don't you try this new product
that's come out so let me just take this
stuff and just really just do what I
honestly think about it just because I'm
not using anymore I am done poking my
finger poking fingers that is all now
and this kids past it's all behind me
and I have to tell you it's really cool
I got this brand new product called a
Libre freestyle Libre Libre think it's
I'm saying it correctly and this thing
is completely different than any other
product
I've ever used in my life and it's
totally utterly cool I've had it now for
just a few days and I gotta tell you I'm
blown away
I was literally so thankful they're just
trying to say thanks I started crying
it's like wow I can't believe that I've
been poking my fingers all this time now
I tried to get this thing when it first
came out and this was months back and
the price on it was just so much that it
was just like wow it was like a couple
of hundred dollars a month just to
maintain the little packs and to get the
meter itself was like almost three or
four hundred dollars which was just
excessive but now the prices have lured
and we were actually able to get the
Libra the Libra freestyle for a hundred
and fifty dollars which is the meter and
one month's worth of the test thing now
instead of these stupid little test
strips like I threw off to the side the
Libre has a completely different system
it's one little leg pad and you use this
thing I probably should have waited and
done it but I wanted to get it on my arm
and what really happens is they want you
to put it on the back of your arm you
guys can see that I've got this and the
band itself there's only like three or
four dollars I bought it on Amazon I'll
make sure I have links for all this
stuff down below but basically my nurse
came over and anybody can do this the
only reason IRS's coming over so I got
that stupid a-hole hold him and hold my
foot and I got to deal with all that
minutia so she's here anyway so she
helped me do it so we basically let me
grab this little thing there's a little
charger that comes in it I charged up
the charger and then after the charger
was charged she put the little injector
pack in it now the needle in the ejected
pack I'm if you're a diabetic and you've
ever had the 50 mil needles it's pretty
much the exact same links about like
this long and so when she first stuck in
the back of my arm was like whoa okay
that was smarty Smarties and it hurt for
literally about maybe a minute min and a
half from that poke that goes in but
then no more pain no more poking at all
no more finger poking and I tried the
finger poking one and compared it to
this now the numbers on this seem to be
about two numbers higher than on the
ones that I'm poking my finger with and
that's okay by me because too little
number
if I'm bringing my blood sugar down you
know to those levels that's really not
that big of deal si you know 10 or 15
where you're gonna be taking in so it
amounts to making yourself get sick from
you know too much insulin it doesn't
happen whatsoever and it's amazingly
really simple
honnestly dumb stupid to use after you
put the sensor on so you put the sensor
on and then when you put the sensor on
you have to wait one hour because when
you first put it on it takes one hour I
guess to get in there and suck your
blood like a vampire till it gets the
meter and everything on there all sookie
sookie with your blood but then after
that you can check your blood a thousand
times a day literally a thousand times a
day
I mean it's so really dumb easy soon as
you push this little button on the front
of the meter right here you push it it
comes up with a little thing all I got
to do is go back here find it exactly
where it's at sometimes my shirt
sometimes my shirt I admit does get a
little bit in the way but all you got to
do is take it back and put it back here
and then you get a reading
1:03 not bad it actually went down even
from my last thing and here we can real
quick show you you know how really easy
it is when you turn it on if it gives
you an error message or anything all you
have to do is press this button and then
put the meter really close to where you
um have matter you have to recall where
you have the the spot where you put the
little pad on and it automatically gives
you the reading and this is just amazing
because just picture this you're at work
you're at a restaurant you're anywhere
where you're not in your home and you
don't really have access to sit around
and go poking your finger and doing all
this meter stuff I mean really you wanna
go in the bathroom at your work an
unfamiliar bathroom and go in there and
start poking your finger and doing all
the stuff you got to have alcohol swabs
to swap the area all this stuff it's
really a pain in the button with this it
doesn't really matter you could be out
with dinner with all your family friends
you could be at work and this is so
user-friendly that no one would even
notice you just turn it on simply and
then put it up to your arm and then
voila boom you get a reading and that's
great so if you have your diabetes
medicine on here you have your need
on you and your insulin if you are a
person who carries that around with you
I sometimes do depending on how long I'd
be away from home you have everything
you need we you just need to walk into
the bathroom and take your injections of
what you need and you're good to go
so I have to say this product for me is
a life changer because the biggest part
of my diabetes all along has been
maintaining my blood sugar because I
hate poking my finger and when you poke
your finger and if you're a diabetic out
there you know exactly what I mean if
you poke your finger multiple times
multiple times excuse me and you're
getting an error message over and over
and over and doing it it is so
frustrating for one you really really
want to know what your blood sugar is
you do you want to know it could be
life-threatening depending on how it is
especially I'm trying to heal my foot so
being frustrated and angry and getting
upset when all I'm trying to do is
follow my health routine it's just a
pain in the rear that nobody needs
honestly this product to me is the most
life-changing product that I've ever
received in my entire life mom thank you
so much once again for - for me I mean
it's really not that either expensive
anymore it's a hundred dollars for the
meter it was fifty dollars for a month
worth of stuff every 14 days all you do
is you pull off the armband and you
remove the little pad thing you put the
next one in and then you're good to go
and every 14 days you have to change it
out if you're a diabetic out there
you should definitely hear what I'm
saying and try this because it will
change your life it's simple it's easy
it's accurate and honestly I am so
thankful to this company in to my mom
for just bringing this product in my
life I've never made a video ever in my
life ever about a product that I
honestly felt so thankful about I have
tons of AM so I have all kinds of gear
and stuff that we buy and sell and that
we do for doing videos and all that
stuff but I've never ever bought a
product in my life that had the biggest
impact in a positive way on my life than
this particular product the free style
Libre it frickin rocks it has changed my
life and I know in the future it's going
to be probably the number one tool that
I have in my life for
maintaining my blood glucose levels
making sure that I have the right amount
of medication in my body and making sure
I never get those levels up so high that
I'm toxic or dangerous so this will be a
life changer so if you're a diabetic hey
I'll have a link down below of the band
and these products and seriously you
should check it out I don't really know
what else to say man people out there if
you're diabetic you know what I mean
you are the people out there this is
going to affect the absolute most I know
other people out there just like I work
what's up do with technology but hey it
is technology because for years the only
way that you could check your blood was
by poking your finger going through all
those stupid routines and dealing with
it now it's made simple it's made easy
it's made accurate I'm a very thankful
