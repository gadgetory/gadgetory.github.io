missed the night I brought him back
welcome back to the TECA tomorrow
YouTube channel I'm the Lord Ferris
I saw your comments on Ramirez thing now
be nice to him
he's my fellow guy he's not as crazy as
I am you know he's the same guy out of
the wild guy so here we go we've got an
unboxing today we're gonna look at an
all-in-one system by sapphire this is
the sapphire edge - this is the HD -
version this is the latest version this
is an all-in-one little computer that
features a 1.8 gigahertz dual-core atom
320 gigahertz processor 512 megabyte
Nvidia onboard graphics has land perfect
video output this is the perfect
all-in-one system for somebody who wants
something totally small all-in-one and
just search the internet and does checks
their email that type of stuff it'll
stream videos you can watch your Netflix
anything on it it's very small so today
let's go inside let's check out this
edge mini PC and see what comes inside
the box got my knife here go ahead and
take it here I'm gonna take a little cut
oh pardon the cut there we go look at
that nice yeah nice little chop chop
there I'm ready to go in here off the
side here go ahead and open it up
alright let's see here there's a little
tab right here up on top right here I'm
gonna go ahead and pop this little tab
right here and I'm gonna go ahead and
serve it on the table
cameras you got to refocus in this
general area around here we're gonna go
ahead and start off with I'm gonna start
with the unit itself so here's the unit
cabin you focus in over here yourself a
nice angle here for the people to see
alright so here's one side of it here's
another side of it
here's the other side of it very very
thin now one thing I'm gonna take note
of - right off the bat here now it said
that this came with Windows 7 now I'm
not gonna show you guys that again
hopefully don't really do that but this
actually does come with Windows 7 fully
engaged in the system now here's my hand
I have a pretty fair sized hand and this
unit is really no thicker and no bigger
than my hand it also comes with a visa
wall mount plate lots of connections
here on the back you can see VGA you got
your HDMI right there that's your LAN
you've got audio that's a little power
right here everything's right here nice
and easy access very small unit gonna go
ahead and set that down and the can man
can wrangle down to this angle down here
anyway started moving the rest of stuff
from the box now it does come with a CD
here I don't know why does that there's
no CD player included and the OS is
already in it but it still comes with it
maybe just in case you want a thermal
Drive comes a little sticker we've got
the sapphire Edge HD Mini PC series
quick installation guide this is the
second version by the way I'm just go
ahead and set this stuff in here so you
guys can get a nice look at it see we've
got cables right here we've got lots um
this is your HDMI to your DVI cable
that's right here
that's those people just want to use
their monitor we have the power cable
and the power brick those are gonna go
right here got all that stuff out there
then we also have an HDMI cable right
here nice stuff all together here gonna
pull the box back has camera got a nice
anglers are nice stuff to see and then
we also have a base for the unit if you
want to set this on your desk top
there's a base that way the unit can be
mounted just like this up on a base and
it considered your desk top about the
same size as a modem even smaller
actually or they have the new included
base the wall mount this makes it very
easy to use as well so now you can just
take this unit take it in here slide it
on this little controller and baboom
you're right
the wall so this is everything that
comes from the box like I said this unit
has a 320 gigabyte hard drive embedded
it's a SATA hard drive 7200 rpm also has
512 megabyte video card forelimb Vidya
it's kind of strange to see sapphire
working with Nvidia and Intel because
going to Intel Atom chipset but it's
actually good as well shows those guys
doing a lot of expandability so thanks
for watching the unboxing my name is
Erik Ferriss and I hope to see all of
you guys back here on the tech go
tomorrow channel very soon see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
