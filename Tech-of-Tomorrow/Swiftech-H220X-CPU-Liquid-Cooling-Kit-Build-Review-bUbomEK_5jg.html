episode of tech of tomorrow today we're
checking out the Swift tech HT 2 o X CPU
liquid cooling kit let's go the Swift
tech h2 - OH - an X CPU liquid cooling
kit is a really awesome all-in-one
cooling kit made by the people down at
Swift tech down in Long Beach California
now this thing features a dual radiator
like I said before it's an all-in-one
unit and the heatsink is really cool
because now you can change all the
colors to a bunch of different variants
which is really cool if you're somebody
looking to do a custom build now not
only is this thing closed loop but if
you want to change it out and do
different stuff with it and expand it it
can also do that as well it's a very
cool kit in that respect the unit
features a dual 120 millimeter copper
radiator and enthusiasts great pump and
water block both Swift Tech's powerful
MCP 30 pump and high-pressure helix fans
are PWM compliant devices allowing the
eight g2x to be recognized and speed
controlled by the motherboard depending
on CPU temperature just like a regular
cooling fan as a bonus the system also
includes their PWM splitter allowing
connections of up to eight PWM devices
which can then be controlled as a single
unit by the motherboard and since Swift
tech includes a really killer pictorial
installation guide setup could never be
easier like I said before the system can
be entirely customized thanks to easily
replaceable tubing and fittings due to
the powerful pump the unit can support
additional liquid cooled components such
as a graphics card and/or additional
radiators the factory fittings can now
be upgraded to any 1/4 of compatible
aftermarket fittings an optimal adapter
is needed for the pump outlet and is
available at Swift tech website this
will allow enthusiast users to upgrade
their system to 1/2 inch ID tubing if
they want to Swift tech once again has
geared their product to remain focused
on low kick inaudible operating noise
with extreme thermal performance as well
which means as things geared to work
very very well and still not bring a
bunch of noise into your system which is
really good because you wonder Susan be
something like
the entire time that you're using it now
for us we built a custom system totally
around this kit and we actually did
something that we've never done before
we made our first hardline system
this is our first we're gonna do more
but you guys can see right now this is
our very first system Anthea Reynolds
our in-house tech and our new guys well
eric henry worked together to bring the
system to the table the system features
a gigabyte g1 sniper m3 and motherboard
this is socket 1155 and we've got an i-5
2500 k inside that bad boy system also
features 16 gigabytes of kingston memory
and we just used a simple hard drive in
this system we used a 500 gigabyte I
think Western Digital blue drive we also
used a Radeon 7970 on that as well
obviously the Swift tech h2o xcp liquid
cooling kit and you guys can see it's
all hardline which is pretty neat this
is a very simple design system we were
looking to go out we weren't really
looking to go all-out we're just looking
to make some that looked pretty cool and
experiment with doing the hard line with
the system so you guys can see how well
and how easily actually it can be made
for just at standard click it being
all-in-one to an expandable different
type of kit the system was meant to be
as minimalistic as possible but still be
elegant and clean looking which I think
we've accomplished here but now I know
what motes you guys want you're going to
go under hey hey show us the dang score
so that's the system now let's check out
the scores you ran the CPU and a bunch
of different frequencies we've been it's
arranged all the way up to its 4.08
overclock from its standard three point
three gigahertz now you guys can see
that this thing was running at about 54
degrees Celsius under a normal web being
standard and we overclocked it it was
getting about 68 Celsius at the
overclock stage so this thing was
running pretty good now taken mine that
the ambient heat of your room
is going to affect how you're cooling it
so if your rooms gonna be a hundred
degrees you're not gonna be able to
expect your CPU to be dropping below
that threshold all
when you be a little bit hotter than
that but one thing about water Clinton
it's better than air cooling altogether
is that the air cooling automatically
takes all that heat and pushes it into
your room creating a hotter ambient
temperature and the ambient temperature
is a lot harder to reach using a liquid
cooler once again folks if you guys
lunch I got the full specs and learn
more about the split tech h2 200 X
including buying it well then check out
the link down below that light foam
which I hope you hit level all the
details so that's it folks we've made
this one pretty quick and pretty dirty
for you folks you know you guys like to
get right to the heart of the matter so
I know art and thank you guys once again
for watching tech of tomorrow you guys
like what you see hey you guys know what
to do hit that sub button and if you
liked it hey hit that like button we'll
see you guys back there on techy
tomorrow for more tech goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
