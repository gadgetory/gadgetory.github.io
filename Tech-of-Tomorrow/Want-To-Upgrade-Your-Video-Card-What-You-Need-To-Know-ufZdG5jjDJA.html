card inside of your computer just isn't
cutting it anymore and it's time to
replace that old video card but there
are a few things that you actually need
to do before you can even choose what
video cards are gonna buy and install it
in your system now
the very first thing that you're gonna
want to do before you even make the
decision to buy another video card is to
find out exactly what wattage of power
supply you have that's the very first
thing you can do now to do this pretty
much you just need to remove the side
panel from your case check out your
power supply sometimes this can be seen
by the rear of the computer it'll tell
you how many watts and if you can find
that out that's really easy otherwise
just need to remove the side panel from
your computer check out the power supply
and make sure that the power supply has
enough watts to power the new video card
that you want to put in your system now
the second thing you're gonna want to do
is make sure that you have the proper
connections now what I mean by proper
connections is obviously you're gonna
need either a six pin an eight pin two
six pins an eight and a six pin or two
eight pin connections now if you don't
have these connections on your power
supply you will not be able to install
the new video card that you want to
install so before you even go out and
buy a video card or prep it to put in
your system you need to make sure of
these things first check out your power
supply make sure that you have enough
watts
on your power supply to power the video
card that you want to buy plus make sure
you have the proper connections because
without either one of those things
you'll pretty much find yourself backed
into a corner and you won't be able to
upgrade if you don't have the proper
requirements okay so if you've already
taken those steps you've made sure that
your power supply is good enough you
have the right connections and all that
stuff the very first thing you want to
do before you put your new video card in
the computer is you want to go in and
you want
remove all of the drivers associated
with that video card now if you don't do
this
sometimes Windows Update will say hey we
need new drivers for your old video card
and since that video cards not there it
just gets confusing for some people so
the next step you want to take is remove
all of the drivers that pertain to your
AMD card or your Nvidia card you guys
can see right here you just go in delete
whatever is on there get rid of all the
AMD drivers get rid of all the Nvidia
drivers get rid of all that stuff and
then the next step is to shut off your
computer now to remove your old video
card you're going to need a Philips head
screw driver usually sometimes there are
thumb screws depending on your system
and the next thing you want to do is you
want to ground yourself out on your
system just touch the middle frame of
your system and grind yourself out and
make sure there's no static electricity
floating around and then on some
motherboards right near more than with a
video card pushes into the system
there's gonna be a little locking
mechanism now sometimes these are very
tricky to use be very careful try not to
use any screwdrivers of the metal end if
you can get a screwdriver that has a
rubber tipped in it'll be a lot easier
for you to do sometimes you can hit this
little button and you can pull the video
cart very easily other times it's kind
of a pain the but just depending on what
motherboard you're using but next up you
just remove your video card gently out
of the system
take it out set it on a nice place where
it's not going to you know anti-static
bag where it's not going to get any
electricity on it whatsoever and then
after that ground yourself out again and
then gently replace the new video card
inside of your system like I said before
make sure that you have the proper six
or eight pin power connections you
connect those close up your system so
far at that point you're good to go now
next up you're going to want to restart
your computer
you're gonna restart your computer
you're gonna get inside your windows
system and depending on whether you have
an AMD card or you have an Nvidia card
you're gonna want to go to WWE MD comm
or W am video comm and make sure that
you get the proper drivers for your
system now many of the video cards that
you buy today will come with a CD and
side of it so if for some reason you
absolutely don't have any internet
connection at the time you can use the
drivers off of the CD but those are not
the most current drivers that are
available sometimes there are even beta
drivers which work better on some games
but you're only going to get this if you
use the latest driver and this can only
be done if you go to the website and
download the driver now
once you download the driver and you
install the driver you'll restart your
computer and at that point you're up and
going your new video cards in there
you'll even see the AMD Catalyst control
panel or you see the Nvidia control
panel you can guys go on screen you
click on that and in here is we can do
all your different types of settings you
can change your resolution you can
change the refresh rate now remember the
refresh rate though is only going to
match the monitor that you have on your
system so if you have a system that only
as a 60 Hertz monitor you're only going
to be able to put the Hertz at 60 Hertz
inside of inside of the control panel
you're not gonna be able to set a 60
Hertz monitor at 144 it's just not gonna
work that way but if you do have 144
Hertz monitor 120 you want to definitely
make sure that you go into the control
panel and set this and match it to your
video card and after that you're good to
go
all you have to do is jump in now play
your games and everything should be
running absolutely great and if you
upgrade it to a nice newer video card
everything should be running much
smoother so that's pretty much it folks
how to install a video card even if you
have an older system that is a
completely system built by either Sony
or somebody like that once you look
inside make sure that you have the right
connections and the right power supply
you're good to go now people who have
done their own do-it-yourself systems
you guys will probably have a much
easier time of this because you already
know the parts that are in your system
plus the guys who already building
systems I'm pretty sure you guys know
how to change your video card out and do
all those same steps that I just talked
about in this video but if you're a
person who's really kind of a computer
newbie but you still want to be able to
change your video card out those the
steps that you have to take I'm Eric
you've been watching tech and tomorrow
we'll see you guys back here for more
tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
