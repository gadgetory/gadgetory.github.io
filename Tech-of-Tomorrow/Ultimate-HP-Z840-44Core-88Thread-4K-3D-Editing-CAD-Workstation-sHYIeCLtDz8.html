workstations comm
hey what's going on everybody now I know
that many of my fans that there are PC
guys and most of us use our pcs to just
play the crap out of games but what if
you're a person out there who not only
wants to play games you'd like to
actually try to make a game or do
something crazy and creative using 3d
AutoCAD or any other program out there
well how does a 44 core 88 thread
rendering Beast workstation sound you do
I got your attention because today's
system is just that it is just one
incredible beast of a rendering machine
and like I said this isn't that we're
going to look at today is very expensive
and high and it's about 14k it's
something like you'd see on the fuller
of Disney Pixar anybody out there is
making a 3d movie or something like that
they're going to have a machine of this
caliber inside of their rendering house
that's just the fact now I know many
people out there like you know in some
sectors they're like Oh HP man the
desktop market and all that there's a
lot like Yi but in the enterprise market
HP just seriously kicks ass they have a
lot of killer machines the machine that
we're checking out today is from a
company called Z workstations comm and
what they do is they basically just
offer custom configurations at a very
low price so that you guys can grab
systems now obviously many people out
there at home are going 14k yet come on
network we can't afford that no but they
have systems coming in to market from
around $2,000 all the way up to meet
your needs and if you use Adobe Premiere
to Vincey resolve avid media composer
maya autocad any type of program like
that and you're doing it and making
money off it time is money and we're
going to show you today that this
machine saves you such an amazing amount
of time doing rendering that you can
actually render so many more videos than
other type of machines that it well
makes it worth your while
so if you're doing video you're doing
editing and you want quick quick quick
response this is the type of machine you
want to have inside your office and if
you're having trouble getting started on
a system the guys at Z workstation comm
will hope you configure the perfect
system based on the software you're
looking to run so with that said though
let's real quickly let's take a look at
this system which secretly I like to
the Panthers Justin gnarly but you know
they won't call it that but that's me
with that said though let's check out
first the system itself the specs then
let's show you why systems like this are
incredible for people who use these for
a living and want to save money by
saving time with more productivity
starting off looking at the front you
guys can see that this system is
simplicity itself we see a graded design
which offers air flow through the system
there are four USB 3.0 ports we also see
the blu-ray DVD player and then there's
the power button simplistic itself as we
spin it around the side
what makes this thing really cool is the
modular design there are two components
that have to remove for you to access
the system the top one and the bottom
one the bottom compartment cover it's
just there to keep dust and other debris
out of your system so that nothing
interferes with your airflow but the top
compartment it actually contains all the
fans in everything that actually keep
your system running cool you guys can
see there are six fans in every
direction keeping the system running
cool and quiet once both these side
cover is removed you guys can see
clearly into the system that everything
has well cable management there's
nothing blocking the airflow whatsoever
and changing out the components is very
easy because you have nothing
restricting your way of getting to those
parts you guys can also see that both
the CPUs have a passive fan on them all
the cooling comes from the side panel
which we showed you just a second ago
now the CPUs inside this thing are crazy
dual twenty-two core 2.2 gigahertz intel
xeon e5 v 4 CPUs now that's incredible
so with this you're getting 44 cores and
88 threads which is a maximum amount of
power that you can get right now this is
the muscle contains 256 gigabytes of 21
33 megahertz ddr4 ECC registered Ram we
all know that SSDs are getting bigger
and bigger and the prices coming down
but what about a 2 terabyte P 3600 Intel
PCIe enterprise SSD now this thing is
incredibly fast offering write speeds of
2600 megabytes a second and read speeds
of 1600 megabytes a second
so you know that's going to be offering
great performance when you're moving all
your files around are doing rendering so
far the specs have been pretty damn
outrageous right what about the video
card well the video card insider is
actually twenty five hundred dollars
just by itself it's the K 6000 Quadro
from Nvidia and this thing has 12
gigabytes of gddr5 so you know this is
just going to be one ass-kicking card
for doing anything at all that has to do
with workflow making things moving
things doing anything hell if you're
looking for serious power you guys all
know the quadrille cards are where it's
at and lastly on the very bottom you
guys can see a Thunderbolt 2 card is you
guys are looking inside the chassis you
guys are probably wondering hey man
where is the power supply and that's
another cool feature actually this HP
system is because the power supply is so
well integrated into the chassis itself
making it completely unobtrusive to
anything you're doing but don't think
these systems don't have a lot of power
behind them because you can configure
your system with up to three Quadro
graphics cards like I said the z8 40
workstation that we received came with
Windows 10 pre-installed but you can
also buy your system with no software at
all or a variety of Windows operating
systems or Linux operating systems real
quick before we show you the performance
test of this z8 40 workstation beast I
cannot stress you how much in the
professional world that time equals
money the more projects that you can
complete in your work day equals more
money that you'll make so the faster the
system and the better it works means it
saves you money and at the end of the
day actually makes you more money with
that said though let's check out the
performance of the z8 40 of Korg station
beast first up we show you Cinebench
sittin bench test both the CPU and GPU
and gives you varying scores compared to
different systems as you guys can see
the rendering beast kicks serious ass
across the board the aja system tests it
tests your storage and how fast it
transfers the data and you guys can see
that the 3600 series from Intel offers
incredibly fast transfer speeds around
the block
geek bench 3 you guys all know this test
you guys can see from our iMac which is
pretty much the top light you can get
compared to this just gets a serious ass
with them most of the rendering that we
do in-house we do on my ice of an iMac
and it's pretty much the latest greatest
iMac you can get your hands on it's
fully decked out has 32 gigabytes of RAM
has the latest processor the latest ati
processor that comes inside of it that's
what you can pretty much get on the Mac
side of the things unless you get
yourself a trash can and we all know the
trash cans just aren't that upgradable
at all they're basically about three
year old technology some are even
worried about that a lot of people
though do work off of iMac so we use
Final Cut Pro and we made a 60-second
prod video that we added it and did
everything on our iMac and then we did
the same exact thing using premiere
using the Z 840 system by Z workstations
comm and you guys are going to see that
the time allotment on this is just
amazing
the differences are four seconds versus
a minute and a half and that's just
incredible think about the actual
workflow and space you use with those
kind of numbers with those kind of
numbers you could actually render 22
videos in the same time using premiere
on the Z 840 system than you can't on
our currently fully built iMac that's
pretty damn incredible numbers now as we
go building videos of this company we're
going to get different systems in and
take the testing further and further and
show you things now like I said before
this system comes in a range about
$14,000 but you can get many different
systems on Z workstations comm for
example you can get an 18 core Z
workstation with 64 gigabytes of RAM a
super-fast flash storage Drive and the
latest quadrille M 4000 graphics cards
for $6,000 which literally runs circles
around the fully built $10,000 Mac Pro
trashcan and the reason that they're
different from HP is they offer a lot of
different things that you can do as far
as the configurations go they offer
offer you guys a lot of different
discount pricing so basically you guys
can get the most decked out best systems
and save a lot of money though just by
buying your system from Z workstations
com
if you're looking for something that's
just geared for kicking ass geared for
working you guys should check out their
website and check out their product you
know you don't have to spend fourteen
thousand dollars but if you run premier
you run a lot of Adobe software type
projects you do what anything has to do
with CAD 3d my anything in that type of
realm of application then these are the
type of systems you're going to want to
check out you're going to have something
that's a server that's going to be
steady it's going to be stable it's not
going to crash on you it's going to run
cool and quiet and get all of your needs
done in the shortest time possible
so I'm Eric thanks for watching the
channel like usual we'll have the
information about this down below in
today's video was sponsored by Z
workstations comm and we've got more
systems from them to come so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
