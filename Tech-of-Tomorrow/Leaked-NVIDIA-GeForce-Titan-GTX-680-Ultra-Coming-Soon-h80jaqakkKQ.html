machine would borrow though Oh anyways
what's going on folks here on tech
tomorrow well more tech because we're
here with all the tech all the time and
today's story well you guys all know
that basically the gtx 680 it's been
around for a while and unlike the old
days we don't see a new chipset being
spit out every other month now it takes
quite a bit of time and the gtx 680 you
know it's been around for a while gk104
has been around for a while but now they
are rumors of a new gk110 that's
supposed to be just you know a huge
improvement and supposed to be basically
the new 680 ultra or the Titan or the
titanium or some whopping big man
to make it sound big you know I'm saying
cuz it's gonna be pic it's gonna be big
hell yes well it's gonna have a big
price tag too so anyways just what the
frak am I talking about we'll check it
out the cards supposed to have 2688 cuda
cores have 6 gigabytes of gddr5 ram
collected five point two gigahertz on a
384-bit memory bus a clock rate of 732
megahertz it's also said to offer about
eighty-five percent of performance of a
dual geforce gtx 690 now you can see
folks not all the power requirements are
out and everything but you can still sue
that's gonna have a high power
requirements because well obvious
opposed to be big badass card now this
thing's also supposed to have a huge
price tag on it now here's going to be
the big question of the day though for
NVIDIA and video are you guys still
trying to lock the cards up bro like you
know number over voltage no more
because if you're trying to charge nine
hundred dollars for a frakkin card that
you can't overclock I'm afraid that
enthused out they're gonna kick you
solidly in the balls I don't give a damn
how bad folks
the nvidia name i love you guys but if
you guys are selling a car for that much
money it better be able to overclock
like a son of a bitch you guys out there
in the audience let me know what you
think like i'm totally down with seeing
you know a GTX ultra Titan titanium
Titan bubala who gives a sh @ with the
name is all i care about performance now
they can bring a card like that I say
that's cool but I also say it's got to
compete now you take a look at some of
the other very expensive cards out there
like that they are usually able to
overclock especially if they're a single
GPU card so with that said I hope we see
a really dynamite carbon people over at
Nvidia also if you guys want to see a
written version of this you can check
out our website wewt cove tomorrow i did
my little giddy on that thing like usual
i hope you guys like this video show me
that love you know I appreciate it also
make sure your subscribe so you don't
miss out on anything let me hear your
opinions though I want to know what you
guys think should this card be
overclocked because it's gonna be like
900 bucks opposing Lana 900 bucks I say
it should be able to let me hear you
guys his thoughts I'm waiting to hear
from you see you guys back here in the
channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
