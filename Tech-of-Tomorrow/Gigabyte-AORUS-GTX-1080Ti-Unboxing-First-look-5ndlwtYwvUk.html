actually got our second non founders
edition GTX 1080i that's right man
this one right here and it's kind of
weird though is that my AMD board is
also an oars a oars how no exactly
either saying that but oars so I can
stick this in my AMD board they batch up
they be all matchy-matchy but anyways
here it is this card's got a lot of cool
features Man three plus three on the
fans the wind force copper direct to the
CPU and all the components so it stays
really cool extra dissipation for the
heat throughout the card it's got this
really cool thing called BR link which
is like basically two extra that's right
two extra connections for your monitors
whatever how it's exactly going to come
into play I'm not sure I'll guess we'll
know we get into a system also has 12
plus 2 power phasing stuff so you know
that everything is going to run the same
all the way across the board so if you'd
only know what that is power phasing its
how the electricity is actually brought
on to your video card so it's kind of
like a conditioning type thing so if
electricity is erratic
it actually wears your car down a lot
faster so if you have spikes high and
low where's your card out way faster so
having those types of features make sure
that your cards going to be you know
running for a long time it's going to be
running stable so I got the box right
here in front of me like usually like
almost every other product out there
guess what this card has no fucking way
our GP yeah because pretty much
everything has RGB for those of you who
are really into the box here is the
front of the box I'll flip it around to
the back just real quick so you can see
it there's nothing really too much about
the box you guys want to know what comes
into it so if you really all that into
it I mean here is the actual
nomenclature of the box and that's
pretty much it let's just pop the cab
maybe that might be a little bit
difficult me to do that angle and lower
here pop the cap here we'll pull the box
out box in the box you'll box testin
thing which never seems to end alrighty
we'll set that off to the side jam and
oh you guys like Methos with the camera
but I think he's had he's like don't be
throwing shit at me brah it's not cool
not cool so here's the box for you guys
who are into that type of thing I mean I
know I like a good tight box yeah
alright so here we go check it out first
off on top we've got something in a nice
container inside what is inside of this
I don't know have a function I know
let's open it up and see
so alright we've got a case badge so if
you want to promote gigabyte on the L
wrist you can do it with this little
case pump your shit bra that's right
step it up slide what else is in here
alright well I don't see any driver in
here and that's you really need it but
there's this let me take a look at that
myself real quick so what is that
okay it's just telling you about the a
that a horse be our length that I was
telling you about so I know you guys
hate if I read if I read stuff off of it
but I mean I'm learning this card I just
got it myself so basically the Aces be
our link offers the most flexible VR
friendly output connectivity with one
front facing and two rear native HDMI
ports so there you go so beyond that
what else do we got rid of other
accessories that's kind of weird this
things like this peeling off trippy look
at that kind of weird
all right and clear that that actually
looks kind of trippy to it it's stuff
look at that the entire thing is all
custom custom baby all right zip it off
to the side so what do we got here I got
one of those on that slide alright so
what I got here now it's the usual thing
you know two six pins to an eight pin
power connector I'm going to bother take
another bag you guys know exactly what
the heck this thing is we've seen them
in tons of boxes which hopefully we're
only going to see a singly thing
connector on here maybe natan a six but
I don't know let's keep going so alright
so oh okay okay this thing is plug-in
heavy too man
I gotta say that right to bat folks you
guys talk about card sags Wow
alright this thing's heavy let me get
this out of the way let me go ahead and
take the card out of the plastic bag and
I don't know why but this car to me does
not seem like a totally new card I want
to start with like the recycles or
something I don't know but alright so
let's start off the front of the card
really cool wind force design the colors
are a little bit weird orange and black
I don't know if I'm really too into that
it seems kind of pumpkiny and kind of
Halloweeny
that to me particularly is kind of a
turn-off I don't really like that shit I
prefer was a blue or a red or something
like that
how many honestly builds we're going to
see they're fucking made like a
Halloween pumpkin I don't really think
that many but anyways still you got
three fans in the front you got the nice
X all that good stuff
nice looking card now the outputs on
this card are slightly different than
your average duck you have three
DisplayPort to HDMI
DBI but then on the very back side of
the car to the rear of the card rather
you can see there's an additional HDMI
port and that is what they're calling
their VR link so it's kind of
interesting how exactly it'll work we'll
bring you guys in the full review
today's with the unboxing and checking
out the card so we'll move on
dad the bottom you guys can see the PCIe
connection that's what you've actually
plug into your system for those of you
who have never actually seen the video
card unboxing before I think most of you
have now down below this card it's kind
of hard to see but there is a lot of
cooling stuff huge cooling apparatus on
this car like I said before this card
features a direct copper connection
against everything all of your
connections your actually your GPU
itself everything has a direct cup of
connection this helps dissipate the heat
a lot from the card you guys can also
see how we have one two three four heat
pipes running throughout the card along
with all those heat fins so just a lot
of things going on to dissipate the heat
away from this card and that's good for
overclocking and here on the bottom you
guys can see even more evidence of the
giant cooling apparatus on this card now
it took the card around to its other
side you guys can see that there are two
eight pin power connections to power
this card now they recommend a minimum
of 600 watt power supply and the card
does draw 320 watts from your power
supply so be aware of that and I flip
the card around the other direction you
guys can see that there are two SLI
fingers here so though people out there
wanting to SLI builds up to four of them
this card has the potential to do that
if you want to go crazy crazy now last
but not least we see the back and like
all the cards that are killer these days
it comes with a frickin bad ass
backplate bad ass punch that sucker you
can see there's a cup or vent right here
this also helps to dissipate the heat
away from your card so not only is your
heat being dissipated all around the
card it's also coming up the back as
well for the ultimate in cooling that
you can get with air and if you're
wondering hey Eric how do I know if this
damn thing we've been fit in my frickin
case we need to make sure you have a
clearance of two hundred and
ninety-three millimeters to make sure
it'll fit inside your case and if you're
wondering hey man what are the
dimensions this card size in at eleven
point five four inches by five point
five nine inches and features a dual
slot design one thing very interesting I
have to say though about this car is it
features
two different modes if each disk or
clock which is already overclocked and
the boost clock now there are two
different speeds in the core clock mode
the OC mode is 1594 megahertz and the
gaming mode is 1683 megahertz but they
also have a boost clock mode and the
boost clock mode the OC mode is seven
and eight megahertz and the gaming mode
is fifteen hundred and sixty nine
megahertz alright folks so there you
have it the unboxing first looking first
hands on of gigabytes ARS gtx 1080i now
right off the bat some things I have to
say are kind of weird why it only came
with one of these is beyond me since
there's two 8bim power connectors two of
these should have been included in the
Box only having one of these kind of
really makes no sense you include both
that you need or don't include any at
all now another thing I don't really
like about the card is I really don't
like this color scheme I'm just going to
be honest with you the orange and the
black
let me hurt your opinions are down below
but me personally I'm not really a fan
of that color scheme now as far as the
features go though features are pretty
damn solid the card is built very very
well all that's cooling and everything
is probably going to be able to gain you
a lot of overclocking room especially
the Headroom for the card the cooler the
card runs
obviously the better the boost runs you
guys who follow in video stuff you know
that the cooler this card can get the
more overclocking Headroom that it has
the hotter it gets the more it goes
downhill but I'm Eric you guys are
watching Tekken tomorrow we'll have the
full reviews of both these cards next
week
mister jitta camerman is off to see his
family for a week so we'll have a few
days of downtime but as soon as we come
back we'll have all the full reviews of
both this the amp extreme and the other
card that we have surprisingly in-house
for you folks so stay tuned to tech you
tomorrow
we'll have more tech for you literally
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
