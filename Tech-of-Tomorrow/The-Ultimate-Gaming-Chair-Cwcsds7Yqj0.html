serious gamer that means you spend most
of your day sitting in a chair who wants
to sit in something uncomfortable you
want something that's gonna support you
and keep you comfortable to your entire
gaming experience now today we're gonna
check out something really crazy from a
company called EEB Lou and this is their
Rosa x1 gaming chair it's the world's
first illuminated PC gaming chair
because it has a human sensor that tells
whether you're sitting in the chair or
whether you're out of the chair now
obviously a chair of this caliber is
going to have a pretty price tag
attached to it but that's because of all
the serious features that it has
starting at the bottom the Arosa
features a solid aluminum base and this
base can take up to 1,800 kilograms of
static loading weight now that's just
crazy you could actually drive a car
over and it still would not break the
wheels offer a silent design and they're
injected with nylon and 30% glass fiber
now this not only makes the wheels able
to take a lot more weight it also makes
them much quieter for reduced noise even
the spring holding the chair up is a
class 4 gas spring which is the highest
quality and the longest life not only
does the Arosa look good because you
guys got it MIT this Ferrari look is
just really clean it's also made of
ultra filament leather now when you
touch it it feels just like real leather
but it has better abrasion resistance
and it's way tougher than real leather
so it should last a lot longer and best
of all it's sweat resistant and whether
you're a big person or a small person
the entire chair is filled with high
resolution now this is 50% denser than
any other type of foam and ensures the
chair doesn't get deformed no matter
who's sitting in it some other really
nice design features about the arosa are
its 3d embroidery logos now these are
pretty cool you can see them they look
very very nice and the hemming process
is very high-quality and offers a much
longer lifespan than a simple stitch
when you're sitting in a chair all day
one thing you definitely want to have is
great back support and lumbar support
now the Arosa features a durable
one-piece backrest cover which is
injected with nylon pass and 30% glass
fiber which also helps prevent
deformation this also makes the chair
twice as sturdy and durable the most
and steel tube designs on the market
today now as far as how adjustable the
chair is it's very adjustable you can
raise the back all the way forward or
you can push it all the way back and as
far as the handrails go they adjust up
and down and can also be turned into 360
degree rotation but like I said at the
very beginning of the video support and
comfort is the most important aspect of
a chair that you're going to be spinning
your gaming day in now the arosa
features head support shoulder support
back support waist support arm support
and leg support to make your gaming
experience the most ergonomic and
comfortable that you can ever get and
another nice thing about the Arosa it
can take gamers up to two hundred and
sixty pounds so even you big guys are in
the game but the really cool and flashy
thing about the e-blue arosa
are its adjustable red and blue lights
now you get four just for light effect
modes for you to choose from and they
look really cool when somebody's walking
up in the chair from the back you can
see it totally lighting up in two
different colors depending on whether
you're sitting in the chair or whether
you're in the game so in mode one when
you're out of the chair the red light is
on when you're in the chair the blue
light is on mode number two when you're
out of the chair the red light glimmers
when you're sitting in the chair the
blue light glimmers
mode number three when you're out of the
chair the red light glimmers when you're
in the chair the lights are off
and last but not least mode number four
when you're out of the chair the blue
light glimmers and when you're sitting
in the chair all the lights are off
so I've been using this chair now for
about two weeks and I'm a person has a
lot of body aches and when I'm inside
the chair I'm at an ultimate comfort
level I have to say the back support is
really nice the lumbar effect from my
lower back keeps me from getting any
type of back aids and my arms don't ache
or anything else so I can get plenty of
hours and in gaming without being
uncomfortable the light thing yeah it's
a little bit of a gimmick but it is
pretty cool you have to admit the color
scheme of the chair all the high quality
designs the embroidery the stitching
just everything on this chair screams
high quality the Arosa is not junk at
all it's a very high quality chair and
like any high quality chair the only
cavity is going to be the price tag yeah
this chair does come to market a little
bit over 400 bucks but if you're looking
for some that you can sit in for hours
and hours on and play your games
comfortably and something that actually
looks totally dynamic especially if
you're building gaming areas if you want
to build an area that was totally built
in a black and red color scheme come on
this chair will fit with almost any
azouz product out there and all their
color scheme builds or any other thing
out there so at the end of the day if
you're looking for something that's the
ultimate comfort
the ultimate look and it's just a
totally badass chair that has a killer
bragging rights
check out the Arosa because it's a
badass and it's a cool product from the
people over at a blue like usual we'll
have all the information about this
chair down below like button hey
hopefully you guys liked this video and
you guys like the chair we'll see you
guys back in the channel for more tech
and mower gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
