Before we jump into today's video let's
check out a word from today's sponsor of
course there the dark core RGB se gaming
mouse is where wire performance goes
Wireless with an ultra fast
low latency wireless bluetooth
connection you know you're getting the
same performance as you would with a
wired mouse but if you still prefer that
wire the dark core RGB se comes wired as
well the dark core RGB se also features
key wireless charging so you can charge
the mouse on any compatible charging pad
or with the Corsair mm 1000 mouse pad
for top performance and with the 1600
dpi optical sensor the ultra accurate
high-speed tracking engine can be custom
tuned to virtually any type of mousepad
and for custom comfort the dark core RGB
se comes the two interchangeable side
grips to fit your playing style and oh
yeah the dark core also comes with
customisable three zone backlighting so
if you're an RGB fan they've got you
covered the dark core RGB se also comes
with high performance
Omron switches which are rated for 50
million clicks that's right
50 million clicks so you won't have to
worry about your mouse cutting out on
you anytime soon and last but not least
using the Q software you can fully
program any of the nine buttons for
total control and customization so if
you're looking for a mouse that can
handle the best of both worlds both
wired and wireless check out the dark
core RGB se from Corsair well the mouse
and the commercial you just saw that's
actually the mouse that I'm using I'll
have my review coming out in a few days
but I have to say though that it
actually does work as well in the wired
as wireless connectivity which is
actually pretty impressive so be on the
lookout for the review now what I want
to talk to you guys today about it's a
couple different things first off if you
guys haven't seen it video car prices
are finally starting to slack off
they're even starting to sell cards back
at their normal price I got an ad from
Newegg today 8 gigabyte 580 for about
$399 it's not all the way down to the
lowest tier that it that it could be but
it's getting there other video card
prices are finally starting to come down
well you guys all know that mine
when it comes out it sucks the heck out
of the market it's like opening up a
black hole to miners where they just
suck every video card they can get into
their systems the market loses you know
all of its stock and prices go crazy
crazy crazy up but like always the
mining craze has it's up and then it has
it's down and the down is going to hit
pretty soon now that doesn't mean that
mining is going away it just means that
the craze for and everything going
around it kind of changes so instead of
being the big huge thing like circus
Vargas the first day it comes out it
kind of loses its luster and there's
still people doing it who stick around
but the big craze will be over and that
means good news for a lot of people
including me a lot of my friends just
come to me before and have me building
PCs and stuff lately
I cannot touch these guys the big
companies who have their pre built
systems and all of you guys out there
who build pcs for your friends you know
what I'm talking about right now you're
like oh cool man I can get this cheap I
can get this cheap I can get this cheap
Ram whoa video card holy crap Batman
then you quote from the price there it's
like wow you know Best Buy or whatever
you know whatever because stores by you
has his pre-built system with a way
better card in it for like you know six
hundred dollars less than that because
you're having to pay that $600 for that
card now that's just we all know that's
insane
but the ice is broke prices are coming
down so I imagine that probably by the
time that summer's in full roll
hopefully by then there'll be new cards
from both the AMD side of things and the
Nvidia side of things and that'll help
alleviate the market as well but we
shall see but let's all keep our hopes
up because it was really nice when I
could actually buy an affordable video
card and pass on my savings from rather
stuff to my friends so with that said
though check this out so much want to
talk about the word gaming right gaming
every time that that seems to be
attached to anything these days it's
making whatever product there is sell
for more money now I've been doing a lot
of thinking about this lately and the
reason is this gaming is entertainment
and it's a want it's like drugs food sex
anything else
we'll get addictive to their gaming it
sucks them in they play I used to be
told like that my son was into that for
years lots of you are into it right now
and when you're in that phase you're
just completely like focused on anything
to do gaming and helping your gaming
experience but if there wasn't gaming on
a PC how many people would actually even
buy PCs especially with Windows on it I
mean well if if the with this the
windows over the years and how much how
much people visco I mean oh it has some
good things you know it would be
interesting to see if there was no PC
gaming ever so let's just say that
computers came out and they were pieces
you know personal computers they were
for doing your business you know other
business people did things on them for
CAD and stuff but let's just say that it
never really took off as a gaming
platform that in itself you wouldn't see
anything that's going on right now
because if you take gaming out of the
computer industry there almost is no
computer industry anymore
there's obviously business a lot people
would believe me if there wasn't this
people would get the most cheapest most
inexpensive thing that they can get
their hands on that would fit behind
their TV for sure these days for all our
emails surfing the internet and
everything else they would never even go
out and spend it and paying like
thousands of dollars or hundreds and
hundreds of over price to buy a video
card they would never waste their time
at all the PC without gaming I think at
this point right now would not be
anything at all like it is without the
gaming side of it and people take
advantage of that fact
they take advantage of that fact because
they put gaming on it they call it a
gaming keyboard they call it a gaming
you know Mouse how many things we've
talked about this before gaming monitor
you know they call it a gaming monitor
even if doesn't even have any
qualifications for a gaming monitor
keeping an IPS panel with no freesync no
g-sync no high refresh rates no nothing
but they've slapped the tag on it gaming
so you're automatically going and you're
looking at that you're going hey wow wow
what's a gaming monitor Elric it says
gaming on it I wanted a gaming monitor
but is it a gaming monitor
I think the criteria for what qualifies
as being a gaming product really needs
to be more narrowed down what truly
qualifies for a Gaming Mouse a gaming
keyboard a gaming anything what
qualifies it that it's just strictly for
gaming and you guys know that you know
that GeForce Partner Program thing
that's what early what's all about as I
look to you more about it's basically
the branding of gaming anything that
says Nvidia gaming on it then Nvidia
would own that gaming platform on it you
know so I'm from from I guess bhisma
spective that's totally smart idea
because it locks are there others out
but there are once again you see the
word gaming being used to manipulate the
market and get more of your money you
know you hear people all the time saying
oh I meant I just use a standard
keyboard a standard Mouse you know what
you're fine bro
those gaming things half the time I
admit it a lot of them are gimmicky
unless you can program the buttons it's
got you know really great features on it
that's really super comfortable pretty
much a mouse unless it's just got two
buttons nothing else it's a mouse only
the programmability and being able to
take that and bring it into your games
makes it any different than any product
out there so now that I'm talking about
the very last thing in this video now
consoles why can't consoles have a
normal OS on them and be upgradable so
that you could buy them I mean picture
this I like sitting in my living room
and so I just bought I'll admit it I
just bought an Xbox 360 I mean not an
expected Xbox 1s I bought the slim one
that got one terabyte with the game
fours in it for 150 bucks I couldn't
turn that down so I bought it and
playing fours on my TV is awesome I mean
it really is fun so I started thinking
about it but I could just sit in the
living room now especially with all this
wireless stuff that I got I got a bunch
of Wireless stuff from Corsair I'll be
showing you guys that stuff as well as I
do my wireless living room but it's
really cool so if I could have a console
that could do all those things I could
surf the net stream do everything right
from my console perfectly and still play
my games aren't the way that I'm doing
now and not have to get broke I think I
could survive that yes obviously PC
graphics you know they are they are
better but why couldn't they do
something with a console where you could
put a different type of video card and
there's something and upgrade it and
keep it going so at least for like a few
years you know three to five years your
same console could be upgradeable and
you could use it I mean I think if that
happened it would be great because there
really for me the big thing that always
separated a PC game from a console game
was the controller when it comes to
first-person shooter games man you're
trying to get that controller my old
fingers man and I am just like whoa this
is Jabberwocky I cannot do this but you
give me a mouse in my hand at keyboard
WASD I mean I'm fine I can play that all
day long you know I'm saying and get
down so if I could totally have that
with my console my keyboard my mouse all
that and have it up and running I think
I would be pretty happy with that and I
think a lot of you folks would as well
and if that happened all these PC
industry guys that keep using the word
gaming gaming gaming to suck all your
cash would have to suck on you not
buying their products anymore you know
honestly if we stopped buying their
stuff just because they're throwing the
tagname gaming on it and consoles
actually improved the entire market
could change I actually plan to try to
talk to some people at Microsoft that I
used to work with years ago I just got
away from the console stuff as I went PC
but I actually have some ideas myself
about the perfect console and I'm
actually gonna bring you guys a video
about that where I'll tell you about my
concept and how I think that a console
in reality could totally wipe out the PC
industry almost completely own those
people who use it for work for just
pleasure a console can definitely do the
job with a little modification so thanks
for watching like I said video car
prices are dropping dropping dropping
dropping dropping be careful what you
buy when it has the word gaming attached
to because most the time they're just
trying to do this to you and and take
money from your wallet and that's the
truth and think about it if you had a
console that could do everything your PC
could do and still be upgradeable and
still be in that nice cost factor of
being a few hundred bucks why the heck
wouldn't you buy that thing and you know
what it could be easily done so let me
hear your guys thoughts and opinions
down below I appreciate it very much and
I'll see you guys back here on teka
tomorrow for obviously more tech
and more news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
