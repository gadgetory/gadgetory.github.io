tech of tomorrow for you AMD fans today
is going to be a really cool day well
you're asking why is it a cool day well
because check it out
the brand new FX 8350 with the Wraith
cooler has hit the market and we're
going to be given this bad boy to one of
our fans so I know that the 8350 has
been on the market for quite a while
everybody knows a core processor really
good for gaming and stuff like that
decent overclocker now this particular
one is completely unlocked and it comes
with the brand new rave cool now the
Wraith cooler actually got released I
think I like January something if this
year they probably saw it at CES and got
released afterwards but now they've
released that same Wraith cooler with
the 8350 so you guys are like okay like
a new cool like what the frak right
alright but this new cooler actually
works really really well in fact I think
it does like 34% more airflow more air
movement than the previous generation
cooler so you know it's going to do a
much better job of keeping that CPU
running cool so for you guys out there
we've never even seen it before though
let's just go ahead and do an unboxing
let's check out what comes in and let's
check out that's so-called rape cooler
so I've got this little tiny knife in my
hand and I'm just gonna go ahead and
take it right here and just make a
little slice right here I'm gonna throw
the knife camerman now I'm just kidding
you could you imagine not to be crazy uh
alright so anyways for those really
interested here's the top of the box
here's a part of the Boggs here's this
part of the box where they got over here
it's the indie FX with the Wraith cooler
Thames when I hear about the Wraith all
I think about is Stargate Atlantis baby
you guys know what I'm talking about
that's right leave a comment down below
if you know what I'm talking about so
we'll go ahead and just pop little cap
here shouldn't be too difficult should I
keep this off here in camera range so
wallah look oh there's something else in
the box okay so here right here this
little box right here here is the CPU
itself I'm sure we'll have some nice
shots you guys can check this out but
this is the CPU itself comes with a
little logo right here and the same
thing is FX 8350 you guys know
you've seen it before but underneath
that dunt dunt dunt dunt dunt danta is
the cooler wallah so there in the out of
the box there's not alright but here is
the cooler so up here is the cooler I'm
gonna pop the cap on it to these two
side tabs there's a plastic cover on top
actually first I saw a lot of shines
like hey they have a really shiny top on
it but nope it's just some plastic but
then we'll start up on top nice AMD logo
the nice spinny fan fan put them pop it
out of the box anything else in there
nope okay so we see two copper heat
pipes run through the cooler aluminum
heat fins everywhere else pretty solidly
built completely nice solid base where
connects to your CPU even comes with
your own pace you have to mess with that
I know so go out there going to use my
own base because I'm cooler but yeah
this patient probably work just as well
for you got your plug in and really I
mean that's pretty much it as far as the
scores and all that stuff go yeah we'll
go ahead and we will put this one on the
bench that's a particular one I'm going
to go down and buy another one at micro
Center because you guys don't want me to
give you what I'm using do ya I don't
think you did but we'll give you test
results but from what we've been reading
from around from the previous one that
came up with the 83-70 these coolers run
like I said really cool I think they
said about 36% cooler with 34% more
airflow so you know that's pretty good
deal and it comes in free it's a hundred
and seventy nine dollars if you're an
AMD fan right now I mean obviously the
FX 70 is the highest you can go but you
can still get the sorry the 83-70 excuse
me the FX 83-70 is the highest thing you
can get right now and then you got this
one the little brother to it but for 180
bucks it's really well priced those
people want low budget gaming systems
that can still play all their games hey
AMD is a great solution I know there's
gonna be a bunch Intel fans Amelia we're
gonna slice up my own path if you're an
AMD fan doesn't matter you know you're
gonna like what you like it doesn't
matter what other people like but the
really big coolest thing like I said is
that though we're going to give this
away and someone do this a little bit
differently whoever leaves the funniest
comment down below that makes me laugh
I look at it and I laugh that's the
person I'm going to give it to you know
I'll announce it over on Twitter like I
always do but he'll announce it here on
the site as well and uh let's see or
well what are we on we're on today's
Friday so next Friday I'll go ahead I'll
let you guys know who went but that's
pretty much it for availability pricing
all that stuff check out the link down
below
I'm Network you guys have been watching
Tekken 2 morrowind Hey the FX 8350 with
the brand-new cooler it's arrived and
check it out
one of you is gonna win it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
