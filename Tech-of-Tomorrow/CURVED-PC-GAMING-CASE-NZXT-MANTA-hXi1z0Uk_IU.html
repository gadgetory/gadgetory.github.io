builders out there who loves mini ITX
motherboards but hates those really
small cases let's check out the mana
it's something just a little bit
different you can see right off the bat
that the mana offers a curved shape now
the curved shape not only looks cool
it also offers much better cable
management and as we're taking a look at
the case from the outside we see a nice
viewing window and actually this is
supposed to be the biggest window on any
mini ITX case out there you guys can see
on the front of the case that it's the
ultimate in simplicity there's nothing
there at all no drive bays no nothing as
we go to the very top of the case not
only you get the on and off button we
also get a nice little LED 2 USB 3.0
ports a mic port and an audio port the
other side of the case it's just the
color design nothing special about that
and the rear of the case is nothing
special either it's just the industry
standard as far as the dimension goes
the mana has a width of 245 millimetres
a height of 400 and 26 millimeters and a
depth of 450 millimeters and the case
itself with nothing installed inside is
about 7.2 kilograms so it's pretty light
as well now one of the really awesome
features about the mana is this ability
be completely disassembled you can take
all the parts off of this and completely
reassemble it very simply this makes for
very easy build and great cable
management now the model that we got has
a completely white exterior but as we
take the panels off and go inside you
guys can see that the interior is
completely matte black this is great for
a lot of different build designs and
there's even a hint of white in there
for a little bit of accent color in
total the massive ports
five separate hundred and twenty
millimeter or a couple hundred and forty
millimeter fans now when you first
receive the matter however it has two
fans in the front 120 millimeter and a
single hundred twenty millimeter fan in
the rear but you can expand this by two
more on the top it can either be 140
millimeter or 120 millimeter another
feature of the manna that I know that a
lot of you overclockers out there and
liquid cooling guys are going to like is
that the Manneken support a total of
three rads that's right I said
Rad's on the rear 120 millimeter rad on
the top a 280 millimeter and in the
front a 280 millimeter so you can have
three of those in there so that means
you can pretty much liquid cool anything
inside this little tiny system the cpu
clearance offers 160 millimeters the GPU
clearance 363 millimeters and you can
even install full-length 360 millimeter
power supplies inside this small case
now being the case that the Manta only
supports mini ITX boards you're not
going to be able to use a whole lot of
video cards anyways so the mana does
have two PCI expansion slots but that's
pretty much gonna be covered if you're
using a large video card as most
high-end video cards are have a two slot
design as far as build quality goes the
Manta is made pretty solid the side
doors actually feature reinforced steel
for much more structurally integral
design so the bottom line is it's not
made of junk it's actually made of
pretty solid material also inside the
mana there are five expansion slots for
different types of drives there are two
slots for 3.5 drives and three different
slots for 2.5 inch drives and another
really cool thing is that you can mount
some of these 2.5 inch drives right to
the back wall of the case and last but
not least you do get a nice little box
with all this prison stuff you need for
putting your accessories inside your
case alright Tech fans there you guys
have it the NZXT Manta a mid tower case
that uses mini ITX motherboards now I
know some people out there gonna start
say hey man that's crazy why using a
mini ATX motherboard in this giant size
case well to be honest with you the
reason I usually stay away from mini ITX
motherboard so the fact those cases do
not offer much expandability you can't
really have a lot of parts no big video
cards nothing really cool so the man is
pretty much a case that can take that
mini ITX motherboard but expand the
friggin hell out of it think about it
man
three water coolers five external slots
for internal stuff all in all really
good features the case is made very well
it's coming to market about a hundred
and $39 so it's you know it's not too
pricey either the big things about it
though are its curved design the ease
you can completely take the case apart
put it
back together all that good stuff just
makes this case very ergonomic and nice
but what it's geared for I want to hear
your guys opinions down below and like
usual all the information will be
downloaded like button for you to click
on also before I bounce out of here give
you guys a chance to interact with
channel and win something cool there'll
be one winner for this so listen up you
guys want a chance give me a name for
the system he who gets his name pick if
will be the winner of the one prize so
leave a comment down there below the
hashtag of what you think this system
should be built because that's next up
folks next up is this thing being built
in an ice hole system also somebody had
mentioned the Kraken x61 will actually
fit inside of this no problem whatsoever
in fact all the Kraken different
products they have they have one that's
geared to fit inside of the Manta so I
mark you guys been watching teka
tomorrow make sure you write down below
with that like but you know what to do
and if you're not sub then sub up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
