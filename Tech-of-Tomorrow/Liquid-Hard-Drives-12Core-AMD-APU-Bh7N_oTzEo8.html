again to another edition of tech Audemar
where today we're talking twelve core AP
use liquid hard drive and google buys
twitch let's go
today's video is made possible by
Squarespace so first off we're talking
about a possible 12 core APU from AMD
why well an AMD public relations
employee posted a picture with the
hashtag AMD evolve what was interesting
though was that the picture shows a
truck with a dozen AMD robots on the
side with AMD a-series logo on the
backside so anybody with a sherlock
holmes type sharp of mind would think
elementary 12 robots a series apu it's a
12 core apu one thing to consider though
is that AMD promotes kaveri as having 12
computing cores even though only four of
them are cpu cores and the rest are GPU
cores so this may be just a whole lot of
AMD fluff-fluff what do you think next
up for those of the scientific mind a
liquid hard drive that can store a
terabyte of information in a tablespoon
of liquid lots according to the new
research microscopic particles suspended
in liquid could be used to store the
same ones and zeros stored on solid hard
drive platters today man so I don't know
what you guys think but for me out of
all the inventions that pretty much come
out since the entire time I've been in
the computer industry being able to
store something in a liquid based hard
drive is really really incredible just
think about all that if you had
something that would size of just a coke
can just imagine all the storage 1
terabyte per tablespoon that's just
amazing what do you guys think I want to
hear you guys comments below next up in
the news life is a bitch and google buys
twitch now sources are saying that even
though this isn't totally official
supposedly it is rumored that this deal
has gone down and that Google has bought
twitch for a billion dollars that's
right a whopping single 1 billion
dollars not a penny less not a penny
more now this isn't totally official as
of yet but like I said the rumors
spinning around is that the deal has
been
and that Google now will own twitch for
that billion dollars I hope it comes to
cheeseburger last but not least folks
before I go we've got some killer gaming
deals right now titanfall for 25 bucks
and sanctum 2 for measly $3 if you guys
know what sanctum 2 is it's pretty
incredible game it mixes a couple of
genres you've got tower defense and
other types all in one game I know you
guys all know what titanfall is
basically a drop down the planet you
fight a while to get inside this giant
robot and you kick ass what do you mean
in the game while we're looking around
trying to find some game for you guys we
also came across something really really
cool this is the arrow cool strike X

the craziest open air test beds I've
