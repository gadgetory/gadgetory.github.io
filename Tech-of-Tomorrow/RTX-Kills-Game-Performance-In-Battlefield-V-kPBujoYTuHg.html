back once again to tech of tomorrow now
the other day I released a video talking
about how it's pretty exciting that RT X
was finally going to hit the games and a
lot of people seem to really
misunderstand the video and leave a lot
of immature comments like saying you're
a paid Jill and all this stuff which is
just absolutely nuts I've said this
before I said again never received a
check from anybody in the industry get
real because it really lame saying that
stuff to me I look at it now I just
laugh at you and think you're an idiot
but I said in the video that this is
what RT X is supposed to do okay
I didn't say it was going to do that for
a fact I said RT X was supposed to do
this this is what NVIDIA briefed me on
they told me that RT X was supposed to
basically take all the great gaming
features that you had make your game
look more realistic and not really get a
performance hit okay that's they told me
and I was really looking forward to that
now I never said that was fact I never
said that's what it was and now that
we've actually done the testing on
battlefield 5 I can actually tell you
that I'm very very disappointed in what
I've seen thus far is not good
whatsoever it's crazy and yeah sure it
does look good things look shiny water
looks more glimmering yeah it does look
like the reflections and stuff or more
realistic but this comes though honestly
with the severe performance hit and I do
mean severe a way bigger performance hit
that I'm honestly probably seen in any
of the things other than probably with
hair works when hair works was you know
killing games as well but now this is
just crazy
so for those of you don't know if you
don't if you have battlefield 5 what you
need to do is you need to go into the
game and here's a screenshot we can show
you need to enable DirectX 12 and you
need to have DXR enabled this will allow
you to get all the features that you're
supposed to be getting now for those of
you who follow the channel you probably
know what our test system is it's a
really nice test this and we've been
using it for a long time but one thing
you guys really want to take note of is
that you have to have all of the latest
updates on battlefield 5 and 18:09 which
is the update from Windows in order to
be able to take advantage of these
features so real quick we can check out
the test system i7 8700 got a very nice
asus motherboard inside of here 32
gigabytes of ram SSD for the boot drive
we're using the very latest drivers from
Nvidia that have been out about
one day and with that said though let's
jump in and let's check out those scores
if you fina before
yeah Batali
searching out anything you can tell over
yes
right
okay so as you guys can see now one
thing we do we only record it in four
caves we just thought it'd be too much
to record in every single solitary thing
and make you walk through it so we
record everything in 4k but we gave you
guys in scores for the 1440 and for the
1080 now you guys can see with DXR on
getting a lot a lot of performance it's
serious performance it's more than I was
even expecting thirty frames per second
on 4k about 50 frames per second on 1440
and then also sixty frames per second on
1080 because it's probably bottlenecking
at that point which is just really crazy
I was honestly expecting a lot more from
Nvidia with this particular thing I was
really looking forward to the features
hence my positive video before saying
hey I'm really glad that stuff is
getting here but now that I've ran the
test and seen it I'm really disappointed
at this point right now yeah disappoint
it at this point right now that's what's
points point point point point point
yeah so I don't really know what to say
there's nothing really that I can you
know spin a positive twist on this and
say hey it's great because it's really
just not with that big of a performance
it it's really gonna affect a lot of
gamers especially if anybody has like
the 2070 or just a twenty eighty with
the 20 80 TI if you have them in SLI you
know and you've got a great big system
probably that a little bit of a hit
probably won't matter to you at that
point but for anybody out there was a
single card or anything you're gonna
look at those performance numbers and go
what in the heck is going on in video so
I have to say that RTX was not what I
thought out of the gate will it get
improved as time goes on will they learn
to use a technology the drivers and all
this stuff you know better in the future
I'm really hoping so because I try to
keep things under a positive light but
right now I'm sorely disappointed
Nvidia man what the heck is going on
here I thought we were supposed to get
great performance without the sacrifice
of FPS but as you can see fps is taking
a serious hit with this stuff on so I'm
Eric hopefully things will change we'll
see you guys back around ticka tomorrow
for more videos and more action peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
