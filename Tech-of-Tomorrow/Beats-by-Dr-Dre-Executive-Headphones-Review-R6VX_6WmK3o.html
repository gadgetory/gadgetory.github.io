tomorrow I'm working is this the way all
the cool kids were these headphones
these days now I'm just kidding we went
to New York last week I know a lot of
you guys know that and during that time
my friend Jonathan had bought in these
headphones and when I started listening
to him playing with them I was actually
show shocked at how they were I thought
man I better do a video so that's why
I'm bringing you this now these new
headphones by dr. dre you know the beats
by dre the big thing these things are
very very well made they're rugged the
design is great you guys can see they
look really good they're actually very
very comfortable they fold up good I
mean everything about the design and
everything about these beats by dre is
awesome but then unfortunately we come
to the reality of the day let's start
off right off the bat with the noise
cancellation ok noise cancellation for
these contained using a battery and the
battery actually makes these things hits
so instead of getting complete silence
you get silence mixed with a slight hiss
now nobody wants to hear a snake in the
air going all day long when they're
traveling around trying to listen to
their music now sound as well these
things sound totally hard if you're a
headphone guy out there and you listen
to things all time you'll know exactly
what I'm talking about now they ask that
you break these things in so Jonathan
use these things all the way going back
to New York from New York you know
traveling back and forth basically from
New York breaking these things in many
many hours in them then I got them from
him and started listening to them and
the sound is just so hard and harsh that
after about an hour my ears were left
with like honestly I was like what the
 just happened I just get screwed in
my ear so I'm really kind of blown
normally you guys know I don't even like
to make videos to say anything bad about
product but for $300 now the audio
technica ath em 50s are a set of
headphones that cost half the price of
this and sound a thousand times better
now I know you guys out there been
sending me emails and you guys been
asking me what do I recommend for
headphones so look in the link in the
description below will actually tell you
some of the headphones that me and
Jonathan TLD use on a daily basis that
we like you guys know we own recording
studios we have all this stuff we're
totally into the audio game I'd really
like to like take these things and call
this warning beats by dre bad but I know
that probably it a bad timing in video
but at the end of the day folks I gotta
say that these new executive series by
dr. dre for $300 and all honesty Carmen
can we focus over here that's where they
belong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
