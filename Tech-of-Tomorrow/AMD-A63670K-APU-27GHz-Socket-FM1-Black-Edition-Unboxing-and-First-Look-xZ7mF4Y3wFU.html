there it's me Elric over on our tech of
tomorrow YouTube channel bringing you
guys something that's really cool now
you guys know that AMD has their apu
which is the all-in-one platforms got
the GPU the CPU everything all in one
well that said I just got a hold a
really cool one right here man this is
the a6 3670 k this is the unlocked
version of this one it comes in a 2.4
gigahertz has 4 megabytes of level 2
cache now this thing I read on the side
of the box works with a lot of video
cards that you can have crossfire
so this CPU is really low price it's
like only around 100 bucks but it also
works with a 66 70 a 64 50 and a 55 70
so that you can have crossfire cards
those three listed right here on the
side of the box so anyways let's move on
I just want to talk about a couple of
things right here behind me I have a
couple really cool things I've got the
sapphire peer this is their platinum a75
motherboard it's one of the FM one
supported motherboard so it's gonna
support this APU I'm also gonna get the
Radeon HD 66 70 this is also from
sapphire so basically everything in the
system that can be sapphire is gonna be
sapphire along with this cool AMD
processor by the way thank you very much
john taylor from AMD appreciate you guys
as support on this so that said let's go
ahead and let's jump in and do the
unboxing of this cool new apu from the
folks over at AMD ok folks so here we're
gonna jump in and actually do the
unboxing part of it we've got the box oh
yeah that always helps the AMD a6
accelerator processing unit black
edition a 636 70k two point four seven
gigahertz four megabytes total cache
it's also the socket fm1 black edition
flip the rounds let you guys see the
side you guys can kinda see the CPU
right there it says a6 3600 series on
the side of it you're gonna see it more
we unbox it anyway so
yeah but here's show you the back of the
box and then once again we would have
this before but these are the three
video cards that you can use in the
crossfire configuration in this so after
not too much ado let's do these unboxing
with the old knife got the knife right
there
I'm gonna go ahead make an incision like
a doctor look at that look how
professional I am yes this knife was
sterile and no children were hurt in the
making of this video pop the old top
there do-do-do-do-do and voila
here's what comes in the box so let's
break it up in a little segment shall we
first let's take a look at their heat
sink that comes with it yes they do
provide you one so if you want to go a
little budget you can go a low budget
all the way and here's their heat sink
you can see looks like it's aluminum
copper fins I mean no copper fins excuse
me retract that statement new copper
fins it's just all aluminum fins all the
way around I don't think we'll be using
that but hey thank you Andy for
including it that's awfully kind of you
folks so there you can see a little
nomenclature on top which basically says
hey I cost three dollars and fifty cents
somewhere in China but that's no big
deal at least they give it to you now
we're gonna move on got this
AMD vision got the APU in there it's a
little shiny got the AMD advanced micro
design processor so I'm going to go
ahead just take this out I don't really
want to handle the process of too much I
don't want to bend any pins or anything
or caused any damage so I'm not going to
completely remove it out of there but
let me see here if I can get it on the
angle you guys can actually see it here
you can see a real close-up of the APU
this way you guys can take a look at it
all in all pretty cool stuff sometime
you go set it back down the table down
here so you guys can see what actually
comes in the box space of the APU the
guide the thing and a trusty knife to
open it all with no I'm sorry that
doesn't come with it but that was it
this is the unboxing this is the a 636
70 K from the people at AMD you saw it
here first on
of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
