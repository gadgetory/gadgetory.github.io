back once again to the channel where
today we're going to be checking out the
HP Envy 34 inch ultra wide q HD curved
monitor now this monitor not only does
all of your gaming stuff it's excellent
for business as well it's a little
pricey but after we talk about all the
features you can make the decision see
if you think it's worth your cash at the
end of the day the HP Envy features a 34
inch diagonal ultra wide q HD micro edge
curved monitor now this thing surrounded
by 5 million pixels of definition on the
screen which is just incredible
the resolution and aspect ratio of this
monitor is 21 9 which is 34% more screen
real estate than a 16 by 9 q HD monitor
I have to tell you that sitting in front
of the HP Envy is really a nice
experience with the resolution of 34 40
by 1440 at 60 arts using any video card
and also featuring a hundred Hertz using
the free sync connection this monitor is
really a nice thing to stare at for long
hours without your eyes getting a bunch
of fatigue the design of the HP Envy is
very nice as well you guys can see that
there's hardly any bezel whatsoever on
the side so putting three of these
monitors together would be truly badass
because it would be hardly any real
estate loss whatsoever the response time
of the HP Envy is 6 milliseconds from
grey to gray now as far as the
brightness goes it's 300 candelas per
square meter which is quite a lot the
contrast ratio is 3001 static and
5,000,000 to 1 dynamic for talking to
people in your family and doing business
and stuff like that we want to interact
action in a more personal level the HP
Envy features of 720p integrated HD
webcam and there's also dual microphones
in an LED light as well and Filosa folks
will actually care about the environment
of features of a monitor the HP Envy
features mercury-free LED backlighting
arsenic-free monitor glass and a low
voltage halogen design to promote energy
efficiency all around now the pixel pics
on the HP Envy now this is how close the
pixels are together on your monitor is
0.23 2 millimeters so it's very nice and
dense if you want to just talk about
aesthetics you guys have to admit that
the env looks really nice which is
probably why they called it Envy because
if you're on that thing they're hoping
other people will envy you for owning
that you know keeping up with the
Joneses but on that same thing this
monitor is actually pretty light as well
it only way
twenty four point five six pounds and
that's including the stand now if you
take the stand off you want I'm not at a
different way it weighs about sixteen
point eight nine pounds now one of the
things that I personally feel is a
caveat about this monitor other people
may feel differently is that you have a
very limited amount of moving space with
the monitor now you can tilt it from
minus five to plus twenty degrees but
you can't raise it up you can't spin it
around and get portrait and that type of
stuff so in that respect it's kind of
limited it does however have a one
hundred seventy eight viewing angle so
no matter where you're standing or
looking at the monitor does look very
clear now one aspect of almost every
monitor I've ever bought that had
internal speakers was at those internal
speakers were weak
they had no balls just a sound on them
with just like yeah I'll use them that's
only going to be really cheap and not
buy any speakers whatsoever but if you
want some actually really good sound
this aspect of this monitor is really
nice the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen speakers that
are inside of this sound very excellent
music sounds really good gaming sounds
really good you probably wouldn't really
need to buy any speakers at all with
these because they actually do sound
that well they're designed in Denmark by
a couple of dudes have been around a
long time doing audio and I have to say
out of all the monitors I've ever heard
sound on these are probably some of the
best now checking out the front of the
HP Envy you guys can see it does look
very nice in the very center is the NV
logo you guys can check it out looks
really cool now that big strip that you
see down there on the bottom that's all
part of the internal audio now on the
right hand side you see the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen logo now below that that's where
all the menu controls are you can scroll
your way through all the different
things and aspects of the controlling
the monitor on this side and on the far
left hand side below that you can see
all the controls for the audio controls
is how you control your volume and all
that different stuff and it's all very
easy to use for those of you wondering
hey Eric what comes in the bus bro
alright we'll check it out you get the
monitor an AC power cord external power
adapter an HDMI cable a CD it includes
the user's guide the warranty drivers
all that good stuff a USB cable a USB
type-c cable DisplayPort cables base a
mount bracket and your standard allen
wrench in case you need it on the back
of the HP Envy you have your power
connection as well as the signal input
connectors now there's no more DVID it's
just a single hdmi and displayport
and one thing nice about the HBM DS it
actually has a USB hub that features a
USB type-c connection I won't take for
granted that all my users out there and
know what freesync technology is I'm
sure most the hardcore gamers do but for
those out there who don't know what it
is the free sync connection is when you
have the free sync monitor and you also
match it with a proper AMD card what
this does is it allows you to get 100
Hertz refresh rate and takes away all
the screen tearing and ripping so that
you have nothing but a flicker free
great gaming experience as far as our
gaming experience went we played a
little bit of gta5 this game just fun
and go around and kick ass all over the
place and even though we never precinct
connection we got a steady 60 frames per
second across the board and everything
just looked really crispy it's dark
blacks nice bright colors everything
that you want in a gaming monitor and as
far as warranties go of the HP Envy
comes the one-year limited warranty
all right Tech fans so there you guys
have it the specs that looks everything
about the HP Envy 34 inch curb cool
monitor right yeah it's pretty awesome
now another cabbage you guys are going
to say right off the bat is this monitor
is $900 I know that most of my viewers
out there they know that freesync
technology can come in to market
especially you know on a 25 inch monitor
you can get them for like almost 150
bucks for 27 around 200 so spending $900
for most people is going to be a pretty
hard thing but think about this last
year they had a lot of those g-sync
monitors without the Predators in all as
monitors they were 13 and 14 hundred
dollars for the same type of technology
I mean let's just face it the picture on
this thing is very very dense I talked
about that in the specs so everything is
really crystal clear even though it's
not a 4k monitor it's only 34 40 by 1440
still that's a huge aspect ratio when
I'm sitting in front of it I feel
completely immersed in the monitor if I
would have had an AMD system in here
we've actually even been a better
experience because I could have setup
that free sync stuff and had that
hundred Hertz which would have been much
better for my old eyes you know
unfortunately though I don't have that
but it's in another room so those people
out there who do business stuff as well
with the security stuff with the camera
that's pretty cool if you're like doing
stock and stuff like that that's a
really cool type of thing so if you're a
person who does a lot of gaming but you
also do a lot of business I think that
you really appreciate that monitor the
only thing I really wish more about the
monitor is I wish that had more
you know availability to tilt move up
and stuff like that I prefer that that's
actually one thing that I like about my
predator motto is I can spin it do
whatever the hell I want with it
you know the overclocking features and
stuff are a little bit better on that
one but also we're talking about a big
price difference and you know the
difference between you know a g-sync
monitor and a freesync monitor so if
you're looking for something that's the
ultimate ultimate ultimate the speakers
are really good now the only thing with
the microphone and stuff is if you're
playing a game with all that noise
coming out using the microphone on the
monitor is just not going to work
because you're going to be fighting
decibels on every side so if you still
want to do gaming and be able to like be
able to hear yourself clearly and stuff
you probably would be better off wearing
headphones but if you're not doing any
of that talking stuff or playing those
games that require that listening to
music and playing games is a very nice
experience like I said the speakers
inside this are probably some of the
nicest I've ever heard
way better than I've ever heard from any
of the predator monitors for anything
out there a long time so I'm Mel are you
guys been watching techy tomorrow I
always want to hear your guys opinions
so down below that like button you guys
can click on that thing and give me your
opinions and tell me what you think I
know at the end of the day most my gamer
guys are going to go wow dude that's a
lot of cash but technology that's always
on the bleeding edge and like I said men
that very thin as a little around the
edge that thing's pretty killer so if
you put three O's together do the
adjustments there really shouldn't be
any loss in a surround type situation if
I can get a hold of three of these
believe me I would because that would be
one awesome I can experience but for now
hey all the information be down below
like button you guys know what to do I'm
