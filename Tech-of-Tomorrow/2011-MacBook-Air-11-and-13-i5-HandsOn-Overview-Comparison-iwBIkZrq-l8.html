repairs back here once again the tectum
our YouTube channel to bring you guys an
update on the ultra portable new MacBook
Air series of laptops from our friends
over at Apple today we're going to be
taking a look at both the high end 11
inch and the entry-level 13-inch MacBook
Airs now both these things do have some
similar features in common those
features are they both come with a lot
of the same things first of all we'll
start off with the graphics both of
these have HD 3000 graphics from Intel
with 384 megabytes of graphic power
that's exactly the same they both have
the same keyboard input same input for
free or you know for working with your
mouse and all that all that is still
exactly the same they each have two USB
ports they each have Thunderbolt now
here's where the differences start
coming in this one here has an 11 inch
screen this one has a 13 inch screen now
the 13 inch screen has a 1440 by 900
resolution which is very nice it's even
higher than any of the compare of a PC
ones that you can get on the market
another difference is the SD card reader
the 11 inch model come in at $1,199 does
not have an SD card reader the 30 inch
model though does so also they each have
a 128 gigabytes of SSD it's inside and
it's also upgradable through Apple you
can get 256 gigabytes or if you a third
party ended up to 480 gigabyte drives
inside of these nice little things also
this one has five hours of battery life
30 days standby time
this one has seven hours of battery life
some of the cool things the little 11
inch one you can actually take this on
to the airport you don't even need to
remove it out of your backpack so you're
walking with that line and they can take
off your shoes get undressed
whether funky stuck there going to do
with you if you have a little 11 inch
you do not even have to worry about that
whatsoever you can just keep in your
backpack throw it through and let it run
to the airport you don't have to open it
up or anything like that
also the new OS has come out lion is out
or both these come with Lion
pre-installed you can also upgrade to
life give me over $29 but these ones
come out of the gate with lion on it now
as far as performance goes there's going
to be some slight differences this one
comes in at 1.6 gigahertz on an Intel i5
now this is a low voltage CPU requires
almost no electricity water to keep it
going
this one comes in at 1.7 gigahertz
they both offer hyper threading and they
both offer turbo boost so that's these
things in a nutshell one's 1199 ones
$12.99 the major differences between the
two is this one has an SD card reader
seven hours of battery life and a 13
inch screen and this one has five hours
of battery life and once again you might
have to remove it to come out of the
airport so that's pretty much it bigger
screen longer battery life ultra
portability and you have to worry about
it coming in at the airport one of the
last things I want to say out there is
that these things compare very well on
the market a lot of people out there
will try to compare the PC and say the
price differences are there in this
segment of the market believe it or not
Apple products actually fall in cheaper
than their accompanying pcs something to
take into consideration I'm going to
Ferris your host here Detective more

both we knew 11 and 13 inch MacBook Airs
