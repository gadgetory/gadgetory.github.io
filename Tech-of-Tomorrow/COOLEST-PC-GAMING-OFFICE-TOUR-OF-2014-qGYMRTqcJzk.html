ever mark taken off here at the Kingston
now what boom Brean now this is the
audio test lab absolutely yeah that's
right can you hear me I'm here okay C's
so in here
they have headphones and testing and
microphones and actually if you guys
were in the parking lot these are the
headphones we'll be reviewing for you
guys very shortly here now out in the
parking lot there's this Bugatti car
Jesus got some shots of it
hmm and I saw the sky out there as well
who did all the patents on SRS and stuff
so you know the sound guy is walking
around along with the sound guy now mark
here though for me it's kind of
confusing because you know everybody
like has this guy they like look up to a
flight want to know something about
memory well mark is like the memory
genius so how it up in headphones forgot
I was kind of tripping but I guess you
know they liked how it sounded yeah all
right then so what's in your mark right
come on we see tech station really out
in test lab what we do here as we do the
testing of our headsets when we bring it
in from the engineering guys to make
sure it meets all our specifications
frequency response distortion
sensitivity all that kind of stuff I do
the testing in this lab to make sure
that we see the highest HyperX standards
basically and if it doesn't you just say
nyet
that's correct and he said it properly
for yes
nyet so if you swing around
what is down yours it's like your
personal area this is what we do our
testing of our headsets and microphones
and other things that we've worked on so
basically we have some very high-end
Micra for other things microphones and
speakers that allow us to test the
sensitivity of our headset microphone
Wow
well as we could take this do we test
our ear cups to make sure that the
frequency response and everything that
we expect that of them is the highest
quality Wow so basically the SuperDuper
high instance testing this is the
engineering side of do we want to go to
production or not with this product oh
wow so there you hear folks so before
you hear it they hear it here in the lab
with Mark tech enough and you heard it
here first at deca tomorrow here we see
one of the two conference rooms on this
side we see the predator you guys can
see that over here and then we have
another conference room over here which
is much much bigger and this is the fury
and you can see the fury is a much
bigger room has a big screen so people
can talk game do all that inside this
giant room including watch the World Cup
if they were so inclined to do so
and then after that we have just pretty
much the other side of the building
which is more greening and another lobby
so let's check that out as we enter the
tour as you can see down here they just
got some more sections of computers they
have somebody being interviewed from
with our HyperX gaming teams they have
some more tables there's a big red area
with a lot of headphones on and to some
other gamers and that's pretty much all
there is to this new addition to
Kingston HyperX</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
