tomorrow we bring you all the tech all
the time now I'm going to talk about a
subject which seems to be dangerous
ground and I'm talking about the new
27-inch iMac freaking PC fans they come
out of the woodwork start throwing fruit
at me Winnie ways check it out
this new iMac actually had some pretty
powerful features and it can double up
as your gaming machine I know you're
saying yourself
I can build a cheaper gaming machine I
know but it's not about that it's about
the coolness of having your Mac and your
PC all in a solid frame now this thing
features the new gtx 680 MX video card
which should power pretty much any game
you would think right so with that said
we've loaded up boot camp in an effort
to get the most power out of this
machine and see how it plays and I think
you're actually going to be pretty
surprised so with that said let's jump
in and let's see Far Cry 3 on the new
27-inch iMac let's go kill some people
look use my gun
kid sighs all right
he found covered
doing the clog
thank you
all right so now you're probably asking
yourself what did I just see all right
well what you just saw was Far Cry 3
medium settings 2560 by 1440 and over 50
frames per second that's pretty damn
good you got taken to consideration most
people have 1920 by 1080 resolution this
is a lot more than that which si means
it stresses out the card more and still
over 50 frames per second now I don't
know what you guys think but I think
this is actually pretty cool because if
you're in the Mac and you're a Mac
person and that's all you really want
but you really want to play a game still
and you don't money to go out and buy
another machine or mommy or daddy or
whoever just won't get you another
machine this way you have the ability
you load up bootcamp and bam you got
your gamers machine 2560 by 1440 right
on your desktop I think it's pretty cool
stuff now beyond all the hate try to get
the hate away from you go you're not
hating try to think about that I think
it's pretty cool let me hear your
unheated opinions about this now we also
did run this on ultra on very high and I
think you'll be very pleased at how well
it did at 1080p which is what most
gamers actually play the resolution at
do you guys want to see all those specs
and those scores check out the link the
