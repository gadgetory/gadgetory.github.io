probably saw my first video where I
asked if AMD's latest Vega frontier card
could beat you know the top-of-the-line
Titan XP card and the comments were kind
of mixed now I did that to gauge your
guy's reaction on the card because like
a lot of people said in the comments yes
previously and video is doing this type
of thing a dual type of mode card that
could do both prosumer stuff and gaming
altogether well you guys know it didn't
really go so well for them the cards
aren't doing that anymore because you
know the markets kind of weird because
you're either doing pro stuff or you're
doing gaming you're not really mixing
the two together now I said the video if
you know md had great success with this
then maybe nvidia would change back and
change the way they do things as well
but from what i've seen from the scores
no this is just me you viewing online
whether the people have said it seems
like this card in gaming and if you want
to tell me this card is not meant for
gaming I'm not even going to say when we
save you because like basically why is
there a gaming switch on it if it's not
for gaming why is there a gaming mode on
it maybe it wasn't meant to be clearly
for gaming but that's pretty funny
because at this point it's actually
AMD's fastest gaming card on there you
guys are seeing the scores it's a little
bit faster than a 1070 somewhere between
a 1070 and a 1080 so it is slowly
creeping up you know and and videos
top-of-the-line cards but it's not quite
there yet and it cost a lot of money
plus I spoke with a lot of people in the
industry who do this type of thing and
they basically told me that if they're
doing their their VIP their video making
and doing all that stuff they're more
worried about their coding getting their
code done fast and checking it out and
actually playing the game so they said
for them you know that's kind of like
something they probably would not really
buy into and I know in the last video
some people did say hey I'm going to buy
this card right now so I guess today's
video I'm kind of like wondering what
gauging again once again how you guys
feel are you guys really going to go out
and buy this card I mean if you have the
cash $1,500 what the card is do you want
to invest that much money in that card
as a gaming card and if you're a guy who
does pursue more stuff or you still
wanted to get a quadrille or a fire GL
which is totally dedicated to doing that
type
the thing because at this point it's
kind of a trip it's more and it's less
all at the same time you get more
options sure you get the options because
you can have the prosumer level stuff
and we saw that it competed pretty well
you know against the Titan XP but how is
it really going to do against a two
thousand dollar quadrille or a
top-of-line firegl card like those tests
I haven't actually seen popping up
everywhere and I straight up asked the
people at AMD antal you know is this
card in Pro you know mode like a top of
the line or mid-range firegl I never got
an answer so what I'm seeing right here
is that yeah it's a little bit of both
but what I thought Vega was going to
come out even though this car was kind
of geared for that stuff a gaming mode I
thought it would have at least been
beating like a 1080 and getting really
close to a 1080i that's what we were all
expecting I mean when is there going to
be a Vega on the market that actually
beats a 1080 TI you know or beats the
Titan XP really beats it like out of the
box no driver issues
nothing like that whatsoever just out of
the box performance you get it you take
it you're played nearly so them are the
frackers that damn thing just blew away
my 1080 and Wow look at that kicking
butt on an XP as well that's what I'm
waiting for now the RX series is going
to come out for gaming but here's my
thing if the Vega front tier is the
mothership of the Vega line how is any
of the other line of cards going to
actually be able to compete and beat and
video on the gaming side
you understand I'm saying or so it's you
know it's a logical question because if
this is the top of line bad boy so you
think they're going to release another
RS Vega for cheaper that's going to be
faster in the gaming realm now sure we
all want that to happen I want that to
happen but do you honestly see that
happening because that's what I'm
waiting for because at this point right
now like I said I'm seeing a little bit
more and a little bit less more options
but let's let's gaming less prosumer yes
you get the options to do both but at
the end of the day so what you really
want or do you want a pure gaming card
that kicks total ass that'll beat
anything on the nvidia side and a
prosumer card for the same thing now I
know this is a kind of niche market like
I said in the beginning NVIDIA has tried
to before didn't do very successfully
for them so at the end of the day I
really just want to know how many you
guys out there are going to go out and
buy this card because like I said if
you're a pure gamer and all you care
about performance and you're not a
fanboy and brand does not matter
honestly that's where your head should
be at there should be no fanboy ISM at
all I'm not a family of jack
whatever has the best performance and
what it is is what I want to use and you
should feel the same way like feeling go
like you know I hate NVIDIA they're just
 piles of or I hate AMD for
this there's no reason to hate anybody
at the end of the day man when you go
out and you buy a car you buy anything
else and you spend your money you buy
the best bang for your buck don't you
you don't go out and just go you know
what wow that number x t-shirt it's like
it's like way more money but it's less
and I'm going to buy that no you're
going to buy what you know is going to
get your absolute best money source so
why doesn't that translate over into the
PC realm I just don't understand it
fanboys and said nothing to do with what
you choose to buy you should buy what
works absolutely best and performs the
best at the end of the day because
that's what drives the competition
between AMD and NVIDIA at the end of the
day it's all about the numbers and the
price Nvidia like you guys know has been
pretty much the king of the ring for a
long time
aim DS the underdog they're known to be
the price people to give a lower price
it's just a slightly less performance so
will you guys buy the AMD Vega frontier
or are you guys going to wait for the RX
ones and hope that they will beat Nvidia
at their own game I really want to hear
your comments because at the end of the
day that's what my videos are mostly
about these days I'm proving you guys
I'm trying to see what the feel of you
guys the public is on these subjects so
no I mean sometimes it feels like a
little bit of height maybe it is because
height kind of drives the enthusiasm
between people to talk about these
things and discuss them so hey let's
have a discussion
let's see your comments down below for
you guys who are here in America happy
4th of July
I know in Australia it's already
Wednesday but
for you guys in America hey happy fourth
peace out we're here for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
