tech of tomorrow another day means more
news and what the heck does that mean
well lots of good things are going on so
AMD fans you guys all have reason to be
happy last week the 6800 k was released
and now they're going to be releasing
two more skews into the market based off
the piledriver technology and one of
them is going to have turbo speeds up to
five point Oh gigahertz and speed the
other one is going to be four point
seven so that's really exciting news now
one thing about these things is there
going to be much more pricey though than
your normal CPUs from AMD these are
going to be your bargain basement price
CPUs they're actually going to be up
there in the market now these things are
going to be eight cores and they're
going to have a higher TDP than previous
generation ones that have come out
they're actually going to be at 220
watts compared to 195 watts of the
previous generation ones all the stuffs
actually over on our website look it's
that later as we move on for those fans
out there who like Apple products I know
that my channel you know a lot of you
guys would prefer pc stuff for those
folks out there who do like apple
products the new MacBook Airs all come
with PCIe SSD built in now if you don't
know what that is what pc is SD is it
goes directly into your pcie eliminating
the bottlenecks that you get using the
state of Technology so you don't get no
more bandwidth limitations it cuz goes
directly through there which means you
get faster access speeds faster boot
time just faster everything faster
faster faster this is going to be really
cool and it's going to make those damn
things really great machines for doing
all of your work on them so I think
that's pretty cool and something to
celebrate for fans of apple products and
then for those folks who like very very
fast memory corsair is now releasing
some really really fast stuff it's
almost pretty much 24 hundred megahertz
actually 2933 megahertz but it's still
faster than shit how fast this shit i
guess spending on much greasy food you
be right like wow
you guys know I'm just kidding around
you has this really very very fast stuff
so you guys should be interesting the
stuff it's going to be their brand new
vengeance memory looks very very cool
it's going to have XMP profiles for
those folks order that golly if anybody
has any questions on what XMP stuff is
it all you got to do is it's the
extended memory profile and what you do
is you basically going your bios go in
there find it set XMP profile one and
Kabam you get the speeds of the memory
you're using in an AMD system you just
have to go ahead and actually set it at
the speed so those are the three top
news stories now also you guys all know
III is going on right now and we will
have coverage for you guys tomorrow
