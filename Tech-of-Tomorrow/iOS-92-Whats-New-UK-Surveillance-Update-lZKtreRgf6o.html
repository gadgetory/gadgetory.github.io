update 9 point know and it was very well
received had a lot of great things going
on for the very first time your device
didn't slow down like a piece of garbage
and make it useless which is a really
good thing I think people around the
world for the first time agreed and said
hey that OS was really a cool update
what didn't seem like it took apple any
time at all though to release another
update now 9.2 is actually hit the
market and the really cool thing is it's
a beta but right now it actually turns
any of your Apple devices into a phone
with a tease numbersync now this is
actually pretty cool stuff now any of
your Apple devices can be used to make
phone calls and we need to make
emergency phone calls it'll still make a
Wi-Fi call for you so even if you don't
have your phone with you once you update
your device if you have to make an
emergency phone call you're going to be
able to do it via the Wi-Fi which is
actually a pretty cool feature now I
know there's probably a few other things
that are going to be coming out but
right now this seems like a pretty cool
thing and unfortunately though it's only
for AT&amp;amp;T use at the moment i'm sure that
i'll change but for those people out
there who use ATT which i'm sure is a
massive assed world market you guys are
going to have something that's going to
be pretty cool so 9.2 beta is now out
it's available and if you've got an AT&amp;amp;T
account and you've got other devices you
can now turn that device into a phone
and even use it without having your
Apple phone with you so that's pretty
cool stuff if you guys interested in
more we'll have a link down below where
you guys can check that out now privacy
it's a very touchy subject around the
world it seems like the people in the UK
are taking steps even further to I don't
know maybe invade your privacy I'm sure
that in their view they feel that
they're protecting you but they have
this brand new bill that's hit the
market that makes them retain well not
actually them it makes let's let me back
a bijoux a second what basically is is
that there's a slot it's going to be
coming out there that basically says
that all companies that do
telecommunication stuff must keep a
record for one year of everything that
people do on the internet now they call
it a slightly slim down
version it's not like you know we're not
fully keeping track of your web browsing
but basically they're keeping track of
anything that you buy now I don't know
it seems kind of weird because why are
they keeping track of your money now I
can understand maybe maybe this is the
point that they're doing it is they're
saying hey you know if you buy a bomb or
you're buying some to buy a bomb
they want to know way the ahead of
time so they can stop that and for that
that's cool but the only thing is these
lines are so touchy and encryption laws
don't seem to be so clear right now they
seem to have a clear thing of what
they're doing with this but encryption
laws companies out there still don't
know exactly what they're going to be
able to allow to do and what they won't
be allowed to do so that's pretty crazy
stuff and if it hits in the UK you know
dang well that it's going to be coming
over here now just like a gun a weapon a
word things can be misused by whoever
the person is using them so that's where
you have to really take this into
consideration report just like that
movie Minority Report they obviously
stop the minor report thing because they
were like hey there's a chance even if
it's a slim chance in hell that
we make a mistake and do something so
they stopped it now people start
collecting all your information on what
you buy and all your money just imagine
them starting to sell this to
people it's even more marketing
 so all of a sudden they'll be
like oh yeah you know i knows you know
steve wynn a chester he buys this this
isn't this so lets spam the out of
this guy with this stuff and sucking min
with those whole mentality of you need
more and we all know it everywhere
especially in the countries that are
doing better i'm sure i'm probably the
third world countries out there it may
be not be as much and you know honesty
you guys probably in some ways have a
much more peaceful life friend of mine
told me visit the philippines he told me
there's not all those technological
 but he said that people they
were really relaxed they were more
family-oriented they were having fun
with their life here everything's about
getting ahead getting ahead of the game
getting more money getting more this
because you got to be competitive you
got to be doing this than that you know
so kind of got a little bit wrong track
there but still in a technological world
I don't really know if I want all my
information being stored now right now
this proposed bill says that they'll
keep it on hand for one year ok so they
keep it on hand
here but then what happens with that
information though after that one hears
up I mean somebody's going to get it
somewhere so I remember my point was
that it's how it's used now this is all
sounds well and good on books taking all
your information to protect you but all
that information could also be used
against you I really want to see what
you guys have to say down below once
again I'm like what the you know
but for you guys out there who like iOS
updates hey 9.2 is here turn any of your
Apple devices into a phone so that's
pretty cool stuff and you guys in the UK
I know I got a bunch of fans there I
know you guys are good probably correct
me or something i probably made
something somewhere probably little
mistaken you guys are correct but i'm
down with that i love you so I wonder
what you guys think especially what do
you guys think about that do you guys
feel that being locked down and having
all your information is a good thing to
protect you do you need big brother
wiping your ass or do you think that
this is kind of a fallacy type thing and
they shouldn't be do it at all I want to
see your comments down below I'm elric
you guys been watching tech of tomorrow
with what the news and we'll see
you guys back here for more later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
