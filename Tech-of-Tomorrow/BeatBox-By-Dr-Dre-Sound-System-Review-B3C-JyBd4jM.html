here on the tech of tomorrow YouTube
channel well today we've got something
pretty interesting for you guys to
review we've got the new beatbox by dr.
dre now if a lot of you people follow
hip-hop and R&amp;amp;B you guys should know who
dr. Dre is he's like one of the kings of
this industry this gentleman has been
lately been creating lots of deals for
his products
he has headphones he has HP deal for
laptops and now he has a beatbox today
we're gonna bring you a review of that
beats box now this thing comes in at
about 399 dollars but there are some
really good quality things to it for
those people out there who like to
listen to their iTunes and have all
their stuff store in their little phone
that a little iTunes playing device you
just stick this little device into the
speaker and listen to your music
wherever you want to go it's actually
pretty portable if you have a gym or a
backpack bag you could actually fill
this thing in the back of it and take it
wherever you wanted to listen to it okay
so some of the really good things about
this that we found we're listening to it
is that for hip-hop and that type of
music pop this thing has really good
separation you can hear the separation
to Bay's and you can hear a separation
of all the high end treble stuff very
well the sound also fills the room and
plays very loudly so you people out
there who want to have a really good
stereo system but you'd like to be able
to take it with you wherever you go but
not sacrifice the quality of sound this
new beatbox may fill your niche if
you're the type of person who wants to
not spend a lot of money on a system but
yet still have a good quality system
$399 might seem a lot of money to some
people but by the time you go out and
buy the separate components including a
subwoofer you're probably already at
that price level and you can't take that
stuff with you whatsoever so dr. Dre has
really like taken a to kind of the next
level now the beatbox you AB truly is a
beatbox it's louder than any of those
portable things that we carried around
the 70s and 80s by any measure so at the
end of the day I say that if you a need
something that's portable it's great B
you need something that sounds good it's
great $399
isn't that much money if you really
think about it for a complete stereo
system the only drawback I'd say here is
that the remote control is made a little
bit cheesy but overall when you get all
these other features that's really not
anything to drag the system down at the
end of the day so overall I say hey
congrats to you dr. Dre for all your
great deals and this new beatbox really
is a quality product overall</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
