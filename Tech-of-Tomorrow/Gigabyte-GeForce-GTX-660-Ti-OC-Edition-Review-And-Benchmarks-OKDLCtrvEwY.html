tomorrow if you guys happen to mix the
unboxing of the new geforce gtx 660ti
from gigabyte this is their overclocked
version make sure you check out the link
in description below or it's probably on
the screen or behind me and pop back and
check out the unboxing right now I've
got the card in my hand and some of the
things that are specific to the gigabyte
card beyond the normal features is their
cooling apparatus their cooling
apparatus is their wind forced
technology now this cooling apparatus
covers the Carter it actually extends
way past the actual PCB on the back of
the card that's one of the main features
of their card they also have their own
overclocking and software tool called OC
guru - you guys can check that out we'll
have a screenshot of that back there as
well
those are the things that are really
pertinent to this card this card's gonna
be coming into market at about 300
dollars and if you guys saw the unboxing
you know all the stuff that comes in the
box and all the close-up shots the card
so for now let's actually jump in let's
talk about the actual specific features
the speeds and feeds and then let's go
check out the performance of this gtx
660ti from gigabyte so let's first off
just talk about some of the things that
we want to really reiterate that are
specific to the gigabyte overclocked
version of the gtx 660ti you know before
we talked about it but you can see their
whole cooling apparatus is right here
this is their wind force cooling
technology it's anti turbos which
doesn't make a bunch of noise why it's
running underneath it is the complete
cooling solution you can see the
aluminum fins all throughout the card
and you can also see the copper heat
pipes going completely through it as
well you can also see there are two
6-pin power connectors the geforce gtx
660ti typically draws up to 134 watts of
power and most non TDP apps this is what
she'll experience with the power target
slider set its default one at percent
settings now if you wish to overclock
the card we highly recommend that you
max the slider out to 123 percent at
this setting the board will drop to 165
watts and non TDP apps so now let's talk
features the geforce gtx 660ti has been
designed for gamers who want to enjoy
their games with the graphics settings
in a
turned up they also geared this card for
a 1920 by 1200 or 1920 by 1080
resolution now one thing that all cards
will have in common they will all
contain thirteen hundred and forty four
CUDA cores and seven SMX units the
memory subsystem the geforce gtx 660ti
consists of three 64-bit memory
controllers for a total of 192 bit
memory controller it also has two
gigabytes of gddr5 memory now the base
clock speed of the geforce gtx 660ti is
915 megahertz and the typical boost
clock speed is 980 megahertz the
gigabyte overclocked version however
ships with a base clock of a thousand 33
megahertz and has a boost clock of 1111
megahertz or 1111 mega it's kind of a
tricky number to say now all cards also
ship with a memory clock speed of 608
megahertz which transfers to 144 point 2
gigabytes a second total memory
bandwidth pretty fast stuff now let's
talk about the actual size of the card
the actual PCB the silicon is actually
under 9 inches but measuring the card
with the cooler it measures 10 inches
long by 4 inches high by about an inch
and a half thick we'll have this all
translated into millimeters for you guys
in the screen for you guys over in
Europe now the rear eye of the card this
is actually my favorite configuration I
like having two dual link DVI
connections a standard DisplayPort and a
standard HDMI I'm not really a big fan
of the smaller ones using the AMD cards
although that's what all the people who
use Apple and everything are using I
prefer this one so those are pretty much
the features of the card now let's move
in and let's check out the performance
of the card and see how it does against
the competition
all right folks so there you have the
specs you guys have seen how fast the
card is you see how cool it runs now out
of all the cards I've tested the
gigabyte card actually is running very
very cool I was very happy with that the
cards running very cool its numbers are
good it's gonna be coming to market at
$300 so it's right in there to compete
in the mid arena of things now there's
all kinds of cool features that are
specific to Nvidia cards themselves
which could be a whole nother can of
worms you know they're adaptive vsync
all that different type of different
stuff they have for their card you know
all of their multi monitor technology
all that stuffs in there but that'll be
some other videos today you would just
want to get you guys the basic features
show you how fast the card was and let
you guys make a buying decision based
off those things say hey is that the
card I'm looking for so this card is
priced right there in the middle of
where the cards that they'll be cards
probably anywhere from $2.99 all the way
up to 369 this card's right there in the
lower 300s it competes well I feel at
the end of the day this gigabyte card is
a very hot product for those looking for
a mid-range video card in the three
hundred dollar range
so you guys saw it here and we'll see
you guys back on tech o tomorrow see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
