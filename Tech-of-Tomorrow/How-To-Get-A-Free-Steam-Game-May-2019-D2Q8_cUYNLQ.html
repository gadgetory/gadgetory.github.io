to hit us and what better way than to
spend your weekend then lounging about
playing some games and possibly how
about winning some new games that's
right winning some new games not a great
thing to do so starting now which is
this Friday this is going to be a
concurring thing so every Friday we're
going to be giving away games we're
gonna be giving away 10 random steam
codes here on tech of tomorrow here over
on the YouTube channel and we're also
gonna be giving away 10 over on the
great old thing that everybody loves
Twitter I know some people don't like it
but if you don't wit use Twitter and
don't care about Twitter whatsoever then
hey guess what you don't have to worry
about it you can hang out over here so I
just want to state all of these games
are probably in like the 10 to $19 range
no I'm not giving away 10 of the $70
games that are out there I'm buying all
these out of my pocket and things are
tight as they are but still I like to
give away things to the fans and people
are always saying hey do some more
contests so I was like hey okay cool
let's just get some cool games that
people can play so you know if you're
not a total game snob you just want to
get a cool game to play or possibly give
the game to your kid or somebody else
you know you know Steam games are really
great games there's all kinds of stuff
all kinds of different genres that are
going on out there and just a lot of
different fun stuff not everything you
know is about that $70 you know certain
shooter game that you know that gets
blown out of proportion everybody's out
there going oh my god oh my god there
are a lot of other games out there
especially by indie companies and stuff
that people just really don't really get
to check out or they just get looked
over and a lot of these games that I try
to get our games that get a lot of good
ratings so that people are like hey this
is a really cool game but there's still
affordable games that way you know if
you like the game and everything you're
playing it and you recommend it to
somebody they can be like hey cool like
I can actually afford that game it's not
gonna cost me $70 to jump in and play it
so all you have to do it's really simple
to enter all you do is leave a comment
down below and make sure that you are
subbed to this
site if you're not sub then pleased sub
the channel now and I would ask that you
will be kind of to throw at least a stub
for at least six months you know and not
just sub just to get it in on the
contest because I'm gonna start doing a
lot more contests again and by the way
this particular contest like all the
ones I'm going to try to have in the
future will be Worldwide's this is a
worldwide event
um but please on your YouTube channel
please make sure that you have in your
channel that you can communicate with me
because the problem that I had before is
when I was doing giveaways here on
YouTube a lot of times I get the winner
and I couldn't even go and message him
because their channel wasn't set up at
all for them to receive messages or talk
to anybody and I'd say hey buddy you've
won this game and then they couldn't
contact me there because they didn't
know it was up so like if something like
that happens you know and you can
contact me somewhere else and prove that
you who are all well you know who you
are we can work it out but basically
leave a comment and then please sub the
channel and by the way there's a very
easy way somebody asked me this last
time they're like hey dude how do you
even know if we're subbed to your
channel it's simple I just go over to
your silent channel and look at your
subscription box and you're either sub
to the channel or you're not it's not
rocket science it's pretty easy stuff so
with that out of the way and this is it
though cool games though every single
one of these games is actually really
nice they're very fun they got high
ratings you're not gonna be like if
you're this person who likes to have fun
with games believe me you won't be
disappointed so leave a comment down
below sub up the channel here on tech of
tomorrow and if you want to be involved
in what's going on over on Twitter all
you have to do is go over there leave a
comment share it and we'll have a link
over there as well for what's going on
over there for both these particular
giveaways the one here and the one
that's on Twitter but for now on just
marking your hat every Friday I'm gonna
be announcing this giveaway at 5 o'clock
at night and then I'm going to be
announcing it Sunday so on Sunday you
can be looking at the channel look in
your inbox to see if you've won and we
should all have a lot of fun with this
I'm mo work you guys been watching techo
