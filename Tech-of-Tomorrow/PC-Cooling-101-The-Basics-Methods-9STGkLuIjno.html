tech of tomorrow I'm your co-host and
today we're gonna talk to you guys about
the different types of cooling methods
used for the PC I know for a lot of
people out there advanced users like oh
I know all that stuff but believe it or
not I get email all time from people
saying hey I still don't know what these
different types of cooling are so for
those people are interested stay tuned
because let's check it out and let's
talk about the different types of
cooling that you can use on your PC in
the beginning CPUs weren't very hot at
all they actually ran quite cool they
start off using them in phone technology
and that sidestep many many years ago
before you even saw the onset of the PC
and for those type of things they used
what was called passive cooling now
passive coin was basically just a
heatsink
on top of the CPU that helped dissipate
the heat away from it there was no fan
no moving parts no nothing like that
whatsoever that's passive cooling not
exactly what any of us is enthusiasts
use these days we all need to have at
least what the next step in the phase is
and that is active cooling what is
active cooling more like the name active
you know suggests it means there's
something moving something's happening
that means a fan so we've been active
cooling you get the heatsink usually
some a bunch of heat fins to help take
that stuff away and dissipate it then
you get a fan helping to blow it away
even more away from the CPU there are
however a lot of uses for air cooling
around the world the only thing is
though is if you live in a really really
super hot place to keep that damn thing
cool you're gonna have to have that fan
going full blast which is gonna create a
lot of noise now things like not to us
silver arrow these have been proven
again over and over again with the right
CPU they can do great cooling and
achieve decent overclocking events next
up is liquid cooling and this is what I
personally prefer it's what I've been
using for years and it's just like
basically my cup of tea when it comes to
cooling now as far as liquid cooling
goes there are two types of units that
you can get your hands on there's a
closed loop system now most closed loop
systems contain a single radiator the
heat sink your pump and all your stuff
is all pre bill
inside of it and you be just put this
onto your system just like you'd attach
a normal heat sink and fan unit only
difference is it's prefilled liquid the
drawback to this however is no expansion
is very very limited and it's usually
only used for one component in a system
at a time custom loop systems are an
entirely different breed of animal and
these are what we usually base our
systems on here at tikka tomorrow once
in a while we'll use a closed loop
system because we like to make things
nice and convenient but if we're
building some kind of crazy super system
you can bet it's going to be a custom
loop system so what does that mean
custom loop system oh what's he talking
about
speaking alien so basically a custom
loop system is you can cool many
different parts you can go all crazy you
can cool your memory you can cool your
CPU your GPU you can cool it all attach
a bunch of multi different radiators
pumps and have this huge giant system
going that's gonna keep your system
running cool and pretty damn quiet now
this requires though somebody who has at
least a little bit of degree of
knowledge on how to be technical on how
to do technical stuff when I got sick I
finally decided I need somebody to help
me do this stuff so I hired Anthea
Reynolds you guys know mr. Asha - he's
our own house builder and he's been
doing this stuff for me for years and
years and years I really like a custom
loop system and I kind of always had a
general rule of thumb like one rad per
part so like for me if I have a CPU then
I need a rad for my CPU maybe
single-single might work or maybe double
depending on the build but at a video
card
I want another rat I got another video
card I want to know the rad the reason
for this is that the more liquid I've
got flowing that system and flowing
through their radiators then the cooler
my system is going to be able to be when
my CPU is running hot now this next type
of cooling kind of like went out kind of
like disco did and this is called
Peltier or thermoelectric cooling this
was actually cool before CPUs actually
became really hot yeah I'm just saying
that's really how it was the problem is
its refrigeration type cooling you have
one side a tag that's very very cold
like refrigerator but the other side of
that is very very hot and that needs to
be cooled well you cool it use water
liquid anything else that can sometimes
create condensation and as CPUs became
hotter and hotter and
Peltier cooling just kind of like just
slid the backseat because it's really
only good to keep a CPU cool that you
know is not gonna be running too hot so
those are all the types and stuff that
you use for cooling at your home any of
these types can be done depending on
your technical level or if you want to
have a buddy come help you you can use
and do all those types of things at home
and they're all available now some
drawbacks I also feel about Peltier that
killed it was you needed a totally
separate 12 volt power supply yeah which
is like it a cost of like you know 60 80
bucks just to be able to power the coil
that was doing the Peltier so rather
expensive didn't work well went out the
window now are there other types of
cooling out there yeah there are there
are plenty of guys out there go out to
the extreme overclocking events and
they're doing all kinds of crazy stuff
with liquid nitrogen and all kinds of
other stuff but this stuff is not for
the home user at all you're not gonna
really see a guy at home and you know
talking to his friends what are you
doing do it all
I'm liquid nitrogen all day long just
cooling my computer it's just too much
hassle nobody is really going to be
doing it sometimes you get special
licensing depending on where you live to
get that giant tank you know over to
your house to be able to use anything
what are you well there or something or
what else are you doing hmm
so it's just a lot you know I paying the
butt to use those stuff but if you're
gonna become an extremely overclocker
then hey you may want to check out some
of those pro got there and see what they
do but none of that stuff's for a home
use the stuff I'll talked about today
can be done by anybody at home so thanks
for watching tikka tomorrow another host
on I hope you guys like this video I
know for people out there there's one
question that I got to talk about and
that is done ambient temperature gotta
apologize I made a video before and I
said the ambient temperature was
different between the different cooling
I was entirely wrong the energy is all
the same so no matter what kind of
cooling that you're using the ambient
temperature room will be affected the
same depending on what side of system
you're using because the heat and the
energy obviously has to go somewhere so
peace out thanks for watching you see
