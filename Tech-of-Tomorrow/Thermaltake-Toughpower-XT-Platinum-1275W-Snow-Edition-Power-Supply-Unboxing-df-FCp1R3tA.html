to the tech tomorrow youtube channel
today we're going to show you guys
something really cool from the people
over at thermaltake this is their tough
power x t power supply you guys are
really going to like this bad boy it's
filled with blocking our see the box
back here behind me twelve hundred and
seventy-five wats platinum-certified
modular and hey if you guys are into
that totally clean light build this is
going to be the power supply you're
gonna want to check out fully supporting
SLI crossfire with plenty of power and
breathing room to support your system so
with that said let's check out what
comes in this box and check out this new
cool power supply from thermaltake
alright so let's first check out the box
thermaltake 1275 what toughpower xt snow
edition seven-year warranty totally
Green SLI twice I think that somebody
made a little mistake here put the wrong
stick around you to be SLI and crossfire
somebody is probably drinking that day
or some out partying you know you guys
can see it's 80 plus platinum you guys
can see a quick picture of it here don't
if there's anything too much more
exciting on the back of the box will
spin it around anyways as you guys can
see it so we have one main 24 pin power
connector one eps 12-volt connector
eight pen one EP s 80 x 12 volt
connector four plus four pin peripheral
connection for pin floppy disk drive
connector for Penn say to connector
5-pin pcie connector six plus two for
your 8 pin and then pcie connector six
pen so there's two of those six of those
15 of those one of those six of those
one of those one of those and one of
those like that Funkadelic alright so
here's some of the power specs for you
guys out there who are totally into that
kind of stuff talked about how they use
high-end Japanese capacitors and
electrolytes and their stuff so enough
about that let's type it in here and get
to what you guys want to usually see the
power supply it sucks so we're off the
bat see this nice big foam thing here
protecting everything go ahead and get
that out of the way power supply cable
here all the accessory cables they are
all all white so we talked about those a
minute ago so i'm not going to read
integrate all this again to check these
out they're flat they're white a lot of
you guys have been talking about the
braided but I got to tell you for cable
management nothing beats a flat cable
you know you know they say flat girls
are easy to nail well flat cables are
easy to put in the back of your system
just the way it lots of cool stuff there
I'm liking this already
the most people out there who are
totally in the AMD theme this is going
to be the shiznit for you you know what
I'm talking about baby so here we've got
it right here the 1275 why 80 plus
platinum toughpower xt snow edition this
is the usuals manual not much there and
just plays in the specs go ahead and get
this out of the way really really
awesome this is actually one of the
best-looking power supplies I've seen
really nice flip it around show you guys
aside place about cable management hence
the flat cables of which I spoke of a
moment ago because that's what they're
for flip it around the back loop it
around against you guys actually see it
here's the input voltage on and off
switch simple design here's the fan so
the thermaltake warranty void if remove
so if you actually move this panel
you're avoiding the warranty of this
unit so both sides actually look the
same so this side right here though
actually does have some other stuff
check it out I didn't really notice
before but there are actually three
lights that the cameramen zoom in here
we have stand by PC actual and
temperature kind of nifty don't seem to
me power supplies here's the back you
can see that all the power cables are
inside so but their sleeve though and
their sleeve with very nice White's
leaving now some people will talk about
a little it's my modular ok whatever
we're going to get past this for now
while when I say modular I mean these
cables are in there because you need
your power cables having them modular is
completely asinine no reason so for now
on if it's got all these i'm calling it
modular if you don't like it sue me
there you go so here's all your PCIe
connections all your profile connections
extra for a few connections all cool
stuff so so that's it guys from
thermaltake 1275 what's hey man it's 80
plus platinum certified so it's
basically the highest that you can get
built for speed built for super SLI and
crossfire systems you
a lot of power here which means lots of
headroom now if you're running an sli or
crossfire system happinesses power is
really good because you do want to have
headroom the less your power supply
stresses the longer to last now sure
could somebody they'll go I could go
ahead and I could use a 600 watt power
supply to do the same thing man yeah
it's going to stress the out of
your power supply the same time bro you
can run that same setup on this and have
zero stress the power supply lasts ten
times as long so take that to the bank
but anyway you guys saw it here we'll
see you guys back here in tech or
tomorrow later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
