back to another edition of tech of
tomorrow I'm mark your host here once
again with my special guest Leon from
gigabyte who's gonna show us their
latest z87 ny5 motherboards we're gonna
bring you like the guys basically the
unboxing in the overview and we're gonna
get Leon handle all the action because
it's his motherboard so Leon you're on
the floor drum roll please all right
guys
here we have egg you can buy z87 and
Wi-Fi motherboard this is a mini ITX
something it's small it's small it's
smaller than small micro is micro ATX is
small this is smaller than small Oh
smaller than your Winky so what we have
we see we see the market trending over
to mini ITX so we pushed out mini ITX
lines we have the h87 this time we
brought the z87 and Wi-Fi as you can see
we actually include an 802 point you
love an AC adapter now AC is the new
standard for wireless exactly gigabit
speeds which is all 5 gigahertz speeds
and higher right right so 8 I believe
it's 867 Meg's a second or something
that Wireless then hey either way it's
gonna be fast it's fast so basically you
don't have to worry about getting a
third net cable you have a wireless
installed already all you have to do is
get the drivers for it and you're ready
to go so we're gonna start off with the
quick unboxing for you so you have a so
you have a look at this motherboard and
then we'll show you guys some shots of
the box later so you can see what you're
getting right on so let's go it started
taking it out so so I just want to point
out that this time around with the
wireless adapter that includes bluetooth
we've actually shrunk down that module
so you're actually getting one single
antenna for two things
what about near-field does it have that
as well this one does not have any NFC
you don't see NFC as a big thing right
now because of course this will fit with
this it's really not that big video the
phone it's more important that a
motherboard yeah right so in the future
it might be something we might start
implementing if you guys want to see it
definitely leave a comment leave a
comment down below saying hey we want to
see that on the motherboards and then
gigabyte we listen comment message us on
Facebook that's always a good way to get
our attention and we'll see that
she had bomber you know just let them
know alright guys so this is what you're
gonna get when you purchase this box you
get all these extras but in a free box
and a free box so yeah you get a
multilingual installation guide the
motherboard manual the driver disk
that's included inside a back io shield
you get the Bluetooth and wireless
antenna which is built into one now and
you get two SATA 3 cables and the
motherboard itself and the motherboard
is stuck so boom so now you guys can see
the motherboard is completely inside of
a completely sealed package anti-static
wraps so we'll go ahead and we'll just
go ahead and break the anti-static wrap
on here and see that nice new car smell
oh yeah it has that nice new electronic
smell smell oh yeah I like that smell I
don't know why I grew up liking that
electronic smell so here's the
motherboard you guys can see it's
actually pretty nicely laid out lots of
room for your stuff you have room for a
full line video card if you want one
slots for your memory but I'm gonna hand
it over here and let Leon explain all
the features of this motherboard so I
think it out man so this motherboard you
know that utilizes Intel's fourth gen
processors so any 1150 socket LGA 1150
will fit in here as long as you have the
drivers uh sorry as long as your BIOS
works for it then you're good to go
we have two DIMM slots for ddr3 memory
PCI Express by 16 and what's the native
memory speed right that bastard support
to support 21 33 1867 see under XMP
before the native speed would still be
1600 off okay but doesn't but does it
allow X and people yes okay no of Texan
with XMP profile very important alright
so a quick thing we have your standard
ATX power your 4 pin 8 4 pin ATX power
for your CPU we have a 4 pin PWM band
header here we have your front panel
connectors up here and then we have USB
2.0 right here and then USB 3.0 right
right USB 3.0 along with the fourth of
the four additional SATA ports 4 SATA
ports you have your battery the wireless
part that we talked about earlier and
bluetooth
so that's your AC moving on to the back
we have USB 2.0 a ps2 HDMI and believe
that's 2 HDMI and a DVI right there and
also your antenna connectors for your
wireless and Bluetooth engine and the
antennas are also inside the package as
well correct the antenna is inside the
package so like we mentioned earlier
this antenna runs for both the Bluetooth
and the wireless so excellent versus
having to have one antenna for each you
can now combine it save some space and
it looks good also very clean it's good
that what we're gonna be doing with this
motherboard is we keep trying to bring
these steam systems the tail but things
keep changing all the day and time we're
doing it but now we're going to be doing
this we'll be building a full on steam
machine in conjunction with gigabyte
using this motherboard so hopefully in
the next week you guys will see us as
you get all those parts together and
we'll bring that first video to you guys
because this motherboard is actually
perfect for this type of situation
it's small it's elegant it still has
enough power under the hood to you know
to have some cojones but yet it's not
gonna be this giant thing in a giant
case so if there's somebody looking to
build like an HT PC or you do like a
steam box like we're doing this is gonna
be the perfect type of solution for that
and the fact that you can actually put a
full video card in it I mean I don't
know if it's gonna be able to take like
the most giant a 780ti you know or those
giant video cards but some of the newer
video cards that are coming out from
Nvidia especially the new 750ti that
came out will fit in this thing
amazingly and with the power of that
you'll have a great little system that
doesn't even need that much cooling in a
small box right and so just to finish
this off we have four USB 3.0 s in the
back and most importantly to land Nick's
know now these lambics on here they both
shotgun cable do they work together they
can work together for T me okay perfect
alright and then we have your regular
audio you have a spit if and then the v
audio jack so that's all I have folks
and this thing's very fall a bit of the
very fall it's very fall in the fall
when all the things are falling this
board matches them none just kidding
but look z87 n Wi-Fi small economical
powerful perfect that little small build
that you're looking to build for your
personal system yeah I'm not gonna roll
that alright then
well hey I'm more particular tomorrow
this is leon from gigabyte liam we thank
you again for stopping by and we'll see
you guys
background checking tomorrow very soon
as we bring this board to you in a brand
new system Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
