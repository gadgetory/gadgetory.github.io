teco tomorrow youtube channel i know
request your host and today we're going
to be bringing a first look hands-on on
the new third-generation ipad that's
right
this thing in my hand actually has more
pixels per square inch than this thing
behind me actually a million more pixels
pretty incredible stuff now you guys
although this new iPad was announced the
other day the model that I have here in
my hands is the 4g LTE model this is the
18 t model now my friend Jonathan
actually owns this thing lent to me said
he's going to exchange it and actually
get one for verizon since they guess he
thinks that AT&amp;amp;T sucks but the purpose
of today's video we're going to jump buy
into this this thing has 2048 x 1536
resolution all on this little screen we
talked about it last week this features
the new a5x processor nose is a dual
core processor that features quad-core
graphics I know that some of you people
out there had a lot of questions about
this but to clarify that's what it is
having a dual core processor actually
allows the system to run a lot longer
and have much better battery life you
get 10 hours of normal battery life but
if you actually use the 4g capabilities
you get only nine hours now this one
right here this is the 32 gigabyte model
that's in my hand and basically today
we're just going to jump it is we're
actually just going to show you some of
the nice easy games that are on this
thing to play now I know this thing
costs around seven hundred dollars
that's very expensive ooh pricele pricey
but it also has a lot of features so for
those folks out there who are fans of
the Apple products this is a really cool
one let's jump in and take a look at the
couple of the games on this here cool
little ipad 3rd generation alright so
check it out folks this is sky gamblers
air supremacy the dogfight one going to
go ahead and just press in here and
start playing the game now the controls
are all on the screen use this to fly
around move around void missiles
yeah so I'm finally kicking a little bit
of but in this game not the most easiest
game I've ever played to be honest with
you but I suppose it just takes practice
I'm sure all the kids out there were
probably kicking ass on it and thinking
I'm a lame duck now we're gonna do a
little racing folks this is one the
latest racing games they have on here
let this little intro here you guys can
see the graphics look pretty cool almost
like Need for Speed a couple jens beck
so there we go to HD real racing or to
rhd real racing so I've never played
this before so they're offering me a
rookie bonus of twenty-five thousand
dollars since I'm broke as a joke i'll
go ahead and take their cash so they're
offering me a Volvo I don't like Volvo's
volkswagen golf that's even worse but I
guess what the heck alright we'll go for
a golf there we go all right folks let's
just do a little quick race here and
just check out this little game writer
and see how it does
so it's really worried about this folks
is that this thing like this it's not
weird but there's a gyro inside of this
thing so that you're actually your iPad
is actually the steering wheel I mean
it's kind of a cool idea i'm still kind
of getting used to the controls on this
thing but it's pretty fun still cut a
little corner right here that's right
big daddy's on his way in if i don't
crash out i personally like this game
quite a bit this one's actually kind of
fun it's not what I'm used to but it's
pretty fun to play I'm not sucking too
bad I guess I'm mini-dome whoa okay i
had an ipad crash there whoa alright
guys so here we go from the second lap
I'm still racing around this little
thing trying to figure the steering went
out I'm getting better hit that fool get
him out of my way got on my way fool I
pity the fool gets in my way now get out
of my way I got to tell you guys things
are so trippy using this thing as a
steering wheel I mean obviously a great
idea just takes some getting used to
I've moved up to a crappy sixth place on
the final lap see if i can get my
positioning a little better here got to
fifth place I know it sucks still but a
my first time playing this thing my mac
but he may all it look really really
easy and I guess it is pretty easy I'm
just not used to it it's kind of weird
because the thing accelerates on its own
and I don't know how to do anything else
really honor to accelerate it or
anything to make it go faster so I feel
like I'm kind of stuck at whatever speed
it's making me go at not only Tempe
about that but oh here we go in fourth
place fourth place fourth place
oh can we do it can we do it oh can we
do it I'm in third place folks I am in
third place here we go
race complete so I took number three not
too shabby for my first time on the
track all right guys let's take a look
at one more game on here this is for the
sports fans out there this is foosball
you guys know that's where you'll get
crazy and drunk in the bar and play some
football so I'll play the old one player
game foosball right listens kind of I
suppose somebody's gonna like this but
for me foosball was just kind of half
susina a little floozy on the floozy I'm
trying to score point here so we can
show you guys some points here but yeah
whoa yeah finally scored a goal here all
right whatever but he right here we go
try it again I'm moving my fingers all
running screens crazy if he's got to
keep moving around moving around like a
little finger workout going on here oh
well folks that's about it for foosball
i'm not a big foosball fan first place
because this is one more the games we're
showing you on here oh those red
bastards scored a goal against me i
guess i just plainly suck at this
anyways but hey guys this is just
showing you guys a few games now all of
these games you showed you these are all
the high-resolution retina based games
for kids and stuff out there this will
probably really popular me i'm the pc
gamer i probably would never really use
this unless i was in an airport or
something if I actually owned one I
borrowed this from a friend of mine
thanks a lot to my friend tldtoday for
lending me this thing thanks a lot
Jonathan but that's it you guys saw this
is the new ipad 3rd generation 2048 x
1536 screen a million more pixels more
than my HDTV in my living room so that's
it see you folks back here on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
