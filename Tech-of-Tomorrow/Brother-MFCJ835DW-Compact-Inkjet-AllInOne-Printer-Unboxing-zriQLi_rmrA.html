unboxing by Empire Rising Sun but every
bring one boxing of new product from
Brava oh yes is mfc j 8 35 are you going
to like unboxing of this so before
further do we grab soda with postsolder
hot we need to unboxing with sword
episode in Reverse style okay we spin
for you for final cut now we see what
inside
harder but I hope you guys like that was
supposed to be a funny begin to hope you
lies like that I just thought it was
kind of fun to break out the old samurai
sword and open the top of this is the
mfc this is a.j 835 DW it's a
multi-function senator printer by
brother says brother hecho sighs that's
right I got this thing because it was on
sale for 99 bucks at best buy so I
figure I get sometimes go by and used to
the house it has Wi-Fi has pretty quick
printing has a scanner has a little
window that pops up its kind of all
kinds of cool stuff so let's just go
ahead and see now what comes inside the
box go ahead and pop the top now there's
some struction guides right here it
actually is telling you all the content
how to remove it a little things are
going to come out of this if I can see
power cables right here and go ahead and
move that there's the phone jack line
this thing also is it back sent can say
that as well and pull it out of there so
there's a fax in it as well and I'm
using all this stuff so that's why I got
it so I'm going to get that of the way
let's see here basically the printer is
going to be easy to come out if I just
have to slide the whole thing out and
you just like kind of a case video and
pop it out of it some stuffs gonna fall
out that hey no big deal sound a fixed a
show the box and now the box is gonna go
for our live Leigh tough some effect
written it goes oh yeah we love time so
right here on top that's some suck to
hear looks like it's the drivers CD for
the mfc j8 350w the starters guide all
here I'm sure you got to probably follow
the instructions sometimes you install
the CD first before you even hook it up
sometimes you don't just read the
instruction I'll tell you what to do
buck that out of the way so the CD DVD
blu-ray disc you can print this with
those as well you can put a blu-ray in
here a CD in if you've got pictures and
images on it you can also print them
directly off this printer which is one
of the reasons I got it as well they
said this is multifunction it really is
so this is the tray some more
instruction guides and stuff right here
whether this is good take out all the
bags you guys can see exactly what it is
it's a free pack some photo paper looks
like three little photo papers they're
really small a product safety guide
users guide a kind of stuff and get that
all the way so now let's jump to the
heart of the matter what skips the
printer itself a little side phone
packages they're removing one who's the
other one large plastic bag around the
entire thing come back from your airtime
different kind of large boxes bag so
here it is according the stitches and
picking stuff up and then using it so I
was uber that's on here you guys and see
what it is so starting off on this side
we can see you have the Wi-Fi here's the
on and off switch right here we have the
fax scan the copy of the photo the LCD
screen everything's going to be right in
here so you can control right from the
front the keypad you stop your exit
underneath here this is your scanner
scan all your documents and everything
whether it be text or whether it be
photo everything else see you guys just
seeing all the features on the front all
the ink and everything is actually down
here you pull up this little tray right
here here's all the ink and everything's
inside of here like once again I got it
all secure this little lovely blue tape
going to remove all that off of there
for all your paper these mini go as well
get eaten by the jaws of the printer
the ink actually goes in right here and
so that's pretty much it in the back of
the thing there's one of their spot
where you put ink in go ahead and put
that around traditionally here is a
cartridge you go so that's pretty much
it guys I mean this is the brother and
that's cj8 three small I've DW
all-in-one everything that's about it
