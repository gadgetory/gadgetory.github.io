cooler mattress in the name today we're
gonna be looking at a really cool set of
headphones new people hope and cooler
master this is their new so offensive
now these things are coming to market
about sixty nine dollars they're on sale
everywhere including amazon and if you
guys want to check out the rest of them
video follow along as I use this trusty
knife ten bucks is cool set of
headphones so follow the frack along
all right so check it out folks here it
is these are the new cooler master CM
storm sonus gaming headphones 53
millimeter driver explosive sound gaming
headset now maybe the cameron to bounce
the camera over to me i just want to
start off by saying something this is
the last set of headphones that i got
from the people over at cooler master
and i just want to say that out of all
of the USB headphones that i've ever
used in my life these things right here
are definitely the number one set now
i'm really hoping that the CM store
sonus headphones are just as awesome and
with that let's start to do the unboxing
i got my trusty knife right here gonna
go ahead a couple quick insertions here
like a surge in whoa hey I didn't like
that one so I think I'm gonna do it like
this there we go a little bit different
there but now we got those two old
plastic tabs up so she you guys real
quick the back in the box you can see on
the back as the introduction says the CM
storm sonus gaming headset is a
lightweight all around gaming headset
designed to be your one solution for
powerful yet crisp and clear sound when
you are gaming alright then quick pop
here at the top another puppy off the
top the internals call my some plastic
tin there go ahead and remove it out of
the box you guys can see the box and
since we're back in the office we can
once again throw the box at the
cameramen Oh a solid smack on the
cameramen that time all right here you
go so check these things out from first
glance they look really cool so let's go
ahead and we'll take them off of here
give you a little little plastic jabbers
back here hold it in place so I'll go
ahead and just remove these two little
things here there's one on each side one
here and one here these are holding
everything in place when they're all
flapping around the internet we're not
flapper on the internet when they're in
shipping or whatever they don't come
flying at you now let's see if we can
pull the headphones off of here
nice and no he's all that plastic isn't
notably noisy plastic yes it is all
right then so now the plastics there
once again cameraman wow that makes
enough noise I don't even open to need
sound effects so got the microphone here
we're get the camera to take some
close-ups this side fully adjustable
I'll breaking up here so you can
actually get the true sound up in the
microphone here's the other side now
some sets of headphones come with
different type of little inner pads
these wouldn't just come with these nice
soft foam ones I like those now I don't
see you can see you can see the
nomenclature on the inside on this side
there's the thing here's a little cap
right here and it looks like they
actually sent us another one of these
little things here so if this one falls
off you actually have another one or
what I'm think will be even cooler and
this is what i'm thinking is going on
let's see if it's true i think i'd want
to break them but i'm going to ask i
would think that maybe this is some kind
of design where you could possibly move
the microphone to the other side
meanwhile have this here that's what i'm
thinking they pop this little cap out
here yeah that's exactly what it is
inside of here are the plugs so you can
remove the microphone and put it on
whatever side you prefer I think that's
a really cool app design so let's stick
them on my head Oh check it out I've got
the headset on my head they're very
comfortable the mic rotates and moves
around so you can place adjustment like
we said he can move over the other side
if you'd like so we've got two
connections here one is your audio one
is your microphone and then we have this
little part right here this is where you
make all your adjustments your volume
control and all that right through this
little thing right here so what you get
you get the headphones this there's no
drivers or anything else you get one
little pop-up thing and that's pretty
much it folks so thanks for watching
focus of the unboxing and first look of
the new CM storm sonus gaming headphones
going for about sixty nine dollars out
there we'll see you guys back here on
tech of tomorrow soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
