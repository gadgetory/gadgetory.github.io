Tekken tomorrow bringing you guys
another benchmark video have you guys
caught us last week you'll remember we
did Assassin's Creed unity whose
performance was not exactly the best in
fact it was absolutely abysmal and today
we're looking at another game from
Ubisoft this time it's Far Cry 4 now
just like with that other video we
tested the game using four of its preset
options we ran it on low medium high and
ultra and we're using a large test
system whose specs you can see right
here which include a GTX 780 and an i7
4770k that being said let's hit the
benchmarks off
so there you have that the game being
run on four different settings now as
you can see not the best optimization
definitely not as horrible as Assassin's
Creed unity book could still use some
work we were barely hitting 60 frames
per second when running on ultra during
combat now the frame rate will be a
little higher during non-combat segments
we're just walking around exploring the
world so it's not always gonna be that
low but the high combat parts are when
you're gonna see that framerate drop so
that's the kind of performance you can
expect during those really exciting
moments now as for the game itself so
far it's a lot like far cry 3 but
definitely with some improvements and
updates and of course a brand new world
to explore
they're definitely driving home the
whole alignment thing again this time
either being a super goody two-shoes or
just ruthless and accomplishing your
goals really interesting so far love the
new villain gonna definitely be playing
this a lot over the next couple days
other than that if you guys pick the
game up for yourself let me know what
you think of it down in the comments if
you haven't grabbed it though and you
want to we do have that link down below
in the description as well as a way to
follow me on Twitter as always guys if

you haven't yet to not miss out on any
