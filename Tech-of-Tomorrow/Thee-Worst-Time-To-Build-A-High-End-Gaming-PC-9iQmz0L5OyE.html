welcome back once again to the channel
now I've been a PC gamer since before PC
gaming was really even a theme playing
games like Dig Dug and things that
really required no type of video really
whatsoever just basic simple things that
you played on your computer well this
particular inner ste has grown into
something that's like the biggest
industries in the entire world why
because it's entertainment and like
George Carlin said your only purpose in
life is to be entertained honestly since
I've had a lot of health issues and
stuff I've tried really to stick to that
mantra what George Carlin said actually
changed me more than all the counselors
I paid money for all my life i watch the
show one time and George is like you
know what you're here to be entertained
so no matter what's going on you should
enjoy it because you could die the next
day and that's just how it is so I live
every day like it's my last but PC
gaming even though it's now this huge
huge arena we got new games coming out
sure cool new stuff coming up but if
you're a person who likes high-end PC
gaming the state of things in the gaming
industry is kind of really really bad
right now and I'll tell you why
we all know the r-tx cards are going to
be here they'll be on the market
tomorrow you guys are gonna check all
them out but regardless of how well
these cards perform I don't care if
these cards are faster than a rocket and
ship on rocket fuel you know it doesn't
really matter when the top of the line
card is $1,300 to jump into the 20 atti
founders Edition and that cards not
going to be faster than you know I don't
know like you know twice as fast at
least minimum I would say even then it's
gonna be a hard push to push the card at
those prices
none of the Nvidia cards that are coming
out we haven't seen the 2070 well
hopefully we'll see a 2060 but we
haven't seen that really the lowering
cards yet but if the higher-end cards
are very expensive they're right around
between $800 right now we're seeing and
$1,300 okay eight to $1,300
traditionally video cards were like in
the five and six hundred dollar range
and I did talk a little bit
about inflation so at the very beginning
when I was buying a high-end you know
gaming cards this is back in the day of
3d effects and stuff like that pretty
much the top-of-the-line video card at
the time for the gamer was around three
hundred three hundred and twenty nine
dollars okay we're talking about a long
long time ago so in last generation
cards you know when these cards came out
the taint CI those cards were still
right around the five or six hundred
dollar range and with inflation after
all those years I know it sucks because
it's like Oh more money but that's just
the way that is man goes up
every year go to a restaurant you used
to be able to go to Del Taco and get a
special combo for three bucks now
they're like nine bucks it's just the
way things are the way of the world but
now these prices are so high that you
can pretty much buy your entire system
and get the absolute best I'm just
trying to do ad today I mean you can get
everything really good the best
motherboard the best CPU the best memory
the best pretty much everything nice
cage deck down lighting all this stuff
and you're probably still gonna be under
1,300 bucks and so then if you want a
high end you know PC card to put in
there it's gonna cost you thirteen
hundred bucks or lino at least eight
hundred and something you know I think
we saw that the price right now I think
we saw is eight hundred and thirty nine
bucks for the for the amp edition of the
zotac card so it's still like you know
$839 add tax where you live at
california it's like eleven percent so
you know you got another sixty bucks
know what another 100 bucks taxed onto
that card just cuz it tax duties in
other countries all that money that
means for high-end gaming stuff only the
rich are gonna be able to afford buying
themselves a super high-end PC for
gaming that really sucks because even
back years ago when I was building these
systems of these cards like I said back
in the beginning paying only three and
twenty nine dollars because I think
that's what I paid for my very last
high-end you know 3d effects cards like
around that price now is the at the
day that was the bomb you know the Mac
Daddy if you didn't have that you went
in you know I'm saying that was for the
cool kids and I made sure books systems
and a lot of people have these systems
you know I mean now inflation has gone
up a little bit on things but now when
you're seeing these cards that
and card that's you know pushing it's
kind of you knows it's not really
knocking on the $2,000 door yet but
we're knocking on the $1,500 door and if
minors if for some reason these cards
you know there's some bad thing going I
mean to know about it minors as I
although these are the cards that we
need for our new mining guess what
nobody's even gonna see those cards so
high-end gaming will be there completely
out of reach or it's just gonna be so
expensive that you know you won't be
able to really do anything else but that
you won't be able to eat pay bills
you'll be like okay this is my sole
thing now there is though another side
of this and this is really good for AMD
because right now Intel's gonna be
coming out with new CPUs so you know the
Intel's gonna have their latest batch of
CPUs they're gonna be priced at Intel
prices you know I mean we'll probably
see CPUs now go up to four or five
hundred dollars for the CPU and we're
gonna see the NVIDIA GPU in the 14 range
no all these expensive stuff which is a
really good time for AMD now even though
AMD doesn't make the absolute best and
the fastest products in the market yeah
I know I feel the beer cans come in the
bottles fly hey this is just the way
things are you know what I mean and with
their pricing though and making be very
competitive right now they can even
lower pricing more people will fought to
them because a lot of gamers out there
are gonna be like you know what I don't
need all those extra bells and whistles
I don't need my game to look super duper
unbelievably realistic with r-tx you
know I mean they're just gonna be like
you know what I want a game have fun
playing my games shoot some up
crawl around in a cave go search for
something I just want to have fun man
and guess what on the AMD side of things
you can do that I mean you could even
get a thread Ripper CPU for dirt cheap
so you can get yourself a really
SuperDuper high-end AMD machine and you
can keep that right at almost like
eleven or twelve hundred dollars and
have yourself old machine the only thing
it's gonna be keeping you back obviously
you're gonna be the high price of faster
memory we all know that faster memory
works better on the AMD systems when you
clock that memory and stuff those AMD
systems run a lot faster and better than
they do just off the shelf that's the
way it is you know what I mean so right
now Andy has a very good opportunity to
sell the out of parts because
people who cannot afford these other
things even then they might be a pipe
dream and they're gonna watch videos
about it and go man I'd really you know
love to have that I'd also love to have
a Lamborghini and you know a couple
Harley's in the driveway do I have them
Hales - no I don't have that but sure
I'd like to and with these other cards
that they get so priced and the Intel
CPUs get so priced that it's just like
basically investing in a house or car to
be able to get one I don't see too many
people buying those things other than
really rich people and for people who
live in outlying countries where we all
know they're financed the money's not
the same that will become a completely
untouchable market for them and if AMD
lowers their prices even more this is
their chance to fill the market but for
high-end gaming right now the market is
pretty much at the worst I've ever seen
it in my life
like I said I don't care if RT X is
faster than a rocket ship on rocket fuel
man when you're gonna be paying these
extremely high price for video cards it
makes building yourself a high end
system that much more expensive you're
talking about if you want a high end
system now you're probably going to be
looking at about three thousand dollars
to build it and that's gonna be right
where it's at and we all know that
everybody out there does not have three
thousand dollars most people wish they
could buy a whole system for like six or
seven hundred dollars but now for a
thousand dollars in all honesty you can
build yourself a pretty decent AMD
system you know what I bet for like
seven or eight hundred dollars I could
even put together a really nice
AMD based system if you guys would like
to see a system like that let me know
that's really affordable I wish it was
different man because I've always been a
high end PC gamer I've been loving it
since the day it was invented I just I
love that's man I hope you guys saw
the video yesterday we're giving away a
copy a shot of the Tomb Raider so if you
guys actually want to get in on that you
guys can check that out we'll have a
link down below but we I got these three
monitors from Bank U and we're gonna be
building this totally new gaming area
with three monitors using obviously an
AMD system the Vegas 64 and hopefully it
just looked totally radical and in fact
this whole system that we're doing with
this and everything including the
monitors I think is under three thousand
dollars and that's for everything we're
talking about
huge monitors system everything speakers
the work so if you guys want to see that
let me know and we'll bring it to the
table I wish we were all rich I wish we
could all afford high-end gaming pcs but
unfortunately right now it's probably
the worst time I've ever seen in the
industry if you want to be a high-end
gamer so anyways that's my rant we'll
have some links down below if you want
to check them out I'm Network you guys
been watching techo tomorrow we have
more tech coming your way tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
