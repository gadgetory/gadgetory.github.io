my music and everything and they sound
really good these are also 67 bucks so
they're in that same type of range next

thought fits into that niche really cool
category gift and hey it's under 100
bucks so it's still really nifty for the
price range gaming lots of us do it and
I got to tell you folks one of my
favorite games so far this year has been
