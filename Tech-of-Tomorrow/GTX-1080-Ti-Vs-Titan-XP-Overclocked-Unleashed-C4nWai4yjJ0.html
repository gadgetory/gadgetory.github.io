back once again to Tekken Omar for more
tech this time it's a battle of the
overclocking giant the Titan XP versus
the 1080 Ti who actually overclocks
better well I think you guys will be a
little bit surprised because the new ti
with its better memory does overclock
better than the Titan XP by only a small
margin though we have nineteen forty
nine megahertz on the Titan and in
nineteen ninety nine megahertz on the
brand new TI card this is pretty much
due to the fact that it has much faster
memory now in our test everything was
done an open-air test bed and we had
didn't increase the voltage whatsoever
we used MSI's afterburner and that's how
we got those results now a lot of know a
lot of people out there excuse me I know
a lot of people out there prefer if I
give the results right off in the
beginning video so I'm gonna tell you
guys right now at the end of the day
obviously the TI is going to win but
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
show you how we actually got those
results so few people who really loved
me giving you guys inclusion in the
beginning we're going to try something
different with our content creation here
and you guys can see that you don't
watch anymore you don't have to but now
let's jump in let's check out our test
system and how we got the results that
we did with these two cards like I said
before if you follow the channel you
guys know that we've been using the same
test system for quite a long time now we
run the CPU in turbo mode at 4.6 at all
times everything else in the test system
is exactly as it is we use the latest
Windows drivers that are available and
the Nvidia driver that we use today was
three seventy eight point seven eight
this is the latest driver but I believe
that by Wednesday of this week the
driver will change to a newer driver and
what to start all over again with crazy
testing like I said the beginning the
video folks we used MSI's afterburner
software to oliver overclocking and we
did this without increasing the voltage
whatsoever 160 megahertz offset turned
out to be the highest stable core
overclock that we could achieve and this
allows us to boost the clock up to
nineteen hundred and forty nine
megahertz now in order to achieve these
results we had to turn the fan up to a
hundred percent and this does get pretty
noisy but it's more of a woosh sound
instead of the old-school whine so you
don't get that lawnmower type sound but
you do get a little bit of a whooshing
sound so if you're expecting to get
great overclocking results and be
completely silent for that you'll need a
liquid cool
overclocking the GTX Canady I is very
similar to overclocking the Titan X with
the exception that the faster veeram the
Titan T I use is much more of our clock
able we were able to add 150 megahertz
to the core and 500 megahertz offsets
the memory with complete stability and
with those settings we were able to
reach a steady 1999 megahertz core and
6000 makers on the memory clocks
the 1080i never got hotter than 70
Celsius and this is due to the fact that
its fan profile is very similar to that
of the XP now if we use liquid cooling
we could achieve even greater results
now with that said let's check out the
results between standard clock speeds
and overclock speeds between the 1080i
and the Titan XP let's rock
you
my
you
already tech fans so there you have it
the results of the overclocking battle
of the giant the kanay a I versus the
Titan XP now the Titan XP is definitely
an older car to spin around for about a
year it's memories nowhere near as fast
as the TI and when it comes overclocked
in the memory obviously the TI is
kicking ass but overall the results are
good and if you have a card like this
you should definitely overclock it
because without increasing the voltage
in your card your cards not going to
have any problems whatsoever and
definitely not going to take away the
longevity of the card so at the end of
the day you guys can see that 1080i is
the clear winner in this battle if only
by a small margin
now things are taking consideration
turning the fan up to 100% is definitely
going to create some noise so if you're
looking for somebody trying to run a
silent PC well then overclocking
probably isn't for you but if you can
have that little bit of youtube noise
and maybe if you're somebody wears
headphones this won't matter whatsoever
you guys can see that the overclocking
results get great gains if you're not
going to ruin your card hey why not
overclock so I definitely think the day
recommend overclocking either one of
these cards you get better performance
and like I said without increasing that
voltage you have no worries of wrecking
your card whatsoever I know if you guys
been watching techni tomorrow also a
shout-out to our friend mark over at
battle tech reviews if you guys want to
check out a different perspective and a
written review on this makes you check
down below that like button because of a
link and more information about these
cards I'm network peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
