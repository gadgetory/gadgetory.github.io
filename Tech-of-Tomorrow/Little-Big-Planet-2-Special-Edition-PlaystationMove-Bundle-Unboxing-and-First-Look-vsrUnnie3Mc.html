techadon mario youtube channel today for
another unboxing that's right it was
Christmastime and I got some pretty cool
gifts some good shiznit
so with those gifts I'm gonna unbox one
of them this is the PlayStation 3 move
bundle with LittleBigPlanet 2 it's kind
of a trippy game with some little rag
doll looking fool I haven't actually got
to play yet but this is like the
complete kit there's actually a couple
kits out there you want to make sure if
you want everything you want this one
this one's got the controller it's got
the navigation and it's got the camera
do when they didn't come with was it
ChaCha but hey
luckily my buddy actually got me the
ChaCha as well so that said let's check
out what comes in the box whose is it
right here about 130 dollars and comes
with everything you need for the move
which means you can add guns because you
have the camera you can do all that
stuff there's a lot of different games
you can use series the front of it the
back of it you guys all see it's all
PlayStation Move there's lots of games
that are go with this so that said I'm
gonna go ahead and box it trusty knife
right here so I'm gonna go ahead and so
we're gonna start the unboxing I'll make
a little incision here like a doctor
make another one here on the other side
I have to make a couple quick incisions
we show very safely and nicely put away
our knife okay so now I'll start the
unboxing I did the incisions so get and
pop the cap right here let's go ahead
and show you guys inside of the box real
quick everything's in there so that I'm
just gonna basically I'm just kind of
waiting dump everything off and then we
can take a look at it one piece at a
time so let me get everything out of
here and then we'll just start looking
at it
and then we'll go start putting it
together afterwards actually on the TV
so get everything off of here first all
right so we get it all out and we'll
start off with the first thing which is
right here get all this out of here this
is the PlayStation 3 this is your manual
how to set it up all the stuff for you
move all your setup guides all that Chiz
Nick stuff is all right here so you get
all that that comes in plastic bag
number one I'll go ahead and just we put
it back in plastic bag number one so we
know it's got all our instructions all
that stuff right there yeah Italy goodly
so here we see the bundled game
LittleBigPlanet 2 featuring the little
funny-looking wiggly guy there you can
see it features the new PlayStation Move
stuff so we'll be able to use the like
goodies in this box with this game also
we get another little game sampler that
comes in the box
this has I think one two three four five
six has like twelve sample games you can
plan here so that way if you see some
game that you really like with the movie
you can say damn I like that thing you
go out and buy the full game so this way
you can demo three a bunch of excuse me
that way you can demo through a bunch of
the games so got that we'll move on
right here we have a controller number
one you can see it has all the
PlayStation buttons on it all that okay
you little click button during the back
kind of cool get a little rubber ball
here on top and also a strap now take
note of this lots of people playing
those games for the week one of the
biggest things they did was throw their
controller through their TV screen you
guys have all seen it now this one is a
some logistical thing here I'll have to
readjust it because I didn't kind of
pulled it a little bit weird there but
this thing actually goes in your wrist
if you're playing the game it's not just
gonna go flying off in your TV you know
I mean that's kind of cool haha that's
funny there I don't care who you
are then we got the next piece I believe
this is the navigation piece right here
we still nav
control it up here from moving around
sort of wanted ones to move you around
now the other ones too like shooting do
you're pointing you see you got two
little click buttons right here now this
one does not have a wrist strap I guess
good it's the nav button you're not
gonna be flipping across the other ones
like for swords I get a sword to be
going now we've in flight of your wrist
so basically use these things together
whichever hand you are you choose
whichever hand you want so if you feel
more comfortable Navi with this one
shooting with that one I think
personally for me I'm gonna feel more
comfortable Navitus one and slicing and
dicing with this one or shooting like
this you know it goes many ways cool
stuff I'm actually looking really
forward a plan with the stuff so we got
those two pieces
I'll get those out of the way and then
last but not least we have the camera
right here now I'm they tell you that
just you need to set the camera like up
on top your TV I gotta tell you don't
work I actually to go out and buy
another $14 product to actually use the
camera so the 14 dollar product I get it
actually mounts on top my TV and the
cable is long enough to reach down into
my PlayStation 3 so this is basically
all the content folks all that's right
here you get it all here and all its
goodness we got the games we've got the
controllers we've got the camera
everything drivers everything all good
to go no drivers actually gives its
PlayStation but all the information
anyways cuz you're in too soon to set up
so that's it this is the PlayStation 3
move kit it's the bundle kit that comes
with everything including little big
plant to with a little cousin topic down
so that's that I know thanks for
watching teka tomorrow channel we'll see
you guys back here soon
