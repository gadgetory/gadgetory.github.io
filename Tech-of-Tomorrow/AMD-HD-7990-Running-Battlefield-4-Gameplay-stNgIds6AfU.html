news the hard news the best news I'm
just messing y'all welcome back to tech
of tomorrow just having a little fun
there now what is on the calendar though
now you guys have all heard or seen
something about the 7990 AMD fans have
been going
WTF for months now going what's going on
with this car well you guys all know the
power color a soos a few companies they
broke out of the mold and maymay what is
you know called a officially unofficial
version of the card
well now AMD is actually jumped back
into the game and they said they're
going to officially support this card
now it does look a lot different from
what we've seen so far though from
previous edition cards in the past
you've always seen the blower type fan
now this has open air now the difference
between the open air and the blower is
open air actually relies on your cases
airflow to keep it running cooler other
cool stuff though I don't know if you
guys missed it but they had a 17 minute
video showing the new battlefield 4 and
all that shiz Nick was recorded on this
supposedly new 7990 now that's pretty
trippy stuff so what you're gonna see
now is in a few months we're gonna see
an official 7990 come out what we've
seen so far though is that it uses
really high quality components it has
the new open air and there are two eight
pin power connectors now the cards by a
Zeus and the cards by power color they
were all in like the 500 watt you know
power range this car with the two eight
pin power connectors is kind of limiting
it down to 375 watt so we're gonna see
how these cards actually do compared to
these you know extremely bad boys that
have been out on the market now if you
guys want to learn more about this new
7990 or you happen to miss that
