Squarespace for your free trial period
just enter T ot at the checkout alright
folks another day means another battle
in the mid-level graphics card division
today's entry into the market is the new
sapphire dual XR 1985 now to do less
because it was a xxx it had to be the
nasty version and not just not what it
is so you guys all know this card just
came out I know her from tech of
tomorrow I know you guys want to see
more than just me running my trap so
let's jump in and let's see what this
cards all about first off folks let's
talk about pricing is obviously the cash
is muy importante and for you people
who's been good it means very important
this thing is coming into market about
$265 will have various models and
everything linked down below so we're
out the bat folks you guys can see the
dual X name features two fans you guys
can see those both right on top now this
thing size in at 264 by 113 by 34
millimeters and features a 2 slot design
now as far as power requirements go
going to the card it has 2 6 pin power
connectors and actually inside the box
that comes with a 4 pin 2 6 pin adapter
so if you guys don't have that with your
power supply they'll provide it also 500
Watts minimum the power supply is the
requirement some of the other stuff
inside the box includes the driver all
the information about the card you get a
VGA to DVI adapter you also get an HDMI
1.4 cable and you get this little
mousepad now it's not really gonna be
all that effective for gamers but it's
actually just pretty cool as kind of a
collector's thing and then you also get
those two adapter cables I talked about
those four pin to six pin adapters in
case you don't have them also you guys
that are really nitpicky I know you guys
like to complain about the PCB color
well this thing is all blacks a little
match pretty much any system you guys
are out there look into design down the
side of the card down by the pcie 3.0
interface you guys can see these things
look cool that's some nice cool copper
heat pipes going around as we look on
the other side of the card you can see
the sapphire logo and then the dual BIOS
one of these is for legacy and one is
for UEFI as far as specs goes yep the
285 is still based off the 28 nanometer
process now this card that we're looking
at it has a base clock speed of 965
megahertz features 2 gig
of gddr5 memory with a 256-bit memory
bus and it features a fifty six hundred
megahertz memory speed
it also features 1792 stream processes
which is just a little bit less than a
280x as we bounce around to the rear a
card and all the outputs you guys can
see this as an HDMI 1.4 cable included
DisplayPort 1.2 one DVI and one DVID so
there are the specs you guys have seen
the card now let's rock out to the
benchmark song and see how this thing
compares to the competition
all right you guys are back thanks for
walking out now why do you guys all want
to know what the heck that song is well
that is the human Zoo by me here in the
team at Tech of tomorrow we hope you
guys like it also a lot of you guys
asked a lot of times hey where's your
music and how did you guys get to what
you're doing we'll check this out our
music website is techo tomorrow music
calm and we made that entire thing using
Squarespace they have this totally
unique drag-and-drop interface so that
when you go and you try to design your
website you can do it very quickly
because everything's really intuitive a
really cool thing about Squarespace as
well is they have 24/7 technical support
that's why you guys are based out of New
York the Big Apple and no matter what
time day or night that you need them
they are there for you and it's also
never been easier to set up your own
online store you guys get a free trial
by entering quixote at the checkout and
also if you guys decide to join you get
an additional ten percent alright folks
so that pretty much breaks it down the
brand new sapphire dual-x r9 285 card
now as far as the heat and stuff goes 29
under Idol 66 under full load you guys
can see it also gives an r9 280x a
pretty good run for its money and in
some cases it even beats the GTX 770 so
all in all this is a pretty good card
like I said in the beginning of the
video this card's coming out at about
two hundred and sixty-five dollars which
is you know kind of almost matching the
card and they should because it's called
a 265 and sold it for 265 when they've
been nice and easy I think you guys
would agree so that's pretty much it
folks so I'm Eric thanks for watching
techo tomorrow once again thanks very
much a Squarespace for making this video
possible I know you guys always ask
about hey where can we get this card all
that stuff down there below that like
button there will be a thing called the
description and availability and all
that stuff will be down there as well so
I'm Eric thanks for watching if you like
what you see and you want to see more

button see you guys back here on the
