was actually a huge success thanks to
all of you very much for your
cooperation in that now we have
something really cool going on you guys
want to have this song on the song you
guys can own this song all of my stuff
is elric Farris is a singing musician
all of my pain cylinder stuff and all
the stuff that mean the team have done
here on tech tomorrow in a music pack
including the videos that go along with
them and by buying this music pack you
get a chance to win five awesome prizes
here on Tekra tomorrow all unique and
worth a lot of money so the reason
behind this is we obviously we need your
support to bring all these videos and
everything is not free and plus now that
we have 250,000 subscribers when I have
these giveaways and stuff it's really
hard to nail it down if he was so many
people now i want to emphasize one thing
very very clearly this has absolutely
nothing to do with our 25 days of
christmas or this giant giveaway that
we're doing with new wave which you guys
will see in a couple of days because in
the 22nd we're actually going to be
announcing this giant system that we're
going to be giving away on New Year's
Day with newegg so that's going to be
really really cool so you guys should be
looking forward to that plus we just
have all kinds of stuff that we're
giving you guys for free but we really
wanted to do was we wanted to give a
select group of people a chance to
really get something unique from tech of
tomorrow like we have four systems that
were actually going to be giving away
with this I have them few of them back
here and things actually going to come
tomorrow we're going to totally custom
build the last system which is the
Thunder it's based on the asus Thunder
effects motherboard just all kinds of
killer parts water cooled you guys know
the Ferrari system you guys remember the
Aurora we originally had this system as
a hackintosh system we actually had the
system on newegg I've changed a lot of
the parts around it to make it as a
standard PC for you guys you can game
and then we've got the Blitzkrieg you
guys all know the Blitzkrieg system and
we're going to have one more that is
called the Thunder FX now everybody who
buys the music packet I want to really
specify this you are buying the music
pack we don't want you guys just to have
absolutely nothing we want to give you
something
for your money so you guys are actually
buying the music pack for twenty-five
dollars and everybody in the entire
world can qualify for this drawing the
thing is if you're in the United States
we can pay the shipping if you live
somewhere else in the world we ask that
you pay the shipping but we're going to
do something totally unique here if you
buy the music pack and your name gets
Ron and you don't have the money to pay
for the shipping I'm going to go ahead
and send you out of my pocket a gtx 780
lightning one of the fastest cards on
the planet I just finished up all my
reviews and everything I got it free to
go so if you're out there and you enter
this but you'd run the money get the
shipping I will send you the gtx 780
lightning card now if everybody wins the
contest and everybody pays with shipping
I will add that as a fifth prize so this
is going to be limited to 500 people now
if we have five prizes that makes your
chances one in a hundred in winning one
of these great valuable prizes now I
think that's really cool the stuff that
we have was all custom built by Anthony
Reynolds our tech every one of them has
something unique and one-of-a-kind about
them and you can't just go out and just
buy this off the street and have it the
exact same way that we're going to give
it to you so basically it's just really
easy you guys by the $25 music pack it
help support us and keep the channel
going and then that fact all those
people who do that will be entered into
a drawing to win one of these five
awesome things now we know that some
people out there going to be a little
bit weird about it they're gonna say oh
hey man I think that's a ripoff if you
think it's a rebuff and you're not down
with that absolutely keep your money we
don't want to take anything from you
whatsoever also if you're a poor person
and you're really struggling we don't
want to take any money from you either
we really like to get support from our
fans out there who have some extra cash
we want to keep the channel going and
would just like a wonderful chance to
win one of these five awesome prizes

description will be all the information
