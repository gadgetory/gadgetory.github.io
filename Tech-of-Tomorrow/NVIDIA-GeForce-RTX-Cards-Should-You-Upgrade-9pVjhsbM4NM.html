NVIDIA has finally released their
touring architecture brand new cards the
2080 TI the 2080 and the 2070 card now
this launch however is a little bit
strange in how they really did it
because usually when I go and I see a
launch right you know watch a launch one
of the main things that they're always
showing is a lot of gameplay and numbers
showing how this car is going to be
faster than the previous generation
cards and the other cards that are on
the market however this launch was
different in a few different ways first
of all not a whole lot of gameplay was
really showed now there were game
trailers of course and things like that
you know saying hey cool look at have
all the colors looking everything with
this cool new rate racing technology
right well rate racing technology is
really there to make everything in a
game that supported just actually look
better all the lighting all the shades
all this stuff it's really you know hair
works all you know the super Nvidia
stuff that you know NVIDIA has
proprietary to their card you know all
these things that make games look more
like real-life they really take a heavy
strain on the card because for one thing
think about it we're here in reality
when you're inside of a game that video
card itself's have no like kind of
recreate you know the reality in 3d as
much as it can off you know whatever's
inside of the video card and this is how
rate racing is really going to help
because rate racing will completely make
the object that you're looking at it's
gonna do it very very fast in real time
now so all the other stuff that was
taken away before and rendering will now
be out the window now here's where the
big question also is how long are these
particular r-tx cards really going to
last on the market I mean let's just
talk about that because they release the
Ti version right off the bat at the
launch now there's something that's
usually not done usually they release
you know the initial cards the founders
Edition then the aftermarket guys put
their fans on them they go out to market
you know and then you know they release
the TI you know
usually months or a year later you know
stretching the life of you know that
chipset so you know is the Turing
chipset and its current you know
iteration what it is is it really gonna
be around a long time because were they
gonna go from here I guess the next
thing we're gonna have is a Titan r-tx
but then you know beyond that where they
going are they gonna reintroduce SLI
again and really start supporting SLI
again I mean what are the changes being
done here so here's my advice right now
for people because since we didn't see a
whole lot of gameplay I don't really
know if when we get the cards in here if
just on like the regular settings that
you see if we're gonna see this you know
crazy performance and gameplay unless
it's just so utterly ridiculous which is
good backfire in my face like a giant
fart and I could look like a boo-boo man
but you know I'm thinking that we're not
gonna see a whole whole lot of super
advanced frame rates over the attend ATI
generation and their Titan generation XP
you know I don't really think that we're
going to see that right I think we're
gonna see improved performance just not
the double digits that people were
talking about but I was having a
conversation with another friend of mine
who works over at Nvidia and we were
talking about people really they go play
like games you know at the latest Final
Fantasy and then they complain they say
oh my god you know Nvidia is GIMP in the
car because when they turn on hair'
works and they turn all the features and
all this stuff that make it look like
you know real-life waving flags cuz it's
physics and all this stuff well then
obviously the cards gonna be taxed like
I said earlier you know making this 3d
environment is what really taxes the
cards but now with this rate racing
technology they're going to be able to
do this much easier so what I'm thinking
and I may be wrong but this is what I'm
speculating at this point is that I feel
what's probably going to happen is now
you're going to be able to play all your
games with all the bells and whistles
completely turned up and you're not
gonna lose those frame rates so we're
probably going to see now is that
everything running over 60 frames per
second
with all the bells and whistles going on
now as far as how it's gonna translate
into 4k
I don't really know 4k to me is kind of
I don't know it never really got out of
the gate you know it's like a really
super fast horse but it just really
didn't go anywhere not that many people
I know ever come to me and say
I want to build a 4k gaming system it's
either one a gaming system or I want a
gaming system so I can do 3d stuff and
get me some oculus or something it's
like that so I'm not really getting mean
people come in to me and saying hey man
I want a game I want a 4k monitor I want
to do 4k gaming I just don't hear that
because right now it seems like you know
1440 is probably the you know the
optimal you know resolution for a game
or 1080 you can really kick butt but we
all know that 1080 is getting it a
little bit on the old side so we want to
get you know ultra wide make that
monitor a little bit wider so we can see
more of the environment and all that
type of stuff so at this point right now
I feel that the prices on these cards
are also like really expensive
I mean it's $1200 for a top-of-the-line
card and I mean even though the
technology is there that's a lot of
money pretty much the most expensive
price tag that I've ever seen on an on
Titan or non quadrille card from the
folks over Nvidia and that kind of makes
me kind of scratch my head and I had
that particular thing I have to say I'm
not really too happy with now obviously
we do see you know that the 2080 the
2080 excuse me the 2070 they're gonna be
at a lower price point but that 2080 Ti
is really up there in the price you know
the 1080 I was nowhere near that price
until you know obviously you know we had
the big mining craze and everybody took
your card so you couldn't buy a card
where the life for you because of that
and I also don't know now these cards
could also be really geared towards
minors there could be a lot of stuff
that the minam's particular technology
and the touring and architecture that
makes it so that you know a guy who
wants to go out there and mine can mine
like a crazy guy I don't really know
these things I haven't told you that we
will get a briefing the cards will be
coming our way so we'll be able to test
those things out but for right now I
would say that unless you are completely
unhappy with how your card plays in your
system if you have a 1080i you know and
you have a 1080 that unless you really
aren't happy with how your game looks at
all you know you like all the bells and
whistles on and without them on you feel
the gameplay is just wow then yeah you
should probably be seeking to upgrade to
one of these different type of cards
probably not the $1200 version but
somewhere right in the middle you know
if I was a gamer that's where
I would usually go go for the middle
technology the lowest sending technology
seems to get replaced faster the highest
in is always SuperDuper high so it's you
know it's it's you know kind of like the
girl in all the beds in the old time
story are you're looking for that
perfect spot and that's probably going
to be right in the center of all that
but if you're happy with your card and
you know you don't need to turn all
these bells and whistles on I don't
really think it's really time to upgrade
kit I just haven't seen you know enough
evidence out there so far this may be go
oh my god yeah you guys need to get in
the pre-order line pre-order these cars
and just you know god forbid the miners
want to take them all up and drive you
know drive the price now that's the only
thing about pre-ordering that I see were
like you know they're really trying to
just catch the fish early you know early
bird gets the worm they're trying to get
everybody in there okay we've got new
cards we'll sell them to you first
through pre-order you know but in a way
it's kind of going on faith because we
haven't really seen exactly how all the
game performance is going to be we know
it has ray-tracing
we know it's gonna make all the games
and all the showers and everything look
really nice that's good so games will
probably honestly with these cards I
can't say they're definitely probably
going to look better that's gonna be for
sure but will they actually perform
totally faster that is yet to be seen
so IML work you guys have been watching
taken tomorrow like I said strange
launch strings things are afoot over
there at Nvidia but a new cards have
been released now we're waiting for is
them to get them out to the market get
them out to the people so we can all say
hey yeah this stuff is the greatest
thing or what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
