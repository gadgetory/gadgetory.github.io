again on TECA tomorrow now I know you
guys are all paint into the videos out
there lie and it has had one J's had one
and they're all basically showing their
heads hung down crying and like oh my
god like insel has become Satan and I'm
just kind of tripping on that because
last year when AMD really didn't have
anything in the market everybody else
except for me honest and you guys knows
who follow me was like screw AMD screw
AMD they weren't even touching the stuff
while I was doing builds at the FX
process and everything else all year
long and now I see everybody like doing
the opposite and complaining about Intel
now obviously the most expensive CPU
that's coming out on this new x29
platform by 9 is there 18 core you know
36 threads CPU now obviously this thing
is going to be expensive it's the only
CPU on the market of its kind now I know
most of us are gamers and none of us are
going to go out and spend that kind of
money for gaming but why would you that
CPU is geared for people who do
rendering workstation all that type of
stuff that's an overpowered beast not
meant for gaming sure you can game on it
but it's like having a Maserati and
driving it around across the street from
your house there's no point in that you
mean you can be as powerful as you want
but if you're not doing anything to
actually use the power it what's the
point in buying it now the 1800 X's
showed itself to be a great CPU from AMD
really good CPU man multiple threads
eight cores 16 threads really nice CPU
right now even lowered the price are
about four hundred and fifty nine
dollars so they're getting you know kind
of cheap but can the top-of-the-line CPU
from Intel now actually beat it by four
times because if it can beat it by four
times and maintain a cool temperature
then yeah it might actually be worth it
for that $2,000 at the at the end of the
day I think that what I'm seeing people
they're all coming at is they're just
going way crazy over that $2,000 CPU and
honestly that's not my problem at all
with this launch they can have a CPU
this $2,000 all day long I'm not going
to buy it I'm going to get myself 278
20x the 78 20x has basically the same
exact features that you see on the AMD
1800 X about 149 dollars more but and
just saying is how history really goes
usually Intel CPUs are a little bit
better at gaming and a little bit faster
now that is actually yet to be seen
because I don't have the CPU in my hands
probably I don't think anybody has we've
tried and tried to find it but they're
not going to be out for a few months
probably a month or so I think so
when they get here we'll buy that CPU my
biggest problem however with this entire
launch though is that changing the
platform to X 299 from X 99 is just
 ridiculous all of these new AI 9
CPUs should have worked in the x99
motherboard with the 2011 chipset
bringing it up to a new chipset and
everything else to a 2066 I mean that's
just kind of ridiculous and even though
they're releasing all these new
motherboards and all these new CPUs from
what I've heard is that the bump in
performance isn't really that much and
that the new motherboards which is
basically you know the mode borders like
do you know where you thought it's like
CPUs the brain that's the body the body
really offers nothing more on this it's
not that faster it still contains 40 PCI
lanes yeah there's a cool new
functionality for some water cooling
headers and stuff like that of some
certain boards but at the end of the day
jumping in to suck it 2066 on the
motherboards going to cost you around
$500 just for the board so that means
even if you decide to get that that CPU
that I want like the 78 20 K you're
still gonna have to buy another $500
motherboard just to get up and going and
that's just crazy
why Intel did not stick with the X 99
and make it so that everybody can do it
is up it makes them seem like
they're desperate and it's really kind
of a just a screwed up move to all the
consumers that have supported them
because now you have to go out spend
money for a new board get a new CPU
without really any type of extreme
performance you know differences with
the motherboard that to me is the
biggest pet peeve and why I say at the
end of the day what the Intel
because if you're going to come out and
you're going to release new stuff you
should at least make it faster now we
all know AMD they're gunning for the big
boys they're gunning for Nvidia they're
gunning for Intel and with people who
gun gun gun gun gun they easily succeed
because as it seems to me is right now
Intel is kind of living on their laurels
they expect all the stands that have
been around forever just to
oh my god a new thing from endo it's
been so long let's jump into it but I'm
not going to jump into it this time it's
just it's just to me not worth it unless
I can find some way to get my hands on a
bunch of motherboards you know what I
mean to build systems with it
I'm not going to spend any of my money
to go out and buy any of this new stuff
from until to me it just doesn't seem
worth it I'll probably be waiting till
the next gen now if I get a bunch of
pressure and people to build a new test
system or do something like that
something may change but at this point
right now my biggest question about CPUs
are we going all I'm going to change
over and switch over is we don't know
yet because the 7th excuse me it's a 78
20x beat the 1800 X I'll be willing to
pay that extra hundred and $49 intel
traditionally has been a bit more stable
you guys know this you don't see AMD
stuff in a lot of stuff in professional
music studios you don't see it at NASA
so obviously those people are concerned
about stability I still am as well now
if I can see AMD and their next-gen
become completely rock stable and
everything else like I see Intel then
all seriously consider myself jumping
over to the AMD platform now
AMD like I said has definitely seriously
I mean seriously up their game quite a
freaking bit man the 18 directs all
those CPUs they release with the
motherboards pretty nice price great
performance I mean come on before until
release these CPUs AMD for a moment was
once again being the king especially of
the budget stuff even though their CPU
now is like for $59 for a
top-of-the-line CPU usually Intel's
about $1,000 for the desktop that's
usually how it is and they start getting
in the work station the X stuff that's
when you start seeing the 1500 and the
2000s but as far as the gaming stuff
Intel and AMD kind of go back and forth
back and forth now I want to hear you
guys opinions out there because I've
just seen all kinds of crazy videos out
there but I want to know what you guys
the audience think do you think that
like Intel is like completely done
because they have a CPU that's $2,000
and because their motherboard series
isn't much faster than x99 because check
this out a lot of people who are just
jumping in to the PIO the computer world
and just jumping into getting their
first PC they might want to consider the
X 299
the i9 series because they had CP using
the i9 that are actually quite
affordable so for those people they may
say oh wow you know intel has a history
of being stable intel has a history of
this that and the other and they may
still as their first platform jump into
that but I don't think there's anybody
really out there right now it's a good
x99 platform motherboard and 2011 socket
CPU I don't really see them going out
and buying new I just don't so at
the end of the day no I don't see myself
thinking of Intel as a demon I'm mainly
just disappointed my thing for what the
 is Intel you're going to make
something make it so it's compatible all
around if they would have made this for
the x99 motherboard I would have been
totally stoked because you have to buy
that motherboard that means you can
invest more money in your CPU this way
anybody who's already got their stuff is
not going to upgrade and since they're
brand-new 18 core 36 thread CPU won't
work on any other motherboards ain't
nobody upgrading their system they're
going to be totally rebuilding a whole
another system AMD's come a long way and
I hope they come further I know you guys
too but at the end of the day I think
this new Intel stuff is ok and it will
be ok it's just not exactly what I was
looking for and probably I don't think
it's what any of the really Intel fans
are looking for as you guys can see from
the videos out there I really want to
know what you guys think is everybody
has an opinion they're all different you
guys have heard my opinions first off
I'm not so blown away that Intel has a
$2,000 CPU that doesn't really Fuzzle me
at all
come on 18 core 36 thread
you know like MC Hammer said can't touch
this I mean that's all there is about
that but if it can't beat the 1800 X by
at least four times
I might just think it's a lot of hype
let me know what you guys think peace
