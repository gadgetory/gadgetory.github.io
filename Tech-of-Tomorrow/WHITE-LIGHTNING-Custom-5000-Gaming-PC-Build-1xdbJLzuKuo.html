tech tomorrow bringing you guys
something that is just simply incredible
now there are a lot of guys out there
that make totally custom pcs you guys
know anything relative don't mind for
years but the thing is that how many
companies out there that are actually
companies selling pcs to the general
public can actually make a computer
that's totally as kick-ass as
aesthetically pleasing functional as
those guys right from a company well
main gear has done just that this badass
system behind me which I'm calling the
white lightning because it's just got a
totally custom paint job on it that's
awesome and plus all the parts match up
inside of it so I'm going to call this
thing
white lightning now this system is
completely utterly over-the-top like the
only thing that could probably be even
more crazier I suppose if you put higher
in video cards or more video cards but
for anybody playing games out there
using 1080p 14:40 not too many people in
the 4k arenal this would still handle it
this system is just blazingly phenomenal
even the system's really that we've had
built here that Anthes done they've been
really high-end you guys remember the
Red Dawn we've had a lot of different
systems they were all really nice but
these were all done by a guy who's
sitting in his house doing this by
himself taking up pretty much a lot of
time sometimes 30 days sometimes to make
these systems well the people remain
gear they told me that they can actually
make this badass system it takes about
three days to totally get it put
together and customized and this system
is just over the top
like I said crazy on the outside Corsair
900 D case totally custom painted and by
the way I'll have a link down below few
people interested because these guys
actually do totally like custom
automated lifts custom automotive paint
inside of their factory it's not sourced
out they have their own dude and you
guys give you guys watch the video see
it is like a stern face kind of looks
like red from the 70 show all Stern and
he's the guy painting all these cases
and this one's totally custom painted
the paint job I don't know how well it
translates across in video but it's
incredible it's completely smooth
even there no damage marks on it
whatsoever no scuffs no mistakes they
buff it out they make it look nice and
you guys can see all the way around it's
pretty awesome on the front of the case
there's the main gear logo and the green
lights are permeating from the side on
the back panel we once again see the
main gear logo and the front you guys
can see all of the killer components
that are in this system now what's
really incredible though is that all the
parts inside of the system for the water
cooling are all pretty much custom now
the blocks are from ek but all the rest
of it is custom-made they make all of
their custom tubing and this tubing is
made to last it's the very highest end
it's UV and they also have all their own
custom fittings they couldn't find the
fittings that would actually work for
the way they wanted it to and so they
went ahead and completely customized the
system out now some things that are
probably a little bit hard to see I
don't know if we totally were able to
dip into it but down at the bottom is a
release valve so the release valve is
down on the bottom so when you're
draining the system at it like you never
would really need to because there's so
much fluid inside of this thing and
through the system that you probably
never have to ever use fluid pretty much
ever again it's going to last a long
time now what's really cool too is not
only they have all their custom parts
inside of here the way the loop works is
pretty cool too first of all it runs up
into the top right here by the way these
are huge radiators they're using a g5
pump inside them you guys are all
familiar with that a lot of people use
them their own version they're using
inside of here but from the CPU it goes
up into this and you this thing's just a
huge huge assembly lots of radiators
space now it's cooling that water down
then it's sing that water down and going
through this big huge reservoir and from
that it's pumping going around so before
it ever even gets to the video cards
it's actually made a long trip all the
way through a reservoir a radiator and
then back through all these loops before
it even hits video cards so for you guys
out there know about overclocking and
stuff like that you know this is going
to leave a lot of headroom to overclock
these video cards now these are a pair
of geforce gtx 980ti is in here and
obviously they're going to be set to SL
that's going to make it badass the
motherboard inside of here is a deluxe
motherboard it's the z7 ten deluxe from
a Zeus we actually have that motherboard
on the shelf we're actually putting a
system over on with it and it's in this
one as well and that actually helps
match with the actual color theme
usually you know ROG things are always
the black the red this is completely
different this is white a little bit of
black and this nice permeating green a
little bit of blue here on the sides but
even the back of the cards hard to see
there ek blocks but they're very very
clean I mean just very very clean we've
worked with Swift tech for years and
they have some nice stuff but I have to
say ek is doing some really nice jobs
I'm really impressed with what's going
on here every single one of the cables
in here also has a custom connector here
that they've laser-cut inside of their
shop so they hold all the cables
together these are really really nice
things
these are barely just coming out and
they actually sent me a link a little
while ago saying hey check these things
out but these go over the top most of
the time these things are completely
closing you have to string your wires
through it's a pain the but but nope
these guys are smart enough just to cut
the ends off of them make them entirely
flexible and obviously a beast of this
magnitude needs a beastly power supply
to give you lots of headroom and the
system we see the Corsair ax 1200 I so
you guys can also see that everything
inside of this system is amazingly clean
there's nothing you know what I'm saying
that clutters up the area there's
nothing that's stat standing out making
it look cluttery at all it's completely
clean completely elegant so man I just
got to say though this is a company this
is a giant pretty much corporation that
made this it looks unbelievably killer I
mean you guys have to admit this system
is just nice from all the lights and
everything that we have even even down
here all the custom lighting and all the
fans in here also high-pressure fans so
when you shut the system up the wind
flow through the case is very very nice
the air flow the air flow is nice so
that makes it perfect for doing the
water coin because you're not like
trying to rely on any type of you know
air cooling those off you just want the
system itself to be nice and cool and
let those cards and the water cooling do
their thing
and with two separate radiators I don't
know this thing's going to run really
killer anthing does that a lot two
splits the system off I admit but to see
a company do this and make it a system
like this is for me I pretty draw
dropping I know there might be something
out there's going to be no you're going
to have the people either gonna say oh
yeah I do I can make that thing for 80
bucks and blah blah blah I know people
are going to say that and what's really
nice too is even the backside where all
the cables are you guys can clearly see
that they've done an excellent job
making this thing completely clean and
elegant so it's pretty much not only a
high-end gaming PC it's pretty much a
piece of artwork no two are exactly
alike everyone's going to be just a
slight bit difference in it because
obviously when you're making things
you're going to have a little bit of
differences which is going to make you
know every PC nice today's video I just
really want to show you guys all the
components there's also 32 gigabytes of
incredible huh Kingston Pettit er memory
in there this stuff is just really
really nice high-end 32 gigabytes can't
really beat that there's also a 1.2
terabyte 750 series SSD that's down here
at the bottom and there's also more to 2
terabytes Seagate 7200 rpm drives in
here as well so you have two giant 2
terabyte hard drives one of them all
used for steam one of them I use for
origin that's how I like to do my stuff
I'll put my OS and anything that I'm
editing or anything I'll put that on
that 1.2 terabyte but spec wise I mean
it's spectat
this is just one totally utterly
beautiful system now Windows 10 comes
already pre-installed but I just got the
system so I didn't get that far but I
want to hold back because I want you
guys to see this so I'm going to be
building and completing a total gaming
dedicated area to this system and as
we're going I'll actually I see how you
guys like more videos so when we get the
testing done I'll actually do the
testing and film the testing why I'm
doing it you guys can see it we can see
all those scores together
I know we've canned a lot and put the
benchmarks out there and put the
benchmark song out there that's kind of
cool we'll mix that in there but I know
a lot of people like to see the actual
live gameplay going on but for now this
is well I'm called like I said the white
lightning system from
people over at main gear a completely
custom system from the ground up with so
much custom nice working it that
honestly you'd have to go out and hire
one of those big-time guys out there who
do this for a living to do this for you
and if you're a person out there and you
don't know any person like that
whatsoever but your dream is to just
have the most over-the-top nicest most
elegant system out there I think she'd
head over to main gear and just like
check out all they have to offer now
obviously the caveat of something like
this is it's going to be pricey but you
can expect to have the very best stuff
in the world and expect it to be cheap
and I know there's gonna be some
comments all about that too there's
always so many comments feel free I
don't care but I mean if you want
something that is custom built custom
done looks badass Specht out and
actually came in the mail and still
completely functional even though it's
water cooling system those are all in my
eyes when I want to hear you guys's
comments below to me like I said
everything about this is totally badass
like when Anthony came and saw this
system he like was even like wow that is
really nicely done and he does this has
been doing it for years you know he's
one of the guys would put it put a name
to doing custom built you know he may
not be the biggest guy in the block but
he's been doing it for years and even he
said that this is very nice very elegant
and well put together so the bottom line
is yeah it's going to cost some money
that's the caveat but if you want
something that's like no other it's
something to look at I mean I don't know
I want to hear your guys's comments
below because probably about the price I
already know it costs a lot of money so
please you don't need to waste your
comment down below tell me Oh screwing
me you can build this for cheaper in
fact in this particular video I'm not
even going to bring the price I'll bring
the price later when I get all the
components we'll talk about my whole
gaming area altogether it'll be like the
ultimate gaming tour as we do the system
but that's it folks like I really just
hope that you guys are like me and you
love the beauty and the elegance of the
design that's what it's all about here
like obviously we know it cost money so
let's really not even talk about the
price let's just really for this video
just sit back and just go wow it's
beautiful
check out the links down below
everything will be down below you guys
want to check out more system man gear
and stuff check those out like I said
I'll also have a link to where these
guys have their painted booth where they
do all their painting so it's really
awesome stuff and real quick before I
bounce out of here
obviously thanks to manga but we also
want to give a special shout out to the
people over at Braintree for helping
make today's video possible even the
best mobile app will not work unless you
have the proper payment API and that's
where these folks come in to solve all
your problems this is where brain trees
V zero SDK comes in one amazingly simple
integration gives you every way to pay
it supports Android iOS and JavaScript
clients and it offers a simple
integration that you can do in minutes
if this sounds good to you try it out
for yourself in the sandbox all you
gotta do is go WW bring three payments
calm /t ot so in any case fans without
any further ado it's time to say goodbye
and get this baby into my room and start
testing it thanks to our sponsors and
thanks for you guys for watching like
usual all the information about this
system its parts and all that stuff
we'll have links to all the separate
parts in that down there so if you guys
want to buy a system like this and put
it together yourself you can do it the
only thing is like I said some of these
components
you cannot buy that's the caveat about
it as well all of these connections all
those things they're all custom made
just for them but I'm sure you can find
something like that if you want I know
Eric even watching Tekken tomorrow stay
tuned because we've got to pull
you guys want to see this right I know
you have so check it out
coming up I'm taking tomorrow beasts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
