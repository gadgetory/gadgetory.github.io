lot of AMD releases and a whole lot of
read we thought we'd throw in some green
happy st. Patty's Day no but check this
out here at taken tomorrow I called up
my friend mr. B over at their item video
company and I said hey sir there's a lot
of stuff going on could you provide me
with a card to give to you know you
folks the fans and the reply was say yes
that's right so I have a GTX 1060
founders Edition that one of you lucky
winners out there will get your hands on
now just say straight up that this
giveaway is worldwide it's very simple
to do I like funny comments so my big
thing is funnier comments if you're too
lazy to leave up to funny comment well
then hey I guess you know you don't you
can't tend to seconds of your time type
in a funny comment trying to make me
laugh because I like laughing comments
so all you have to be a sub to the
channel if you want to give in video
some love it'd be awfully kind of you
guys if you get to school with under
their Facebook page and give it a light
you know you know not twisting your arm
or thing but if you'd like to because
you're an Nvidia fan you know hey you go
for it so we're gonna be giving that
card away here so the way to win this
card is like I just said you just need
to leave a comment down below and I
prefer comments like I said that make me
laugh so if you guys want to get your
hands on a nice gtx 1060 founder's
edition well now is your chance to do it
so i know it's really weird it's like
sometimes i do these giveaways and
people start leaving negative comments
or like disliking videos it kind of just
trips me the heck out because like you
know nobody has to give anything away
and I mean they really don't I don't
have to do this this most the time I
feel like I'm just like you know farting
into the wind cuz like people don't seem
to appreciate it but I still keep doing
it because I know there are some people
out there who simply don't have the
money to get stuff and honestly
truthfully in my heart if I could
actually have a way to meet her the
person who if you like was the most like
you know deserving of a card I would
give it to that person but unfortunately
there's no way for me to get that
intimate with all you people out there
in your life now since we're not just
asked a real quick question if you guys
want to know more about me like stuff
you really don't know because I think
builds a lot of times assume that they
know the tech hosts and the channel and
they assume things about them but if
you'd like was like if you guys would
like to know more about myself leave a
comment down below you know saying that
just say hey you know we'd like to know
more about you mowbray it to you but
beyond that I mean gtx 1060 falender's
edition
worldwide contest we'll leave a comment
down below I'm not gonna force you to
subscribe to the channel but if you like
the videos and stuff please subscribe
because honestly I would rather have you
not subscribed to my channel just to get
a contest to unsub after the contest is
over so I just say it to the wind
you don't have to be a sub to the
channel you know I don't care but if you
like the channel then be sub but don't
just sub because you think it's gonna
help you get this card cuz it's not so
I'll be honest with you it's not gonna
help you get the card and I
don't need you on something later
so biasted yourself be honest with me
like I said I'm giving this card away
leave a comment down below this video is
posted today 7 days from now I will
announce the winner on this channel

attention you don't need to leave a
