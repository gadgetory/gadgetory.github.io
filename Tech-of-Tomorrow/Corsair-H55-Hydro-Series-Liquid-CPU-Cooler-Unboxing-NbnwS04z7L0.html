it's your channel homie your hairstyle
wrecking today we're gonna do the
unboxing of the Corsair Hydra series H
55 upon coming to the market for $69 get
through your AMD or Intel CPU no really
get for the overclocker but more for the
standard man who's got his moral values
who just wants to install and relax upon
his day enjoy life the simple life with
that said let's hop in and let's do the
unboxing with here ye sword
all right everybody usually a lot of
questions always get or hey where do you
guys get your stuff we'll check it out
the name of the person that this sword
is right here you can find them online
and buy their stuff so if any is one
order they can get ahold of one of these
little bad boys for themselves you can
get older these people on their online
thing and this thing's pretty cool check
it out
the inlay is all badass you get duel
dragons right here nice wooden handle
then on top another totally cool dragon
the blade it's quite nice nice little
camera sound there so let's go ahead and
let's jump into the unboxing bit of a
dig thing here
stir it in the side here just give me a
little plastic here there we go now the
big thing about these type of coolers is
they're all in one they're very easy to
use you never have to add any liquid to
them they actually are good for about
two years from the ones I've used after
about two years anything soon as you
like just go kaput maybe this one will
run longer but we shall see so we'll
start up at the box of course there are
hydro Series H 55 like we said it says
for Intel and AMD I don't know if it's
going to have the bracket in here for
the 2011 we'll have to see once we get
it open but it says that it has all
those there so here's the side of the
box so it's going to be quieter
I'm sure this thing's geared to be
totally silent like I said it's a $69
unit its entry-level if you just don't
want to have an air cooler and you want
to have a water cool that'll just keep
your non overclocked system running
totally good for about two years I'd
have to say this thing is probably a
solid solution for that
go ahead here and just uh take the box
apart let me go all right what do we got
here we got the warranty against defects
we have the stop do not return this pot
to the store whatever you do don't go
back to the store no not the store so
that means I guess you're going to be
calling these folks direct and I don't
mean collect here's the Corsair here's
the Hydra series age 55 the CPU upgrade
kit it's an instruction guide and all
that stuff I guess it opens up and open
it up anyways let's see what all we got
on your folks all right we're going to
open it all up alright so now that we
have the manual open we can see that it
supports both AMD a.m. 2 a.m. 3 and
supports Intel the LGA 2011 and 1155 and
11:56 so it's going to pretty much
support anything by Intel or AMD all the
instructions are clear all the way
through how to install it this is very
very simple and easy to install there
even saying only hand tighten it so
pretty nice stuff there we'll get that
out of the way go ahead and start off by
removing the fan before we pull the rest
of the components out of the box let's
first take a look real quick at all the
mounting hardware here you can see it
all here there's everything here for
both AMD and Intel a m2 LGA 1150 556 and
2011 so now let's jump to the rest of
the box here's the bad you can see it's
a Corsair
here's the model number and stuff right
there if you can anybody looking to
actually purchase that separately
sometime put on the back just your
standard fan so go ahead and bring this
out here's the radiator you guys can see
it's a very very thin very small meant
to be just sufficient ran in normal mode
go ahead and pull this off a couple
things here now here's where you're
going to plug it into the motherboard
into the fan connection so you don't get
any errors or anything like that I'll
come down here's the block underneath
I'm go ahead just put this off you guys
can see it's copper and it already has
the thermal paste applied there so
really all you need to have is probably
maybe a screw driver your hands and your
stuff and away you'll go alright folks
there you go that's the unboxing and
first look of the new corsair hydra
series 855 hitting the market at about
seventy dollars you may be able to find
it cheaper out there with a deal
