what up guys glad to see you back in the
channel once again so a little while
back pretty short actually time ago I
showed you guys this thing called the
retro Kade and it was pretty cool I mean
it's made by a company called retro bit
and that particularly unit I actually
like for the price range that it was
then you got like 90 games they were all
old-school retro type of stuff a lot of
different varieties and I kind of really
I kind of thought that was pretty cool
for what it was so I said hey do you
guys have anything else we can check out
so retro bit something something else I
don't that came out right retro bit sent
me something else that's right here
super retro trio 3 plus ok now this is
supposed to play all of your old-school
cartridges so right off the bat I want
to say if you're a person out there and
you have a lot of older cartridges this
is probably going to be a cool thing for
you because not only can you play all
your old games on it in the front of the
unit it actually has a room to plug in
all the old-school controllers so if you
have the old-school controls for your
for either your Genesis for your Super
NES so your NES they're all located on
the front now in the rear it's pretty
simple you have HDMI USB for your power
plug and then an RCA and that's all
there really is and this particular
machine uses cartridges so when I got it
there were absolutely no games installed
whatsoever so right off the bat I know
what this is geared for I think that's
kind of a strike one in my opinion in
just kind of way if you want to be
honest because even though it does play
all of these Super Nintendo games and
Genesis games and all that stuff why
didn't they just install some games on
it I mean you could have put those 90
games that were on the retro quedan here
and I just thought that was pretty cool
now they were cool with me
they sent me a couple of cards you just
to play with I got the all-star
collection this one's day to East this
one's also another one from this one's
Davey says well it's the classic
collection now now between these actual
two right here though there's just not
that
minigames whatsoever so if you were
gonna buy cartridges from these guys
you'd be buying a whole bunch of
cartridges just to get the 90 games that
you've got on the retro Kade right I
mean the retro cave you've got 90 games
to play I guess specifically if they're
games you actually you know you hate
them you remember you're like I I hate
that game I don't want to play it ever
again damn you all up in my mule when I
got mad I wanted to destroy it but you
know not all games are like that but you
know there are some game to me back in
the day let me tell you not all were as
fun as they were able to be so I guess
in that respect you know it's kind of
cool because you can choose whatever
games you want but to me the best thing
about this is if you have those extra
cartridges from the old days and you
know a lot of those machines are all
they're not working very much than sure
this is a pretty cool thing I think it
comes to market about like 80 bucks I
think is about the maximum we saw itself
or probably can give you even get a
cheap if you search on Amazon and stuff
you know but strike two on this thing
and this is where to me it just gets
like I don't really get it strike two on
this particular machine is when I'm
playing the games on this most of the
time when I'm trying to get out of the
game the system doesn't allow me to it
just keeps restarting the game over and
over and over and over and over maybe
some of you guys on one of these you
could let me know hey we're like you're
crazy it does this but for me I mean I'm
not you mean I'm pushing both the
buttons at the same time to take me out
of the game it never takes me out of the
game it just takes me back into the game
I've tried pressing all the other
buttons and nothing ever happens hey I
mean I may be doing something wrong I
don't think so but to me that's really
weird and then once in a while which is
where I honestly I think is strike
number three is that sometimes the
controls don't seem like they're working
right like they'd the response time on
the controls doesn't seem like it's
accurate to what the gameplay is there
are certain games where I'm trying to do
things I'm like a weight you know I'm
doing that but all of a sudden I'm dead
I'm like huh what the heck that's really
weird so
even though I think that these guys had
a really really good idea with this
product now I don't have any old
cartridges whatsoever I'll be honest
with you if I did I would have tested
them and tested those controllers and
let you know if I had a different
experience because maybe it's something
new two controllers maybe that's why I
can't get out of the games you know but
and even worse is very rarely though
you'll get it where it just freezes up
and you got to restart the entire thing
again so at the end of the day if you're
somebody actually looking to play a
bunch of these retro games you know
you're better off getting the retro game
because it just has 90 games you can get
more if you want so I really like that
and they even have like a retro cape
even a better version that you could get
as well for me personally that's what I
want to I would want to get now I know
some people out there before said hey
the best thing to do would be to go out
and get a Raspberry Pi and build one but
here's my question to you say I build
this Raspberry Pi device what
controllers am I actually going to be
able to use with this Raspberry Pi sure
I understand the idea the concept sounds
badass yeah awesome cheap easy but what
controllers can you actually use with
the Raspberry Pi can you use any of the
old-school controllers can use a Super
NES controller can you use the brand new
xbox controllers I mean what controllers
can you actually use with the Raspberry
Pi so like always I want to know your
guys's thoughts down below
so at the end of the day the only reason
that I would see to buy this machine is
like I said if you have a lot of games
from the past that you want to play you
don't have a machine to play them in
you'd still like to screw around and
have fun hey it's good to go I mean even
though you have to restart a lot of
times to get out of the game it's really
not that big of a deal so I mean if
you're sitting there playing a game for
15 or 20 minutes with a friend of yours
and you got a go restart I mean it's not
the end of the world it's just kind of a
pain in the butt the freezing was was
very rare I'm gonna say it's random that
didn't happen happen very often you know
I mean and the control on the stick I
mean in some games it works just fine
but on some it just seemed a little
laggy not the end of the world so I milk
you guys have been watching Tekken
tomorrow we'll have a link down below if
you guys want to check out more about
the system for yourself and we'll see
you guys back in the channel for more
