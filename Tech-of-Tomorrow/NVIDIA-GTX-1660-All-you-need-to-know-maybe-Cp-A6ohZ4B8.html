guy will be turning 53 young years of
age and nvidia is gonna be really seeing
a brand new video card to the market
that's right the rumors are obviously
true because there are people out there
selling this card so it is true there
will be a gtx 1660 and there'll be a
couple of varieties there'll be the TI
version and the standard version and
it's rumored that they'll even be a
three gigabyte version now why anybody
really be releasing a three gigabyte
version at this time in the game I don't
know maybe somebody's got an older
monitor an older system they just don't
really need a high-end video card but
here's what it's looking like
it's looking like we're gonna see prices
at 279 for the Ti version and about 229
for the non TI version of these cards
now what's really the difference between
these cards and our TX 2060 well let's
talk about that real quick the GeForce
r-tx 2060 fe features a tu 106 chipset
now here you guys can see a picture of
the tu one one six four hundred and
there's also rumored to be a tu one one
six 300 now the differences that we're
seeing as far as CUDA cores go on the
2060 we're seeing 1920 it's rumored that
on the six gigabyte version of the 1660
Ti we're gonna see fifteen hundred and
thirty six and on the standard version
we're gonna see twelve hundred and
eighty and we're also gonna see twelve
hundred eighty on the three gigabyte
version now you have to take into
account that these are rumored things
now the only thing I think that really
does suggest though that these are going
to be actual facts is that these
products are for sale in systems by
certain you know manufacturers out there
who build custom systems so that kind of
like lends credence to the fact that
these cards are coming now one thing
about the 1660 series in general it's
not going to feature any of the tensor
cores or RT core so there's not going to
be any r-tx support whatsoever however
you are going to see faster shading to
the 12
our design process now as far as the
texture units go on the r-tx 2060 efi we
see there are 120 texture units on the
1660 TI 6 gigabyte version there's 96 on
the standard 6 gigabyte version there is
room in Derby 80 and on the 3 gigabyte
versions 80 as well now the base clock
of the RT X 2060 Fe is thirteen hundred
and sixty-five megahertz
now something it's kind of interesting
is that the gtx 1660 TI six gigabyte
version is rumored to be 1500 megahertz
in its base clock and what's even
stranger is that on the standard gtx
1660 we're seeing fifteen hundred and
thirty megahertz as the base clock and
this is also seen on the three gigabyte
version as well now as far as the GPU
boost goes on the our TX 2060 efi we see
sixteen hundred and eighty megahertz
now in the gtx 1660 TI six gigabyte
version this is seventeen hundred and
seventy megahertz and it actually jumps
up fifteen megahertz on both the
standard version and the three gigabyte
version now across the board all of
these cards feature 192 bit memory
interface the memory clocks however are
different the 2060 has 7000 megahertz
the TI 6000 megahertz the standard
version and the three gigabyte version
are both at 4000 megahertz also none of
the 1660 cards have any ROPS whatsoever
those are strictly for the our TX card
so like I said there's rumors that these
cards are coming and I believe these
rumors are going to be true because like
I said there are places out there
selling these things and people don't
want to really be selling stuff and have
people returning it saying hey you lied
on these specifications and a Zeus has a
lot of different bottles that looks like
that or be gonna be coming out now my
whole thing is this though 3 gigabyte
version I mean is there really any
reason for that whatsoever it really
doesn't seem like there is I mean you
would have figured they would have gone
with a 408 I don't know it just seems a
little bit weird as far as the memory
configurations go but we'll see how it
does in the market I guess if you really
do have an older system you've got a
smaller monitor and you're not gonna be
doing things at high resolution maybe a
card that's 229 bucks that does speed up
everything else you're doing really
quickly it could be a great you know
benefit for them now how this is really
gonna affect AMD we'll have to see I
mean I'm kind of pondering right now if
AMD is even going to be able to compete
with Nvidia at all in 2019 at this
moment in time I'm just really not quite
sure it looks like I'm the video card
side of things it's probably gets gonna
be a lot of the same and video will be
toppling the towers and AMD will just be
slightly behind them but there you go
folks
it looks like we're gonna see new cards
in that lower price range from Nvidia
279 for the TI 229 for the standard
version who knows what the three
gigabyte version is maybe that's when
it's gonna be $229 I guess we'll just
actually have to see when they actually
get released on the market my birthday
is February 22nd and that's when these
cards are rumored to come out so
hopefully you know I'll have one from my
birthday present out there you know wink
wink wink wink wink wink we'll have
links to all these stories down below
thanks for watching Tecna tomorrow hey
if you're not sub please do so we also
have patron site so if you want to
support it so it only cost you only a
mere $2 a month to help keep the channel
going I love you folks god bless you
we'll see you guys back in the channel
for more tech tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
