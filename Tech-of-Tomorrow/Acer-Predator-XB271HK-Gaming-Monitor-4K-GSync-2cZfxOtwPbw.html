HK in extra-crispy 4k let's go
the xB 271 HK is the little brother to
this D 35 and X 34 now this monitor
features a 27-inch screen with a 3840 by
2160 resolution at a 16 to 9 aspect
ratio the native refresh rate on the HK
is 60 Hertz but with gene sync enabled
you can get 75 Hertz even at 4k and 4k
at 75 Hertz looks glorious the bevel
around the edge of the monitor is also
quite small some people complain about
this and said it was a large bevel but I
feel it's a very small bevel let me know
what you guys think other features of
the HB 271 HK are 178 viewing angle a
brightness of 300 C D 107 billion colors
a contrast ratio a thousand-to-one and a
4 millisecond refresh rate the HK also
features a tilt adjustment from 5 to 35
degrees a swivel up to 30 degrees a -
justement up to 150 millimetres and it
also offers complete pivoting bow which
means you can set the monitor any way
you like for standard gaming for
portrait whatever your zyre this helps
out quite a bit when you're doing
productivity and using things like
Photoshop the dimensions of this
predator are fourteen fifty by twenty
four twenty by ten sixty inches and the
weight with the stand is a whopping 16
pounds now that's a big baby predator
and as we spin around the back of the
monitor you guys can't see him but built
inside here are 2 2 watt DTS speakers
now obviously at 2 watts these things
are not going to give the greatest sound
in the world but if you're just looking
for a simple sound they'll work and
while we're back here let's talk about
the connectivity there's a single
DisplayPort a single HDMI port and then
a port for your USB that includes 4 USB
3.0 adapters and the plug that also
powers the monitor
ok so those the tech specs and the
numbers questions you're going to be a
having I know they're always out there
it's an IPS panel so Elric how is that
back bleed from the back glow well all
back glow monitors do have a little bit
of bleed the particular one that I have
is
isn't that bad it is a little bit worse
than the two others that we reviewed
here but overall it doesn't affect
anything at all when you're gaming
whether you're watching movies or doing
light productivity it doesn't cause any
issues whatsoever now for you folks out
there who like gaming this thing does
look absolutely beautiful
in 4k as we go around playing Star Wars
in some of these other games you guys
can see this thing just looks great
27-inch screen IPS 16 to 9 aspect ratio
3840 by 2160 for the resolution 60 Hertz
native 75 with the g-sync enabled now
that's something I want to talk about
there is a lot of controversy between
free sync and gsync I don't get into the
politics I just like what works but
there is a caveat to this you must have
an Nvidia card that supports g-sync and
able to enable it on the monitor so most
cards that they have out now that are
being sold support this completely
across the board so if you have a new
video card there's nothing to worry
about if you have an older video card
though you might want to check that out
but I will say this much if you use an
AMD card though when you're using a
g-sync monitor even though you can't
have sync enabled there's no framerate
loss whatsoever you're not like losing
frame rates just by doing that so I want
to make that clear
now 4k is really really new it's cool
I'll admit yeah it's cool you got
bragging rights big-ass Swank
and 4k monitor but the whole thing is
there's very few things out there that
are actually 4k very few movies you can
actually subscribe to Netflix I'm
probably sure there's probably some
others out there by now
you know that have 4k support but
there's limited content so if you think
you're going to get 4k and there's gonna
be all this stuff is 4k out there I want
to be honest with you there's not a lot
of content but it is cool games look
brilliant when they support 4k and the
movies that aren't 4k in TV programs
when they are fully 4k that is awesome
it is beautiful
now this thing is a little bit costly
though this monitor I think is coming
around like 800 bucks so it's a bit
pricey 4k you know is pricey plus it's a
predator series monitor you know
predator series are the new
stuff now years ago I know that a sir
had some issues with their monitors but
lately got to say this Asia has been
really closing the niche market and
grabbing the market of these monitors
really only LG is competing with them at
all right now these guys are really
kicking butt I know a Zeus is coming out
with some honor you guys have said those
are cool as well so there are some
really cool ones but the thing is most
these ones are using the same panel
you know IPS panels in them all whoo so
anyways folks like I said if you want
some this 4k you got the money
you like the color scheme you like that
small bevel especially if you're going
to be putting like multiple monitors
together you got some bucks these things
will do great for doing surround stuff
because of that small bevel you guys can
see it's not very large at all so thanks
for watching let me know what you guys
think down below hey I always want to
see your opinion I'm Eric you've been
watching tech to tomorrow down below
like button we'll have a link to where
you guys can purchase one of these or
just get more information from their
website peace out my brothers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
