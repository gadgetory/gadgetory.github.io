guys my personal favorite top 5 PC games
of 2014 now just to be clear these are
my personal favorite ones not
necessarily objectively the best they're
not listed in any particular order and I
haven't gotten a chance to play every
single game that came out this year so
if your favorite ones missing make sure
to let us know down in the comments now
with that being said let's kick things
off with dragon age inquisition now the
game's controls could honestly do with a
little bit of a makeover and the
multiplayer has literally zero need to
exist but the rest of this game men just
completely make up for it with me the
story is a noticeable improvement over
to though that's honestly not hard to do
and I found myself loving just about the
entire cast of characters with one very
noticeable exception one of its greatest
strengths though lies and it's terrific
balance between having story-driven
missions and open world environments
whose main purpose is to be a source of
XP grinding butter handled in a way that
still makes them really engaging the
series has certainly changed its tone
from the original and while it's not the
kind of RPG I'd wish it to be the kind
that dragon age origins originally
attempted to revive Inquisition does a
fantastic job bringing it in this new
direction while still bringing an
adventure that's grand in scale and
enjoyable now next up is another
multi-platform title and honestly one of
my personal top five games of the year
overall and that's the second game from
supergiant games transistor this indie
title brings a near perfect mix of
beautiful art a fantastic soundtrack an
interesting story in setting with core
game mechanics that are not only
original but really interesting
experimenting with the game system
rewards players with extra tidbits of
story and while some moves are abusive
enough to make the late game pretty
easier first time through the game does
offer new game+ modes and challenge
missions for those wanting to test their
skills while it offers the least number
of hours out of the games on this list
it's also some of the most concentrated
bliss and one of the easiest games on
your wallet to come out this year now
third on the list is another indie title
and if you haven't heard of it or
haven't played it yet you're probably
get I think it's a little weird at first
but it deserves to be here just as much
as the other games and that's shovel
Knight now at first glance you might
think that this game relies solely on
people having nostalgia for retro games
but it is so much more than that shovel
Knight combines and refined some of the
best aspects of classic games like
megaman Castlevania and Mario Brothers
but goes a step further by having a lot
of design mechanics that are original
and unique to it while old and style the
game looks as though it would have been
one of the most
gorgeous games of it's time that it's
trying to recapture and offers level
design and bosses that are not only fun
but extremely challenging if you're a
fan of old-school platformers or just
games that set out to test your skill
shovel Knight is one of the must grabs
of this year especially at its price
point next up is the most recent title
on this list it was the surprise hit
that came out just earlier this month
and that's the first person puzzle game
the Talos principle following in the
footsteps of Valve's super popular
portal franchise the Talos principle is
a more serious tone adventure with a
more passive story with deep roots and
philosophy the game's mechanics are
slowly and purposefully expanded upon
with time and gives players a degree of
freedom in what order they do which
puzzles giving you the ability to tackle
things at your own pace what starts off
as pretty simple slowly becomes
considerably more complex and
challenging and the game's atmosphere in
terms of both its world design and music
does an excellent job of capturing
players attention for the long haul best
of all the game is designed in a way
that works for both people looking to
just lose a few days just playing it
nonstop or those that just want to take
a little time each day solving a puzzle
or two with what little free time they
have now as I said earlier this list
hasn't been done in any particular order
but if I had to rank them this one would
definitely be the main competitor for
the number one top spot and that's
divinity original sin now admittedly
this game is a little more niche than
the others and holds most of its appeal
to fans of old-school PC RPGs but what
really jumps out to me about this game
is that for a game of its size and scale
it still feels like a true labor of love
and not just a formulaic big hit seller
there's a ton of detail put into the
game's mechanics and it's writing hits a
sweet spot between being a serious
adventure and having some great comedic
moments one thing that makes this RPG
uniquely amazing though is its approach
to coop and that it just doesn't simply
make it so that two players can make
characters and fight together but that
it can even argue and debate over what
choices are the right ones to make and
even play rock paper scissors when both
refused to back down it's not for
everyone but if you're a fan of classic
RPGs then this is one of the best
attempts to bring that old-school flavor
into modern gaming completely worth
playing by yourself or with a friend so
there you have it my favorite pc games
of 2014 as i said i left a lot of stuff
out of this list i had quite a few i had
to consider and struggled over choosing
