here now I have to say the video card
giveaway was a really nice success all
the way a lot of people got involved had
a lot of fun with it the Twitter
giveaway works great because I'm able to
contact the people directly so I decided
to do one more this time I'm going to be
giving away four game titles two copies
of pug B and two copies of global
Offensive so I'm sure you guys all know
what that is so it'll be four games this
time I know what people say oh my god
these titles are kind of clicked baby
but they're honestly they're not they're
just to get your attention here a lot of
people if they see just so I'm gonna do
a giveaway thing they tend to just kind
of go ant whatever you know what I mean
I don't know why that is but this at
least draws the people and I love to
give you guys stuff and one thing really
good about these game codes it doesn't
matter where you live I don't have to
worry about shipping it to you or coming
up with you living someplace that I'm
having a hard time even getting it to or
it's like five hundred dollars to ship
to your island that you live to in the
middle of nowhere
it's a nightmare giving game codes away
is perfect so Counter Strike global
Offensive everybody knows that game they
play it a lot and player unknown
battlegrounds is like one of the most
popular games it's out there right now
and what's really cool is for you folks
that on the Nvidia side of things and
Vidya has all kinds of cool stuff going
on we made a video about it before and
I'll have a link down below where it'll
show you where you can actually play pug
be on even a cheap laptop with over 60
frames per second no lag whatsoever due
to using some of the features that
NVIDIA has with their software and with
their a whole you know environment that
they work in now AMD hasn't yet quite up
and doesn't have anything like that yet
there's no AMD thing like there will
they have all their games in the cloud
you can go get them and everything just
right there in a bucket this is like
right now and that's kind of a nice
thing about Nvidia at that point is that
you can do that so if you guys want to
be able to win copy does it came like I
said two copies of plug B two copies of
the other so that's four games that's a
lot of people so what you need to do
it's simple it's really easy share liked
this video I'd like if you subscribe to
the channel but please do not sub my
channel just to get in the contest and
then come back and D sub if you don't
win I would prefer that you did not sub
my channel whatsoever it just
confuses things when the numbers jump up
and all of a sudden these numbers go
down so you don't have to be sub to my
channel but you do have to like share
the video go over to Twitter do the same
thing and then I'll be picking the four
winners on Twitter just like usual
because it's very very simple and like I
said before I have a lot of gleam stuff
coming up and you guys are going to be
blown away when you actually see what we
are doing because I've got a lot of
people involved in this even AMD believe
it or not even though we're not exactly
on the greatest of speaking terms right
now they actually did provide some stuff
for us to bring you guys this gleam
giveaway so I've got systems coming up
power supplies I've got some really
honestly some badass reservoirs that are
coming from NR Max you guys are going to
trip on these things they're just
absolutely brilliant so I know some
people want everything to be gleam but
this is just too simple man 4 game codes
hey why should we go to blame for this
it's really easy what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna look for you share the video
I'll see it over on Twitter because
it'll say on your Twitter account if you
shared the video so it's somebody said
last time well how do you know if they
shared the video what's pretty easy on
Twitter because it says you shared the
video and it's right on your channel so
all I have to do is look and if you
haven't well then you didn't follow the
rules but it's very very simple I know
some people say oh my god I look I don't
want to use Twitter but I mean honestly
you don't really have to use Twitter to
be in the contest subscribing and is
having on your system you could wait and
delete it but there are so many contests
on Twitter these days that honestly if
you're a person who wants to take a
chance just do the Twitter thing just
for the country you know just for the be
able to enter these contests there are
guys that I know who spend all of their
time all day long and wring contests and
that's all they do and guess what
these guys win stuff a lot they're guys
with stacks and stacks of crap at their
home really from entering these contests
so I mean if you enter enough stuff
eventually you're going to win somewhere
that's just the rule of numbers so hey
take a chance enter the contest try it
out get yourself pug beat for under a
buck hell and get it for free like usual
down to that like button hopefully you
like this and don't dislike it when I'm
giving stuff away cuz that's just
insanity but hopefully you do and all of
all the information
down there and hey if you do want to set
the channel because you like our content
I would love to see you and have you
part of our family piece out of her
