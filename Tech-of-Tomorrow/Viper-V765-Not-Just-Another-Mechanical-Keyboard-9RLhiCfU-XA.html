this out this is the Viper V 765
mechanical gaming keyboard as you guys
can see from the beginning of the video
this thing looks really nice and it's
also made to last a really long time
it features an aircraft grade aluminum
chassis and a 1.8 litre braided cable
now something totally also different
about this particular keyboard is it
features the first ever di p LED box
switches which feature lighting effects
and it also comes the magnetic
detachable palm rest which is really
comfortable to set your hands on now the
Viper V 765 it is the first of their
keyboard series to feature kale box
switches now this box design protects
the overall switch from dust and
moisture which extends the life by quite
a while it actually has a moisture
rating of IP 56 now these particular
keyboards on this version are the white
click version let me tell you they are
very very very clicky me personally I'm
not the kind of person who really likes
all the clickety switches but they do
have different versions with different
switches so you can get red brown black
and other colors so if you want a
keyboard that's totally silent you can
get one as well me personally I don't
like all the clickety clickety stuff but
some people they do and if you don't
well they got a keyboard that doesn't
make noise now the white switches on the
viper v7 65 they feature a 1.8
millimeter activation distance now this
is a light difference from their
traditional kale switches the bottom of
the keyboard is very simple it simply
has the name of the product and the two
adjustable stands for adjusting the
height level of the keyboard also as you
guys can see this keyboard includes
full-spectrum RGB sixteen point eight
million color backlighting along with
easy to use software in which you can
customize lighting and macro buttons but
a lot of the features that you can do on
the app you can also do on the keyboard
itself now to control the different
lighting modes it's very simple on the
bottom of the keyboard you'll see
there's a little button it looks like a
Viper now you have to do is you push
this button and
then f6 through f10 troll all of the
different lighting features and there's
quite a few may have a rain feature
breathe and even a static mode another
cool thing about the viper v7 65 is you
can actually create your own custom
lighting modes you simply hit the viper
button and then the f12 button hit the
different keys to create the lighting
sequences that you like and then hit the
viper button f12 again to save your
settings
one thing that gamers are really gonna
like about this keyboard is that it has
a hundred and three programmable macro
keys and a five profile control key and
fourteen different light control keys
which means that pretty much you can not
only control how you play your games by
using those macro keys you can control
every aspect of the way this keyboard
operates the way that looks all the
different lighting everything which
pretty much makes it really customizable
me personally I like having media
control keys on your keyboard because
let's just face it if you're in game and
you want to change your volume or
anything like that you really don't want
to have to mess with your mouse or
anything like that you have your hands
on your keyboard already so having the
switches and controls on your keyboard
makes it very convenient now open the
left hand side you guys can see there's
all the keys for stop pause all that
type of stuff and over on the right hand
side there's a scroll wheel and this is
for controlling your volume but what's
really cool is if you want to mute
everything you simply just click the
button that silences everything I don't
know if you guys have ever been in game
and you're just going crazy hitting keys
try and do something and that alson your
keyboard freezes over because you hit
too many keys I really hate that but
this particular keyboard won't have any
problems at whatsoever because it has n
key rollover and a hundred percent
anti-ghosting features while I was
gaming I had no problems using the
keyboard whatsoever like I said before
my hands are kind of the perfect size
for this keyboard now someone who has
big giant hands they might have a little
bit of difficulty with the different
keys and pressing too many keys at one
time but for my gaming style and
everything I found to be just perfect
the keys weren't so far apart that I
couldn't hit them and they weren't so
close together that I kept hitting the
wrong key over and over again and
throughout the entire gaming experience
my
hands were comfortable I felt no fatigue
at all even after a few hours of gaming
the most important feature though to me
is how comfortable a keyboard is when
you're using it and this particular
keyboard is very comfortable
I like the palm rest quite a bit because
you don't need to add anything to keep
your hands feeling like they're not you
know really uncomfortable and at an
angle on the table
I like that quite a bit all the buttons
in everything are very nicely laid out
and I mean every keyboard is pretty much
laid out kind of the same they're all
just a wee bit different this one for me
actually fits my hands I have medium
sized hands and for me this keyboard
works out really nice another thing that
I personally like is the numpad some
keyboards don't have them what sort of
they feel hey it's a gaming keyboard I
don't need to include this in my design
but I'm really glad it's there now
instead of doing a typical unboxing of
this particular keyboard there really
wasn't a lot in the box of the viper 7-6
5 you get the keyboard you get the
removable magnetic little palm rest
which I like it that's really cool just
clicks on and clicks off you get the key
removal tool so if you want taking those
little keys that this makes it easy just
pop them right out and then last but not
least you get a little package right
here that has some stickers and stuff in
it so not a whole lot of stuff inside
the box now I almost at first didn't
really want to do a keyboard review
because I feel that a lot of ways
they've just been like done so many
times over and over and over here
because let's just face it you guys all
know keyboards are actually a pretty
standard type of thing and hey real
quick kg having that keyboard over there
that I brought out down earlier I want
to show you guys something and just talk
about something now this here is a
mechanical keyboard it has the new
switches on it and like I said you can
get any type of switch that you
particular want to get on this keyboard
so if you want to be silent only
partially clickety clickety or really
SuperDuper clickety clickety you can get
it any way that you wanted now all the
different lighting effects being able to
control them that's kind of cool I think
RGB is also outdone everything's fricken
RGB my underwear gonna come with RGB
now they're gonna have RGB condoms
pretty soon you know you guys know what
I'm saying
everything's going fricken RGB it's just
crazy what's important
however are the programmable macro keys
103 programmable macro keys which means
that pretty much you can do so many
different combinations and for you guys
out there who play the games that like
to throw spells and all those kind of
games this kind of feature becomes very
very important for people out there who
do first-person-shooter stuff and that's
probably not gonna be all that important
but one thing it's nice too is you can
actually set this keyboard so it just
shows you the WASD Keys that are just
show you RGB you can do all kinds of
different stuff but if you like
programming all the keys and having all
that macros well it's all built into the
keyboard having all the controls for
multimedia I know they're usually all on
the top and the top of me where else
they're gonna go they're not gonna go
here and they're going to not gonna go
in the back but at least being on here I
think it's very easy to control stuff
because if I'm doing stuff like I'm
typing or anything like that and I want
to change my music I know what to go in
and click on the program dough let
change AI want to be able do it right on
my keyboard so we see the magnetic the
magnetic strip it loses to mother nature
and gravity mother nature and gravity
pulled it right to the ground now as far
as like typing goes like if you're we
sit here typing forever in a day I
honestly I don't think that I would
suggest this particular keyboard for
typing all day long unless you like
hearing me that person tries me freaking
crazy now I give this keyboard though
editors choice for a couple of reasons
though for gamers out there who want
full control of their keyboard that's
really cool second reason has a 2 year
full warranty and it's only $89 any guys
make only $89 - come on guys you guys
know that good mechanical keyboards can
be anywhere upwards between 150 and 300
dollars depending on the manufacturer so
a solid keyboard with the aluminum grade
chassis
solid stuff on and all of these keys are
made so they keep out dust they keep out
moisture like I said as an IP 56 rating
so all in all I think the features on
this definitely deserve an editor's
choice even though it's not really
inventing the wheel but hey it's a wheel
that really really works now me person
before I jump out here I'm gonna show
you guys something
my favorite keyboard of all time I do
of all time is this bad boy right here
this is the SciTech man
it's a membrane keyboard and I got to
tell you for playing games for typing me
personally I love this keyboard
I wish somebody out there would pick up
a design like this and go back to making
some keyboards like this mechanical
keyboards are cool this is a cool
keyboard but honestly I love my Eclipse
