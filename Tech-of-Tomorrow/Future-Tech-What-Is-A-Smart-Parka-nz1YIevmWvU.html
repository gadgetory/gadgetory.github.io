once again I'm Elric and today's video
is actually sponsored by the people at
smart parka smart park is a company in
Canada that's designed the most amazing
parka that you guys have ever seen so
without any further ado let's see what
the smart parka is all about if you're a
person who lives in a relatively cold
area that has a lot of different climate
change you're gonna need a jacket or
parka that's going to keep you warm in
many different circumstances and through
all kinds of varied degrees of weather
and that's where the smart parka comes
in the smart parkas been designed from
the ground up to eliminate you having to
go out and buy all these different
things now think about it when you first
go out and you buy a jacket the jacket
may kind of keep your body warm but what
about your hands what about your head
what about your face and what about your
whole body if you want to stay warm
well a smart parka it has you covered
all the way across the board and let's
see why I just want to show you guys how
versatile how amazing the smart parka is
so like I said really really cold
weather this is the way you're gonna
want to leave looking you want a full
length coat keeping your legs your whole
body nice and warm but what if it warms
up a bit and you don't really want that
much well the first thing you can do is
remove the bottom simply zips off and
then basically that part of the jacket
is removable so then you go from having
a full length coat to a hip length coat
so that automatically changes the
weather so let's go ahead and I'll go
ahead and toss this off kibou knees like
I said folks I have removed the inner
liner because it's just too hot here to
zip this inside of here but without the
lining this thing can still keep you
amazingly warm from five Celsius all the
way to minus ten cells just without the
lining and with the lining you get from
-10 Celsius all the way up to minus 25
Celsius so regardless of the type of
weather you find yourself in you guys
can see the smart parka is built to keep
you warm and cozy and scarves are cool
as well but think about does a scarf
really match the insolvable you're
wearing I mean if you have to pull your
hat off put the scarf on go through all
kinds of things but guess what with the
smartparker
you don't need to do that either with a
smart parka your scarf is already
in to the jacket making it so ergonomic
and easy to keep your face and neck warm
just like this if this is too warm for
you you can simply just unzip the hood
and once it's removed you're into a
whole different level of warmth
now you guys saw that the hood has the
built-in scarf now the scarfs really
ergonomic because only once you take it
out you can very simply tuck the scarf
back in and the scarves out of the way
being completely unobtrusive to anything
that you're doing also there are many
pockets not only do you get the pocket
on top where you can put your cap you've
also got an additional pocket inside
here for doing even more storage so if
you like to put your phone up there
whatever you can put your phone up there
and take it around with you
just all in all really incredible stuffs
you guys might think oh it's just a hood
no it's actually a very multifunction
hood and last but not least the hood can
be accessorized by a nice fur outer
lining which you can buy separately
attached to the jacket this is for both
men and women and looks pretty cool now
this part of the jacket I got to say
folks is pretty cool it's kind of like
Union to me kind of like superhero-ish
in a way you know you guys know what I
mean but in each one of these little
side zippers are the gloves that's right
so they're actually connected as well
but if you want to attach them it's very
easy to do but this way you'll never
lose your gloves now I got to tell you
folks about these gloves they are very
very soft very warm and like I said they
easily just clip off with a little clip
right here so that you can have the
gloves out and these gloves are very
well made very soft leather they're very
nice to wear very comfortable and
they're very warm I don't know about you
folks but me personally I'm always
walking around with a bunch of stuff in
my hands and that means having a jacket
that has a lot of pockets is a really
cool thing and the smart parka doesn't
let you down at all you've got plenty of
pockets on the outside you've got a
couple up here a couple of down here and
inside there's even more so first off
let's start with the glasses that's
right I'll pull my glasses off you can
see my guys eyes nice place to store
your glasses right up here on top
perfect place seal that up and good to
go there's also a foam pocket located
very ergonomically right here inside
the jacket and if you have a tablet
check this out right over here on this
side
I got a nice giant space to stick the
tablet everything fits inside of the
smart parka it took a lot of thinking to
bring this jacket around and bring it to
the table you guys can see that it's the
most versatile jacket that you're ever
going to buy and comes with all the
accessories that you need to stay warm
or cool depending on the weather that
you're living in like I said if you're a
person who lives in Cooke stream cold
weather this jacket is gonna be perfect
for you because of all its versatility
you don't have to go out and buy any
accessories everything's built into the
jacket from your hat from your face from
your gloves to a full length jacket the
smart parka has you covered all the way
across the board and what's really cool
about the smart parka is it comes in
four different styles for women and
three different styles for men so no
matter what kind of style you like smart
parkas gonna have something that will
fit your need so depending on your taste
smart parka has a jacket for your life

still in its kickstarter phase and that
makes it awesome for you guys because
