great and it's pretty cool so now that
you've seen how well it runs let's
actually talk about what's inside and
what makes this system so for the case
we went with the NZXT s3 40 there's a
pretty cool case a lot of people like
and it's actually pretty easy to do a
build in the motherboard is the Aizu z97
a LGA 1150 motherboard far as a cpu with
the intel i5 4690 k 3 point 5 gigahertz
quad-core cpu cooling all this off is
the cooler master hyper 212 evo cpu

have two different drives for the boot
drive we have the crucial MX 220 50
gigabyte SSD and for our storage drive
we have a western digital one terabyte
blue drive with plenty of room to put
those games on as far as memory goes
we've got eight gigabytes of the corsair
vengeance 1866 megahertz ddr3 for the
video card an asus gtx 970 turbo
overclocked edition video card now you
know that's a damn fine card powering it
all is a corsair CX 750 750 watt 80 plus
bronze power supply and like i said
before this system comes with Windows
8.1 if you don't want that whether you
can consider the system basically a
hundred dollars less sense an 11 hundred
