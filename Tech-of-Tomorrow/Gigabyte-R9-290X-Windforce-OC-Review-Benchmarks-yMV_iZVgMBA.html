tomorrow good morning kitties and
welcome to another edition of the tech
of tomorrow show you guys can forget
about those cartoons forget about those
cornflakes because we've got tech for
your Saturday morning and what have we
got today the wind forced edition of
gigabyte of the new r9 290x and it's
full review format that's right so if
you folks been following the channel you
may have seen the unboxing if not we'll
have the unboxing right here for you
folks out there who likes to know what
comes in the box we've already done that
so now let's jump in let's talk about
the specs and how this card runs let's
go let's first off talk about the
dimensions of the card the card is
eleven point six by five point six by
one point six inches we'll also have
this translated into metric for you
folks as well now one of the biggest
things about this card is that its GPU
clock is overclocked it's got a 40
megahertz overclock out of the box
coming into the market at ten forty
megahertz features 2,816 stream
processors 1200 50 megahertz memory
clock 512 bit memory interface 4
gigabytes of gddr5 memory flip it around
to the ER IO to DVI standard DisplayPort
standard HDMI nothing too unusual there
the card also has a single 6 pin and a
single 8 pin power connector on the side
of the car for the folks out there in
that information as well now the biggest
biggest difference about this card
obviously is the wind force cooling now
you guys all know when the original 290
X's came out they were hotter than hell
they were noisier than hell and
everybody agreed we needed better cooler
or we need a liquid cooler well a few
folks out there who know about wind
force technology this is their own
cooling solution by the people at
gigabyte and it works very very well now
if you folks out there are curious
about our test system do you guys want
all of the specs we have two ways you
can do that you can either check out the
video which I have right here or you
guys can check out the link down below
we'll have the full specs listed out now
with that said though let's jump in and
let's rock out with our sock out and
let's check out the scores of the new r9
290x from gigabyte
all right hope so there you guys have it
though full scores and everything about
this card now performance-wise
we're not seeing all that much of an
increase beyond the normal AMD 290x that
came out of the market but what we are
seeing is massive massive decreases in
the heat and you've got to take
something in consideration this card is
actually overclocked 40 megahertz out of
the box and that's really pretty much as
far as you can push it unless you want
to start getting into extreme heat now
the reference to 90 X when it was under
full load it was at 94 Celsius really a
hot gigabyte card however is only 68 so
that's a major major difference 94 to 68
that's night and day it keeps it cool
it's overclocked right out of the box
and it's not as noisy and I also want to
talk a little bit about that we are
going to be bringing you guys a shootout
and we'd like to hear you guys comments
about doing a shootout between the 780ti
from msi featuring Twin Frozr cooling
and this card featuring the wind force
so that's pretty much it folks you guys
have seen the card right now it's
actually a bit pricey but I do think the
price are gonna go down because we've
seen the Bitcoin thing actually shot up
but now it's the whole Bitcoin dynamics
change so I imagine prices are going to
be going down but for pricing
availability all that stuff make sure
you guys check out the link down below
like but in the description we'll have
all that stuff about this card
one thing though before I bounce out of
here want to give special thanks to
audible for making this video possible
for supporting the channel now I know if
you guys know what audible out there is
but audible.com is really cool if you
don't have time to sit and read books
all the time but you still like the
information I'm audible.com allows you
to actually listen to the books now
Ironman is a book by Tony autumn from
Black Sabbath and it's really cool I
don't really have a whole lot of time to
read but this is just something cool
Ironman talks about the very beginnings
of Black Sabbath you know all their
drugs their debauchery all the crazy
things that they did to become Black
Sabbath and Rolling Stone actually
called these guys the Beatles of heavy
metal and I kind of agree with that
Black Sabbath to me is the birth of true
heavy metal and
being able to listen to the book through
audible.com is actually really cool if
you guys are interested in that
I'll have that down below I know a lot
of my fans out there totally into the
heavy metal and stuff like that you guys
can actually jump in and you can get
this for free right now so you guys can
go over to audible.com forward slash
tomorrow begin your little trial
membership and you can get this iron man
book by Tony Iommi and listen to it for

listen pretty funny pretty interesting
