welcome back Tech Oh tomorrow I'm Eric
your host this week in the news the
world's smallest gaming console it's
right you can operate this thing with
your thumb also AMD slicing prices once
again on video cards and last up the GTX
770 by Elsa it's a brand new
water-cooled hybrid card let's go so
what's up with this world's smallest
gaming console well it's a Kickstarter
from tiny screen tiny screen is a tiny
OLED screen that can be customized for
several different uses there are a few
apps already installed such as a
SmartWatch app a video player app and
even a video game app that requires no
programming tiny screen is designed to
be used to display information from the
tiny do we know platform which stacks
together like little electronic Legos
games can be played on the system either
with the four buttons on the side of the
screen or with the new joystick tiny
shield this supports two analog
joysticks currently there's a flappy
bird clone and asteroids available as
titles with more games expected later on
it also features open source software so
other Kickstarter backers can create and
share games so my first question to you
folks is do you actually see yourself
gaming on something this small and I
know they show stuff we can like lick up
to your glasses and all kinds of stuff
like that but with Google glass and all
these other products I see this kind of
get mixed in the mix and getting lost
for me personally I would go frustrated
crazy trying to see that thing I'd be
like Oh going mad I'm sure it has other
uses but for me I don't see myself being
one of those customers but what do you
guys think and at this point these guys
have already surpassed all their
Kickstarter goals so if you guys are
still interested though in finding out
more information about this make sure
you guys check out the link down below
know when we're still on the subject of
small things let's talk about a brand
new Mouse from Logitech this thing's a
wireless mouse it's the new m320 the
m320 features a curved shape design with
soft rubber grips created to be
comfortable to the user
it also features two mouse buttons with
a wide scroll wheel that will transmit
to the nano receiver which provides
connection to the computer the m320 also
makes use of Logitech's have bad
optical sensor for resolution of a
thousand dpi
and it is compatible with the range of
operating systems now I know many of you
gamers out there know that last week
Nvidia had their new launch of the 9
Series 989 70 we covered it if you guys
missed out make sure you guys check that
out down below but with that launch
obviously hey AMD's got it can beat
somehow instance right now they don't
have a new card
they are slashing prices baby to get
your money in their budgets
first up the r9 290 has been cut from
399 down to $2.99 $100 savings while
it's bigger brother the r9 290x can be
had for just 399 down from its previous
549 list price elsewhere the r9 285 and
280x are now priced around 229 and to 69
respectively now I don't care who yeah
that's some damn fine price slashing 100
to $150 savings on your favorite AMD
card team red is kicking ass right now
in the pricing and that's a good thing
for fans out there also for those people
interested in getting a deal we will not
only have links down below we've also
got a brand new website where we have an
awesome new deal section which changes
every day bringing better deals to you
the fans this next story is kind of one
of those kind of like spread Church in
going boom like why are you guys doing
this because we all know the GTX 770 has
been out for quite a while now there's
been some comings brought out the four
gigabyte version you know that was kind
of cool and now else is making their own
hybrid water-cooled version the GPU and
the GTX 770 hybrid is overclocked to a
frequency of eleven hundred and sixty
three megahertz with a 1200 and two
megahertz boost clock this card packs a
noteworthy
4 gigabytes of gddr5 memory which runs
at a speed of seven point two eight
gigahertz over 256-bit memory interface
the Exelero hybrid cooler cools the
graphics card with both air and liquid
cooling it features a single 120
millimeter water queen radiator as well
as an 80 millimeter fan on the cooling
shroud itself the card itself is capable
of cooling up to 320 watts and the card
at factory clock speeds should not make
more than 25 decibels of No
one thing I have to mention about this
card folks it comes with a hefty price
tag this thing is coming to market at
$700 that's right I said 700 smackeroos
baby which is more expensive than a 980
so for me I'm kind of like going in but
what do you guys think do you think we
should try to get our hands on one or do
you guys think this thing just way over
price is what it is you guys go out and
buy a card stick your own color on it
and move on down the road at a much
lower price that's kind of personally
what I think I do
but hey you guys are the fans in your
opinion counts so be interactive and let
me know what you guys think so that
pretty much wraps up today's video folks
like usual down below like button will
have all the information on all these
stories including all the availability

slashed for you folks the fans to save
some hard-earned gas so if you're one of
those people out there who just for some
reasons not and a team red and team
green is your thing of choice we've seen
