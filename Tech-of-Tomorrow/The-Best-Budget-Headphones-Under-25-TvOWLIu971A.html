looking for an awesome pair of in-ear
headphones but don't have a lot of cash
to spend here five my favorites first up
we have the ever digi earbuds now what
does 10 bucks get you it gets you the
earbuds plus a braided lightning cable
now even though it comes with that
lightning cable the inline controls can
be operated either by iOS or Android now
the build quality is pretty good the
controls don't feel amazing but the
earbuds themselves they feel great
and even though sound quality may not be
the most amazing in the world you got to
think about this 10 dollars really well
priced next up we have the Panasonic hje
12 now these things are currently priced
under 8 bucks that's right folks a bucks
and honestly after listening to these
for the price these are one of the best
sounding headphones for this price range
and for those who are color choosy they
come in a multitude of colors and
they're actually pretty comfortable as
well and as far as sound quality goes
bass and low-end are very nice for a
pair of headphones at this price range
next up the US tech sm4 51 now this set
of headphones of the price range is an
extremely premium product it has great
looks and they feel incredible
they have a built-in microphone with
inline controls as well and like the
ever Dizzy's the inline control works
with both iOS and Android now as far as
sound quality goes these things are
pretty much right down the middle of the
road no extreme bass no extreme treble
just a very well balanced sound but the
great thing about these headphones is
they just look great now coming in at
number four we've got the Karno tech RM
- s - bluetooth sports headphones and
for you workout junkies out there who
want to get pumped up this might be
something you're seriously interested in
so out of all the headphones we've
looked at today these are definitely the
coolest looking
they feature bluetooth 4.1 160 hours
standby time they're also very rugged
which is important if you're using the
Jim for sure and you'll be able to throw
them in your bag and not worry about
them getting damaged now as far as sound
quality goes like the previous set the
sound quantities is right down the
middle once again but what's really cool
about these is that they stain your ears
which is really important at the gym
this next product it's last but I think
it's my favorite out of the bunch
this is the Aki EP b4 now admittedly
these earbuds might not have the
catchiest name in town but for 24 bucks
they're better than some headphones at
twice that cost and on top of that these
are also sweat proof now you might not
think that's the greatest feature in the
world but when you're at the gym and
you're sweating your butt off you want
something that's not going to get ruined
these buds also look fantastic and they
come in four different colors and the
package isn't bad at all
it comes with a USB charging cable six
different earbuds large medium and small
and six ear hooks large medium and small
as well and it also has an 18 month
warranty so there you guys have it if
you guys want to see more budget tech
