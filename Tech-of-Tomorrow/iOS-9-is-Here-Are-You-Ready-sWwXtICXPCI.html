again on TECA tomorrow for Apple fans
this week brings exciting news the brand
new iOS 9 hits the market this Wednesday
and for Apple fans out there this is
very big news because apples claiming
for the first time that this offers
instant advantages for everybody who
downloads at regardless of what type of
device they have now in the past
everyone knows that Apple has geared
their brand new weathers for the latest
technology and then sometimes older
stuff slows down and makes you go hey
man wow this is like not really too cool
but you've always needed it in order to
use the latest apps with iOS 9 they're
claiming this download will be
advantageous for everybody regardless of
the device apples biggest competitor
Google can only release updates their
own Nexus devices while Apple at this
time when they release iOS 9 it'll be
pretty much available through all their
devices all the way from the iphone 4
all the way up to the brand new 6 plus
so all their phones and from their iPads
you'll be able to do all the ipad 2 up
to the latest iPad pro and you'll also
be able to use any of the ipad mini
family so everything that they have is
going to be able to be downloaded and
instantly upgraded using iOS 9 with iOS
9 they'll also be a number of new
features including app thinning now app
thinning it helps free up spaces on new
devices by only downloading the
applications that are relevant to your
device so no more bloated app software
not going to get a bunch of device stuff
stored on there it's going to free it up
by only downloading exactly what you
need Apple is also shaved the size
required to install an OS on your system
due to the negative reaction at least
iOS 8 on 16 gigabyte devices now your
system can automatically delete and
temporary uninstall programs during the
install process making sure that you
have enough room to install the new OS
without problems Apple is also vying for
the attention of the casual gamer crowd
that's right Apple gaming hmm sounds
crazy to the PC people are probably
going a snicker snicker snicker but they
had said that they are going to have
definite things that are game centric
with iOS
9 apple announces there will be updates
and features including frameworks for
developing a I which is a game played
kit lighting 3d models model I oh and
replay kit which is used to record and
share gameplay there's also apples metal
AI but that one you're probably only
going to see on iOS 9 due to the fact
that it takes high power requirements to
run it so when this comes out you're
going to actually see a split in the
market because older devices aren't
going to be able to take advantage of
all these new things that Apple's doing
to do gaming but for those who are the
new devices hey looks like apples going
to try to get your money and they're
gonna try to get you to play games on
their phones now for the casual gamer
that's pretty cool because I mean think
about it there are a gazillion Apple
devices out there and if they can get
more game centric and have more games on
all of those Apple devices hmm it's a
totally good thing for Apple users and
really for gamers and all because hey
let's just face if you want to be at
somebody's house and you've got an Apple
device and you want a game and apples
doing gaming stuff you know you have to
tell your friends but you can go on over
there and play your games on an Apple
device last but not least folks the big
question is though performance will
Apple keep their promise and will iOS 9
actually game performance for all their
devices across the board because like I
said in the past Apple's new alessa's
always tend to be running great on new
devices but if you install it sometimes
on an older devices he might be feeling
like oh man my phone is too old and you
don't want to feel like that you never
want to have to download something
that's totally going to kill you now a
really big thing that's going to be bad
is that Apple is kind of said hmm you
know we're going to get rid of the SD
slot so no SD slot so 16 gigabyte phone
there's big difference between it and
the 64 gigabyte phone 64 gigabyte phone
costs another hundred additional dollars
on top of it and the actual price
between the upgrade of the RAM and
additional cost of their cut charging
you is freaking phenomenal and it's not
really worth it so that's something to
really think about I don't think it's
very fair to people out there but I
guess that's why they're saying iOS 9 is
gonna have all these space-saving
features because well you know I guess
their phone since there's no SD support
could it be kind of
get the 16 gigabyte level anyways you
guys been watching tech you tomorrow iOS
9 hits the shells this wednesday we have
hits the shelves break isn't it hit your
phone is a download or hit your device
this wednesday so be on the lookout
we'll see you guys back here when it
gets released to see if it actually to
did what it said</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
