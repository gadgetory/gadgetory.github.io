and I'm born to be rugged I'll be from
the highest mountain I'll still be
working I've got an Intel Pentium
processor and bagging word for you I am
tough enough over than a
and I can take some of yous yeah I adore
a book and I am tough enough for
you I got eight gigabytes of RAM 15 inch
Nexus 3 and I am kicking ass it's true
but it might be expensive result but
I've known the kick-ass on you
so welcome to today's unboxing of this
Prada
it's a new book and I think we're going
to just move in now hey what's up hey
you guys do not there hope you guys
liked our little funny country-western
song I seriously hope you don't
think we're trying to be serious cuz
like we're not we know it sucks you can
say it sucks
wait that said this product doesn't suck
it's a dur book and it's born to be
rugged that's right it is this thing
actually is made to be a rugged that's
what a dura books all about this is a
15-inch laptop it's gonna come to market
about $1,500 a lot of people are gonna
say holy frickin mother of god that's a
lot of money but for something like this
it's not because basically this thing
really is made to be smacked around
dropped around over on motherboards dot
org last year I took one of these things
I actually poured a whole thing of water
on it kicked it hammered it smacked it
around it still kept going so if you're
one of those people who takes your
laptop everywhere you go and the
integrity of information is important
this product is really pretty cool for
you let's talk about some specs so the
model number is the f-15c 2f HD cpu
speed says c i5 2660 with 560 m graphics
memory 8 gigabytes of ddr3 at 1333
megahertz
the HDD is an ST 500 gigabyte the
display is a 15.6
WXGA keyboard says us it features an ion
battery a super multi reader it has
windows 7 pro and that's about it
alright so basically since this is a
laptop I'm gonna do the unboxing in my
damn laptop so Rock the bat there's a
little tab right here it's gonna
this little tab right here top pops open
you guys can see inside so here we can
see what's inside the box
it's actually a couple different things
in here there's one box right here I'll
go ahead and take that out and see
what's in it in a second here I'm going
to just set that off to the side we'll
go ahead and pull the unit out itself
all right once again you guys for sound
effects as I try not to hit the
microphone cuz they really hate it when
I hit the microphone those camera guys
do for sound effects here we go send it
bags nah you guys know I love that
anyways check it out
derp buck alright so here it is this is
the derp book I'm throwing sings the
cameraman please don't call the working
abuse force you know don't be mean -
cameraman thing they might get me you
know I'm saying so here's the box get
the power cable right here
voila one powder came out this is the
other side of the power cable this is
the one that plugs into that little
brick and then plugs into the wall and
then we've got one battery a little
battery out of there there little
lithium ion battery lithium ions like a
superhero alright here's the battery all
nice and interesting wow isn't that cool
- battery all right so that's basically
stuff that came in the box a little tab
here in the back
a little plastic wraps here I think
we're in business now yes we are so
let's remove it out and get the
cameramen to zoom over here and this is
the first shot of it so here we take a
look at the front of it so exciting so
exciting don't you have that exciting
but it's exciting right in the back here
we can see the battery compartment I'll
go ahead and put the battery in now
since we got it here I'm gonna insert
the battery and unlike sex you don't
need any lubrication for this operation
you just stick it on in there I'm good
to go
simple easy breezy baby alright pop open
the top here baboom so now let's just
take a look at the laptop since we have
it out we'll just start up up here at
the top here's the thing where it closes
down there's a little pad right here so
it doesn't damage your keyboard here's
the 15 inch monitor speaker here speaker
here you guys can see the power on and
the reset button right there final
assembly in the USA pretty cool alright
we'll jump back over here begin with the
keyboard pegs a keyboard design just
like most the ones you've seen out there
kick down a little trackpad this is all
touch sensitive there's also a track up
and down button right here as well as
our other key functions right here so
now we've seen this part of the laptop
let's take a look at the side go ahead
and see what the side features are got
an external VGA right here
the powers here two USB ports got your
headphones your microphone card readers
let's flip it around take a look at the
other side it's not as take a look at
the final side we got a couple different
comport s'right here come to the USB
port and obviously we had the DVD player
right here appear there are some
additional ports right here these are
for your phone jacks in case you want to
hook up to the internet and all good
stuff you've also got a standard phone
jack here so if you've got that old
school you're still in business pop
that back on there so that's basically
it folks I mean this is a jirt book the
main focus about these things the main
thing about these laptops and the reason
they're so expensive is that they're
very very tough I went through all kinds
of crazy last time with mine I'm
not gonna do that this times I don't
want to break the laptop I actually want
to keep it and use it for a little while
but this is why it's so expensive
it's got good parts it's very durable
it's built very nicely
it's just pricey that said this is the
unboxing I'll get some performance
testing and see how this thing actually
does in real word performance and we'll
get back to you see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
