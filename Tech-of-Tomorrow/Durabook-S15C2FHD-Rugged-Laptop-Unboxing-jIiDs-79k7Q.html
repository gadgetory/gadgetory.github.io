going to come to market about fifteen
hundred dollars a lot of people are
going to say holy frickin mother of god

alright so basically since this is a
laptop I'm gonna do the unboxing in my
damn laptop so rock the bat there's a
little tab right here it's gonna
this little tab right here top pops open
you guys can see inside so here we can
see what's inside the box
actually a couple different things in
here there's one box right here I'll go
ahead and take that out and see what's
in it in a second here i'm going to set
that off the side go ahead and pull the
unit out itself all right once again you

derp book I'm thorne sings the cameramen

cameramen thing they might get me you
know I'm saying so here's the box just
the power cable right here voila one
powder cable this is the other side of
the power cable this is the one that
plugs into that little brick and then
plugs into the wall and then we've got
one battery battery out of there the
little lithium ion battery lithium iron
silicon superhero all right here's the
battery all nice and interesting wow

that's basically stuff that came in the
box will tab here in the back
couple little plastic wraps here I think
we're in business now yes we are so
let's remove it out and get the camera
men to zoom over here and this is the
first shot of it so here we take a look
at the front of it so exciting so
exciting are you not that exciting but
it's exciting right in the back here
uses the battery compartment I'll go
ahead and put the battery in now since
we got it here insert the battery unlike
sex you don't need any lubrication for
this operation you just stick it on in
there I'm good to go simple easy breezy
baby all right pop open the top here bah
boom so now let's just take a look at
the laptop since we have it out we'll
just start up appear at the top here's
the thing where it closes down there's a
little pad right here so it doesn't
damage your keyboard here's a 15 inch
monitor speaker here speaker here you
guys can see the power on and the reset
button right there final assembly in the
USA pretty cool all right we'll jump
back over here begin with the keyboard
basic keyboard design just like most the
ones you've seen out there get down a
little trackpad this is all touch
sensitive there's also a track up and
down button right here as well as your
other key functions right here so now
we've seen this part of the laptop let's
take a look at the side go ahead and see
what the side features are got an
external VGA right here the powers here
two USB ports got your headphones your
microphone card readers let's flip it
around take a look at the other side so
now let's take a look at the final side
we got a couple different calm ports
right here come to the USB port and
obviously we have the DVD player right
here appear there are some additional
ports right here these are for your
phone jacks in case you want to hook up
to the internet and all good stuff
you've also got a standard phone jack
here so if you've got that old school
 you're still in business pop that
back on there so that's basically it
folks I mean this is a juror book the
main focus about these things
the main thing about these laptops and
the reason that they're so expensive is
that they're very very tough I went
through all kinds of crazy last
time with mine I'm not going to do that
this times I want to break the laptop I
actually want to keep it and use it for
a little while but this is why it's so
expensive it's got good parts it's very
durable it's built very nicely it's just
pricey that said this is the unboxing
I'll get some performance testing and
see how this thing actually does in real
work performance and we'll get back to
you see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
