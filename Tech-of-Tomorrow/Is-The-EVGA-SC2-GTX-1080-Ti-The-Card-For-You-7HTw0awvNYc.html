once again to tech Oh tomorrow I've got
something really nice in my hands here
from the folks over at EVGA now this is
their icx sc2 version of the GTX 1080 Ti
it comes overclocked
out-of-the-box has an awesome amazing
cooling apparatus on it including a
bitchin backplate so with that said
though let's jump in let's see what
comes inside the box the features and at
the end of the day how this bad boy
performs let's go so once we open up the
box and we take a look inside you guys
can see that obviously the card comes
inside of there but you also get a
sixpence a pin power connector and you
also get the driver CD although I would
suggest going online and getting the
latest drivers unless you just don't
have access to the internet for some
reason but the cool stuff is the swag
that comes inside of the box you get a
very nice poster that'll look really
cool on your wall and you also get some
stickers so beyond that there's a little
bit of nomenclature and stuff like that
but I know my fans know how to install a
card now the card itself looks excellent
I mean just check out that beauty the
design on the front is totally artistic
it's really cool I like it 200
millimeter fans on the front of the card
you guys can see the EVGA logo on the
top and on the bottom it says GeForce
GTX 1080i and underneath all that stuff
you guys can see the cooling apparatus
giant huge aluminum heat pins all
throughout and the heat pipes underneath
that as well now this is the icx cooling
from people at EVGA they've been doing
this quite a while developing working
with it and it works pretty damn well
and take a look at the card from the
bottom you guys can once again see a lot
of those aluminum heat fins you can also
see the aluminum heat pipe taking a look
at the rear of the card you guys can see
the sc2 nomenclature there on my left
and you can also see there are five heat
pipes emanating from the rear of the
card on the top it just simply says EVGA
geforce gtx 1080i you can once again see
more of those aluminum heat fins all the
way across on the right-hand side you
see what the fans plug in then there's a
six pin and an 8 pin power connector
it's recommended that you have at least
a 600 watt power supply and the power
consumption of the card is 250 watts on
the back of the card you guys can see
their two sli fingers on the top and
once again we see a nice shroud covering
the back of the card having a protector
is something you guys
that I really like and this protector
has a lot of slots in it you guys can
see all the way throughout it and it
also has the EVGA logo of the name with
a card and all of those slots help to
dissipate heat away from the back of the
card so through all those slots you'll
see the heat radiating away from that
then being blown out for your case and
lastly we can check out the inputs
there's three display ports a single
HDMI 2.0 port and a single DVID port
alright tech lovers so there you have it
what's inside the box what the card
looks like and all that good stuff now
this card has a 1670 megahertz boost
clock which is about 10 percent slower
than the zotac in the gigabyte we looked
at but this card does run absolutely
quiet which is a very positive thing
there's no coil whine whatsoever if I
was going to like say anything to maybe
a cavity it is maybe the back plate it's
kind of made of a plastic thing maybe
metal might be in something cooler but
not really too much to complain about as
far as the card looks and all that stuff
now let's take a quick look at our test
system check out the scores the
temperatures of cards why they're
running at the end of the day why you
might just think this icx SC 2 is one
bad mother-- fracker let's go alright
folks so currently our test system is if
x99 motherboard 5960 cpu 16 gigabytes of
vengence memory really nice 850 watt
power supply we're using all the latest
herbs that we can get our hands on and
everything's patched up with Windows 10
and now mr. buddy says it's time to rock
you
I love the three other tangy TI's that
we use in the testing you guys can see
the zotac right at 80 Celsius the
Gigabyte the cool is at 69 Celsius and
the EVGA tucked right neatly in between
at 71 Celsius under full load art
everybody so there you have it
EVGA gtx 1080i icx sc2 version which you
guys can see is a very very nice-looking
card has nice scores the temperature
range is right in between all the cards
71 Celsius between the highest that we
saw in the zotac and the gigabyte which
obviously has a much bigger cooling
apparatus on it we all know that that
thing has a giant cooling apparatus now
as far as all these different cards go
any of the top level cards that you get
disa matter who makes it if it's a
strict version of it's a Oris version if
it's EVGA is icx if it's a top level
card these cards are all going to be
very very close and what they're doing
they're going to have a little bit
better boost clock of maybe 10 to 15
megahertz you know between them all
that's how it's going to be and you're
going to find with the different cooling
apparatus and maybe one of them might
run a little cooler but overall there's
no like I don't think just King of the
Ring that's just winning any card
whatsoever I mean the totally fastest
card obviously it seems like across the
board is usually you see something from
ZOTAC or something from EVGA those guys
make really SuperDuper fast cards but I
don't think that any of these cards you
purchase at this price range this cards
like you know outside 700 and like 60
bucks I think maybe a little even more
I'll have a link down below where you
guys can check that out in fact all the
link for all different cards this card
is the really nice card it's very
neutral in its color so any bill that
you're going to have to look great in it
no flag see RGB lights and all that
stuff so if you don't want to deal with
RGB and that's not your thing a this
card doesn't have it on it at the end of
the day it comes down to obviously
personal choice but if you're looking
for a card that runs very quiet looks
great in any system has very good
tempers excuse me it has very good
temperatures I mean let's just face it
hold on I mean this cards cooling
apparatus isn't really that big it's
really not very nice you know nice to
slot cards you're not going to take a
lot of inside your system so that's
something that matters to you you might
want to consider that well so I feel at
the end of the day this is a
definitely editors choice card in the
GTX 1080i world I'm Mallory you've been
watching tech of tomorrow me and buddy
say goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
