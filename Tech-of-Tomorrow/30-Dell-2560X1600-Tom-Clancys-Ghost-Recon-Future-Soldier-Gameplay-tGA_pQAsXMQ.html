here once again in the tech of tomorrow
youtube channel bring you guys something
really interesting now you guys know
that Tom Clancy has a whole bunch of his
games that have come out now the ghost
recon future soldier is the latest one
of the games that has been released it's
really cool and it actually plays nice
and it actually features directx11
support so what plays you know with
directx 11 stuff which i think is nice
because all that eye candy which we all
come to like now this game is a little
bit different than the others in the
series and the way that you control your
men before you could actually it seems
like control each man individually make
them do each different thing you want to
do by setting up different priorities
like a bunch of guys we're out there you
could have one guy going this way one
guy going that way well it's not like
that in this game it's a little bit more
easy for players just jump right in and
played what you can do is you have all
kinds of different ways to view of the
game when you go online it's going to
ask you for a name and password you're
going to log on to you play this is the
first screen that you're going to come
to now we'll show you some guys some
game footage of me actually playing the
game live and then we'll show you some
fraps and weaves that way you guys get
the best of both worlds so first off I'm
gonna go ahead and from you guys who
haven't seen the game I'll go ahead and
begin the first mission and let you guys
check some of that out live
all the nice precursor movies you get
here
put a frap this but bamidele
look at the excitement okay now don't
get confused as right here it says the
press the any key there is no any key it
actually means any p so yeah and i'm
just going to smile it okay you have a
bunch of different modes in the game as
well you have multiplayer mode you have
campaign mode you have gorilla mode now
gorilla mode something totally different
on this it's basically there's a bunch
of different guys like I think it's 50
waves of guys coming at a time so it's
almost kind of a tower defense but with
your guys that's a different way to play
I'm actually going to go ahead i'm going
to be playing in the campaign because
that's where i start out at so i'm gonna
hop back in here campaign it's asked me
to create a new campaign or autosave i
will go ahead and create a new campaign
just so you folks can see what it looks
like in the beginning so we'll start the
new campaign will play it as a veteran
and we shall go one of the important
things this game as well is this little
F key because you're going to have these
things that you throw out that actually
can see a bunch of guy it's a detector
it's really interesting so right now
we're in Nicaragua
in game pretty much start telling you
you're in a car actually it kind of
reminds me of the most pretty much of
like Iron Man you know the game starts
out and all sudden kaboom but we're
going to be getting kaboom here in just
a second too once we get kaboom we'll go
actually into the game come on well I
guess my kaboom had a powerful thing I
think booming the monitor actually shut
off I better quiet Micah blooms
put some birds out there I know this is
the most exciting of things but hey
there you go boom and there's our higher
Matt moment now this is the thing I was
Sunday before you can press the Q button
on here and select all of your targets
and you hold the cue button down and it
will kill all of the targets you mark
them and shoot them
that was in the actual example but this
is beginning of the game I thought a lot
of folks might want to see the beginning
of the game the graphics are pretty
decent I have no complaints about these
graphics whatsoever standard WASD keys
to move
now this button right here you can see
the different targets so I'm just
shooting those areas I can turn that off
get back into the normal game you're
going to site just like any other game
slept telling you kind of like
battlefield 3 you go out of the range it
starts telling you hey you're out of the
range then you shall be dead so that
folks pretty much is how the game begins
we're gonna go in here real quick and
shit's gonna hit the fan real quick kind
of a bomb let's little bomb here kaboom
we don't even need special effects for
this shit it's gonna blow up all its own
and so pretty much in you know of the
first mission we all die we all get our
asses kicked and then it's all about
revenge
and so it ends that's basically mission
1 pretty much this game says there are
no rules when you're ghosts your apt to
kill your have to totally do whatever it
takes to kill as you play further in the
game we're going to show you something
about that you actually become
completely invisible with the armor that
they give you it's not actually armor
it's kind of like a defensive measure
because you're totally just basically
you know invisible what to check that
out now before we move further to the
game we actually show the level that I
was playing let me show you how I have
everything set up here all the graphics
options the most important thing that
everybody is going to ask I have
everything set to as high as it can be
in this game including directx11
tessellation global illumination improve
physics motion blur parallax mapping
ambient occlusion volumetric light
shadow the detail anti-aliasing and I
even lock down vsync why I know it locks
the graphics down I could probably show
some higher frame rates but I'm not
doing a video card review I'm just
showing you guys the game so I want to
look as best as possible let's go back
and let's actually jump into the game
now and let's see where I was actually
playing before camos up
that's cute targets
ready
target 3
barking number four do it on you two
marked watch lead repositioning
is history
hi we don't want to get separated out
here here it comes
the series pretty much hot spot now
previously we showed you the preps
movies that was the level preceding this
has some guys in a truck moving in now
let's show you guys know some about Q
I've set that guy
another guy
so a grenade out there to kill somebody
tell you that here's a grenade
Kate when I talked about a sensor
grenade I'm not throw us into grenade
out now
also to move in space to space just hold
down the shift button it will allow you
to go in-between spaces this is probably
going to be a really long video but we
just want to show you guys a couple of
things on here the game plays really
well the graphs are pretty decent and
it's actually so far in the campaign
been a pretty fun storyline the water
running new gun and a lot of cool stuff
swing everybody i've had this game for
basically about two days now i just
started getting into playing it so far I
like what I've seen it's got some pretty
cool game features the physics of the
game the way you're playing and shooting
everybody seems to be nice and fluid it
seems to me that the game is also geared
for people that are either totally like
a beginner games or you can set the
levels to extremely stream late hearts
that way if you're a beginner player you
just sit our knees you can go through
scroll around it's a recruit you can set
it as a veteran go through if you know
more than sit on the extreme you know if
you really think you're a badass in the
gaming I like that the game plays with
the directx 11 I'm glad it's not just a
total utter just total port because they
poured a game over usually it's only
directx nine at least they've taken some
time to put directx11 into this game so
for my first looks I gotta say the games
fun it's got some unique stuff it plays
well and it's about the same price all
the other games out there so my first
look so I got to say hey Tom Clancy's
new ghost recon future soldier overall
it's getting a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
