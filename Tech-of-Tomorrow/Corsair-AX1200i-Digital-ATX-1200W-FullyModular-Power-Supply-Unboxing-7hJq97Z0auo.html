the ticket amaro Channel I'm not refers
to your host today we're going to the
unboxing and features review of the new
Corsair a X 1200 I that's right this is
a 1200 watt power supply for the people
over at Corsair that features lots of
new cool stuff including all digital
power super high-end components and it's
completely totally modular and features
its new course their link technology so
that any further ado let's jump in and
let's see what this new product from
Corsair is all about
right folks so here we can see we have
the Corsair this is the Professional
Series Platinum Edition which means it's
80 plus platinum the best you can
actually get got the power supply right
here
the nomenclature here are some of the
features down here digitally controlled
power quiet efficient operation fully
modular I'll flip it around put just let
you guys see the back of the box there's
not really too much to the back of the
box seven-year warranty always good if
the camera wants to jot down and focus
in on this real quick this is the
nomenclature if you want to buy this
online you can find this power supply
for about three hundred and forty
dollars over on new egg a little high on
other places right now right now that's
the cheapest you can get it I believe
I'm going to flip the box back around
and we're going to put the top and it's
going to be a little bit more so right
up here these are some of the different
cables your 24 pin - 8 pin 6 6 + 2 16
SATA 12 peripheral or molex and floppy
now talk about brilliant design and to
be honest ii folks I do my glass
treating this stuff it's really small
but it basically just talks about this
fully modular power supply makes it easy
to install and you guys all know that
for you folks out there who like fully
modular and really like that the digital
controls are something totally new about
this all high quality components but
let's actually look at it now so maybe
go to the side of the box
oops I'm going to need a I'm going to
need enough all right well I cannot find
a knife anywhere so I'm going to see if
I can do it with a musical pick
get it there all right then I think I
can get this off now the little finger
scrape here instead of using the usual
tactics of my knifes inside this room I
didn't have any knives in and the
camerman he was too scared to go get a
knife afraid I'd throw it at him so I'm
just forced to you know go with the
program
so inside we can see it's nice and red
okay Christmas present whoo Merry
Christmas Merry Christmas and to all a
good night
there put the Box not the other side has
that new car smell so check it out got
another seal right here in the box so
have the camera zoom in on there let me
set it down actually you can see it
better so there's the seal right here so
before I even do the unboxing I have to
break another seal so multiple seals
that's pretty much it so I'll go ahead
and break the seal I'll grab a pin from
over here I think this time to break the
seal it one little run through like that
I'm not really working the best see now
the first time I go I do my boxing about
a knife I need a knife but oh there's a
computer party there we go yeah see a
USB charger works also as a cutting tool
if used properly remember kids don't try
this at home I am a doctor so just pull
the end right here cap the box open lots
of good stuff in here
start off with a cable this is a very
very well made cable very thick
construction no cheap design here this
is made for high wattage applications a
little bit different than your standard
set it off the side something in a
silver bag hmm - this is the guest bag
folks all right you guys guess what's
inside no I'm just kidding I'll open it
up here even though once again I don't
have a knife idea I keep running this
problem
my teeth seem to be working so I'm going
to go ahead and just rip the strip here
ah okay
Corsair link this is the digital link to
the computer this is one of the main
features
Kameron to zoom it in that real quickly
connection right here here's the
warranty guide this more paperwork the
professional series digital ATX power
supply this is the manual it's an
English French Dutch Italian Spanish and
hey I'm not even gonna touch them
because I'll say it wrong and sometimes
correct me it's an it and one of those
possibly Russian but hey I don't want
you killed so a bunch of different stuff
in here talked about the power supply
still once again we see all the
different breakdowns of all the
different cables that are included in
this here we see the power supply
efficiency you can see it has a very low
drop off curve which is why it's rated
as a platinum now in addition right here
it shows the corsair link the USB dongle
it also says is a corsair digital
interface cable I didn't see that but
that's probably in there somewhere as
well as we get to it but I'm not going
to go all the way through the manual but
you guys can see it's a very detailed
manual you're going to be all the cables
these are mounting equipment right here
screws zip ties there's even ah we got
the corsair little case badge in there
now this is what everybody is really
going to want to see the cables and this
I know folks I try to give you guys a
throw is unboxing as possible
now this thing comes in a nice bag just
like you're buying a bottle of brandy
but no it's of course their powers apply
do not drink and drive
I mean well you know I mean let's pull
that out of there okay so the Box still
in the background I blame them on the
camera man let's go ahead and just take
this out of the plastic sheeting here
let's just start off let's start off by
a side view the ax 1200 I very clearly
nice mesh design on/off button you guys
obviously know it's where the power goes
set it down here's the backside Cameron
can zoom in there so you guys can see
all that a little closer and I'll flip
around so you guys can see the side one
more side loop one more side here we see
the back with the fan is that
all right and so now let's take a look
right here which really is the most
important part here's the comport so I
believe this comport let me take a look
here see if it matches this that doesn't
match that hope there's a comport right
here I thought it would have actually
been for this particular cable maybe
it's for a different cable I'm trying to
see this where this other cable is maybe
we haven't got that far yet
here's a self-test button most power
supplies do not have this at all this is
something I've never seen on any other
power supplies so totally thumbs up to
these guys completely modular all the
way around so you guys out there who are
totally fetish freaks about that this
should totally please you you can have a
little fapping time here over this so
I'll go ahead and get this out of the
way and then we'll take a look at the
cables we've already explained you know
Western wise it was 16 of this 16 of
that so your ATX power eight pin try
break him into little batches we can see
these things here folks on the photos
for you a little better here a lot of
stuff in this unboxing so I'm going to
try to get a little more better
separator for you folks we can see it
better let's see here
alright so check it out folks here are
all the connections you've got enough
for Quad SLI triple SLI anything you
want remember before we said there was
six of one and two of the other so a
total of eight connections so we have
two four six eight of those here we see
all the SATA then we have up sorry
here's one more SATA so there were a
total of four SATA connections with four
connections each that was 16 total there
sorry about that folks here goes all the
molex to have plenty of molex
connections all the way around
finally earlier remember I showed you
guys the corsair link the digital link
nice today's probably low comp or plug
well I finally found that plug the plug
is right here so that plug goes into
there you can hear buddy walking around
now and this thing is going to go and
this will sit it has a connection right
here and this is your connection so this
is your digital connection if you guys
can totally see that I'm trying to get
it all plugged in here and get into the
camera range let me try to get it all
plugged in here so there we go that's
plugged in so here you go
exactly how this works - I'll tell you
when we put it in the system because
we're definitely going to be building an
awesome system with this power supply so
I have no fear thanks to Rick over at
Corsair providing this stuff we'll get
you a full written review and a case
build and everything else with this in
the future but thanks for watching the
unboxing and first features look of the
new ax 1200 i from the people at Corsair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
