once again AM 2014 with Dan from Gibson
you guys all know Gibson in 2014 they
came out with some new models and we're
gonna show those to you right now some
how's it going down let's go great you
know we're packed packed like sardines
yeah you know we've completely revamped
our 2014 USA division lineup we got some
Houston from Memphis Montana custom
Epiphone and really showcasing our new
2014 USA lineup which is right behind us
a lot of them behind us too yeah so
let's talk a little bit about this
attitude you have in your hand right now
this is one of our new products is the
SG Futura it's a you know new guitar we
came out with this year it's you know
typical SG body shape it's got a couple
new features we have a new Sidewinder
p90 which is got a humbucker on its side
gives you a nice p90 sound but you know
it's also noiseless and you can tap the
coil as well so you know Wow cut down
the output a little bit it's not
catching
all right and we also included an active
15 DB boost so you just click it you get
a boost up instantly yep sets it at 15
decibels battery pack is in the back
right here does that work like really
good for like when you're going to play
your lead you click at Malton you get a
boost without a pedal and then what's
the e to using this thing automatically
tune aside it's a new standard feature
and a lot of our USA products this year
we've got the mini tune yeah we we
debuted it last year as an option and it
comes standard now a couple of our new
USA pieces so how many different types
of tuning can you actually get on it we
have 12 individual factory presets and
you can make sixty-year-old
so we have six user programmable presets
which are great haha yeah it's it's
super efficient to you know we're here
just turn it on you strum all the
strings at once
and the tuners move on themselves it
just takes a couple seconds to tune up
once they turn along green unit shuts
off and you're ready to go Wow and so
how much is this guitar sewn for like if
I went to a Guitar Center or Sam mash or
someplace right there these Street out
about a ten forty nine with a hardshell
case and we also have a Les Paul variant
called the Les Paul future Les Paul I'm
sure shocking yeah those go for 11:49
yeah we got a couple new finishes I see
a lot of the finishes back here are
really nice like an Infernus green fade
it gets a little dark around the edges
we have a blue and a red which are start
translucent so on the Les Paul's you get
a double a flame maple top on that
awesome almost show us some more all
right guys now we're gonna take a look
at something called the Les Paul piece
now what's up with this one man it's
kind of a throwback to the 60s with a
new technology 60s neck yep
60 slim tapered neck also does mini tune
in the featured standard it's pretty
cool you know it says mini tuned on our
truss rod cover severn question hey you
know what it is right we have a retro
vibe here with a tie-dye
toggle switch oh yeah we got our new 63
humbuckers which are how they how they
compare like a 57 or a verse bucker
they're little a little bit hotter than
a 57 little brighter Oh but you
know it's kind of nice for pretty
Trembley and right in between there yeah
and you know we put these in a couple
other guitars too and our lpj which is
one of our most affordable Les Paul's so
you know if you want to get rid of some
of the frills you know we also have it
as an option
it's basically a budget for me and the
cool and the cool piece knobs there we
go
we also machined the piece oh wow speech
sight and tail studs and just piece on
here
it comes in a hemp case with a tie-dye
interior so it's really interesting I
really like floral like the table knows
it's considered this considered sunburst
this is different kind of harmonious
sunset I believe is the name of the
harmonious yeah yeah they're all kind of
a 60s groovy kind of theme you know we
have mill amount green right there I'm
digging it tranquility blue a lot of
different colors that's all around the
wall now how many different models
altogether are there of the e tune ones
well we offer it in the LP m the SG m
the future is both SG and Les Paul we
also do a small signature the Les Paul
piece and the our base of the Les Paul
Standard which is as well and then the
SG standard also has many tune - these
are all looking so well like she just
owned them all we all green new colors
this year that's really beautiful I like
that it's been a knockout you guys had
this color though but a few years back
but it was on the custom only yeah we we
decided to kind of diversify a lot of
our bursts and a lot of the blues and
greens and stuff this year give people
those or more options now is this
considered triple-a or quadruple a okay
we actually changed it up a little bit
so on the lesson of regular Les Paul
Standard Mini tune we upgraded the top
for a street increase of a hundred bucks
so you went from double-a to triple-a
and then on
this one right here yep we went from
triple-a to aquatic and then we have the
premium which went from either a double
a quilt or a quad a flame yeah this is
what this is this what he bought me for
Christmas it's now a triple a quilt
which is beautiful and on the premium
whoever book-matched the top in our
factory sign the back plate awesome very
cool I liked it when they had the preman
had the clear back plates you can see
through it now our 2008 standards it was
so basically you guys are looking at
having like a really great year this
year with stuff yeah I think it's gonna
be a huge success
you know we've shown a lot of guitars at
CES and it was really I went over really
well everybody seemed to be really
excited yeah but the only thing is the
CES you guys were charging with people
to get in and to put the big ten outside
if there was a charge to get in or the
car with dr. Brown's Carly charge
anybody really know I think they were
charging at the door for that I saw the
booth I want to go see it I saw Doc
Brown's car and everything I was like it
would have been nice I can tell people
were charging it's okay five bucks to
get some beer money for the Gibson guys
right so is there more all right well
let's keep going and see more all right
guys so now we're gonna take a look at a
guitar that Gibson considers their creme
de la creme of the guitars and man he's
gonna tell us more about this and you
guys can see it's beautiful yeah this is
our new 2014 supreme you know for
anybody remembers the Les Paul supreme
from you know the past few years we've
really got to change it up a little bit
suit-and-tie guitars yeah this is a gold
hardware all the way around this is for
when you've reached baller status right
so you know obviously the biggest thing
is you know it's a semi hollow guitar
now we
found f-holes here you know to
quantitate top triple-eight back you
know double bound 5 flight you know
custom style binding you have a 498 t in
the bridge and we also have this
floating Johnny Smith style mini
humbucker did you guys design this
pickup yourself yeah yeah I mean all of
our pickups the views are you know 1%
in-house with the exception of obviously
you know some artist models that might
have Seymour Duncan's or you know we
have to bill Kelleher last year the
Headley sensors exactly so you know if
an artist wants something else but so I
think our pickups are pretty good as
they are
this guitar like what's the starting
price on one of these things these are
like in the 49 range yeah these street
have about 48 99 so if you got 5,000
bucks and you want something totally
bitchin like you said well you can have
this guitar that means you're a baller
so I guess I'm not a baller because I
only own you know
yeah it's less Paul customs yeah this is
one of the few guitars to that has ebony
you know heaven he's getting harder and
harder to get and we're putting on our
some you know some of our hires here
Bellini and ivory yeah exactly so how
many different colors is this particular
model come in the only ones I've seen it
in because we you know we just released
it are the Heron cherry sunburst we also
have a seafoam green over here
which looks really good we're going to
see some seafoam green here folks hold
on what's cool is the seafoam has a
natural side oh that is just that is
really nice check that out folks
incredible finish really nice gold-tone
hardware cuts make it look so elegant I
think this is a really beautiful guitar
me personally if I was going to choose
between the previous one this one this
one would be on my shelf any day of the
week I just think it's absolutely
beautiful dan yeah it's a great way to
to get into our 120th anniversary is so
awesome what's this one right here that
has three pickups in it this is another
super Krete similar body the only
difference is the obviously it's a
chamber guitar we have three humbuckers
sides as opposed to the you know the
single and yeah this is a new basically
new SKU I've never seen one with three
pickups before it's the first time I've
seen this also supreme though isn't it
yes this is yeah this will be a little
bit more affordable it's gonna have a
rich light fingerboard which is what
we've been using in place of you know I
beneath because again I've been getting
harder and harder if you get Kampai
yeah and you guys also didn't you guys
do something with the nut too were you
guys making that now it's supposed to be
like really semi just a bone we're using
graphite right now or a graphtec rather
the company graphtec you know and they
they're basically a self lubricating nut
so that's my lubricating that they've
navigated I love that mitigates a lot of
the you know the problems were getting
hung up on the
it works out really well and helps the
guitar stay in doing a lot better you
know the quality of the stuff we're
putting out now is it just gets better
and better every year
have you guys ever thought about like
working with like ever tune a company
that makes like the evertune bridge to
like the guitar when you ever - never
after tune your guitar give you ever
heard of that product I have it if you
get a chance you check it out every -
makes a product where once you install
it you never have to tune the guitar
over again it's pretty incredible
they're working with a lot of companies
and be great to see the money Gibson
guitar there on my Gibson guitars
alright folks so now we have something
that's really beautiful is their new j15
guitar this thing's supposed to sound
and look incredible and is it so tell us
more about this new guitar not Hanneman
Montana right okay this is great you
know it's the most affordable Montana
piece we've really ever put out and the
great thing is that this is all 100%
North American tone woods their use
you've got a wall nut back inside which
looks great yeah it's nice a little
around Sitka spruce and the eastern
maple neck three-piece with a walnut
stripe to go down the center and what's
like the entry price on these ones
coming out down these go for $14.99 and
you know generally it's kind of hard to
get a high quality for under $2,000 but
the past couple years we've released
some more affordable models that don't
really skip out on features either this
has an LR bags element you know like
electric pickup in it so you could plug
it right in great for a gig and 1500
bucks I don't think there's a better
guitar out there on the market that
really you know even comes close to this
right on that's going to be great
because the coots observed are just the
easiest man yeah anywhere you want to
you know anywhere you want and with that
research into like Americana
you know folk and you know kind of roots
music you know coup stick music is
getting much much much bigger coming
back again absolutely so right on
alright well Dan thank you so much for
your time we appreciate doing it let's
check folks we'll see you guys for more
