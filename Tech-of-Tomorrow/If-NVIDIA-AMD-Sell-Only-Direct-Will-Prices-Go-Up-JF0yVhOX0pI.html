back here once again the channel now in
my last video I talked to you guys about
how I feel that AMD Nvidia are just
really not making enough video cards to
saturate the market and in fact they're
doing the quite opposite they've ramped
down manufacturing so that there's this
giant vacuum in the industry now another
thing that's also happening is we're
hearing all kinds of rumors about these
companies starting to sell the cards
directly to you okay sounds kind of good
right and all honesty if it could work
it could be a good thing but here's the
whole thing if these companies right now
are creating this vacuum in the industry
of cards what's gonna stop them from
charging you those high prices
themselves on Direct Marketing and also
look at this another way all of your
favorite companies that you've dealt
with in the past would be gone so if
you're a sapphire fan guess what
sapphire won't be selling you a card if
your next effects fan guess what XFX
won't be selling you a card hey Zeus
gigabyte MSI if Nvidia and AMD start
selling directly all of these companies
that have been board partners for all
these years will be completely utterly
screwed over now how that will affect
their overall margin I think it's gonna
be quite a big thing we all know that
motherboards they're all kind of the
same the performance level on them is
not that much difference the main
difference in motherboards is just
features companies really don't make a
whole lot of money off of motherboards
there's more money to actually be made
in the VGA market so if all these board
companies all of a sudden can't make VGA
products how will that honestly affect
these companies in an overall sense you
know I'm saying because all of a sudden
let's just say a Zeus makes 50% of their
profit even 40% of their profit and this
is all done off of video card sales
right all of a sudden you cut their
video card sales out how is that going
to affect the market I'll tell you how
first of all you're gonna see prices on
all of the other components start to
rise up that's just the natural order of
things I've lived a long time and in the
70s you had to wait in a line just to
get gas seriously
so things can get really bad really
quick and if these companies cannot make
their money off the BJ cards that
they're making all the prices other
components are going to go up which
means that the entire PC market which
was once a fun affordable thing will
become something that is almost
unaffordable but for all who have a lot
of money the entry-level gamer the guy
who likes to play games everybody's
going to be reduced to playing on a
console now I had a video before where I
talked about you know console I'm kind
of like a PC and since we're talking
with that I want to clarify I never
really meant to make it exactly the same
thing as a PC the PC environment is that
completely what they call open
environment where you can change every
single solitary part inside of a PC to
get what you want
now with the thing that I was talking
about it wouldn't be like that you would
have a static board in there that you
could use for a few generations a GPU
would no longer be a GPU inline GP it
would be something that you actually
plugged in it would be more like I said
a mixture of firmware and hardware it's
not exactly like a PC it's not like a
steam machine it's not like that a steam
machine wasn't really upgradable you
can't do that stuff what I'm looking for
is a consult that's kind of a hybrid
it's a mixture between a PC and a
console so that you kind of get the best
of both worlds
like I said consoles are selling a lot
more and a lot of people said Oh prices
haven't gone up in the bay yet prices
have gone up on consoles here in the USA
I don't know about other place in the
world but here in the US a console
prices have gone up from Christmas till
now there are at least $100 more so
already you can see how the PC industry
is affecting actual other industries
it's like a tidal wave you know when
those tidal wave you know rolls into
town you know it hits everything around
it the building's the cars the people
and that's kind of how this same stuff
is having in the industry this video
card shortage is creating a tidal wave a
tidal wave which may at the end of the
day end up costing you and me and all of
us around the world so much more money
than we were ever even expecting so if
AMD and NVIDIA if they honestly cut out
all the board partners do you think
that's a good thing
has the opportunity to be a good thing
but here's the here honestly is the crux
of the whole thing why are they doing
this all of a sudden why all of a sudden
are they trying to make it where they
cut out the middleman I'll tell you why
and Vidya admitted it already before
they're not happy with their cards being
sold at these higher prices through new
way and all these other people now does
that mean though that they're so upset
that they're willing to sell you these
cards at the normal price or does that
just mean that they're pissed off that
they're not making that extra profit and
that's where the whole crux of this
entire thing balances out if these guys
start selling cards directly will we
actually see lower pricing or we just
see AMD and NVIDIA begin the gouging
themselves and that's what I'm really
worried about because that that happens
all of our PC dreams everything you want
to do is just going to go up in price
and become SuperDuper affordable I mean
super duper unaffordable for everything
that's you're buying I want to know what
you guys have to think do you guys agree
with me do you think that it's a real
possibility that AMD and NVIDIA if they
start selling directly to you that
they're gonna just start charging with
all that money themselves so that they
can make the profit or are they really
gonna do the right thing and just sell
these cards to you at the lower price
I'm gonna say this man human beings are
greedy it's not always a bad thing but
we all have greed I'm greedy you're
greedy Jesus is greedy my mom's greedy
we all have a part of greed and part of
being greedy is you know that we want to
live our lives so we go to work we do
stuff that's all a minor part of greed
but when greed dominates and
corporations you guys all know are known
for one thing and one thing only and
what is that making fricking money
that's what they're in business for
they're not there to give you a job
they're not there to make you happy
they're not there to hold your hand
they're not there to provide you any
kind of decent thing unless guess what
you pay for it so my feeling is this if
these companies start selling direct all
we're going to be doing is switching one
evil for another evil so instead of
getting gouged by Newegg Amazon and all
these other sellers around the world
guess what we'll just get screwed
directly by AMD and NVIDIA Wow
