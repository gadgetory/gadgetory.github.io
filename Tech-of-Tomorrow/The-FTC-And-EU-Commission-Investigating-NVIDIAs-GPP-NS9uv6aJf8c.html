so I know by now that pretty much
everybody out there has heard about the
GeForce Partner Program and the weird
thing surrounding and there's been some
brand-new news that just hit the streets
today but Before we jump into that let's
check out a word from today's sponsor
Corsair the dark core RGB se Gaming
Mouse is where wire performance goes
Wireless with an ultra-fast low latency
wireless Bluetooth connection you know
you're getting the same performance as
you would with a wired mouse but if you
still prefer that wire the dark core RGB
se comes wired as well the dark core RGB
se also features key wireless charging
so you can charge the mouse on any
compatible charging pad or with the
Corsair mm 1000 mouse pad for top
performance and with the 1600 dpi
optical sensor the ultra accurate
high-speed tracking engine can be custom
tuned to virtually any type of mousepad
and for custom comfort the dark core RGB
se comes with two interchangeable side
grits to fit your playing style and oh
yeah the dark core also comes with
customisable three zone backlighting so
if you're an RGB fan they've got you
covered the dark core RGB se also comes
with high performance
Omron switches which are rated for 50
million clicks that's right 50 million
clicks so you won't have to worry about
your mouse cutting out on you anytime
soon and last but not least using the Q
software you can fully program any of
the nine buttons for total control and
customization so if you're looking for a
mouse that can handle the best of both
worlds both wired and wireless check out
the dark or RGB se from Corsair alright
so that's a pretty cool Mouse by the
people over at Corsair in fact I'm
actually using that Mouse in my living
room and my complete Wireless situation
and it's working great so for some of
you out there if you haven't heard of
the geforce partner program what what it
is is the geforce partner program is
kind of like a contract that nvidia is
trying to get companies assigned where
they pretty much either only make nvidia
cards or the only cards that say gaming
on them are nvidia cards now this is
kind of a really strange thing and it's
caused a lot of commotion and now it
seems like the EU come
and the FTC are both possibly going to
be looking into Nvidia for doing really
uncompetitive business things for one
thing everybody knows that AMD and you
know they're the biggest competition
against Nvidia so pretty much I mean the
only people that really probably have a
severe problem with this or AMD fans and
AMD but still it's really not a very
cool thing to do whatsoever I mean if
you're like me you like having a lot of
options I mean EVGA a seuss gigabyte all
these companies usually have their own
different brands of cars now obviously
some companies only make nvidia cards
now these companies who only make nvidia
cards this probably wouldn't affect them
whatsoever because let's just face it if
you're only making Nvidia cards who
cares about the GeForce partner program
because you're already pretty much in
the g4s Partner Program right but for
companies like a Zeus MSI gigabyte and
these other companies they make all
kinds of different cards you know I'm
saying they have their own versions of
cards with their own cooling there's
like Strix everybody's got their own
different version of the card and if the
GP P program went through you probably
would never see any of these cards
anymore whatsoever the only cards that
you would see would be cards by Nvidia
that would actually say gaming on them
or even really be you know recommended
for gaming and that honestly is kind of
a really bad thing I mean I've used
Nvidia cards for years I've used AMD
cards for years but at the end of the
day what really matters to me most is
having a choice having a choice in life
is probably one of the biggest freedoms
that you'll ever be able to have you
don't even really realize this being
able to choose what you want to eat what
you want to wear what you drive who you
hang out with just having freedom of
choice is very important and if the
nvidia geforce partner program goes
through from what it's looking like is
you would probably never see any of
those cards ever again you might see an
AMD card yeah but it's not gonna say
gaming it's not going to be Strix it's
not going to be probably any high-end
stuff because obviously all the
attention is going to be going over to
the nvidia cards and that's the part
that i don't like about it whatsoever
now if the geforce partner program was
more like
on the lines of this say like if you
join the g-force partner program you got
a better deal on buying all your PCBs
and buying into all that stuff that
would be a really cool thing because hey
let's just face it if I was MSI gigabyte
a Zeus or any of these companies out
there if I can actually get all my PC
boards and all that stuff for cheaper by
being part of the GeForce Partner
Program you know damn well that me
personally I'd be on it and so would all
these other companies but when you come
in and you literally try to totally
clock a block I'll use that word you try
to totally clock block other companies
from saying that there are gaming cars
that's really bad business now I'm gonna
contact my friends over an Nvidia and
ask if they want to do an interview here
on Tech and Ammar about this subject I
don't know if they will or not they
might be very touchy and think I'm just
being an asshole trying to do that but
that's really not my intent I haven't
heard from either of my friends from in
video which is Brian and Brian they've
been buddies of mine like I said for
years but I am gonna contact them now
and ask for them to give me a direct
quote or a direct statement regarding
this program because what it's looking
right now it really just looks like a
move to cut AMD off from being able to
say hey they make a gaming card and I
love you guys Nvidia but come on AMD
makes gaming cards as well
they just do they make cards everybody
buys for mining AMD is literally your
biggest competition so in that respect
sure I mean I can see as a desperate
business move somebody's trying to you
know implement a program that cut all
these companies off from making a video
card or at least making a video card
that says gaming or has all the great
cooling and great features that you guys
all like about aftermarket video cards I
mean I don't know what you guys think
I'm not sure of all the exact facts
surrounding this but the very fact that
I read in the news this morning that
they might possibly be getting looked
into by the EU and the FTC that's kind
of a giant red flag for them even to be
considering to look into these guys
throw huge red flags up saying hey whoa
what the heck is going on here because
if you get caught doing you know things
that are uncompetitive in the business
world you will get slapped down and
you'll get slapped down hard you'll
probably get a bunch of fees who knows
what else can
but the very fact that these companies
are thinking about looking into Nvidia
it really speaks volumes at least though
I feel that it does otherwise if it was
something that was totally cool and
totally a JIT why would these companies
even want to look into it whatsoever
they be like this means nothing you know
what I mean honestly so if these
companies excuse me if the FTC and the
EU commissioner even looking at Nvidia
to look into this kinda makes me go whoo
wow this might be something really
serious and like I said right now it's
just a rumor that they might possibly
getting looked into there's been no
facts based out there there's been
nothing that says Oh officially they're
being looked into but rumors have it
that they're going to be and if they do
get investigated for this it will be a
heavy slap on the hand and in the face -
Nvidia now I know you guys are fans of
getting the cheapest cards that you can
get your hands on for gaming that's
always been the number one thing for a
gamer but what do you guys feel and how
do you feel about the NVIDIA GeForce
Partner Program if it really is doing
the things that are being claimed if
they're trying to lock down all the
manufacturers to only make cards that
say gaming and use the great features on
Nvidia cards that really is a messed up
move I don't agree with that whatsoever
I don't think that you guys do at all so
please
I want to see what you guys have to say
down below please leave your comments
let me know what you guys think do you
guys think this is just all rumor do you
think it's gonna blow by or do you think
that and video will actually end up
being investigated and this thing is
gonna blow up like a giant nuclear bomb
in their face like usual down below
we'll have links to you guys want to see
more information on this news that's
just come out and only time will tell if
this happens but if it does it's going
to be a very very big deal thank you
guys for watching got more videos more
giveaways more stuff coming up so we'll
see you here back on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
