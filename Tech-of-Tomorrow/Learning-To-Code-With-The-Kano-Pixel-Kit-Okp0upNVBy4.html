again to TECA tomorrow now right off the
bat I want to say that today's video was
sponsored by Aquino we're going to be
taking a look at the pixel kit which is
something very interesting
now the pixel kit is a light board that
features 128 LEDs that's very easy to
put together and code with it's not only
fun it's totally educational and you can
learn how to code simply by downloading
the Kano app so with that said let's
jump in let's check out the unboxing and
see why you guys are going to think this
thing is not only fun it's totally a
learning tool as well so first off folks
obviously here's the Box in front of the
box the back of the box for all those
people who care about that stuff but I'm
going to ahead and pop the cap here and
inside right off the bat you guys are
going to see this little thing it says
let's go now inside of this that's where
all the information that you're going to
need to set this thing up and get going
so I'll go ahead and just open the other
flap right here this isn't a little flap
right here I'll spin that back around
for you guys to see so you guys can see
that better and you guys can see all the
parts and everything are right here in
the box so nothing's like going oh my
god what do I need to do well there
actually is one requirement that is
required to use the Kano product and
that is that you do need to have the
ability to read whoever's putting it
together so after that point you can
probably plan the computer forever but
to put it together
you need to read so take a look here
this little book right here is I'm
looking at this is about making make a
light board so this is obviously one of
the things that's telling you what to do
get there and then now let me visit some
nice stickers oh yeah so you know kids
love stickers we all know that and even
a lot of people even adults like
stickers on their guitar cases on their
stuff so your person who like stickers
paint knows got you covered okay what
else we got in here looks like even more
stickers okay so there is a mass variety
of stickers in here
just a lot of stickers so he likes
stickies hey I got you covered anything
else in there nope it is empty okay so
so it says hi I'm judoka your pixel pal
and I'm going to help you build and code
your own whiteboard ready let's go so
that's the first step so the first thing
we're going to see is here is the pixel
brain that's this particular part right
here this is the parts are telling me to
get out and have in my little hot hands
and you guys concedes that there's a
three USB ports along the side here a
little turning control knob right here
and then an additional button over here
which is probably most likely the power
button I don't know that for sure yet
but I'm just kind of guessing that's
what it is
so next up is the case so this is your
case whoops sliding around guess I set
it off to the side for a second here is
your case a little different than your
standard PC case really really small
then we've got additional USB cable
right here this is obviously what's
going to plug into your computer because
you plug one end into the pixel kit and
the other into your computer so we've
got a mode dial that's this particular
piece right here the mode dial in
joystick and buttons okay
joystick and buttons I see these buttons
right here these little tiny red things
right there make sure you guys can see
them on camera everything little red
buttons I'll set these all out here okay
we have the battery kind of looks like
exactly the same as you see like almost
like a standard phone battery so here's
your battery I'd imagine I can probably
put that in here now just popped right
into place pretty much just like your
phone like I said this is a filter I
guess a little light filter to fuse your
light so it looks okay then we've got
the tilt sensor now what the tilt sensor
does is this actually when you have it
put together yo guys will see you can
play games with this you know like
playing a little handheld game or with
the lights you can do fancy things of
your life and the lights will move
according to how you move it so it's
like a strap to hold together I'm just
looking here and see if there's anything
else additionally in here I don't think
so I think that's pretty much it as far
as the parts go well it does say there's
a K no code app but I guess since that's
just telling you to download the app
online so obviously you have to download
the app to be doing it through your
computer ok so finally get to the actual
instructions pick up the brain turn it
over
alright I've turned it over this is its
computer and I figured that go through
here look through this thing done
Siddhanta oh what's also cool is that
through a microphone you can actually
talk to the lightboard computer using
the k no code app as well so that's kind
of cool
didn't really know it did that so the
two red little buttons they go over here
on this side very easy to do they just
simply pop right on there it's not magic
the last piece you're going to put in
the circuit board before you put it in
the case is the dial it has little knots
right here so once you match the notch
on it slides right on and then you just
simply put it inside the case set it
down nice and gently
there's a thing on the bottom of the
case that actually locks it in place so
that way doesn't fall off anymore and
then you just finish the final assembly
actually a lot easier that I'm making it
look like I just like I said folks I
shake a lot to my nerve damage but there
we go and then after you have it boot
just simply hit the power button and
then once all the lights are on you
simply lastly plug in the tilt sensor
and you are ready to go and if you want
to show off all the things you've done
your pixel kit on the bottom there's
even a mount where you can put it on a
tripod now the scrolling up on the side
you guys can see there are numbers 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 these are your programmable profiles
and once you get this set and you do
stuff that you're going we're going to
show you later on you can actually
program three of your own things in here
and bring those up at any time between
the two now on the front we have a
joystick this controls your up and down
left and right and then we have your a B
buttons to scroll through the different
aspects and stuff that you're doing but
honestly there's hours of stuff you can
play around with this before you even
get into the programming aspect but now
let's jump in and let's see why the
pixel kit is a great educational tool
for children all the way up to adults
who want to have fun and learn at the
same time the first step of getting set
up and doing your program with the pixel
kit is connecting a USB cable one end
goes into the pixel kit and the other
goes into any available USB port on your
computer now whether you use a Mac or
you use a PC you simply download the app
to match your system and then you can be
up then going now once you do this
you're going to find yourself in a world
where you can get lost for hours and
hours and hours they have lots of
different tutorials that you can check
out and work with they also have a bunch
of different things that you can do now
one thing really cool about this but I
think is going to be awesome is
programming this with whites to put
inside of a PC for a PC mod now if you
guys would like to see that
easily but comment down below because I
think this would be a really excellent
thing to put right in the very front of
your PC or on a side window and have
something just scrolling by item making
your system look even more awesome but
we'll talk about that a little later
once you get the software up and on your
computer you can find that the
programming is really simple
there's drag-and-drop options on the
left hand side and on the right hand
side you can see all the options for
doing Java scripting like I said earlier
the best thing about the pixel kit
however is that anyone can use it from a
child all the way to an adult there are
games and different things you can do
another thing that's really cool about
the pixel kit is that other people
upload their projects onto the net and
you can take their projects and change
them around and make those your own and
that's just something that's really
incredible you can take someone else's
project change it around and then
totally make it custom and personalized
for you alright so you've made this cool
game and you've made this cool project
for you're like hey man what can I do
with it we'll check it out you can
actually upload it onto the pixel kit
and use one of those three profiles to
store your ideas right here are you
someone out there who's always play
games with thought man I'd really like
to make my own game which you're always
kind of like afraid that you couldn't do
it with the pixel kit though you know
you absolutely can do it because you can
take baby steps
and take your education one step at a
time until you become the master of your
realm all right folks
real quick before I bounce out of here a
special thanks to people over kano for
making today's video possible and
providing the kano for us I got to say
though for $79 this is an absolutely
great deal you spend $10 almost every
meal you spend five to fifteen dollars
going to a movie per hour two hours and
you're in there and with the Kano this
thing is just pretty much like I said
unlimited you will get sucked in trust
me I give you my absolute word of honor
if you start playing with this you will
be sucked in and have lots of fun you'll
sit in front of that computer doing
stuff and you look up and hours and
hours have passed because you've just
been having fun at the same time you can
take a look at all that programming
stuff and see how it's done until your
mind put those two things together I'm
at work you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow like usual they'll be linked
down below where you guys can get one of
these
things for yourself and have all the fun
in the world that we're having here at
tech of tomorrow so peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
