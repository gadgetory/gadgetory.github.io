by Professor Einstein a really cool
robot that can teach you science and
even train your brain hey what's up Tech
fans welcome back once again to the
channel glad to be here glad you're here
too
now I know that all of us wish we had
all the cash in the world so that we
could buy the latest greatest newest
equipment all the time and have the
absolute best systems in the world but
most the time for many of us that's just
a pipe dream that can't happen let's
just face it there's those one
percenters who can buy everything and
then kind of the rest of us who all fall
through the crackles and in some places
I know that money is even tighter than
it is here in the US and for people out
there who live in these type of places
and for even people here in the US who
don't have a lot of cash sometimes
buying used gear is an absolutely great
experience you can get yourself some
really cool stuff and not have to pay a
lot of money for it now one of the best
things about this is is that we all know
that the latest and greatest iteration
of anything out there you know you want
to buy a 1080i it's the most you want to
buy a vega card it's going to probably
be the most anything that's like right
now 580 included is going to be probably
kind of expensive even on the use side
but here's the key though by last
generation if you buy last generation
stuff you're going to be able to buy
great parts for a much lower price now
the tricky part about buying you stuff
is let's just face it it's used so that
alone right there means that there's you
know a probability that there could be
something wrong now I know there are
some forms out there and stuff that work
off you know like people who have a
reputation for selling used gear and
some of those places might be okay now I
just got to tell you guys right off the
bat though buying used equipment from
people at you know strange places and
strange forms is very very risky
Craigslist crazy stuff let's just face
it if you buy something from Craigslist
and you get it home it doesn't work what
are you going to do I mean try to
contact the person because unless
they're totally honest with you know
with you it's going to be you and your
buddies with a baseball bat saying hey
bro I want my cash back
because there's just no way to guarantee
your money that's it's just not that way
now like I said a second ago there
probably are some forms out there with
members that have been around for a long
time have a great reputation for you
know selling you stuff and maybe they
even exchange you stuff and that's okay
for you folks out there who have the
insight down to that please do me a
favor leave links down below to help
other people to go to place where they
know that they can rely on the stuff
they're buying now myself personally I
find that eBay and Amazon actually offer
the best way to get your parts and I'll
tell you why on eBay and Amazon they
both have warranties that completely
protect your money so if you buy
anything on there if it comes to you
it's broken it doesn't work you don't
have to worry anything whatsoever about
getting your money back and that's just
a really good thing now there are a lot
of deals I'm sure that you can probably
find on Craigslist and in some of these
forums that are probably even maybe a
little bit cheaper than that but the
whole thing is just really rolling the
dice will your money be saved will the
parts that you get actually work and if
they don't work how are you going to get
back that financial you know commitment
that you just purchased I mean let's
just face it especially if the shipping
is like - overseas and you're risking
something like that and you're trying to
get something overseas then it becomes
even more and more tricky as you go down
the line and let's just face it some use
parts from people are really really nice
I mean a lot of guys out there tech
sites I know a lot of guys get their
part I turn around they sell them on
places well most of the places that they
sell them where they're going to be
probably in some of these forums or on
eBay or Amazon and while we're talking
about the thought process of buying used
equipment let's check out a word from
today's sponsor professor Weinstein
professor Einstein is an amazing
expressive and playful robot that can
teach you science and even train your
brain not only as Professor Einstein a
learning tool he can take a walk he can
smile he can point he can even go crazy
and turn his head and blink and when you
connect to the cloud he can talk to you
about science math people and anything
in between
professor Einstein makes it easy to
understand any of the facts that you ask
him to from astronomy to physics to
geology and so much more the
possibilities are really endless if you
can think of it professor Einstein can
answer it to interact with professor
Einstein all you need to do is download
their app this works with either an
Android or iPad device professor
Einstein can keep your brain active by
playing fun addicting games that you can
learn from as well as simple and
difficult quizzes to keep your noggin in
shape this is a win win in my book
because you can learn and still have fun
so if you were looking for something to
bring the whole family together and
something that anyone can learn from I
would highly recommend checking out
professor Einstein so let's get to work
now the best thing that I like about
Amazon I would have to say that Amazon
is the number one even though they're
probably the most expensive so let's
just start there Amazon best place in
the world to buying thing they'll take
anything back it pretty much doesn't
matter no matter what you don't like it
it's broke you don't like the color hell
you can return it to Amazon they won't
give a crap don't even work with what
the person who sold it and you guys will
both get your monies and you'll all be
happy campers now like I said though
that is probably the most expensive
place for used parts but sometimes you
can get incredible incredible deals I
one time by the camera lens author the
camera lens was like usually like 300
bucks and I was able to get it for like
a hundred and fifty bucks is a great
deal that came brand-new that was
awesome I've also recently been buying a
lot more used and refurbishment off of
Amazon myself and like I said even
though it does cost a little bit more
money we had a motherboard that came in
which is kind of like you know why our
testing sucks up damn long and rides I
won't even get into that but you know we
had to exchange that motherboard and get
rid of it and Amazon took it back with
absolutely no question whatsoever
now eBay on the other hand is like a
virtual swap meet I mean they have make
offers you can get really cheap stuff on
eBay now I will say this though bidding
most of the time on eBay is a lot of
 every time you go to the bids
and every time I look at vids I have to
sit back and honestly shake my head go
what the is this world come to
honestly I sometimes see
items selling for almost the exact same
price as a new item which is just
totally utterly just like yeah I want
anything to do with that you might want
to get into it I've gotten lucky a few
times I've probably bid on probably
thousands of items over the years I
think I've maybe won ten or eleven that
were actually worth my time so go from
there but a lot of people have buy it
now and with the Buy It Now price you'll
see that a lot of people are really just
trying to get rid of their old computer
equipment because there's factors that
go into that for one thing the
equipment's getting old you know and
electronic stuff doesn't like have
really any like resale value in the
future if you buy a Pentium CPU from
yesterday or an AMD phenom from a long
time ago and you think you can put it on
a shelf and save it up for a rainy day
and sell that for like 20,000 dollars in
investment man ain't happening
electronics don't work that way so
you'll be able to find people out there
that'll give you absolutely great deals
and you can also send a message to a
person asking them saying hey man you
know I know that this item is $89 I've
got $69 would you willing to take that
send me an offer and I'll buy it
right now and the best thing about eBay
is is if anything on there doesn't work
you have 31 days in which to provide a
reason why it's not working either it's
not as described or just plainly doesn't
function but either way your money is
safe with eBay and I think overall that
eBay's prices can even compete with some
of these forums out there that sell
stuff I've looked at the prices and some
of them pretty cool the absolute really
best way that you can buy any used
equipment is probably to buy it from a
friend because you know where that
stuff's been and what it's been doing
but if you want to save money and you
want to buy yourself use parts please
guys out there did you know of good form
that this is working on I'd really
appreciate your interaction with this
video please leave the comments down
below - those type of sites please don't
link to other YouTube channels most
those comments are it's going to be the
link to be deleted as container I have
to bat but if you're putting a link to
something that actually has to do with
the video and it's not linked to another
YouTube site I'm totally down and I
would appreciate that because I know
there are some people out there who want
to know where these places are what
forums are I don't really use forums
that much I used to you know back in the
old days why I have one of my own I was
but these days I honestly find just the
ease honestly the ease of using Amazon
and eBay is just absolutely best because
let's just face it you call up a guy
that you bought it from in a forum and
he's been really great but like he's
adamant that that particular part work
and he's not willing to really give you
your money back it becomes a battle and
I don't know most you guys but I'd
really don't always like conflict I'm
sure you guys don't want that either so
if you don't want to have any conflict
any complications whatsoever no
your best place for pricing is eBay your
best price for any type of return is
Amazon and I would say that the forum's
those probably fall in third and I'd
appreciate like I said some links from
people out there who know what's up to
some of these forums so hey that way my
fans can check them out and I can know
them as well so at the end of the day
maybe you guys go we don't have a lot of
money you want to buy use parts you can
definitely get yourself a last-gen
system that'll be totally awesome nice
and clean almost like new and you can do
without taking any risk whatsoever
through ebay and amazon so peace out and
once again thanks to Professor Einstein
for being today's sponsor like usually
we'll have links down below that like
buttons peace out we'll see you guys
