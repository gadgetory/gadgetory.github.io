the deck of our YouTube channel we bring
you all the tech all the time what are
we doing today well today we're taking a
look at the gtx 680 direct cu2 top card
from the people over at asu's that's
right this thing comes overclocked 1201
megahertz right out of the box has all
kinds of features including their direct
hot wire stuffs you're going to be able
to like actually Hotwire this thing onto
some of their motherboards and overclock
the I buy over volting it now
doing so will probably over you know
state your warranty but those people do
extreme overclocking and that kind of

this card is made for that so it may
have more features and you will ever
actually use but it does have that
option so today we're going to bring you
the unboxing and then the full review of
this card so let's go
alright folks so here we see the from
the box has the Asus logo inspiring
innovation persistent perfection directs
you to top model 20% cooler 14 decibels
quieter that's right this card is
actually pretty big too cuz there's a
giant huge heatsink here you see it 1201
megahertz right out of the box that's
the top GPU boost that's a great
overclock you have their digital oi oi
power stable overclocking this is all
the great components and everything
that's part of it the VGA hot wire for
do-it-yourself over volting that's
pretty crazy huh 2 gigabytes you gd-r 5
memory and obviously it's the geforce
gtx 680 dumplin doom so flip it around
you guys need to see a quick thing the
side not too much there at all not too
much in the bottom either however there
is the nomenclature so let me hold this
up here so you folks can see this this
shows you the nomenclature of the card
for those who are interested alright
then we'll actually see the back of the
box there's actually quite a bit of
features in the back of the box right
here you can see repetitive what we saw
before but then we see the heatsink for
the first time heat pipes direct contact
with the GPU pre hence the directly to
top the tops actually overclocking the
directs you to is actually this
connection right here moving next over
we see the digi+ vrm plus super alloy
power
30% less power noise and 2.5 times
longer durability what this means is by
keeping the card cool and they also have
programming that actually digitally
keeps the fan running so the fan goes up
and down and keeps the card running it's
absolutely cool it's ensuring that it
runs for an absolutely long time here's
the VGA hotwire real-time / volting with
raagh motherboard so that's right with
the toprock motherboards you can
actually directly take this thing sawed
it to the board and then over volt the
 at it for it for overclocking so
with that said let's jump in and see
what else is in the box go ahead and get
this thing over here and pop the tab
there we go go ahead
topside glad you move it from the box
and we'll be kind we won't even throw
the box to the cameraman because we know
some you guys about they're sensitive so
look we have the black box inside the
box box ception going on once again with
the Asus logo across the top slap it
down we're gonna open it up now and then
inside of the flap we have the beginning
and here we go here's the hey-zeus
little black book and inside we have the
speed set-up guide and we'll move on I'm
on this particular one that I got it was
an earlier sample so I didn't get a
driver CD I just downloaded it off the
internet from them so here we go kaboom
take that off the top there underneath
we have some of the connections we have
the dual molex to eight pin power
connector right there so do a molex
eight pin here we have right here the
SLI bracket very far apart as you can
see it's a very very large stretch
because the ROK motherboards you can
separate the cards and the cards
themselves are actually very very large
all right folks now that we've seen all
the accessories and all our stuff relax
actually take a look at the meat of the
matter of the car oops let me go ahead
and take this get this out of the way
here we'll go ahead and we'll set the
car down actually we'll set it down face
first and start off right here so let's
do this now you've got the card face
first let's do the measurements
the card is exactly one foot long so
it's a 12 foot card and I'm just kidding
folks a 12 inch card when people caught
that but lady pleasers it is a 12 inch
card always pleases the ladies trust me
on this as far as the width of the card
Kabang it's about two about two and a
quarter inches well this all translated
for you guys and centimeters not stuff
few people who live overseas so let's
get past that point and since we got it
on this side let's start off here right
at the bat we see two
SLI fingers I mean you can do Quad SLI
with this card flip it around the side
here again we see eight pin and a six
pin power connector so 115 75 watts and
another 75 for the PCI Jessie all that
nice and good all right
and bring this up with the camera really
close if you guys four somehow missed
that I'll just go up here and show you
quick again two power connectors and
then the two sli fingers don't me to be
redundant but some people might not have
caught that so let's flip it around
let's take a look at the rear i/o to DVI
hdmi and displayport my favorite rear
i/o I prefer this one because those are
all the connections that you need it
makes it very easy to plug in especially
using my Dell monitors back here in the
background here's the PCI interface
right here now here's the front of the
card the two fans now underneath all
this is the great direct see you stuff
you can't really see it very much
because the cards cover you know now I'm
gonna try to get the Cameron to slip
right in there and take a look right
here here you can see one two three heat
pipes running all the way through the
card heat fins all the way through this
is connected directly to the GPU so all
the heat gets sucked into that absorbed
into this and then blown away by the
fans that totally dissipates the heat
away from the card so lastly to show the
back one more time
and that folks is what comes in the box
alright folks so now that we've seen
everything that comes in the box let's
see how this card performs against the
competition get ready to rock out to the
benchmark song let's go
you
you
you
all right then the benchmark song rockin
and rollin with pain cylinder song the
benchmarks on you guys have picked it up
all over the place it's available out
there a lot of people ask what it is and
it's available and for you guys yes it
is in all kinds of different flavors and
versions so anyways the really cool
things about this car though are really
for those extreme overclockers being
able to directly hotwire into the
motherboard itself a controller things
the BIOS is really really critical to
those guys were up there trying to break
a records and all that stuff for most
folks like me and you that are just at
home gaming that particular feature is
like you know having a button on our car
that we flipped to fly but we know that
we really can't fly you know but it's
really cool to have it anyways you know
I'm saying so it's just kind of a really
cool feature at the end of the day
though I think this thing is a serious
editor's choice product here on tech of
tomorrow it not only is very very fast
right out of the box it's already
overclocked it runs very very cool with
the digital and everything control of
the fans like I said before this thing
continually runs a constantly cool
velocity I think that is absolutely
great so you guys take care I hope you
guys like this video we're trying to get
more of these review type stuff up for
your folks so show some love and like
always be subscribed because we're going
to have all kinds of giveaways and
contests going on here on tech up
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
