another edition of tech noir we're
bringing you all the tech all the time
now in correspondence to your guys's
complaints down below of why we don't do
the damn mic test
well okay then we've figured out a way
to bring you guys the mic test I've got
the new HS 30s on my head right now and
I'm talking to you guys through the mic

taken my bows and my curtain calls you
brought me fame and fortune and it goes
with it I'll thank you all now this
thing may have given a little bit of
that noise but this way you guys did at
least hear you know how it sounds
and how it even sounds when it goes but
anyways this was the HS 30 this is the
mic test like you folks asked for it for
now on we'll try to include this in the
video when we're doing it but you guys
asked for it we brought it to you so

mascot bringing you guys this week's
news edition and it's pretty exciting
you know and right now if you have your
Ultrabook out you may want to hydrilla
to book in the other room because the
news i'm about to bring you is well it's
really going to hurt its feelings about
to say it's going to make those book
here in its eye and you know now this is
going to be a very interesting product
coming out here by eurocom now this is
going to be the first basically server
super gamer laptop whatever the hell you
want it to be because it comes decked
out with the latest Xeon processors 12
cores 24 threads up to 32 gigabytes of
ram dual sli dual crossfire video cards
whatever the frak you want now the one
thing about this thing is it is really
big and its really bulky kind of like
the old joke we used to tell about the
girl and the moped we're just kind of
like you know fun to ride around but you
may not want your friends to see what's
going on you know that's gonna be this
thing it's gonna be a big bulky huge
laptop but it also doubles as a server
so the big question of will this thing
play crisis will hell ya know play

network for playing a crisis server game
where you could have your own team your
own stuff just set the thing down the
middle of nowhere with this wireless
capabilities have added so this thing's

Zeus makes a series of cards they limit
it to a thousand cards and the price

be made so they can cut the price and
