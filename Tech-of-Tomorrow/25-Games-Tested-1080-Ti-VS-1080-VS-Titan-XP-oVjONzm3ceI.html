video cards from around the world
welcome to tech of tomorrow it's early
in the morning for me and it's time for
all those great scores you've been
waiting for for the GTX 10 ATT I now
we've got 25 games test that's right I
said it
25 games tested against three different
cars today we've got the brand-new Kenan
ati the standard of 1080 and then we
also have the Titan XP so that's what
everybody's wantin what they're looking
for so with that said let's jump in real
quick let's check out our test system
let's check out those benchmarks and see
why you guys are going to really be
going holy
so if you guys who follow the channel
you guys probably know our system but
for you guys who don't you guys can
check that out right here now we're
using the latest 370 eight point seven
eight driver from Nvidia this should
probably be publicly released today
hopefully we'll see you guys can use the
same driver in your testing we're using
the patch version of Windows 10 and
everything on the system's been updated
to all its latest drivers to get the
best performance now if for some reason
you happen to miss my other video where
I talk about all the tech specs and
what's underneath the hood you guys can
check that out right here we'll have a
link to that we you guys can go watch
that video first before you see the
scores if you want to and with that said
let's see those 25 games and let's rock
out to the benchmark song let's go
and for those are you wondering damn
networks how hot did that card get with
all these games well it had a maximum
temperature threshold of 86 Celsius
you
all right you're back so what do you
guys think I'm thinking hell of
impressive for the price point of $700
you can see this thing competes directly
head-to-head with the Titan XP so for
the money this is definitely a card
worth your cash I'm saying that just the
way it is Nvidia is now once again
taking the crowd they are the king of
the ring and single card stuff we
haven't seen any duel cards yet and
maybe we will and nothing from AMD right
now in the market no matter what the
price range can actually compete with
this card head-to-head so we did include
that in this video we're going to have
another video where we actually show you
against the AMD card if you guys can see
the differences but today we figured
that you guys really want to see the
differences between the 1080 the 1080i
and the Titan XP and you guys can see
the numbers are n-now real quick before
we bounce out of here special thanks to
our friend mark if you guys want to
check out his review in a different
perspective we got a link down below the
battle tech reviews where you can see
what he's doing on paper and if you guys
like to read you'll probably enjoy it
quite a bit so imma work you guys
watching Tekken tomorrow you can see man
the numbers don't lie
coming in at $700 huh Nvidia is now the
king of the ring with the 1080 Ti
I'm Elric you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow like usual down below like
button leveling so you can check out
more information or possibly violin of
these cards for yourself we'll see you
guys back there on technical mark from
more tech because there's lots of stuff
coming with the 1080 TI bees</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
