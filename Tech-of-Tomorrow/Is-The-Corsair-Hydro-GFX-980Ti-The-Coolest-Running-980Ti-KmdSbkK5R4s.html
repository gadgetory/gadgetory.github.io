tomorrow winter edition you guys are
going watch it just like that well men
you know it in California it's like they
two degrees so it is official man hell
has frozen over now for us any time it
really falls below 60 degree everybody
panics and goes oh my god the world is
coming to an end and for us believe me
it's freezing cold now I know there's
some people out there in colder place i
know the new yorker is going you know
what I'm my block when it was 30 degrees
outside we will play baseball in our
underwear you're just a wussy and you'll
be alright it's cool it's cool but him
for us it's cold now winter edition
features a brand new product that's come
out from the people over at Corsair and
it's pretty cool because it's done in
combination with the people at MSI so
pretty much picture msi top in Hardware
killer cooling by the people over at
Corsair so it's a mixture and blend of
the two and that is their brand new
hydro FX card so it's a hydro GFX this
is a gtx 980 card non ati that is
top-of-the-line car that you can get
right now from the nvidia for the
desktop so let's go in check out what's
in the box see how it performs at the
end of the day say hey do I want to
spend money and get myself a killer
water-cooled gtx 980 TI maybe so like
usual any unboxing obviously is going to
include walla the box so here's the
front of the box on the side you can see
some of the nomenclature n numbers of
this great little card here is the back
where they talk about the cooling
functions at all that stuff now you guys
all know what great cooling solutions a
lot of people have them out there this
is Corsairs version I'm obviously going
to assume right off the bat that it's
going to work very well since I've taken
all the time to go and invest in this
type of product when it's not their
usual run-of-the-mill type things so I
think it's going to work out really well
I'm going to flip it around one more
time to hear that's pretty much
everything there is for looking at the
Box weekend unbox it gonna pop the cap
here open the top up don't be obviously
be a box inside of the box which is the
Box ception I'll go ahead and just pull
that thing out here it's much easier
just to simply take the box for me
jelly just make a little shake so now
let's go ahead and pop the hood see
what's underneath the hood and we'll
spin that around and you guys can see
you nothing is actually probably better
this way so here's everything inside of
the box and what it looks like when you
guys get it so when you buy the card and
it comes in the mail it's going to look
like this will slowly take the stuff out
so it's a few things inside of here
better the bundled contents will take a
look at the bundle contents real quick
right here on top we've got some screws
molex 6 to 8 pin cable nice little
plastic bag that has the MSI stuff like
I said the card itself is probably
manufactured at MSI level using their
cooler or vice versa could be lots of
different things but there's that then
we have the quick users guide looks like
we have yep the CD the drivers Koch
little thing here saying hey this is the
hydro GFX from corsair so good stuff
there it's not a lot of bundled content
but what do you really need so beyond
that we pull this out right here let me
just set the box off to the side boom
alright let's get this range so check
this thing out so visually speaking you
guys can see right off the bat the card
looks really killer it's like gunmetal
gray black and silver looks like
something you'd see in a very high-end
car or high-end product you see the MSI
name here of course their logo msi once
again on the single fan really nice
looking simple yet elegant once again on
the bottom you guys can see the msi logo
on a PCIe slot as we look at the rear I
oh you can see that there are three
display ports an hdmi port and a DVI
port on the back of the card one thing
nice to see a nice solid protective
plate you guys all know I love that for
those of you who like the cringe get
ready to cringe it's crunch time tap in
the back of that card and as we spend
the card around you guys can clearly see
it's the overclocked series it says it
right there and obviously a card of this
caliber is going to come over clocked
out of the box the big thing about the
liquid cooling on this card is that it's
going to help that boost the cool of the
card runs the better the boost also
we're taking a look at the back panel
you guys can see that there are two SLI
fingers up there on
up like I do is remove the tab and you
can access those you guys already know
the specs of the GTX 980 TI the only
thing different about this one is this
water cooled as a little bit overclocked
now as far as the cooling reservoir goes
you can see there are two cables that
are tuning out of the side of the card
they go to this radiator right here this
will be very simple to install in any
system pretty much you know if you have
a fan in the back of your case you're
going to be able to mount this they're
very very simply which makes these
clothes in systems just absolutely
awesome if you don't want to mess with
stuff and you want something very simple
hey this is the awesome way to go and
once again on the top you can see
there's a single 8 pin in a single 6 pin
power connector once again the 980 TI
nomenclature and once again the MSI name
again and I think I'm SI user name all
over this card think so so anyways this
is the card that's awesome i know it's
kind of spec light by now I'm have
figured you guys all know by now you
know what this card is what it has i
mean cuda cores you know that a six
gigabytes egdr five and think you guys
all know these things if not you can
yell at me but I mean this card's been
out for quite a while the big difference
about this card is that it comes out of
the box obviously overclock senate has
this totally cool you know system of
water cooling so there are a few other
people out in the market that have
water-cooled cars and they're always a
little bit pricey due to the fact these
cards are obvious a little bit of risk
factor because there are water cooled so
I mean this gives the chance you know
even of murphy's love something can go
wrong possible it gives that so these
are high in cards very high-end very
pricey so don't want to speculate I
apologize but I figure really honestly
you guys should know this car by now
it's been out there for quite a while so
let's jump into the test system by the
way I know you guys are going to say hey
while you're testing this card this way
it's been the same test system we've had
for years so obviously we know some
stuff on there needs to be changed we're
updating it it's the holiday time I
didn't want to let these guys down at
least not show their car because it's a
really cool card if you're looking for
actually a really high-end awesome gift
this is something to consider this card
runs so much cooler you'll see then the
other cards now the so tech card they're
19 their 980 I amp extreme car that card
so far has been like just the fastest
absolute fastest card this card second
but it runs so much cooler and that
gives you head room for more
overclocking so let's jump in real quick
and let's just check out those Tesco
course and then let's bounce and enjoy
our holiday season
okay so check it out folks you guys all
saw the scores you guys all rock out to
the benchmark song rock on now you guys
see that this card although not the
absolute fastest gtx 980 I that we've
ever seen here it is the second fastest
and it did run significantly cooler so
having that cooler factor it means that
the boots clock will have much more easy
time boosting that clock up and doing
your overclocking so that's something
very good about the card means it right
now as it is it has Headroom now there
is one caveat to this car because it
costs seven hundred twenty dollars but
like I said any of the liquid-cooled
cards others gtx 980 I series are all
very freaking pricey it stopped and wine
card water cooling all that stuff
combined makes you no moola because
these are the absolute best cards they
stay the best cooled they're going to
last you longer because of that factor
in fact if you just leave this card
alone which I be honest with you guys I
don't overclock all my cards only one
you guys really want so I'm something
overclocked I just like to run my cards
where they are and just play my games
and enjoy them and pretty much when I do
that I'm not getting any screen tearing
I'm not getting any framerate drops I'm
not having any issues with weird driver
stuff so that's just me personally I
know that people out there who just love
to overclock the out of him if
you're one of those people well this is
definitely one of those cards you want
to check out because it has plenty of
room for overclocking so if you're an
overclock and you want to get something
you can push to the limit take a look at
this brand new hydro gfx card from the
people over at course they're obviously
in conjunction with msi like usual the
price of all this stuff information will
be down below that like button hope you
guys like it sorry to make the video
kind of short it is the holiday season I
still want to bring you guys video but I
have family out and stuff so I'm going
to actually take a couple days out after
this video probably until Christmas i'm
only gonna probably have maybe one more
video possibly to one last thing before
i bounce out of here every day i'm
giving stuff away on twitter go look and
in fact you guys complain said want to
show pictures so now i'm even showing a
picture of everything i'm giving away
every day on twitter and it's really

detective tomorrow go follow me over on
twitter easy money every day i'm picking
