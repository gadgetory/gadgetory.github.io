back once again to TECA tomorrow now in
the last two weeks we've seen some crazy
as keyboards the real force RGB two
hundred and fifty dollars of course
there the week before at two hundred
dollars a lot of people seen between the
tuned for further Corsair but today
we're going to take a look at a keyboard
that's under a hundred dollars
mechanical features its own keys but did
I say it's under a hundred bucks that's
right now this is the test oral xcalibur
SE spectrum gamma can remember I
remember it all and one big flouse so
with that said though let's jump in and
let's check out with his keyboards all
about and why at the end of the day I
think it's the absolute best mechanical
keyboard for under arounder bucks so
first off let's check out what comes in
the box now obviously you get the
keyboard itself but you get two other
little things you get this little
sticker that's right this little sticker
right here with has every one of the key
things and what they can do for you
which you can actually no stick in the
center of your monitor until you learn
what you're doing then they get this
little quick book guide that tells you
everything that's going on really that's
what comes in the box now the keyboard
itself when you're looking at it from
the top it looks like a and the other
keyboard that you've ever seen because
obviously the most of them are set up
pretty much exactly the same
in fact this looks a lot like the real
force RGB in many ways to turn onto its
back it's got the same type of plating
got two feet all the same type of
features almost the same type of tilt as
well now the big thing about this
keyboard is the Tesoro switches now
these are supposed to be similar to the
Cherry MX switches but they're just
branded by these guys it seems like a
lot of people out there when I read
reviews are liking these types of keys
now there's absolutely no metal in these
keys whatsoever and that makes them
pretty much given anything else in the
market so you not to worry about
spilling your drinks and stuff like that
as well because it's anti dust and spill
resistant which is pretty cool which
means you just spill your drink on it
you have to worry about metal getting
corroded and down the line ruining your
keyboard whatsoever you just got to take
the keys up dry and clean that stuff up
and you're back and going in the game
now one thing great about this keyboard
is you don't have to worry about any
type of driver CD whatsoever it's got a
driverless set up you can do everything
on the fly all the adjustments are very
simple you get the escape button on the
top and then you get your for
programmable macro button
and remember the memory is already in
the keyboards you don't have to worry
about programming this anywhere else and
saving it any kind of memory file on
your computer you can pick this thing up
go wherever you want
and everything's programmed in it next
up the f5 through f8 keys these are the
speed of your activation and you can go
anywhere from five milliseconds up to 40
milliseconds depending on what your
preference is as far as multimedia Keys
go the f9 to f11 keys these control your
volume you can mute raise your volume up
or bring it down through these keys the
f12 is the keyboard lock button and last
but not least are the profile keys you
can see it says profile 1 profile to
profile 3 and these also double as the
standard keys that are on any keyboard
some other features of the keys
themselves are non-contact signal which
eliminates double typing all the keys
are hot swappable and like I said before
this keyboard features an advanced anti
dust and spill resistance design the
report rate is a thousand Hertz
there's also 512 kilobytes of built-in
memory the life cycle of the keystroke
is a hundred million keystrokes I don't
know if you're going to ever be able to
do that much gaming backlit is
completely RGB backlit and the backlit
setup is perky and every K can be
programmed to its own color so you're
definitely going to find something that
you like there are also anti-ghosting
effects which you can turn on and off
and they offer full n key and 6 key roll
over and since the Excalibur is so well
built you know it's going to last a long
time for your gaming needs another thing
to take note of now I don't know how
much this actually means to different
people because this is obviously an area
where it depends on what you're doing
but this keyboard does offer no extra
USB ports or anything else like that you
get the single USB that you plug into
your PC and that's it as far as
connectivity now that's totally
simplistic a lot of people going to be
like hey that's cool with me but I know
there's some folks out there be like oh
man no USB not for me and if you're
wondering hey how long is that cable
Elric it's 1.8 meters and as far as the
dimensions go the xcalibur sizes in it
450 by 150 by 34 millimeters it's very
light - it only weighs one point to four
kilograms alright folks so those are the
basic specs and all that about the
keyboard now this next part of the
keyboard is very subjective some people
out there like hell
yes I love RGB other people like no man
I don't want any RGB we'll check out if
you don't like the our GP or anything
like that you don't have to use it
whatsoever you can completely disable it
on the Excalibur so you don't have to
see anything but the keys the way they
are but if you're into the lighting
effects like I'm I think it's really
cool you can do a lot of different stuff
with this keyboard and best of all you
don't have to go online and do any
driver type of stuff you can do live
recording of different keystrokes and
all kinds of different things to make
this keyboard yours
like I said before there's ten different
programs that are already inside the
keyboard for you to use so yeah
you can't like Sokoli crazy and control
but with all these things already
pre-programmed it in the most of stuff
that you're going to want to do is going
to be in there I guarantee if you like
RGB unless you're trying to write your
name or use something fancy like that I
think you'll be totally cool with what
this does now you have to do is just hit
a couple different keys and then you're
boom you're able to do whatever you want
and set it the way you want
now the question other people asked
before in other videos they said hey man
you missed the part of how loud are
these keys when you're hitting them well
these aren't that loud but obviously
it's not a membrane based keyboard
obviously membrane based keyboards
they're smooth they're nice and soft
they're beautiful mechanical keyboards
all have a little bit of click and since
this is modeled after the red switches
you can see this going to be about that
same volume it's not extremely clacking
but there is still a slight clack as you
guys can see right here now as far as
the in-game experience goes this
keyboard is very very nice all the keys
responds but like I said before if the
keys aren't as responsive as you like
you can always change the activation to
be exactly what you like now one caveat
however might be is there's no wrist
rest so if a wrist press is like you
know you're mmm well then you might want
to think about that but there are so
many aftermarket wrist frets that you
can get I really like the one it's from
gel from Kensington that one's totally
badass that's one I use so I'll try to
put a link down below because that's one
I think is more preferable to anyone
that comes any keep on the market but
that's just me but at the end of the day
folks the best thing about this keyboard
beyond all these nice features is come
on it's under
a hundred bucks $99 right now so in my
book I really feel that for under $100
this is the absolute best mechanical
keyboard you can get your hands on I
like it a lot now I know there's gonna
be some people out there might be saying
well it's not a mechanical keyboard
because of this or that I don't know but
its market as that so let's just keep it
in that frame where you won't cut it up
in like punk-rock metallic to the speed
rock death metal you know we want to
shop up to so many pieces like they
don't rock music will don't leave it
like that
and at the end of the day down below
like button we will have a link to all
the information about this keyboard so
if you guys want to pick one up to
yourself or just check out more
information before you make that buy you
can do so here
so I network you guys been watching
ticker tomorrow we got more tech coming
out every day this week so to stay tuned
