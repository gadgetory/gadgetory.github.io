to see you guys on the channel it's me
Eric mr. buddy the dog and like usual G
behind the camera now today's video is
basically to once again thank you guys
for being great fans and let you guys
know that I finally did start and get
our patreon site going so for you people
out there who've wanted to help you know
support the site help support me help me
pay those nasty medical bills I have
keep this little puppy fed and all that
good stuff welp we started a patreon
site it's up and going now we'll have a
link down below
now I didn't do one of those other
things we're just funding for for cash
as a short thing because I figured we
might as well do something that's gonna
be around a long time and there will be
certain things that are specific only
over on the patreon site I'm gonna try
to figure out as many different special
things like and do over there since
obviously at that point you guys will be
donating money now they're currently
there are just two ways to do it there's
a $2 and a $5 I'm gonna change it around
and try to increase it I'll Bank action
one's a little bit lower and then one a
little higher that'll have some
different stuff like one thing I would
really like to do is some of these
giveaways I mean they're really kind of
I don't have to put up there kinda dog
fell it's kind of funny they're there
they're kind of impersonal wait there
are some wins I don't know them you know
we give something out I think I want to
do something different this year and
possibly figure out a way and get
sponsors and then actually give
something away and have the people
actually come out here meet us in person
and then get the prize and then take
that with them and go that way we can
actually meet the people it'll have more
effort probably a little bit you know
less amount of stuff but actually better
stuff so it should work out pretty good
I understand why this little guy's so
uncomfortable today he wanted up here
he's the guy who was plugin now he's
like no but I'm gonna be up here alright
well jump on down then alright
so mr. buddy the dog is out of the
picture but this is a very very short
video today folks I'm just letting you
guys know though for those people out
there who always said hey man I wish
there was a way to support you please
start a patreon channel well hey I did
it hey man what do you got Bogey's any
or something's like he's making me itch
am i allergic to puppy all of a sudden I
hope
no I'm just kidding am NOT but so that's
it folks so for you guys who want to
donate wanna help
want to help pay my medical bills and
all that stuff we've also got another
video on patreon that explains a little
bit more in depth so if you guys want to
check that out we'll also have a link
below but like usual thank you guys very
very much from the heart I appreciate it
you guys have been a great audience
great fans and it's just wonderful to
have you guys regardless of the numbers
of what's going on a channel because
YouTube's whacky algorithm and just
doesn't show my videos anymore you guys
and I'm talking back as I'm not even
hardly ever in your subscription box
anymore but hey that's just the way it
is we're still bringing videos we're
still in the game we're still here for
you so let's just try to keep things go
on in this patron will just help the
engine run smoother</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
