miraculous tech of tomorrow YouTube
channel I'm Eric first your host on
today and that's right today I guess
it's today I hope it's not yesterday it
was today when I woke up this morning so
with that in mind we're gonna take a
look at something once again from the
people over at Rose will huh and today
we're gonna be taking a look at their
hive power supply now when you guys
think of hive you might think of the
hive mind from Star Trek and think the
Borg is attacking or you might think of
a bee hive is but freaking out but
nonetheless it's just a power supply
nomenclature the hive maybe it's a TV
program no it's a 750 watt power supply
it's not modular and it's coming to
market at about $79 and today what we're
gonna do is we're going to see what
comes inside of the new hive box here
all right folks so here we see it this
is the Rosewill high gaming power supply
80 plus bronze with a three year
warranty now there are actually three of
these in the new hive series there's a
515 650 and 750 watt we added the 750
watt one so you guys have you outside
the box gonna flip it around right here
on the side is the nomenclature high of
750 you can also see they have the 550
650 and 750 watt version that I spoke of
a minute ago if you were paying
attention around nothing really there
nothing really there here on the end we
see the features and the connectors so
let's go over this together anyways so
the features on the high of 750 it has
120 plus 4 pin power has one four to
eight pin ATX EPS power supply has one
EPS 8 pin eight SATA six molex four and
two floppies so you guys can see all
that right there on the side I'm gonna
go ahead and take my trusty knife and
begin doing the unboxing which begins
with once again a surgical incision here
on the top here don't try this at home
folks I cannot be responsible for what
happens if you try this
I don't want your lawyers calling me
saying my son saw an unboxing on your
site and he cut his hand off oh my god
oh my god oh my god it would really bum
out my days seriously so don't do that
to yourself you know leave the unboxings
to the professionals
leave the unboxings to the pros you know
I'm saying it's a dirty job but
someone's got to do it that's right it's
a dirty job and someone's got to do it
and I'm the dirty guy for that job
people it's gonna make all these nice
quick cuts around here so I can bring
this unboxing start tearing all his
plastic off there we go we're gonna rip
it and tear it like a cavemen just get
all that lovely plastic goodness off
alright
got all that now get the shiny box cap
whoa alright everything falls on the box
so with that we'll bring you back over
here
here we go we've got the hive 80 plus
bronze it's not the winner of the
Olympics but it's not the loser either
it's the hive 80 plus bronze got that
again this side got an accessory kit
right here this is going to contain all
of the extra cables so I'm going to go
ahead and pull these out for you folks
so that you can see them all then we
will put them back afterwards so let me
get this over here get the power supply
out of the way and let's just show you
guys all the different cables out here
so the cable man can zoom into those so
you guys can see this is a semi modular
power supply I say semi because that's
right the power itself is not modular so
there's all this you guys didn't see
that goes back in its carrying case so
let's go ahead and take all that stuff
there's also the power plug it's in
there you're going to need this to plug
in your wall unless you have little tiny
little roads in a cage that make
electricity if you have that then hey
thumbs up you're a badass dude me I got
a round trusty old electricity that's
right the old standby electricity bug on
it Thomas Edison's gift to mankind so
here we go we got the black and we've
got the red these are also colors like
the Republic of gamers or like fatality
or like AMD black and red as a theme
that many people seem to adopt when
they're making their design and we see
that here as well show you guys side
nothing there like that nice black side
whoo it's all bitchin SPAC it's cool
yeah alright here's the top if you can
to zoom in on this other side here's the
backside can we see the on and off
switch the power connector right here
the bottom fan the warranty void is seal
is broken so don't go taking the damn
thing apart and then last but not least
your power your 24 pin and your
additional two four and eight pin powers
so that's it folks this is the unboxing
of the new 750 watt high firm Rosewill
and so me and my trusty little knife
we'll see you guys back here on tech of
tomorrow tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
