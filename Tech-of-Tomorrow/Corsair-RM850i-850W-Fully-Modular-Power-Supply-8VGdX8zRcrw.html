Corsair RM 850 I bring 850 watts of
power to the table 80 plus gold
certified seven-year warranty
fully module what Leblon FLE modular
what could be better
me talking better rear drop I got a
knife let's unbox Troy so check it out
we've got the box la caja few people out
there who speak espa√±ol this is like
aha
and it's also yeah like the yellow kaha
which a como se D says mr. Jesus we say
yellow I'm a real I'm a real kaha right
here in this box with the Corsair RM 850
aye
now first you guys can see the further
box oh and you can see the back of the
box and then right here on the side are
a few things which right now we're going
to talk about now another thing is this
thing is completely geared towards low
noise so it supposed to be very
efficient and very quiet which a lot of
people want they want quiet and they
want efficient I'm down with that as
well let's talk about what's actually
going to be in this thing as far as
specifications go and what you're going
to get is the wiring schematics starting
off we're going to see a 24-pin ATX
cable there's going to be one of those
we're going to see ATX 12 volt cables
there's going to be two of these these
are eight pin four plus two we're also
going to see six PCIe cables these are
the 6 pin plus 2 type we see 10 SATA
cables 8 4 pin peripheral cables and I
don't even know why and how they have
this in there - floppy drive adapters
another cool feature which I haven't
actually seen too many power supplies
numb if the big super power supply guy
is this thing has the ability to switch
from a single 12 volt to a dual 12 volt
rail and that's something really cool I
think users out there gonna like that a
lot with that said though let's hop in
the Box got the old trusty knife here
find some nice spot to cut in here and
make a selection slice here I'm actually
have to ask for donations for the
Cameron for this this is gonna hurt I'm
just kidding who who would film come on
what I have some like button nope
we need him mute him he's reliable got
to have him
we can't throw things though like boxes
at him those always look oh so check it
out box comin at ya wha and look another
box ah
can you believe it alright so we'll take
another little cut here for this other
little box in here and now we've made
the old slice pop the old gap and inside
more stuff now right the bat we'll start
off with what we got right here we've
got all the different manuals for all
their different power supplies all the
way from the RM 1000 eye all the way
down the RM 650i the user's guide and
all that good stuff some people are
gonna read that most people just going
to try to put this bad boy inside of
their system
the warranty guide like I said
seven-year warranty on this 80 plus gold
certified bad boy and got some foam
right here up dough already and that one
thing that's really cool that I
appreciate my friend over there Rick
Allen thank you very much sure they
always put like all the nomenclature and
pictures and stuff on a nice little
drive inside of here which is pretty
cool because there's not going to be any
drivers for power supply no there's not
just kidding you set it off the side the
star power cable need this unless you
got two little mice running and a thing
that let you generates electricity or
you know something like that otherwise
you're gonna need a power cable now
believe it or not when I first start off
in the computer industry I had some
customer call me and they told me that
their computer came with a power supply
and therefore they want to know why they
deployed it in the wall and I was like
what'd you think was a battery and the
guy actually said yes I thought it was a
power supply hmm strange but true so got
some zip ties for those custom
installations some people are gonna use
those let's go over here
alright we got a couple more things in
here now we've got an empty box we're
gonna not thought the cameramen because
what don't give me the finger buddy
alright so start off with all those
cables that we talked about earlier but
pop the cap here
and there's like a ton of them so
we went over all the different types I'm
not going to recount them all out for
you they showed them on the side
Jewelers is single one of this one a to
these other ones but love all the other
ones but here's what they actually look
like they're actually all braided so
right now let's get some close-up shots
of those just so you guys can check
those out another variation of the cable
is they have some of these cables that
are completely flat these are for lining
up behind your cage and stuff so you can
do those custom builds that any of the
cables showing so that's cool another
cable they did not mention in there
whatsoever night see it right here
though is a USB charging cable something
you don't usually see inside of a power
supply but this one's here now you guys
can see all the cables clearly laid out
in the table and they're all pretty cool
looking are these the type of cables you
guys are looking when you buy your power
supply I want to see down the comments
down below and I'm sure the people over
at Corsair want to see these as well so
let me know do you guys prefer these
type of cables or is there something
different that you're looking for
inquiring minds want to know
news at 11:00 now moving on we got the
actual power supply itself a beast from
the east whoo hmm has that nice new
power supply smell yeah all right so
let's check it out fully modular like we
said earlier and let's start off in the
back here we see there's the power input
and the power switch as well as the
nomenclature you can see it right there
the RM 850 eye as we spin it around the
side you can see the Corsair logo and
once again the nomenclature of the power
supply well spin it around the back and
on the back here you can see it features
corsair link this is a digital
connection and this is actually what
that cable that I thought was the USB
cable earlier it's there but there's
also a digital connection called the
digital link you can see there's a fan
test button for testing out the fan we
also see the peripheral and SATA
connections the six plus two PCIe and
four plus four CPU the peripheral and
SATA and 5u 24-pin ATX on the bottom
well spin it around the backside you
guys can clearly see there's a fan with
the corsair logo once again predominant
on it there's also an empty black bag
which Kindle is it alright just kidding

second cuz you guys are always compare
