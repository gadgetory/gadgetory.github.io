you
welcome to
when we bring the best to you
I see duck five-and-a-quarter drive bay
which is hot swappable for either your
2.5 or your 3.5 drive this means you can
use a standard hard drive or an SSD
inside of this bad boy it's also totally
hot swappable so one bay inside of your
computer you can have two drives either
an SSD or one of the you know smaller
size hard drives like it's just use an
SSD if you're gonna go that small and a
regular Hall Drive all in one so let's
jump into the box let's see what it's
about because these things are supposed
to be quality products this thing's
about 35 bucks so for 35 bucks you get
yourself a hot swap high quality little
drive a it support two different things
so let's jump in and let's check this
out alright folks so here we have it a
thirty five dollar product like I said
before you can put two Drive in one in a
single five and a quarter bay so you
guys can see it's the five and a quarter
hot swap drive caddy for two-and-a-half
and three-and-a-half SATA hard drives or
SSDs duo swap long part number right
there if you want to write it down and
be nine seven one SP dash B which means
it's black and beautiful it's called the
Express trailer set up new screws
required nothing else say it a six
gigabit sports three terabyte hard
drives plug and play alright let's take
this thing around spin it around here's
the back of the box not really much
there so I'm not gonna bore you with it
here's the side shows you a couple
little things here individual access for
2.5 and 3.5 inch drives that's right so
alright let's bring it out here Tonto
and here we go so now this thing is
considered to be a high quality product
these guys consider their products to be
pretty high-end so here's the silicon
gel don't eat this stuff throw away do
not eat do not feed to the Bears not
leave the rats not feed your cat feed
your worst enemy well you know unless
you got ulterior motives in that case
you know I didn't hear about it
toss it out of the way here we go here's
the installation guide and stuff shows
you a picture of the unit
then inside simple instructions on how
to use the unit so there's that the old
IC doc folks buy that here other screws
these are just to hold this end by the
way not to put your dries in this is
just to hold this Bay inside your case
in case you don't have the screws so
here we go here's the front of the unit
eject buttons it's like an old-school
kind of CD player which is kind of cool
buttons right here down here you can see
on the bottom here I don't know if it's
gonna see here try to get a different
angle here maybe if the camera can see
it here now down on the bottom that's
where you're gonna fit your 2.5 and then
on top of that your 3.5 now all you have
to do is just basically take the drives
and plug them in there we're gonna take
a break real quick and put some drives
in so now we've went and got a standard
hard drive go ahead and we'll plug that
bad boy in there just see pops right in
to us it's already mounted and locked
into there and then below that there's
still room for the SSD I didn't have to
have one handy right now otherwise
showed you but it's very simple just
goes in there and you have two drives in
the place of one that's how you reject
that one see that the drive is in and
then ejected and the drive pops out you
actually have to hold the button to pull
the drive out so take that in mind you
get the drive and try to pull out you
need to hold the button to take the
drive out so now we're take a look at
the back side you can see here's the
power connector here's a connection for
the 3.5 and here's a connection for the
2.5 I see doc alright so there you guys
have it anybody's out there is looking
for this type of product if you current

system or perhaps share both an SSD and
a hard drive in a single Bay for 35
bucks you can get this one slap it in if
your motherboard supports hot swap
ability this thing works right along
with it so you can pull the drives in
and out as you see fit you won't lose
