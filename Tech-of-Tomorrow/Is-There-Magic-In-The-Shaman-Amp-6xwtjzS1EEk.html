guys back here on the channel now today
we're gonna be doing something a little
bit different in the house today I have
my guitar player from seven deadly sins
his name is Shawn Hernandez Shawn thanks
for coming over to the show and we're
gonna be checking out an amp from the
people over at Panama now if you guys
don't know anything about this company
at all these guys are a little bit
different they're definitely thinking a
little bit outside the box everything is
handmade at the side of a volcano in
Panama and they do it out of all kinds
of woods that they can keep using over
and over and over again so it's totally
sustainable tonewoods they use different
type of build materials in their amps
that i've ever seen before when we take
a closer look at the amp you guys are
going to see that it's built really nice
I mean you have to admit Shawn this
thing just looks really nice don't you
think I mean and the whole front of the
thing is just beautiful in the way it's
laid out plus it's a very very small amp
you can take it with you wherever you go
Panama amped sell there you have them on
eBay they have them on reverb they
really haven't broke food to the majors
yet and one thing I can tell you about
these guys even though this particular
amp sold for $5.99
they have always make an offer on eBay
and on reverb but if you make them a
reasonable offer they're a very
reasonable company they will take your
money trust me so today we're gonna be
looking at the shaman now the shaman amp
is really nice it goes all the way from
like really nice clean shiny stuff all
the way up and pretty much I can't
really say melts your face metal but it
does get very very heavy tones with
inside of the Sam so with that said
Sean's here today he's gonna be taking
this nice little Jackson guitar we got
right here he's gonna be using his
guitar skills to run through the
different saying so we're gonna show you
the clean tones there's also a lot of
features inside of this so let's jump
right in and let's take a close-up of
the amp itself
take a look at the app itself you guys
can see it features are very nice tolex
outside the front of the amp is very
nice it has really nice wood colors you
guys can see the wood on this is just
absolutely amazing you have the panama
logo what you guys can't see is what's
actually in side of the app and there's
five 12ax7 and two el84
now taking a look at the front of the
amp on the top you guys see the input
switch below that is the foot switch to
the right-hand side of that this is the
voicing there are four different
voicings on this particular amp so you
can change them up or down to get the
settings that you particularly like so
starting off let's check out the control
knobs now each separate channel has its
own control knob so that you can control
them independently so starting off we
have the gain knob then we see treble
mid bass the presence knob and finally
the volume knob this amp also features
two different types of power structures
when the switches to the bottom it's at
10 amps when the switch at the top it's
at 20 amps there's also a switch on the
end this switches between the different
channels and then last but not least we
see the power and standby control
switches on the back of the amp it's
pretty simply laid out you have your
power input and then you have your
different type of settings for your
speaker's you have 8 and 16 ohms and
actually there's a hard bypass switch as
well as a fully functioning effects loop
for adding effects to the amp so the amp
does look really nice right but one
thing you do not want to lose is this
little slip of paper right here I'll
admit I had to look at it a couple of
times because all the control knobs have
funky designs for changing all your
different settings I mean if you lose
that can that book you're gonna be like
oh yeah you like lots in space what do I
do
I'm sure Benji could figure out you sit
there and tweak around them till you get
used to it but definitely don't lose
that now with that said though let's
jump in and let's test how this amp
sounds now first we're gonna be showing
you the different settings on the clean
channel this is absolutely straight into
the amp there's no pedals anything else
then we're gonna go into the heavy stuff
which they call clean and unclean which
if any of you guys out there are science
fiction fans there's this book out there
but Thomas comment the unbeliever and he
was unclean anybody who reads do you
know old stuff you guys will get that
but with that said though let's jump in
let's see how the shaman am actually
sounds the shaman shaman shaman it's so
we're gonna start off with everything at
the 12 o'clock position then we'll start
changing all the different knobs for
different tones
go ahead and add a little bit more
trouble to the mixer
is really driving a little bit I'll show
you where I guys think is my perfect
role setting for this a little bit more
this is my particular favorite setting
on this now remember we said there's two
different voicings that was the first
voicing now I'm going to switch over to
the other voicing you guys can see very
bright I'll say really Bassets well the
clock position will start over again
again
dirty dirty dirty
my particular favorite sitting in this
particular channel I like it a little
bit brighter
a little bit more bass not as much as on
the other channel and even a little bit
more particular trouble on this
particular setting and a little bit more
volume
I think on the bright child this is my
favorite a little bit more presence if
you want
[Laughter]
everything's you guys just heard was in
the 10 watt mode now it's turned the
power up and let's do it in 20 watts
so now let's check out the unclean
channel we're gonna start out on 10 watt
and the voicing on this particular one
is called crunch and everything is at 12
o'clock so let's rock
now this right here this is my
particular favorite setting on this
amplifier this is where I think it
sounds the best you guys can let me know
what you think but as far as like just
rhythms and this kind of stuff for me
this is the perfect setting so now let's
go from the crunch to the lead channel
and see how that sounds
these particular settings right here are
my favorite on the high-gain channel so
now we're gonna start back off on the
crunch channel I'm not going to bore you
guys going through everything again but
we are going to go back to the crunch
channel and turn the amp up to 20 watts
I'll just leave it on my favorite
settings for both things so you guys can
just hear the difference between the 10
watt and the 20 watt
so now we're going to show you guys the
high-gain setting on 20 watts with a
tube screamer 808 in front of it
personally I think this just tightens
everything up and makes it sound really
great so let's check out that riff once
again this time though with a tube
screamer
oh my god no we're just kidding all in
all though the Panama shaman is a really
nice amplifier like I said at the very
beginning of the video this is actually
a bee stock item that I couldn't find
anything wrong with whatsoever now the
street price is $5.99 for this
particular amp but like I said you can
make these guys a reasonable offer I did
trust me they will give you the deal
that you want to do now me personally
overall for the amp I feel it's a BM
what about you Sean would you agree with
me that's kind of like right there in
the middle of the road I mean it's not a
Mesa obviously but the clean channels do
kind of sound you know that good you
know I think it's a nice foundation
alone it's definitely dynamic it's got
great cleans and it's got a good decent
gain channel but it's something you
could definitely build off of yeah the
clean Channel I have to say about this
particular app is very very nice and
something I want to just touch upon real
quickly before we close up the video is
that our particular chain is just the
guitar which is a nice Jackson nice
fuchsia Jackson we're going into the
tube stream of the 808 and into the app
and you guys in the video saw will we
mostly through the whole video just use
the amp itself and its raw tone with no
effects no pedals nothing else except
when we got into all the unclean stuff
now as far as the unclean stuff I
thought it was fluffy a little bit muddy
and not really as tight as me as a metal
guy would really want what about you
yeah I think it's pretty par for the
course as a metal guitar player I like a
really tight tight gain sound it's
nothing that an easy overdrive pedal
can't fix but I mean what about if
you're just like a guy who does rock if
you do rock or you do like just like you
know even pop stuff actually this amp
would be really good for that right
dirty blues anything like that
well blues yeah definitely blues yeah if
you add like a nice like chai me like
pedals like a delay and maybe a little
reverb you can get this thing to really
shine in the clean chose I mean if I was
just gonna rake the amp on the clean
channel alone I would probably give the
amp an a where I say the amps of beach I
think you agree with me like we talked
about is that for a metal guy I'm
from a metal aspect because we play in a
metal band you guys have heard our music
we're metal guys now that's not the only
opinion and the end all of everything
though right I mean yeah cuz like if you
were in a different band you weren't
playing metal you probably like hey no
this amp firm non non high game modern
metal I think it's a hundred percent
usable out of the box it could use a
little love for modern metal but yeah
but that's you know but how many of you
guys out there actually play modern
metal there's not that many people so if
you're a person out there and you just
play even just regular metal 80s metal
that type of stuff or you play rock or
blues or any that type of stuff this is
a very all-around amp plus it's not just
the same old thing let's just face it
we've all seen a billion amps from all
the major companies how often do you
really see an amp that's handmade at the
bottom of volcano and Panama that's one
of the you know the really nice things
that I think about this amp it's
interesting because everything else you
know made in China made here you have
super high end amps it's you settle
their places but not really something
like this so at the end of the day I
give it overall Abbey Sean you agree
with that as well yeah definitely it's
definitely a B amp as far as I'm
concerned but you can get it for a
really low price they have a stock B
stock items and also one thing I didn't
talk about is behind me what we use for
our cab on this particular cab I believe
they're not selling anymore they're
selling a cab kind of like it this is a
Prometheus cab and I personally love it
because it has two different types of
speakers in it you have 50 Hertz in the
bottom 75 Hertz at the top so at the
bottom they're like vintage 30 speakers
and at the top they're like a link Oh
blue speakers and you can either set it
to bright you can set it to normal or
you can set it to bass so you can set it
to where you're just using the bottom
speaker you're using just the top
speaker or using both speakers in
combination which is what we did today
so I'm Eric this is Shawn Hernandez Sean
thank you for coming to the show we can
shake hands or do fist bumps or do back
slaps um you know whatever we want to do
we can do the Three Stooges thing
anyways see you guys later we'll have
links below top this type of stuff so if
you guys want to get yourself an app
like this then you can do so we'll see
you guys back here on ticking tomorrow
say good bye good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
