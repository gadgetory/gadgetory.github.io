welcome back to tech tomorrow we bring
you all the tech all the time now check
this out when we were at CES we got a
full demo by Gabe rushan of swiftech
where he told us all the cool things
about their new h 2 20 all-in-one liquid
cooler now one of the few things about
this thing that makes it stand out from
others is this is an all-in-one plus a
custom all and one as well it's bridging
the gap between closed loop and non
closed loop which means this thing comes
close loop you can keep it running for
three years to the liquids in it or you
can take the thing apart and change it
around and build your own custom design
now one of the great things about this I
want to talk about right off the bat is
that this thing was really designed to
be inaudible it was designed to be
completely quiet and still bring you
great cooling can you turn up the fan
and crank it up and make it louder and
get a little bit better results yes you
can we'll talk about that in the outro
but for now check it out I've got the
retail box right here now few folks out
there who've been asking me vitamin tlie
when is this going to be available well
I have it confirmed on March third these
things will be hitting swiftech in long
beach california and then out to the
places to buy them so very very soon so
with that said let's jump in let's check
out the retail box and let's talk about
this product let's go all right folks
like every good unboxing and everything
we're going to start by looking at the
box right here we can see swiftech has a
three-year warranty we can see the dual
120 millimeter helix fans right there
the nice black tubing you can see once
again it says in the box design too low
to inaudible operating noise which means
made to be really really quiet now
another thing is that people think that
liquid cooling is very very hard to do
it's not hard to do it all in fact with
these closed loop systems it's easier
than even using air clean what you're
talking with this little pop in Intel
things so here's the front of the box
you can see it's compatible with
everything by Intel everything by AMD on
the box ready to rock and roll
going to flip it around her to the side
we're here we have some of the important
aspects of this so number one truly low
too comfortable audio bowl noise levels
2 x 120 millimeter helix pwm fans rated
at sixteen to thirty three DBA each to
substantially better thermal performance
than high-end air coolers and or
competing all-in-one liquid cooling
systems to 120 millimeter copper fen and
brass tubes radiator hi hydraulic power
pwm adjustable pump state-of-the-art
micro pin copper cold plate large
diameter flexible tubing for optimal
flow rate means everything's going to
flow if they're nice and easy cuz it's a
nice a big diameter plug and pay
configurations out of the box factory
prefilled and pre configured for easy
installation that will get you up and
running in minutes and that is actually
very very true or going to be talking
that later to fully expandable system
for add-on components unlike other
prefilled system that are sealed for
life our radiator features a fill port
that lets you add coolant and or tubing
can be easily replaced either to change
its link and or add components for
example be able to graph here it's
probably going to be hard to see our
pump is also powerful enough to drive
several additional water blocks without
suffering noticeable performance loss
which means you can do two radiators
other parts all off the one pump good
stuff so you can easily expand your
system to a full liquid-cooled system
loop including water blocks for graphics
chipsets or MOSFETs with minimum effort
or knowledge number five minimum
maintenance if you use your LCS strictly
a ship we recommend that you check the
fluid level approximately every three
years that means if you take this thing
out of the box stick it on your computer
for three years nothing to worry about
total control your system performance
and noise levels using the built-in bios
temperature controller all you need to
plug is your LCS to the motherboard cpu
fan connector and either lets the
motherboard manage the speed
automatically or you can find to it to
the level that you feel comfortable with
bakes it is a part in here that you can
cook up all the fans to connect it to
your motherboard and then control
everything from the bios so that's
pretty much all the good stuff on the
back it shows the dimensions i'll put
this around
over on the swiftech website you'll see
that this thing will fit just about
every case out there and there are a few
out there that doesn't fit but many of
the larger cases will definitely
accommodate this very easily so now
let's go ahead and let's get it out of
the box and take a look what comes in
the retail package so right here in the
front pop that open little thing here on
top go ahead and remove that call bomb
Kabam you can see the unit inside the
box the tubing and everything so we will
go ahead and just take this out the
whole thing easily comes out so I'm
going to take all this stuff out and
then remove the box out of the picture
hand it off to the cameramen and then
let's check it out so you can see
basically everything's in this big thing
are here on my right hand but let's talk
about some of the other stuff so retail
box the user's manual this is going to
tell you how to install it how to work
at how to take it apart how to expand it
how to do whatever your little heart
desires there are great instructions in
there by the way the people at swiftech
have taking a lot of time to make sure
that everything is very correctly
written out for you so when you look at
your like what the hell am i doing
you're like oh okay that makes sense
which it should and it does nexium book
here's all the other different stuff now
this right here is the pwm controller i
was talking about few folks let's go
ahead and take this out of here now you
have the one that goes to your
motherboard to your power be very
careful when you plug this in some
people have just shoved stuff in there
you can bend the pins and it won't work
correctly then you have all your fans
connect to this and then you can
actually control all those fans directly
through the motherboard BIOS next step
all the screws more screws additional
mounting stuff is in here pull this
thing out of here lots of stuff that's
in here making this up
here we go these are additional mounting
hardware the screws the washers all that
kind of stuff that's all the accessories
stuff so we'll get that out of the way
move out of the way nothing else in
there okay now let's move on so right
off the bat go ahead and pull this off
of here kaboom here is the pump you can
see it looks very cool very suitable you
swivel very easily for you so basically
folks it would be like this just show
you guys this so basically this will
plug into this you guys are going to
know you're going to say I shake I know
I do I've advanced diabetes I'm sorry
but sometimes I shake so this is going
to plug into this all of these are going
to plug in to your system and then this
will plug into your motherboard so all
your system fans your unit and then to
the motherboard set that aside
underneath you guys can see the copper
block one of the mounting hardware is
already mounted on here black tubes let
me go ahead and take the radiator out of
here now a lot of these kits that you
get the fans aren't matted but here the
fans are mounted the cables all around
here let me get my hand out of the way
there here are the pw connectors right
here you can see the dual helix fans ear
120-millimeter here's the rad whoops try
to throw anything off there so here's
the rad
so you basically get the whole unit all
the instruction guide all the mounting
hardware everything that a growing boy
needs to watercool is CB you all right
folks so there it is everything that
comes in the retail package of the new
swiftech h220 now like I said this
thing's 139 dollars that's very
reasonable considering the performance
that you're going to get now a lot of
people out there going to go oh wow how
does it work I'm going to tell you right
now the swiftech h220 and test you guys
can glide and look all over the internet
because there's reviews all over the
place i'll put some in the link in
description below but basically the only
thing that's beating this is the new
crackin now the new crackin also has its
fans turned up to really really loud so
it sounds like a jet plane and it's much
bigger limiting how many systems it can
go in now the Swift tech product is
beating all the others if you don't
believe me go check out online this
isn't me saying it it's the other
reviewers out there on the web they're
saying it so that's pretty much it this
thing when it comes like i said is
geared to be very very quiet so you pull
out of the box and you hook it up you're
barely going to be able to hear it now
if you want to turn the fan up to get
better performance though you can but
you'll be sacrificing a little bit of
the noise level now another big myth
water cooling is hard to do total myth
I'm not even joking I know you're
getting some crazy comments below but
trust me there are a lot of things out
there Silver Arrow is one of them try
installing the Silver Arrow and then
come back and try to install the
swiftech h220 you'll be bald if you try
to do that one in this one you love your
full head of hair still it's very very
simple you just pop it on the back plate
screw the four screws in and that's all
there is to the mounting nothing else
now obviously you're going to have to
mount it inside of your case and all
that stuff now few people out there
there's a website out there called
Martin's liquid labs I want to give that
guy a shattered he has a really really
excellent job and he has a video up
showing how to install the new swiftech
h220 very simply and easily so i'm going
to have the link to that in the
description below as well so you guys
can go over and check it out where he
shows you actually have
to install this if you guys want more
information also before i get my reviews
up go out and look around the web and
see what people have to say about the
swiftech h220 it's very simple to use
very quiet under normal circumstances
you want to overclock and turned up
you've got some performance ratios you
can go there but generally you're only
going to get a few degrees you know
above ambient temperature in your house
that's just how it is it's not you're
going to put a water cooler on you know
your house is 75 degrees and you're
going to have your cool running at 65
degrees it's not going to happen if it's
75 degrees in your house you're going to
be lucky if you get your computer
running at 79 80 degrees that's just how
it is so if you guys want to check
things out look at the link in
description below go check out Martin's
liquid labs where he shows you guys how
to install this thing very very simply
where anybody can go hey I understand
that like usual I hope you guys like
this video if so hit that like button
and show me some love and if you're not
subscribed please do so so you don't
miss out on all the cool here on
tech of tomorrow see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
