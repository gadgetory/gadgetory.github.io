noise whatsoever there's absolutely
really nothing on the back of the box so
with that said let's move on all right
folks we got the Box open right here so
real quick i'll just pop this thing open
right here because this actually has a
lot of the stuff custom pick keycaps
multimedia keys to control audio
functions and it also says you can use
these on the fly because that's who be
normal USB hubs for installing other USB
devices gaming speed 8 times quicker
military-grade cables thousand Hertz
pauling rate gold-plated brown cherry
switches
like I said before 15 million keystrokes
and it has a ps2 adapter for any key
role / eliminates ghost keys you guys

keys many times you want and it's not
