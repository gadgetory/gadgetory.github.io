every day asking me why I shake and do
all these different things so I thought
I'd bring you a little bit of stuff
about myself that obviously a lot of you
people don't know those who've you been
following from other boards org you guys
kind of know my history and stuff but
for those of you who don't
I probably should just let you know who
I am where I come from and like why
things are the way they are for those of
you who follow me back at motherboards I
don't you guys know I start out as a
writer a long time ago worked for PC
Magazine for a long time
worked for PC extreme just had a bunch
of enthusiasts PC enthusiasts magazine
I've done a bunch of writing for years
and years and years until I actually met
Jonathan from TLD which I met him about
12 years ago and since that time we
worked together and did a lot of
different stuff prior to him having the
challenge he's actually the person who
pushed me into YouTube so for anybody
out that for some reason Phil's thinks
that I got fired from other boards that
are you couldn't be clear how can you
fire me from a company that is my
fucking company
it's not happening those guys tried to
screw me around and do the content and
take my money and if you guys have been
around you know the motherboards arc
hasn't done shit in fucking years
nothing no videos no nothing I won the
court battles I got the money they got
to maintain the name because in all I
see they did pay us a lot of money to
get the name so our business deal with
them was they got the name we work
together in a partnership and they
developed the business well the only
thing they ever did was take money from
the business development never happened
so the whole thing broke up but around
that same time I got sick with chest
cancer so I had cancer for a few years
do you guys would have seen me actually
before this time I had long hair all the
way down to here full head of hair and I
was in a heavy metal band and that was
my whole spiel my whole thing got cancer
lost all my head so I started shaving my
head bald because it was just easier
then sitting there watch myself get sick
every time I got injected these
chemicals getting sicker and sicker and
sicker
well I beat the cancer that was okay
right sure cool we all think so right
but then right after that I find it I'm
diabetic and my doctor pretty much told
me the most unlucky son of a bitch in
the planet because he was like cancer I
can cure diabetes not so much I'll be
honest with you guys I'm a sugar freak I
love sugar I love to sort of pop I'll
admit it I don't like chocolate that
much so which the people I think it's
weird I don't like chocolate I love Ruby
things though man you mean it as fruit
in it like I love it anything baked with
fruit that's totally my thing I love
that kind of stuff so being a diet
Bedok those two things don't go too you
know hand-in-hand so once I got diabetic
I started getting really really sick so
during the time that I got sick I really
didn't take care of myself I mean it's
my fault and I've learned a lot of
lessons since then but I ended up
getting both my feet amputated you guys
can see right here that I no longer have
any toes I have feet that are about you
know a couple inches long and the
problem with that sub is my feet get dry
if you get a cut the cut canal most
likely to get more stuff because if you
get a foot ulcer anybody others diabetic
knows what this is it's the most
likelihood of you getting your shit
chopped off and getting you're losing
more of your leg very very very very
high luckily I haven't got past that I
still had my legs I'm trying to maintain
myself now one of the main questions
that I get though all the time my
channel is Hey Dude are you okay you
were shaking when I was in the hospital
they couldn't put a regular IV into my
arm my vein did collapse collapsed
excuse me completely so I did this thing
called a PICC line well when they put
the PICC line into me they stuck it into
my heart piercing my heart and it caused
severe nerve damage
it makes me shake all the time took me
years to even learn how to hold my
guitar right it was really an ordeal if
I wouldn't assign that little waiver
saying hey no matter how we fuck you up
everything's dandy on our side
you know things would be a lot different
I could have sued these jerk-offs but no
they always make sure you sign a waiver
signing your life away and doing that
they gave me permanent nerve damage it
makes me sweat it makes me shake it all
in all is just a really really really
bad experience I'm just telling you guys
that the right now if you have to have
diabetes you know exactly what I'm
talking about it's a hard road having
that and then doing with this nerve
damage on top of that I shake all of the
time in fact my doctors have told me a
few times that they don't even think
I'll live many more years so for a long
time it isn't my channel like you know a
lot of people leave comments say oh you
know hey man you knew your channel is
dying my channel is like dying it's more
like I'm dying that's really what it's
more about my body is starting to fail
on me more and more and more so if
you're a fan of the channel I can tell
you right now you probably won't see me
for too many more years I really don't
think I'm going to live probably more
than five more years my health is bad I
can barely sometimes get up to do these
videos for you guys like a lot of times
to film it and he's got to wait just so
I can crawl it Abed and do these videos
I'm in a lot of pain because the
diabetes it's honestly hard for me to
wake up and focus it makes my vision
blurry just all-in-all a bad bad scene
so few guys that they're always asking
those questions that's what's going on
with me personally a lot of people don't
really know what's going on but those
are the things that are happening in my
life the nerve damage the diabetes and
plus let's just face it I'm no longer a
spring chicken I'm 52 years old now and
I'm getting older and as I get older my
health starts to fade a little bit more
and I know sometimes I make a little
mistake here and there I try to bring
you guys the absolute best things but
I've never honestly claimed anybody out
there that I'm like a professor of tech
or like I'm the most knowledgeable guru
in the world you've never heard me say
that I don't you know bring that to the
table because I'm just a guy who likes
computers and stuff like that I used to
be the most hardcore gamer in the world
I played games like literally night and
day my wife used to be pissed off at me
all the time about it my son was the
same way for years he's finally now
growing out of that and not doing that
but before my son Erin that's all he did
was play computer games 24/7 he didn't
give a shit about his job that's all he
really did and now he's finally groomed
was like okay but for me it wasn't
really about growing up and out of
gaming my vision just got so bad for the
diabetes that looking at monitors that
only had 60 Hertz I would play a video
game for about a half an hour and then
literally be throwing up we had this VR
thing oh if you guys saw it in house you
brought this VR thing we brought a
couple in the table each one of those VR
things juice the Cameron he sits back
there and plays them like all day long
he's like whoopee I played for 35
minutes I flew up everywhere and had a
headache for almost eight hours
afterwards so my vision from a diabetes
and stuff doesn't doesn't allow me to
sit in front of a computer and play for
as many hours as I like to believe me
I'd like to be sitting in front of my
computer every time that nobody's here
just playing computer games but now I
get an hour maybe two hours then I still
start not really feeling too good that's
even on the fastest monitors out there
so I just want to know that for you fans
out there was stuck with me all these
years I love you guys I appreciate you
guys you guys know that I've given tons
of stuff over the years away to you
folks trying to just make you know some
people out there get cool stuff but at
the end of the day I'm just a guy I
you guys know I have serious health
issues with everything's going on with
me my amputation my diabetes the nerve
damage it's honestly hard for me to be
you know obviously the most you know
outgoing and every day making videos but
we're trying our best for you folks so
if you have questions about me those are
things you probably have never known
about so I appreciate you guys watching
the channel I love to see you guys on
here
hopefully I'll live long enough to see
when VR actually is really VR because
let's just face it VR is really just 3d
gaming isn't it I mean let's face it all
the games in the past they called 3d
gaming was not 3d now we have 3d gaming
and they call it VR that's life
thanks for watching the channel I love
you folks see you guys back on ER if you
have any questions more please leave a
comment down below I'd be more than
happy to answer any of your questions
you guys have so that you guys can get
to know me better so peace out I'm
Network you've been watching taken
