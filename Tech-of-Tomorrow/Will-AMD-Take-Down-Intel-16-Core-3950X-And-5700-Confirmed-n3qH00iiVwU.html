tomorrow we are continuing our coverage
of e3 now AMD dropped quite a few
bombshells at Computex 2019 and they
actually drop some new ones at e3 as
well now the first part of the AMD
presentation was pretty much a refresh
of their copy text 2019 conference in
which they were showing off their new
rise in CPU line so that was really
nothing new although they did show a
couple of benchmarks that they didn't
show at Computex they showed a Division
two benchmark with the rise in 939
hundred X versus the Intel Core I nine
and ninety nine hundred K at 1440p now
both of these CPUs are about the same
price which is around the $500 price
point you guys can see that 3900 X was
keeping up with the nine nine hundred
and K right up until they switched to
the streaming demo and at 1080 with the
slow OBS quality preset the i99 900k
shows unbearable stuttering while the
3900 X was as smooth as hot melted
butter sometimes it almost makes you
feel bad for Intel almost then they
moved on to a graph of the rise in 738
under X versus the i7 9700 K and even
though it didn't beat the Intel CPU at
every game it wasn't very far behind now
the 3800 X is $399 while the 9700 K
comes in at just over $400 once again
AMD's looking good they've been
announced they're lower in CPU line
which they forgot to mention at Computex
for some reason but this is the rise in
v 3600 which has a 4.7 gigahertz boost
3.6 gigahertz base 65 watts of TDP and
comes in at a whopping 199 and also the
rise in 530 600 X with a 4.4 gigahertz
boost a 3.8 gigahertz base 95 TDP and
coming in at 249 dollars now both these
CPUs also have six cores and twelve
threads AMD also showed us a graph of
the rise in 530 600 X keeping up with
$54 eye 590 600 K along with the csgo
1440p demo where both CPUs were
performing about the same now we're
finally going to get to the heart of the
matter and after a short little video
spot dr. Lisa came out with the new
Radeon rx 5700 XT card which looks just
slightly different than there are other
cards a fan on the right side with a
Radeon logo on the left nothing new here
really and then finally what we've all
been waiting for drumroll please the
actual specs of the rx 5700 X T now this
GPU is going to contain 40 compute units
up to nine point seven teraflops eight
gigabytes of gddr5 megahertz boost clock
seventeen hundred and fifty five
megahertz game clock this is pretty much
the average game speed that you're going
to see during gameplay and also a
sixteen hundred and five megahertz base
clock they also showed us some specs in
the design of the card as well the card
has an aluminum alloy shroud and
backplate optimized airflow and
acoustically tuned contoured design with
vapor chamber cooling it also offers a
very efficient heat diffusion with a
graphite thermal interface material it
has one single 8 pin connector a single
6 pin power connector and a 7 phase
digital power system making it ready to
overclock right out of the box and all
of this is coming in wait for it 450
dollars about a hundred bucks less than
the art CX 2070 which it's aimed to
compete at AMD then showed off World War
Z benchmark comparing those two cars
with the 5700 XT coming in at 170 frames
per second and the RT X 27 at 102 frames
per second then they showed us a graph
of the 5700 XT almost beating the RT X
27 and 10 other games and only in two
games did the RT X actually win but only
by about one and three percent so it's
definitely looking like Andy has finally
made a GPU that compete with the RT X
family we'll have to see when they get
these cards in our
they actually do what they say but let's
hope they do AMD also announced the
Radeon rx 5700 which has 36 compute
units up to 7.9 teraflops eight
gigabytes of GDR six up to a seven
hundred and twenty five megahertz boost
clock a sixty 125 megahertz game clock
of fourteen sixty five megahertz base
clock and this card's gonna be coming
into market at under $400 at 379 they
showed the 5700 off with Apex Legends
pitting it against the RT X 2060 which
comes in at about three hundred and
seventy dollars the rx 5700 got 88
frames per second and the RT X 2060 at
72 frames per second and of course they
showed us a graph where the rx 3,700
beats the RT X 2060 and ten 1440p games
having anywhere from two to 21% better
performance across the board but the
good news is is that both these cards
and all of their new CPUs will be out on
July 7th AMD also announced fidelity FX
a game developer toolkit which pretty
much adds a little extra detail to any
game with fidelity FX support and with
games that have not adopted fidelity FX
they announced AMD Radeon image
sharpening which has similar effects to
fidelity FX and virtually no performance
hits according to the graphs that we
were shown another feature AMD announced
was Radeon anti-lag new features that
reduce lag time between your GPU and
monitor they showed up a demo of the RT
X 27 with a latency of 59 milliseconds
against the rx 5700 XT which had a
latency of about 44 milliseconds AMD
also announced that when you buy a 5700
series GPU or select rise in CPUs you'll
get the Xbox game pass where you can
play Gears 5 and hundreds of other games
they also showed us gear 5 footage and
gameplay on an AMD powered PC system and
pretty much just talked about new
features like adaptive shading and
real-time rendering in the new gears 5
game
and this game does look pretty cool and
I'm kind of looking forward to playing
it Borderlands 3 was also showcased
showing us the difference between
standard and HDR and the use of fidelity
FX which improves image quality without
giving a performance now the game
developer platform unity came out and
talked about new upcoming features they
showed off a demo that was rendered in
real time using unity they also showed
off their upscaling abilities with a
1440 image up scaled to 4k using
contrast adaptive shading and compared
to a 4k rendered image it looked almost
identical
it looks like AMD and Ubisoft for
working together again this time on
Ghost Recon breakpoint and they also
gave us a first look of the game on a PC
with the RS 3700 series GPU and the
scenery looked pretty damn awesome now
after the Ubisoft presentation dr. Lisa
came out again and she was handed an
actual superhero figure of guess what
herself hmm I wonder where I can get one
of those also announced was the rx 5700
xt 50th anniversary edition which has 40
compute units 10.14 teraflops 8
gigabytes of GDR 6 a 1980 megahertz
boost 1830 megahertz game clock and a 16
80 megahertz base clock and this card is
also going to be priced at $500 just $50
more than the regular edition the last
announcement of the show was a new CPU
called the Rison 939 50x now this has a
whopping 16 cores and 32 threads with a
4.7 gigahertz boost 3.5 gigahertz base
72 megabytes of total cache 105 Watts
TDP and it's going to be priced at about
750 bucks
which will be available this September
now this actually pushes AMD into new
areas because this TPU is a little bit
pricey but it does however look like
it's got a lot under the hood AMD also
played a TV spot showing off the 39 50 X
and they did this with record-breaking
results in Cinebench r15 this is
the 16 core test it scored five thousand
four hundred and thirty four in
Cinebench are 20 which is the sixteen
core test it scored twelve thousand one
hundred and sixty-seven and in Geekbench
for multi-thread sixteen core it scored
65 thousand four hundred and ninety nine
so even though AMD start off the show a
little slow by the end of the show AMD
announced some really cool stuff that
i'm sure all kinds of gamers around the
world are waiting for like usual we'll
have more information about this video
down below so you can click on those
links and get more information and
prepare to spend your money when AMD
releases all this stuff on the 7th i
mark you guys been watching tekken
tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
from war tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
