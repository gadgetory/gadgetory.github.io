day means more Tech this time the tech
however is on the audio side of things a
little bit different but still that tech
of tomorrow good and yummy flavor you
love to have in your belly all day mmm
delicious
tech now you guys follow the challenge
you guys know that for years I've been
building up my audio stuff we've been
recording songs buying guitars recording
guitars just doing music crazily and
crazily and crazily and one of the major
companies that we've always dealt with
has been Sweetwater and the reason that
we've dealt with Sweetwater
is that they've always done a great job
taking care of us currently our main man
is AJ Becerra but we've had a few guys
before him and honestly all of them have
been great if you want the best customer
service you want to make sure that when
you get your product that there's gonna
be a company backing this product up
Sweetwater is definitely the company
that you guys that should be checking
out they have payment plans you can make
a few payments get your goods you can
have your equipment in your hand already
before you pay for it which can be a lot
of a lot of fun just make those payments
so if you guys out there who know about
them you know what I'm talking about if
you're considering using gear you guys
should definitely though
check out Sweetwater and see what they
have to offer because I've never had a
bad experience with them and when your
equipment goes down you don't want to be
standing around your thumb in your butt
going oh my god what am I gonna do you
want your studio up and running and
these guys will work with you now and
that same note I was contacted by
Steinberg and one of their agencies and
they said hey would you like to work in
conjunction with Sweetwater and do an
unboxing of this brand new product that
we're releasing onto the market the you
are arty - and I was like well hell's to
the yes I want to see this product I
love our your stuff audio stuff yeah
back off it's mine all right
now with that said though essentially
what you have with the you are our t2 is
a 24 bit 192 kilohertz USB 2 interface
now this interface though is unlike
interfaces that you've seen in the past
because da da da it has Rupert Neve
technology built inside of it now some
people out there probably going Eric who
the hell is this Rupert Neve guy well
Rupert Neve is a guy who spent most of
his life making and building hand wired
consoles transformers everything around
the music industry and it's some of the
most sought-after stuff in the world the
80 series itself probably there's
nothing that can touch it on the planet
as far as warmth and just natural
sounding stuff and having Rupert Neve
technology built into this little unit
that comes to market at under $400 is
actually pretty amazing stuff if you
guys are musicians out there and you
like wonder who the heck that is look it
up because there's a lot of people out
there who know who Rupert Neve is and
what he's like brought over into the
domain of music and it hasn't been you
know a little bit it's been a lot so
let's first see what's inside the box
and then let's talk a little bit more
about the features and design of the you
are arty to buy Steinberg so for those
of you are into the hardcore unboxings
let's take a look at the bots itself
just so we don't miss anything so here's
the front of the box just telling you a
little bit about what it is talking
about Rupert Neve once again on the side
of the box right here see you de lot of
different things the Yamaha deep
breathand root and 92 kilohertz all the
stuff we already talked about but this
unit also does come with a lot of no
latency effects that come free inside of
the box along with the software so it'll
be pretty cool to play with down the
road the back of the box just a bunch of
different stuff showing you exactly
we're pretty much we're gonna be talking
about in the video but it's all laid out
here for those people who are out there
now shopping going hey what do I really
want to buy this what the hell does this
damn thing do okay so there's that
so we spin it around here just go ahead
and pop cap on the top we see the power
cable just go ahead and get all this
stuff out of here few folks and see it
really clearly here without destroying
the rest of the house along the way so
inside of here we have the USB interface
and this is great because this thing
wants to keep popping down what's great
about this is it's USB 2.0 it'll work
with Windows 7 sp1 all the way up to the
latest Windows will work with all the
Mac stuffs you don't have to worry about
what kind of computer you have ax
actually something I think is really
cool everything else in here the audio
interface manual
much all your documentation odd stuff is
right here on the side over here see
we've got the power cable the charging
station made for us which is where we
are so that's a good thing and that get
that other way
I believe all the trim to be left in
here is going to be the unit and some
thing I want to tell you guys about the
unit as well is this thing is not some
lightweight product you clear all this
stuff out of here for you folks this is
not a lightweight unit I mean you can
hear this thing is made of solid steel
man I mean it is seriously made like a
tank let me go ahead and pull it out of
there
take a look we'll take a look at the top
real quick you can see that everything's
laid out very easy for you to see very
very easy for you to see although in a
way this is kind of crazy it kinda would
have been better on the back but I think
it's probably there is what we haven't
got that far but this is kind of cool
too because let's face it how many times
you're using your unit and you like want
to go and do something back there but
you don't know what you're doing and one
of the reasons why this is really cool
is the phantom power so this has phantom
power plus 48 volts now my only cavity
is I wish it would have been on the
front of the machine I think it would a
little bit a little bit better but since
they haven't marked it won't be that
hard to you know to touch on - it's
really really made of solid steel now in
the front we have the USB a little light
right there that tells that you're
plugged in now there's two plugins in
the front this one doubles as a high
ziane Alosi this one's just standard low
Z so you can plug your guitar into here
you plug your mic into here everything
works really easily just plug it in up
and going you can engage the high Z by
this button right here but only this
particular one in the front here does
high Z now like I said before the
Transformers inside of this unit are the
Yamaha Dupre now these are really good
and warm product on their own but when
you get the Rupert Neve and you add that
which is optional there's two buttons
right here on the front and these
particular two buttons by pushing them
on and off engage or disengage the
Rupert Neve so if you really like the
way the Rupert Neve sounds on something
you like hey I
I have it well then hey push that button
if you're not really happy with it well
then turn it off your gain and
everything is located very easily right
here on the front you have your
headphones you have your output mix here
and your phone's volume here very easy
to use very straight ahead interface so
on the back you have the power on button
you have the power connection the USB
2.0 like I said the phantom power is
here you also have MIDI connect
abilities
you also have MIDI connectivity as well
back here so if you want to do something
with MIDI you can do that as well so
lots of great options you have your main
outputs these are going out to your
studio monitors and then you also have
two more line inputs here on the back
and last but not least on the bottom
there are a little rubber feet so it
keeps the unit from sliding around
now also inside the box you get all the
software like I said that you can use to
get up and going whether you have a Mac
with you have a PC it doesn't matter
what you have they include the software
do at least get you up and going so you
can be playing with the unit the day
that you get it well unless for some
reason you just don't have a computer so
at the end of the day here is my
breakdown of the you are RT to now let's
just put this in perspective Rupert Neve
is a guy who spent his whole life
hand-building consoles and transformers
making them the most ultimate thing in
the world and at this point if you
wanted to get one of those consoles of
the 80 series you'd have to be like you
know super duper rich like Dave Grohl to
be able to get your hands on one and
this particular market drops the market
at three hundred and forty-nine dollars
so for $349 for a desktop user this
product is pretty amazing the fact that
it comes with all the different types of
software you need to get started whether
you're on a Mac of PC whether you're
using a tablet or whether using an
iPhone it's all there making it so that
you can really simply integrate this you
know interface into your life the Rupert
Neve technology IDEs have Stressless is
just amazing and the fact that you can
change between the Yamaha Dupre and them
gives you the option to the option
excuse me of being able to change your
sound focus so you can
have them on or you can have them off
now me personally for vocals and stuff
like that the Neve stuff is just
unbelievable it adds warmth it adds
clarity it just makes things sound
really great for a guitars and stuff
though I found that the the Yamaha you
know the deep freeze they were actually
great and worked just perfect for that
and I didn't really see that much of a
difference but there's lots of options
inside this little unit comes everything
need to get you up and going and here's
what's really cool okay you guys saw
when I got that Universal arrow product
and how much of a pain in the butt it
was to try to get that USB type-c card
to work in any system it was just a
frickin nightmare check it out this
product is USB and it's type 2 USB so
it'll work with pretty much anything out
there you're not going to worry I
probably am I gonna plug this thing and
freak it out and the spec requirements
aren't that good I'm excuse me aren't
then imma it's not that good they're not
super duper high the requirements for
you to be able to run this on the PC are
pretty pretty low spec actually all
things considered so with this
particular device you could probably
build a PC not the greatest PC in the
world but you could probably have your
entire music studio up and running with
this device speakers and everything for
about $1500 and you're gonna be right
off the bat going with great stuff plus
it'll work with any of the software that
is out there through ASIO so it doesn't
matter whatever you know software that
you're using it's going to work right in
with that perfectly for people out there
who love Steinberg software I'm going to
be trying to work with them and see we
can get a copy of that and check that
out as well I've always heard great
things about it I've just never
personally used it myself before so I
want to thank Sweetwater once again for
sending this product out letting us
check it out thank you very much guys
we'll have a link down below where you
guys can buy this for yourself but
honestly at the end of the day at 349
dollars the URR t2 is a serious editor's
choice across the board</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
