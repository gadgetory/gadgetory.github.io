to a rock condition of tech of tomorrow
we're going to talk about AMD's rising
CPU so let's go with a little song shall
we hey em he is risin hey ma'am
ye in yo face hey em C in risin hey em
he will win this day so let me unplug my
guitar real quick early turn the volume
down all right just a quick improv on
AMD funk just you know thoughts go out
it's okay alright everybody so now that
we got the guitar equipment out of the
way we tried to film with a goal but it
started going I have a tampon like
almost literally I had it 110 if it
could have gone to 11 I would have
turned that to 11th and none of
this will go to 11 but 10 was my maximum
so first off before we again let's talk
about the AMD rise and all stuff about
it let's first talk about the last video
that I did where some people out there
seem to be very offended by some of the
things I said and didn't quite
understand what I was saying first of
all I was giving no hate or any
animosity towards any fans of AMD
whatsoever I'm a fan of AMD I love all
technology as should you
I have no loyalty to any brand so if
you're a brand out there and you think
I'm looking on your ballsack I'm sorry
I'm just not that's not my thing I love
technology
I love Nvidia I love Intel I love course
there I love Kingston I love any company
out there who's pushing technology so if
you have a brand new technological
product and it's badass then I guess you
could say that's what I'm a fan blade of
I'm a fanboy of new technology I don't
give a hell who makes it so let's get
that off the table
I love AMD just as much as anybody else
may make cool stuff I am down that's
what we were to talk about now we got
all of our stuff for doing all of our
testing we even got the test kit from
AMD you can see a little box back there
they only sent me a 1,700 and I bought
the other one so I guess that works out
it would've been cool if they gave them
to me all because I would have been able
give them to you but unfortunately
that's not how it's going to be so I've
watched video you guys have all seen
videos in the test scores from everybody
like we got all of our stuff late you
know that there is an accident we've
worked it out with AMD they finally sent
in my test kit but as far as the scores
go on launch day I got completely
skunked on that which sucks because I
know you guys want to see all my scores
but honestly I've watched so many videos
out there and there are a lot of sites
that I do trust like I trust Paul's
hardware
I trust pit wit like I worked with these
guys these guys are really solid trusted
guys I've never really heard of Jay
doing any crazy stuff like I don't
really know Linus all that well but the
guys that I know in the group that I'm
with that we hang out with like I don't
think any of those guys would honestly
bring you guys dishonest scoring I
really don't I would never do it and I
don't believe they would either now are
there some people who did of course
though I saw even before the launch guys
who had scores up that we're showing you
know the AMD risin going you know
completely above and if CP you could
ever imagine and there were people doing
that but I would never do that but with
that said let's just talk to a quick
about something everybody's talking
about oh my god you know this and that
they're still spreading rumors all in
all the AMD risin is a success it is
success totally so first of all I want
to talk about the processing power
because many people they play games but
they don't really think about a lot of
the other things that they're doing on
their computer they take that for
granted and they're just like oh yeah it
runs so whatever but when it comes to
doing content creation this means doing
all your videos editing music doing all
of that stuff the Rison is an
unbelievable hands-down huge
success the only thing that can really
kick its ass the 6950 that cost a
ton of more money anything that Intel's
got anywhere near the price range AMD is
just straight-up it's kicking its ass
it's just this that's the way it is so
if you're like if you happen to be an
Intel fanboy and you don't care about
anything else that you're fanboy ism
then I'm sure you just be like ass
whatever but the numbers they don't lie
you know content creation is a lot more
important you think as when I say that
that's like doing any type of thing you
could be editing you could be playing
with music you could be listening to
music being on the internet and just
doing all kinds of things and the more
your CPU can handle all that stuff the
better your system is going to be so
right off the bat as far as the CPU
being a
please success you know that it is the
1700 is a great price point you can get
that thing for $329 it comes with its
pan so that's obviously going to be the
entry level for people who want to jump
in and get a rise in CPU and they just
want to have it now
that's it some people say that the eyes
that excuse me the 7-series Pat one more
time the five series and the three
series are really going to be where the
sweet spot set but for right now just
for raw horsepower and doing everything
hey
the seven series of AMD's Rison are
doing very kick-ass thumbs up I got a
hand to him it's a cool thing there's
really no disputing it I don't care who
you like so let's just get that gone now
as far as gaming goes okay Nvidia and
their GPU Department and a and B and
their CPU department are also having
problems in the 1080i resolution don't
ask me why there's just like bottleneck
stuff going on with one the other one
doesn't support it that well
but let's talk about 4k gaming now I
know a lot of people out there don't
have a ton of money and they just
can't go blow money and spend money to
get you know the best of the best so
with that said are a few frames per
second like in gaming and doing gaming
really mean all that to you and if you
don't have a 4k monitor you honestly
plan on getting a 4k monitor because
let's just kind of break this out if
you're a 1080 monitor guy you've only
got a 1080p monitor that's all you've
got the rise ins not going to be that
great of a thing for you it's not going
to be really competitive against Intel
they're going to be kind of you know
getting their butt kick honestly that's
just in 1080 but if you haven't a 4k
monitor and all that stuff well there's
only actually a few frames per second
maybe five Payton to me that's really
not a big deal to say oh you know what
I'm going to go spend more money on it
and tell CPU just buy it just for those
frames per second it makes absolutely no
sense to me now as things improve around
the CPU because AMD see Felix's face it
it's brand-new optimization will keep
coming as well as a 1080i everything is
going to keep advancing as we go down
the line so obviously it's going to get
a even better as we go along so as they
release the 5 Series in the 3 Series
hopefully when they do that they'll have
been fixing all the problems are in it
and you'll get your absolute best
performance that
so at the end of the day I have to say
that AMD's rise in what I've seen so far
is absolutely cool it's fitting the
price is $500 it's not their most
expensive CPU they have ever had they've
had more expensive ones it's right there
in the pocket but if you're a person out
there and you do a lot more computing
than just gaming and you still do 4k
gaming there's really nothing to
complain about honestly probably getting
the realizin CPI was well I'm gonna be
honest with you guys though rolling off
my tongue now that I did my joking thing
about it I always want to say risen I
just do I always want to take it like
they've risen but I'll stick with you
guys and that's is anybody Apso rising
so there we go I'm trying to think what
else I really just want to get across to
you guys so basically if you can
sacrifice a few frames per second in 4k
and your 4k gamer you're good damn go if
you're building a brand new system out
of the barrel you're good to go
also some of the new motherboards
they're coming out you guys can see
there's a bunch of and back behind me
now we're going to do different system
builds like I said all three CPUs don't
really turn my back on you but I got all
three CPUs up here you guys can see the
case back here hopefully you guys can
see it you can see I have various
motherboards from Asus from MSI from
gigabyte so what three different systems
one for the 1800 one for the 1700
alright the X X and then the 1700
vanilla I want to hear from you guys
though is how you want to see these
systems done now obviously we already
have this case for the biggest and
baddest back here we have another case
that's around there somewhere the Shogun
will be doing within that we haven't
actually chose the case for the vanilla
1700 yet so I want to know what you guys
have to say down below for the 1800 X
system what do you guys want to see in a
price range so please leave your
comments below also I'll make a little
poll which you guys can answer later on
the video telling me what you guys want
to see because I actually you guys the
fans and I want to bring you guys with
you guys really want so communicate with
me because I'm not a mind-reader either
of you let's learn together about
everything so that just about wraps it
up folks that is the absolute truth
about AMD's Rison it is a really killer
cpu who really gives a frakkin ass but a
few frames per second now obviously like
I said if you only have a monitor that
does 1080
me well there's really no difference at
that point between hippie Intel and the
Rison at all I mean there's really not
they're going to be pretty much neck and
neck you are going to see a few better
frames per second on the Intel side I'm
to be honest with you about that at the
lower res but hopefully with the
optimizations everything AMD will figure
all these things out so that's the truth
I hope you can hear it and deal with it
I'm Network you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow like usual we'll have links
down below to more information about
this and we'll see you background check
in tomorrow as you start building these
systems and bring lots of scores to the
table with different variations we're
going to be building systems using dual
1080 eyes and SLI and we'll also be
doing them with two of the Red Devils I
got a pair of Red Devil for you to stick
in there so we'll have those in
crossfire when Vega gets here obviously
since everything's cooled AMD you guys
will see Vega here on my channel it will
actually be on time this time so peace
out everybody glad to see you guys here
hope that all reps everything up you
guys are cool because I want to be cool
with you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
