makers of the XP GV 220 800 megahertz
gaming memory good morning everybody
once again welcome back to tech of
tomorrow its launch day that's right the
new geforce gtx 760 from nvidia has hit
the market and we were lucky enough to
get our hands on one really cool card
from the people over at EVGA this is
what their a CX cooling and this is
their superclocked Edition one thing
it's really funny is the lady who was
from UPS who delivered it she called me
on the phone and she's all I'm sure will
you be home because we have a delivery
from F da I was like f up EVGA gotcha
neither thing she was talking about so
with that said let's jump in let's check
this thing out and see what this card's
all about here on launch day alright
folks so let's check it out right the
bat we see two gigabytes g2 the r5 it's
by EVGA obviously not F des we see we
got the EVGA that the number one partner
of Nvidia that's right this thing is a
3-way SLI capabilities you don't get
forward which you have 3-way
superclocked edition and obviously the
name of the card I'm just going to flip
it around let you guys just see the back
of the box just basically shows what the
rear i/o is shows the AC ex cooling you
guys can see right here that's the model
number everything of the card plus its
seal number and all that good stuff
evie JS warranty there mod Riggs EVGA
gaming EVGA so net all that good stuff
precision X that's the overclocking
software and that's pretty much it about
the box so let's just move on a trusty
little knife right here I will make an
incision up here into the plastic and
then go ahead and remove all that stuff
off there for pretty much really much
total true unboxing there right this
thing's completely sealed up right here
on the side we have a little thing I'm
gonna go ahead and just open that right
there
pop the cap take the card out get all
that good stuff out they have a lot of
my stuff in the box and we'll set the
box off to the side so let's start off
right here it looks like we have a giant
poster and those are always cool
clusters are always badass all right
once again we have the game of poem arm
yourself with the EVGA get it a little
bit hard to see with the camera angle
right there because this thing's a giant
size thing and though we're pretty close
to the camera but you guys see that
a nice giant sized poster that's really
cool a lot of people are gonna like that
and cone going through here inside of
here they have a really cool case badge
as well as the drivers CD so check this
out here's the case badge powered by
EVGA try not to get my finger in there
powered by EVGA I'll move past that the
drivers
everything's on this CD right here put
it back in this little plastic package
here we have a warning label and get
that up to you guys right here it's
saying to make sure that you plug the
card in because if you don't well the
card won't run or it'll overheat one of
the other a little bit more about the
nomenclatures a Quick Start Guide
they're important notice the EVGA
GeForce GT except my driver cars a
cutting edge card and ships with the
latest technology including a full UEFI
BIOS so you guys can see all that stuff
there just like a little bit more
information then we have the stickers
that's right so if you're a guy you like
stickers enthusiast built by EVGA bang
TAS that the graphics card users guide
all the information about the cards
inside of here how to hook it up how to
install on your board all but the pin 6
pin power connectors get past that here
go all of our connectors right here so
first off we'll go ahead and we've got
the first of the connectors right here
this is our DVI to VGA connector get
that out of the way hang the next one
out the next one is to molex to 6-pin to
molex 6 pin you got one more right here
go ahead and pull that out of the bag
and that is 2 6 pin 2 8 pin power
adapter cut that one right there and
that's pretty much all the stuff right
there
I'll just put it over here real quick so
you guys can see get the rest that stuff
out of the way that's everything that's
going to come inside the box now let's
actually move on and let's check out the
card so now we see the card is hidden
it's nice little plastic obviously
anti-static
shell casing or they wouldn't put it in
there hard out just get that away for
the moment so let's start off right now
on the front of the card I'll go ahead
and remove the plastic and you guys can
see right in the front this is the EVGA
geforce gtx 760
features they're a 6 cooling to active
fans underneath that we can see all the
fins and there's heat pipes underneath
there as well as i'm sure we'll see more
as we move the card around just flip it
around into the bottom side but you guys
can see a CX active cooling extreme
that's their cooling solution go ahead
and flip it around to the side of the
card to slot design pcie 3.0 interface
flip around show you guys into the card
you can see more of the aluminum heat
fins and actually right here on the side
you can actually see one of the copper
heat pipes as well
spin it around this way I'm gonna spin
the card this way at first here is your
6 pin and your 8 pin power connector
hence with those two little jockey
things they gave us earlier so if
your power supply doesn't have to
support this you can have these two
little plugs right here this one and
this one and then you were up and going
with your old or power supply such a
those are for once again we just see the
name of the card flip it around real
quick
but you guys first see the back of the
card you guys can see these guys use a
complete black PCB not that many people
do that and I know that's a big fan of a
lot of people they really like that up
here on the top go ahead and pull this
tab you see the two sli fingers and like
they said earlier this card can be used
in 3-way SLI configurations no quad so
that's it folks we have actually a lot
more stuff coming here today on launch
