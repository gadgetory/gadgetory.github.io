to suburbia it'll be nice and quiet if
we move out to the suburbs on let me
tell you the suburbs are not quiet
there's always trash cans trucks people
mowing their lawn there is always tough
going on here screaming kids honestly
moving to the suburbs is not quiet
whatsoever I've got to tell you it's
actually even noisier than City in some
ways trippy right okay that's not we're
here about today today I want to talk to
you guys a little bit more about the
whole mining craze and video cards and
all the things that are going on around
that so today's topic though is is a
card that has been used for mining still
good for gaming and people sell these
cards online a lot people are saying all
buy used cards many of these cards have
the potential or maybe cards that have
been used to mine mm-hmm that's right so
right now honestly before you go out and
buy any video card you really need to be
asking that people are giving these
video cards from as if they use for
mining because after doing a bunch of
research if a card is used for mining
for basically about a year now this
isn't a complete actual you know
complete scientific fact it's kind of
like a roundabout number on how things
go
the cards are failing out and if you
take this car to any of the
manufacturers and you want to get a
warranty they're not going to give it to
you they're gonna say that you destroyed
the card so the potential chances of you
guys buying a card that somebody use for
mining and having that card fail are
very very strong according from one
reading on the internet you know I mean
I obviously take that with a little bit
of a grain of salt because it is the
Internet but still people aren't going
to take the time to go out and do all
this research and put videos together
just that are complete hocus-pocus cuz
it's not April Fool's everyday now like
always in every video I want to hear
what you guys think and what your guys's
personal experiences are because I
myself I tend to avoid buying anything
used if possible now I have bought some
used up before off of ebay eBay pretty
much you had the 45-day periods of doing
things wrong you can return things
that's that's a good thing on eBay
but buying through Craigslist or
anything else like that but you're not
going to get any kind of like protection
on I would really avoid like the plague
I mean it is truly I'm pretty much any
use
product out there I'm sure amazon's
probably cooled they have protection but
as far as like you know going and like
walking a financial tightrope you know
like the guy walking between the twin
towers before they got blown up you know
like that's dangerous stuff as far as
I'm concerned you know walking across
the Towers crazy stuff going out and
buying a video card and really having no
idea what conditions that video card has
been used on you know is a very risky
process now obviously if you have a
friend and you're buying from him or
someone that you know chances are much
better that you're not going to get
completely screwed
but I'm saying right now that any card
that a minor has used and is now selling
to the gaming community as a gaming card
sorry guys I'm really sick right now so
I'm trying to do the video and not get
all clogged up with my thirst almost
like a frog I feel that they're screwing
people I think that since these mining
cards are almost used to the point of
non-existence there should be something
out there a law something that says you
know these cards should meaning be
acknowledged as hey this card was used
in mining you know almost kind of like
an industrial type standard because
let's think about it if a person takes
the card and they're mining with the
card they're not gaming isn't that
industrial you know because you're using
something to make financial game to an
industry you're buying a bunch of video
cards killing the gamers on prices and
yet you're trying to resell those cards
afterwards maybe for a little cheaper
but if these cards are virtually almost
all going to fail very fast they're
completely ripping people off big-time
and I understand now a little bit more
why people get so angry with the mining
thing you know at first when I started
looking into everything the whole
constant with Donna say no some people
agree but the whole thing of doing
mining and stuff like that I think it's
a cool idea you know for one thing the
government controls most of our lives we
all think we have freedom but our
freedom is actually very very very
limited you're free in your mind and
that's about the only place you can
really be free because there's taxes
there's all kinds of caches red tape and
everything that we do in life you know
I'm saying it's just the way things are
so having a way to make some money
that's completely off the charts is kind
of a cool thing I mean everybody excuse
me if everybody had the means in the
mine
- by solar panels I think that would
honestly be the absolute best way for
people to make extra money because of
solar power and solar energy you can
sell all that extra energy and you can
sell it right to the power companies so
I honestly think that's an industry that
should be like really really invested if
I had a lot of extra cash me personally
that's what I would invest in out
invested having giant places full of
batteries a bunch of bunch of reflectors
catching all that free sunlight and
making my money because now we see the
mining craze it comes all the cards get
bought up prices go up for all the
gamers so they can't buy them and then
those same cards at the end of the day
are gonna be recycled back out in the
market as junk so it's kind of almost
like a disposable industry in itself
which is just crazy now do you guys
completely disagree with me or do you
guys agree with me because the way
things from my perspective is I would
never want to buy any card at all if
it's been used for mining period not for
anything not for nothing not even from
my office not for gaming just for the
simple fact that if these cars doing
mining are put to their ultimate strain
why would I want to buy something that's
ultimately strained you'd be like saying
hey you know there's this Toyota from
last year but it's been drove 500,000
miles up and down six mountains and
crashed three or four times but hey you
know it's a good deal buy it I'll buy
that for a dollar what do you guys think
just you know just my two cents on the
entire matter right now
as far as use cards go excuse me oops
maybe we can just bleep that out didn't
mean to do that
it's like saying ninja online what do
you say ninja oh my god no anyways
though that's just my take folks if you
guys agree let me know I have a pole
sitting back up there but at this point
in time I don't think that any card like
I said that it's been used for mining
should be available to be sold to a
gamer with that I've been a big red sign
it that says this thing was used for
mining because if they don't tell you
you're liable to buy a lemon love seeing
you guys here peace out
