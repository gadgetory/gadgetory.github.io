features and options about this it's a
quad-core does full HD I'm not exactly
sure what the prices on this I don't
think it's been released yet but this
thing is going to be available for the
holiday season it's very nice and
elegant has a very nice look to it has a
lot of weight to it and it seems like
it's very very well built every piece on

I have a solid piece of metal so this
thing is probably going to be very tough
for the market so that's it folks this
