the channel today is Sunday Funday and
that means another giant giveaway here
on tech of tomorrow so this time what
are we giving away well this time it's a
giant steam giveaway and we're gonna be
giving away four copies of pub G and
four copies of Counter Strike global
Offensive whoo right I know lots of
people love these games in fact every
time when we are giving other stuff away
people go I really wish I could get a
hold of pub G man I really want that
game well guess what here is your
opportunity to do it so it's pretty easy
um you don't have to be sub to the
channel not gonna make you do that but
this one is involving Twitter once again
for Yoos people out there who say don't
have twitter it's not fair well life
isn't fair and that's just how it is for
me it's much simpler to make contact
with people on Twitter and give them
their prizes than it is through YouTube
I'll tell you why many channels you go
to their channel there is no about on
their channel which means I have
literally absolutely zero way of
contacting the people announcing their
winnings and/or giving their winnings to
them whatsoever Twitter it's really
simple I announced the winner I given
their game code and they're off and
going so here are the parameters of this
giveaway I'll be making the video here
on YouTube as you guys can see and then
we'll have a link where you guys can go
over to Twitter you can leave a comment
I want you to like and share the video
and just leave a comment tell me why
you'd like to have pub G or Counter
Strike global Offensive in your game
collection so it's very very easy like
usual this contest will go on for 15
days so 15 days from today I'll be
releasing the winners I will announce
all the winners strictly on Twitter
there's no real reason to do it on
YouTube so I'm not going to be
contacting the people on YouTube but the
day that it goes up I will have a link
inside here which says hey the winners
have been announced on Twitter so it's
pretty easy stuff these are all
relatively really nice games
honestly pub G is probably one of the
craziest games I
our plate I know there's a lot of people
out there say I prefer fortnight
honestly I've played them both I don't
know what it is I'm just not really a
giant fan of fortnight I don't know what
it is just that it's too cartoony I
don't know just something about it with
me just doesn't jive I really like pub G
a lot better I think it's more intense
and I know that opinions vary on that
but that's just how it is and
counterstrike been playing this game
like forever but still people like this
game they love this game I mean it is a
really cool game it's honestly probably
the very first game that I played where
I would just sit there for hours and
hours and out did I mention hours hours
playing this game just totally playing
it and being into it so it's really a
lot of fun so honestly this is a really
simple giveaway if you don't use Twitter
I'm sorry I don't know what you're you
know why you've got some crazy hate
towards social media but social media
helps get the word out helps get hits on
the video and all that good stuff
because regardless at the end of the day
to recap the money for paying for this
stuff to give to you I need to make some
money somewhere once again I'm just
going to state there is no money in
subscriptions at all anymore so even me
saying hey subscribe the channel I'm not
making any money from that whatsoever
there's no ad money in Twitter so you
guys making comments on Twitter once
again there's no money there the only
money that I make whatsoever
is actually views from the video itself
that's it so it's really cut and dry so
here we go once again for copies of pub
g4 copies of Counter Strike global
Offensive that's a total of eight
winners and in fact you know what I'll
throw in two more random winners and
just give them some random steam cones
that I have lying around from other
games so all in all they'll be 10
winners so there'll be a link down below
you guys will click on that it will take
you over to Twitter leave a comment like
and share the video that's what gets you
into the giveaway and after that 15 days
from now I'll announce it and if you
don't enter and you don't play well then
guess what you can't win so if you want
to win you know what to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
