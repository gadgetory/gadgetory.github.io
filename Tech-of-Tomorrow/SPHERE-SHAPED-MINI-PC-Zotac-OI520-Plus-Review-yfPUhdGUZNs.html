back here once again for another edition
of tech of tomorrow now right here
behind me I got some where people are
going hey is that the Nexus Q hell no
it's not and go go
what the frak were you thinking instead
this is something a lot cooler this is a
brand new product from zou tech this is
the oh I 520 plus now what's the plus
stand for where the plus means that it
comes with the memory and the hard drive
this one comes with a 500 gigabyte hard
drive already installed so with this
system all you have to do is install an
OS and away you go
now is it worth your money well let's
jump in and let's see if it is first and
foremost the big thing about this is its
design I mean this thing is something
that people are gonna talk about it just
looks like a little sphere I mean think
about it
it's very space-saving you guys can see
it right now on top my hughes &amp;amp; kettner
and it totally majid if there was
somehow I could combine that with my
using Kettner
damn straight I'd be doing it it looks
really awesome it's very compact it's
under $500 and a lot of people are gonna
just walk up to your desk if you had
this and go hey what is that cuz really
honestly does it look like a PC to you
it really doesn't look like a PC it kind
of looks like it could be even something
like you know a thing you set in your
living room and blows out cool stuff
with potpourri I mean people are gonna
ask you what is this so first and
foremost this new Z box oh I 520 plus is
definitely a conversation piece this
thing sized in at 154 millimeters by 154
millimeters by a hundred and sixty-one
millimeters and oh pretty much sit on
any desk where you've got not very much
space another cool feature about the
sphere is its ease of access all you
have to do is grip atop the sphere make
a quick turn pop it off and there you
have everything accessible for you to
get access to you can upgrade the memory
up to 16 gigabytes put an SSD or even
put an MSA to drive in all very very
easily now as far as Debates expects go
this thing contains an i5 3 200 u dual
core processor this is a 1.6 gigahertz
with a 2
six gigahertz boost this thing also has
a 4400 graphics built on to the CPU now
this is OK for moderate light gaming but
any intense gaming yeah you got to look
for something else
personally I feel like the CPU and the
graphics on this aren't really meant at
all for gaming but one thing that is
actually really cool is the very full
fleshed rear i/o which features the
power button a four and one card reader
HDMI microphone jack the power input
which by the way is DC 19 volts a
headphone audio output jack display port
for USB 3.0 ports a LAN port and two USB
2.0 ports there's also an additional USB
2.0 port available on the side of the
unit now obviously this thing does not
have a DVD ROM or anything built inside
to install the OS you're gonna have to
use an external one or gonna have to use
the OS on a USB stick either one will
work just fine like I said in the
beginning of the video folks this
thing's not entirely geared really at
all towards gaming but being a gaming
channel we went ahead and still ranked
games on it to show you guys performance
values for what this thing brings the
table so let's check that stuff out now
and rock out to the benchmark song first
up we have Tomb Raider and it's the low
settings obviously this thing comes in
at 17 frames per second next up we have
Bioshock also want some low settings at
15 24 7 frames per second
3d marked fire strike in standard mode
531 is the score on that Metro last
light glow you guys all know that's all
last light isn't very demanding game but
still this little thing puffed out seven
point six seven frames per second isn't
that cute
next up Geekbench 32-bit score single
core got 2288
multi core got four thousand four
hundred and nine
battlefield 4 this is the game that
everybody knows and love and you guys
know this game is very very frickin
demanding on the low settings though
Battlefield Forbes scored 11 point 6 5
frames per second next up Crysis 3
actually my all-time favorite games on
low settings that got five two point six
seven frames per second which ain't very
playable now just for everybody's
reference out there everything that we
ran was ran at 1080p why don't we run
anything else well for one thing it's
2014 and 1080p is where gaming is that I
mean hell you can get a monitor for
around a hundred bucks there's really no
reason to test in anything but 1080p now
even though this thing isn't really
geared towards a gaming machine if you
want to play like dota 2 other games of
that type you'd have no problem playing
them on here is there going to get like
you know all through it frame rates no
but it'll still be playable and this
thing was not advertised as a gaming
system so even be able to play those
games is still a thumbs up in my book
alright folks so that pretty much wraps
that up now you can come at this from a
couple of different directions for five
hundred dollars could you go out and
possibly build a better system yeah you
probably could but will it look this
cool because there are some positive
things to this if you're somebody who
doesn't game you want some that looks
really cool it's completely quiet it
doesn't get hot at all I mean zero it's
one of the coolest running machines I've
ever actually seen this thing does have
benefits for the right cause it just
depends on how you the user interpret
that if you're looking for something
that's just really cool that's not gonna
break the bank and you're not a gamer
and you're looking at something like
this this might be something you're
looking at now for me and probably 98%
of my audience I know this thing is
going to be underpowered for most of us
but for somebody out there who's not a
total gamer is looking for just that
niche product that's really cool and a
mouthpiece then this might be something
you want to look forward to so I am
