there it's me L work once again here on
the tech of tomorrow
YouTube channel to bring you guys an
unboxing now you guys should know I'm
pretty lucky I live in the City of
Industry in California and whenever I
want products I pretty much just like
travel around go door-to-door that's
what I do I go knocking like hey what do
you got so that said I shot over two
Thermaltake today and I was bugging my
friend ransom on like hey bro come on
CES was just here what in the do
you got for me to review dawg
come on see yes you know look a brother
up so that said he was like oh man I got
some stuff but it hasn't quite at the
American mark yet but I'm like hey
whatever I want it so I'm like in there
trying to snake as much stuff so this
time I got something actually really
cool check it out man this is the Theron
gaming RTS mouse some really cool
feature up the bat it has from 0 to 50
600 dpi I believe maybe higher might be
fifty nine hundred I'm I'm thinking zero
to 5600 says it does it on the fly you
can instantly change it it has multi
sensors on the bottom of it and this
thing has a bunch of different things it
has like battle mode and all these other
crazy modes what it's zero here we've
got battle mode function block button
mode 128 kilobytes of onboard memory and
it says it has multi color stuff so it's
pretty cool stuff
I mean ensues right here but that said
let's go ahead and let's jump right in
let's do the very first unboxing of the
new Thermaltake Theron gaming mouse okay
so let's jump right in check it out it
says it is the Theron RTS gaming
battle-ready stim your gaming experience
like I said before function lock button
battle mode 128 kilobytes of onboard
memory multicolor if I go ahead and pop
open the top here we're go some other
features it says right here it says
on-the-fly sensitivity multi level
resolutions from 100 250 600 dpi so I
was correct beanie sidelight change by
clicking frequently during battle modes
you can change like the colors even when
you're doing stuff it says pause break
lighting system on logo
to engage gaming atmosphere so I guess
this thing blinks and stuff cause W no
trippin the mine powerful 5600 dpi laser
engine that can be used on most surfaces
has a a pulling pull rate switch button
between 125 500 and a thousand cycles I
don't know exactly what that means but
it's probably pretty damn cool have to
look into it
it says weight and design to get the
perfect feel for mouse movement it
stores up to 45 macro keys within 5 game
profiles has a function lock button that
can disable the functions of side
buttons and you also have the theorem
customised GUI this is software that you
install so you can customize and go into
your mouse and there you guys like a lot
of information in the inbox things so
that's basically all the SH is Nick
that's about it that said let me go
ahead and begin the unboxing I'll start
up by here once again making a couple
professional incisions don't try this at
folks at home this is dangerous I have a
sharp knife here watch it
careful oh ok he is successful she now
put away the blade and begin the
unboxing
we'll start off right here about cutting
the old cut the cap here capping it off
here getting a little plastic thing that
you hang on the Shelf here this is for
chefs to hang on as you guys know let's
go ahead and pop this out oh by the way
just real quick I'm gonna show you guys
in the back of this thing I guess the
Theron is about this guy so I should
probably mention this damn boxing it's
probably important times you guys can
zoom in and see that TT Apollo softball
excuse me
TT Apollo's softball Taiwan professional
Starcraft 2 player from the Taiwan
eSports league it's signed by him so I
guess this is pretty much like his
endorsed product didn't want to forget
that and leave any names out of what's
going on here that said not you guys
have seen it let's move the frak on and
get back in unboxing the thing so
periods in its packaging nice and
plastic and shiny lots of glare there to
get in the camera man's eyes they just
love that's yet we got a bag right here
this is a multi-purpose bag I'm using
you to store your mouse or put other
goodies in there hopefully not the
police will arrest you for you know
hopefully not and put that down there
that's number one then we've got the
challenge D game software like we said
before remember there is a GUI decks
installed so there will be
drivers for this product set that down
there hit the knife out of the way then
last but not least we have the mouse
itself we're gonna pull this little bad
boy out over here okay so now that we're
focusing in this area you guys can see
we got a sliding button right here we've
got additional control right here on
this side we have a single button
there's a light right here on this side
as well they said this lights up also by
the way a lot of the new cases have this
really custom rubber feel on it it's
really nice
this mouse includes that same custom
rubber feel it's really nice feels
really slick in my hand then we have on
this side this is under beyond your
basically your right thumb button you
have two buttons here an additional
light here all really cool stuff we're
gonna pop it around the bottom remember
we sit at multiple sensors as you see
here on most mice that you see commonly
they have one sensor this one has multi
sensors around it so it's gonna be able
to be actually more accurate having
multi sensors sending more area is gonna
actually make the mouse perform much
better and I don't really know why
they're so for RTS for me this thing's
gonna be really for first-person
shooters you can get that head shot and
kill a but I mean that's
just me
but anyways this is the Thermaltake
Theron RTS gaming mouse this is the
unboxing you're watchin techo tomorrow
and I'll see you lads back here later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
