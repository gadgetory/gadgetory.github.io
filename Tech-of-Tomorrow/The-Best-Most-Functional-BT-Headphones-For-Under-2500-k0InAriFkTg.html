beats hey what's going on youtubers
Elric here once again on teka tomorrow
now we all know that the world is
heading towards everything bluetooth you
guys saw my previous video the brand new
Apple phones that are coming out the i7
no longer you're gonna be seeing any
type of phone jack it's all going
wireless and what better well hey giving
a brand new set of wireless headphones
now today's video is brought to us by a
company called sound beats and these
little things we have right here are
very very nice the only way 4.8 ounces
so regardless of what you're doing in
the gym walking doing whatever you're
doing these headphones are geared never
to toss you any type of stamina at all
in your ears on your neck whatsoever and
what's really great about these
headphones is their function ability you
can not only use these things for
listening to music and everything off
your iPhone or your Android device you
can also use the built-in microphone to
operate the voice commands on your
Android or iPhone device and they also
offer CVC 6.0 noise cancellation so
that's pretty cool for people who just
want to ignore the environment and be
listening to what they're doing in their
headphones now these things are very
easy to use and operate that don't
themselves actually insert interior very
very simply some of the easiest I've
ever seen just a slight little push they
lock in on either side and you're locked
up and ready to go and once again they
won't even move out of your head I could
do some crazy jumping and stuff like
that and run down the street but it
wouldn't change anything because these
things aren't coming out and another
nifty thing is they feature this thing
called ez lock and with that you can
actually take the little headphones and
for traveling around a magnetic strip in
here it just catches each one inside of
it should fit traveling around
everything's nice and conveniently
stored right inside of your little sound
beats inside the box the q9 hunters you
not only get the headphones you also get
assorted ear pads for different ear size
and you also get the charging cable now
as far as the controls go they're very
ergonomic to use on the right hand side
you have a button for answering your
phone you have your volume up and down
you have your power on enough button and
you also have your microUSB for charging
they're all located on the right hand
and on the left-hand side we see the
controls for operating your audio than
the volume you see your pause play and
you see your previous song Nexon and
that's pretty much it as far as the
controls go very easy to use and very
simple let's talk a little bit now about
operational time it takes two hours of
basically charge the sound beats all the
way up you get ten hours of talk time
ten hours of continuous playback or 300
hours of standby time which is a pretty
long time and as far as the sound goes
these things are really straight across
the board flat response there's no
extreme highs no extreme lows they're
right down the center and that's
actually most preferable to a lot of
people out there there are other people
who like really deep bass but that's
mainly for gaming or really high trouble
for maybe if you're listening to like
some high-end type of orchestral audio
but for general listening and that kind
of stuff straight down the middle is
probably best now the only caveat to the
sound Pete's that I see is it only has a
10 meter range but I mean that's a
slight caveat do you really think you're
gonna be more than 10 meters away from
your smart device at any time maybe but
I don't really think that often if
you're at the gym if you're out running
doing any type of those type of things
at the beach you're pretty much gonna be
right next to your smart device so that
may not be a problem at all the
Bluetooth connectivity of the sound
pizza is also Bluetooth 4.1 and it
allows you to connect two devices
simultaneously all right so like I said
at the very beginning of the video many
people out there are always searching
for wireless bluetooth headphones and
these sound beats do offer a lot of
different features from the CBC's 6.0
nodes cancellation from the comfort of
them billing being four point eight
ounces the sound is very nice they're
loud enough in your ears that you don't
hear the outside environment perfect for
working out doing that stuff but best of
all these headphones are under $25 and
I've got even better news than that
they've actually given me five coats to
give away to you folks out there and all
you have to do is enter is it leave me a
comment down below a positive one please
be subscribed to the channel then I'll
send you the code and you can order them
directly through Amazon yourself and
they'll be delivered right to your door
and then I'd really hope to hear back
you guys letting me know what you guys
think about these things I honestly feel
that for being under 25 bucks they're a
great deal all the
controls being able to answer your phone
and all that stuff makes them very very
functionable and let's just face it
under $25 isn't going to break the bank
if something does happen like losing
your luggage or somehow they get broke
your not going to freak out you can
easily get another pair because they're
so affordable like usual we'll have
information down below like button which
hope that you hope you guys like this
video even though it's sponsored I hope
you guys have a positive attitude about
bringing a positive attitude and a
positive product to you folks I'm Miller
you've been watching Tecna tomorrow
we'll see you guys back here in the
channel for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
