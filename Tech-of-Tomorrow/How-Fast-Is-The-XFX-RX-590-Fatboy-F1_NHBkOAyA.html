world that's right it's November 15th
2018 and AMD has released a brand new
video card now it's really not the most
exciting thing in the world because we
were really hoping to see Navi but I'm
hearing and that's even gonna be pushed
farther in the next year so when I said
till q3 so that's kind of crazy but what
we do have is the brand new RX 590 and
the particular one in my hand is from
XFX it's called the fat boy edition you
can see it's a really large card it's
been completely like redesigned as far
as the cooling and everything goes plus
the name you know fat boy and it's
really weird there's been some one
controversy out there people are trying
to say that oh like the name fat boys
like relating to like dropping the bombs
and Hiroshima and stuff because they had
two little things like them it's just
completely ridiculous fat boy that's not
even just because they did they took two
different words out of something and
tried to mix it in people that they were
doing this come on man get a life man
this has nothing to do with that why try
to mix in a hatred and all that kind of
stuff into a video card launch just
ridiculous stuff but anyway it's with
that said this is a pretty nice card and
it's gonna come to market at about 279
to 299 I haven't actually seen the
retail prices on you know lime for
marketing sales but for what it is
I think this card is going to be the
sweet spot of all cards out there for
1080p if you're not you know totally
interested in the whole rate racing
thing if you're looking for a good
gaming cart that's not gonna break the
bank your 1080p gamer I gotta say this
new rx 590 I think you're gonna really
like this particular card it's got a lot
of nice features
2,304 got stream processors 144 of the
texture map units
you also have 32 ROPS so all in all a
good card it's gonna take about 225
watts of power for the car because on
the side you're gonna see we do have a
single 8 pin and a single 6 pin
connector right there
so just gonna draw about 225 watts mad
at your system on that particular thing
the cards really nicely built okay so
I'll start off right here on the front
we're turn the cart this way say it
upside down from the card to new hundred
millimeter fans they actually have 11
blade
so they're made to deliver a lot of
cooling against the card they run really
silent too and if you're not gaming
you're just like surfing the internet
and doing stuff like that
the fans actually don't move so if
you're not gaming you look in your
system the fans aren't moving don't
freak out and go my cards broke it's
actually designed to do that in the
design and another cool thing about AMD
is that for crossfire you don't have to
require any kind of buying a $50 bridge
or anything like that
that's why AMD is always so good at
being the budget King because of NVIDIA
you know even though their stuff may be
a little faster and have some cooler
stuff you're gonna be paying big bucks
because you got to buy the bridge you
got to buy this you got to buy that you
know when you put your AMD card in your
system and you put another one in there
Crossfire's automatically enabled and
just like free sync you're not gonna
have to pay any extra money which is
other great things if your person out
there you're looking for a monitor that
you're not going to rip and tear during
your gaming you can look up any free
sync monitors a particular card it's
going to do very very well now on the
side you can also see there's four new
heat pipes running all through here
aluminum fins all cooling the card
throughout the entire system and when
this card's in your system it runs very
quiet even when the fans rev up these
fans are pretty unbelievably quiet which
is kind of you know I'm thinking okay
wow these older cards you add you know
the fan turns on it's like Oh sounds
like some kind of lawnmower jet plane
going off and videos like famous for
this as well but no this card is
actually completely silent I love the
fact that it has a backplate that's
actually wonderful you can't cut your
hand on it can't damage the card all of
these cards have a three-year warranty
so if you're wondering how long is the
card of a warranty well this particular
card is a three year warranty all of the
AMD software stuff that you like for
overclocking lot man and all that stuff
it's all gonna be in there now the boost
clock on this card is running at about
1580 you can actually go into watt men
though and change it to 1600 megahertz
on the boost and it'll run just fine at
that without any problems whatsoever you
just got to do a little bit of a tweak
there and then you're in like Flynn
now the i/o is also pretty much the same
standard i/o that you get on all of
these cards there are three display
ports a single HDMI port a DVID port and
one thing
cool about the end of the carters it
actually as the XFX logos when it's in
your system you can actually see that as
well going hey it's my XFX card if
you're wondering hey will this card fit
in my system well the card is actually
10 inches long so you know it's a real
lady pleaser but instead of being two
slots this card is actually almost three
slot because it's a very fat boy car
like we talked about before the fat boy
well this card is a fat boy card so it
almost takes up two and a half slots so
pretty much the same thing as like a lot
of the larger cards out there it'll fit
and most systems out there I really
think it's gonna have a problem
whatsoever but if you're looking to put
you know other cards right next to it
that may affect it when you're putting
inside your systems I gets the really
big things about the RX 590 is the very
fact that the Polaris chip even though
it's been redesigned it's now on the 12
nanometer process now that means they
can make a lot more chips on die which
means they should have better yields
which should affect the pricing so maybe
these cards will even go down in price
as the next few months go by all in all
a pretty standard looking car there's
nothing that just like totally stands
out makes you go whoa but in any system
with the colors and everything it'll
match pretty much up with anything it's
straight ahead it does what it does and
let's jump into the numbers and you'll
see why at the end of the day I really
do like this card we've been using the
same test system for quite a while now
it features an ASUS Maximus hero
motherboard features an i7 a 700 K
processor 32 gigabytes of RAM and SSD
for the boot drive and then we got a
couple of 2 terabyte hard drives for
storing all the games and all that stuff
on also we're using the latest drivers
available at the time of launch and
we're also using the latest anniversary
edition of Windows 10 so with that said
though let's rock out to the benchmark
song and let's see those scores let's go
you
all right I have to admit I just love
that song the new benchmark song to me
is really cool and by the way this
version that you guys are hearing isn't
even the finished version this was just
like a rough mix that we did with some
guitars and some program drums the
finished product is much better and
since many people out there are always
asking hey can I use your song and all
the stuff
well the copyrights belong to us but I
will have this song for sale without any
vocals on it if you want to use it very
soon yer there'll be the vocal version
and the non Milka version so with that
said let's get back to the card so rx
590 12 nanometer process refresh on the
Polaris chipset nothing completely new
there however you guys can see that this
card only gets 81 Celsius under full
load so any overclocking really passed
the 16 or megahertz I don't really see
that happening because the Vega was
actually running about you know seven
degrees actually cooler and this card is
almost as fast as the Vega 56 which is
really crazy because the Vega 56 I
believe is about almost $100 more so if
this card does hit the market at 279
dollars even at $299 like I said it's
going to be a very sweet spot for people
out there who want to do 1080p marketing
now is the whole Polaris thing the
biggest news in the entire world no it's
not but you guys can now see just how
fast the XFX RX 590 fat boy it really is
and honestly at the end of the day I
think it's a really great card I give it
an editor's choice here on Tekken
tomorrow even though it's a Polaris
refresh it's still nice to see new tech
I don't care who the NIC new tech comes
from I love new tech and at least AMD
did something to bring something out and
doesn't say okay we'll leave the same
stuff we have nabis being delayed so
this is the card at the moment if you
guys are looking to buy one we'll have a
link down below where you can purchase
one of these bad boys for yourself or
just get more information
I'm Elric you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow and now you know just how fast
the RX 590 fat boy from XFX really is
