techo tomorrow here with JJ from Asus
going around the room showing you guys
all their new products now we're going
to be taking a look at the P 9 X 79 e WS
now this thing just has a lot of new
features coming to market they've
released a board similar as before but
this is an updated version with a lot of
new features and now we'll let JJ tell
us about some of this great stuff yeah
so like you talked about actually we
already have a p9 X of a 9 WS which is
already a piece of the board's got dual
next awesome overclocking ability full
xeon ECC support even four-way SLI
support but we had users that wanted
even more so this is generally targeted
at content creation so people are doing
audio video production they're doing any
type of overall content creation in
addition to that some of them some of
that just high-end easiest I want
multi-gpu board setups also always
interest in ws so this one kicks it up
to 7 PCIe expansion slots
we've got dual PL x gen 3 switches on
here so that gives you just gobs and
gobs of bandwidth so you can imagine
either if I'm running you know 3-way
4-way SLI configurations to triple stock
cards I've still got spacing or if I'm
doing content creation you could imagine
maybe multiple HDMI capture cards being
connected to camcorders and DSLRs to
bring in tons of bandwidth and video
being brought into my system so
Clemente's so this board pretty much
that was geared for the guy who games
but also works right now it has all the
gaming features in that you want but
it's also features for those people who
want to work so even though it's labeled
as a ws motherboard I know a lot of you
guys say ok I use a WS mother book for
my gaming yes of course you can but not
everybody actually works this boards
geared for the guy who plays games but
then also think that it goes and
actually works on his computer and uses
it right yeah definitely if you're
somebody that has both usage models or
you like I said do just somebody that's
targeted doing you know content creation
you need just a platform to build on and
this is going to be in your office and
this is what you're always doing work on
it'll work well as well so it's got a
lot of flexibility we've gone ahead and
also updated the Nick's on here more
historically we always use Intel mix and
our ws series usually use the l series
which are the Professional Series
this one's been updated
latest generation iSeries network
controllers which even offer better
performance management options pretty
much of the cream of the crop when it
comes to what you have on integrated
networker so does that help with
connectivity staying connected how fast
it goes what kind of stuff can put
forward for performance is going to be
affected too you're also gonna have
better actually cpu load not a lot of
people realize let's say if I'm
transferring tons of different video
maybe full workstation images backup
some systems large high definition based
content when you really tax up actually
a network controller you could sometimes
you're using 15 20 30 percent CPU
utilization just on transferring stuff
to network cuz it's such heavy load when
you have really high quality network
adapters like we're getting integrating
here on the board CPU load can generally
drop to underneath five percent
sometimes three percent two percent so
an amazing amount of difference freeing
your CPU up to do other things of course
and you can imagine that if you're using
content creation maybe you're rendering
your 1080p video 2k video you're doing
DSLR photography editing you want all
your CPU freed up to be able to do that
but you still want to be able to make me
do stuff in the background with your
network plus the management options on
the Intel NICs are extraordinary
especially when people need to be able
to customize maybe packet control jumbo
frame options virtualized environment
options all kinds of kind of
higher-level levels of functionality
it's really great choice if you guys
don't know if that really is what means
is that you can go in you can set up
your NIC and you can assign what you
want to be of importance so if you're
downloading one thing here it's not
important you can classify that as low
if something else you're doing you can
classify it as high and prioritize it
correct yeah you do actually have
prioritization options within VLANs and
a whole bunch of other stuff so really
cool options that we have there I'm
really liking this this big huge silver
cooler right here that's yeah well nice
well that makes sure you know what WS
it's about 24-hour operation not a lot
of users always realize not all parts
are intended for that for this type of
product of course you're gonna have a
huge amount of heat maybe from all these
GPUs all these devices plus the plx
chips so you want to give you something
beefy reliable it's gonna make sure and
cool it well but moving over from there
we've also added some additional
SATA controller functionality so we
actually have our brand-new SSD cache
into
controller on the motherboard so this is
great for users that need advanced
storage but with improved performance
for mechanical volumes so if let's say
you want to attach like a 2 terabyte 3 4
terabyte drive but you need to improve
it because you're handling heavy
workloads maybe uncompressed 1080p video
2k 4k video heavy you know foot
photography editing you can add either 1
SSD 2 or upto 3 to keep improving the
performance of that large mechanical
volume so you have the best experience
excellent that's gonna be great stuff so
overall I mean that rounds out some of
the awesome new features that we have
here and of course we keep all the
classic technologies like our USB 3
boosts awesome UEFI great overclocking
if you're interested in it and of course
for the guys that need the best
stability and the highest level of
performance that the xenon support so
you can support up to 16 core CPUs and
of course ECC memory support and this
one's also 16th base power as well
correct all digital power design as well
alright well there you guys have it
folks
brand new motherboard gonna be coming
out when's this thing supposed to be
released it we're targeting towards
hopefully the end of q1 maybe very
beginning at YouTube and what is the
suggested manufacturer's reseller price
right now we haven't set that price but
because it's going to be positioned
above the current x79 WS expect a higher
price point than that ok well you got it
folks we'll see you guys back on
tomorrow with JJ for more stuff soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
