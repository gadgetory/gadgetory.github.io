welcome back once again to tech of
tomorrow where once again we have some
of the latest tech on the table this
time it's a brand new card from EVGA
this is the RT X 2070 now this
particular card is the black edition
it's coming to market at 499 dollars and
overall I think at the end of the day
you're gonna find this is a really nice
card
the founders Edition is about $100 more
but honestly by the time you guys see
the end of the video especially this
particular video because on this one
we're just competing with the founders
Edition 1070 versus this particular car
because I know a lot of people have the
founders Edition 1070 cards and they're
wondering hey you know is this worth you
know my time for an upgrade path or hey
I'm jumping right into the market want
to buy a new card and honestly for $500
considering how fast the card is and how
cool it runs it's a nice card overall so
let's jump in let's check out the card
itself let's look at the scores and talk
why at the end of the day I definitely
would say that this is a good card for
an upgrade path a new Buy and definitely
an editor's choice product let's rock
EVGA has completely re-engineered these
cards to actually look good and keep
your card running cool as well you guys
will see on the top that overall there's
this clear plastic shielding that's
covering the entire card and underneath
that you can see all the cooling at
brass you can see the cooling fins and
all that good stuff the heat pipes but
right on top there's also two fans
pumping a lot of air through the card to
keep the card running cool
now the only thing is on the back of the
card I was a little bit disappointed I
was really hoping for a backplate but on
this card unfortunately there is no
backplate to me ah you know that's kind
of a bad thing but for some people it
probably won't matter whatsoever but
honestly for me I really like a nice
backplate real quick taking a look at
the rear of the card you guys can see
there are two display ports a single
HDMI port a USB type-c connection and
last but not least a DVI connection I'm
pretty sure that most of my fans are
very familiar with the new Nvidia launch
with r-tx all the technology the
ray-tracing all the stuff
that came in the 2080 I and 2080 is also
inside of this card the only really
difference is the amount of power in the
card the amount of CUDA cores and that
type of stuff all the same technology
has rolled downhill from all the top
line cards onto this one this particular
card has 2300 and for CUDA cores it has
a base clock speed of 1410 but it has a
boost clock speed of 1620 so it's a
pretty nice boost and you guys will find
out as we go into the video this card
actually runs really cool and learning
that cool will actually be much easier
for people to get a great overclock on
this card this card also has 8 gigabytes
of ddr2 and a 56 bit memory controller
and the memory bandwidth in this card is
448 gigabytes a second evj also
recommends that you use a minimum of a
550 watt power supply to make sure
you're getting enough power to the card
and if you're wondering just how much
power this card actually draws it draws
175 watts from your power supply the
card is also ten point six inches long
it's 4.5 inches high and it's made on a
two slot design just like most cards the
EVGA r-tx 27 t black also supports four
monitors right out of the box if you're
wondering hey can I do surround vision
with this card yep you can now with that
said though let's quickly check out our
test system now the motherboard we're
using is the a Zeus
Maximus 10 hero motherboard we have an
i7 8700 K there's also 32 gigabytes of
Kingston HyperX fury ddr4 memory and - 2
terabytes Seagate Barracuda hard drives
to store all of those games and
information ok now in this particular
video mind you were going to have more
we're only going to show you guys the
scores between the new r-tx 2070 black
and the founders edition 1070 card
because I know a lot of people out there
like I said in the beginning of the
video are wondering hey man should I
upgrade my card or not so with that said
though let's rock out to the new
benchmark song and let's check out those
scores rock on folks
now one big difference you guys are
going to see is definitely when it comes
to the temperatures the r-tx 20 70 Black
is running at 65 Celsius which is just
amazing and leaves a lot of headroom for
overclocking and the 1070 is running at
83 Celsius so you can see there's quite
a large gap as far as the heat is
concerned and that becomes a major
factor like I said when it comes to
overclocking the cooler the card runs
the bigger the boost you know now
obviously there are a lot of things
different technologically between the
old gtx 1070 the founders edition card
and the brand-new black edition from
EVGA r-tx 2070 all this mainly has to do
with the chip said all the touring stuff
and all that stuff now as far as the
scores go you guys can see there's
actually quite a big difference between
15 and 30 frames per second when were
talking at 1080 and then we're seeing
about 15 to 20 frames per second more in
4k depending on the game that you're
using so there is quite a bit of
difference there now the card obviously
is going to cost about $100 more than a
1070 but here are the reasons why I
would definitely buy this card over the
previous generation gtx 1070 first of
all it's newer technology so that means
that it's more future proof all the
games that are coming out and stuff are
going to be more geared toward that and
as RT X matures and we start seeing all
the stuff that's in you in the card
being fully taken advantage of you're
not going to really want to have an
older card you definitely want to go in
on beat you know one upgrade and plus
the fact that it runs at 65 Celsius
which is amazing it's almost 20 degrees
Celsius cooler then the gtx 1070 that is
going to tend to lead to a lot of great
boost clocks so you know that this card
you're going to be able to overclock it
it's gonna run cool for a really long
time the power requirements really
aren't that high under than 75 what
power draw 550 watts that's what you you
know needing for a minimum power supply
that's hardly anything and the card
comes to market at $500 and last but not
least best of all it's still in stock in
many places so if you're able to get
your hands on one of these brand new
EVGA car
I would definitely suggest buying that
over the previous-generation card and if
you have the money
I would probably definitely ditch my gtx
1070 and jump into the r-tx because we
see the scores are better the card runs
cool or just overall it's a better card
future-proof all of that good stuff so
