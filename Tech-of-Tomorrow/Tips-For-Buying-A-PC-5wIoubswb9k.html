Affairs here once again on tech of
tomorrow okay
previously we brought you guys a video
we said hey had a term between buying a
PC and a Mac most people obviously going
to buy a PC so that said in this video
I'd like to talk to you about how you go
about determining how to buy your PC
there's a few easy steps that you can go
through to make sure that you're not
buying something way past your needs and
wasting your money the very first thing
that you need to do is sit down and
evaluate exactly what it is that you're
going to be doing with the said PC are
you somebody who just wants to contact
people on the internet do you only want
to just use your email and upload a few
pictures on the internet you barely use
the thing but you want to make sure that
you have something you want a very
entry-level computer there are all kinds
of new things including the new AMD ApS
that are coming out that allow you to
buy an all-in-one system for around $300
or less that's probably going to do
everything that you need also when
you're looking at the stuff to and
you're out buying it decide what kind of
monitor that you want to use are you
somebody who's getting old do you want
to have a really big monitor if you're
gonna have a really big monitor you're
going to want to make sure that your
video card is actually up to
capabilities to power that big monitor
something to take into consideration so
the very first thing you want to do is
really evaluate what am I going to use
my computer for if you're somebody who
plays RPG type games you don't play like
the heavy you know 3d intense games like
we talked about some other videos you
don't need a super efficient video card
solution and especially if you're
somebody who already has a pre-existing
monitor and all you're doing is looking
to go out and buy another system you
should really pay attention to what
you're buying because if you've only got
a monitor that say a 20-inch or below
and your resolution is maxes out at 1680
by 1050 there's no reason for you to go
out and spend the big money on a video
card that's basically the lowest and
standard on that is above your even
monitor you're just wasting money so you
really need to really think about what
you're doing that always comes back to
what am I using this computer for what
am I really gonna do with this computer
those are serious things you got to
think about and then you go out and but
your money always budgets gonna come
into play we all know this everybody's
struggling for money these days the
these kind of screwed up world wide so
budgets always going to be in there now
if you're somebody who's upgrading and
you're just looking like to do your
video card stuff then you need to also
look at something in your computer
what is your computer doing now the
games that I'm playing now what are they
not doing that I want them to do in that
case you want to go ahead and look at a
video card that's going to go ahead and
meet your need you may not even need to
upgrade stuff I basically feel that
Intel computers are for people that do a
lot of multitasking stuff a lot of
multitasking you're sitting there you've
got lots of windows open you're working
with Photoshop you may be working on the
Internet you're just doing all kinds of
stuff on your computers I feel that
Intel is a better buy for that stuff but
if you're strictly a gamer using single
footed applications are most the time in
gaming there are a few that take
advantage of multi-threaded but not very
many so you also need to look at that as
well if you're somebody just gonna go
out and buy a computer and you're
strictly going to be using that computer
for gaming nothing else I believe that
AMD is a great solution you can get many
of their CPUs including their new quad
core CPUs for a very low price even
their 1090 T which is a six core CPU is
actually very well priced compared to
some of the Intel CPUs so if you're a
gamer and you're strictly going to use
that an AMD pc p-- excuse me an AMD CPU
is just fine basically most games use
the video card as the main processor for
the engine now there comes into plays
like physics and stuff like that yeah if
you want physics and all that stuff you
might want to just go ahead and use the
Nvidia card if that means nothing to you
then you might want to go ahead and use
an ATI card there's just so many
different aspects of doing it but the
bottom line always is determine what
your needs are highly evaluate what
you're doing look at the surroundings
that's your end also do I have room for
a big monitor do I not even have room
for that there's all kinds of things to
do it if you're only somebody who just
does basic stuff you need a very very
low-end PC the high-end pcs that cost
lots of money these days are really for
enthusiasts people who are in the
industry or people that are just really
super competitive with playing their
games most people out there don't even
need to have any of these type of things
in their computer
so really sit down before you decide
you're gonna go out into the computer if
you're somebody who's young sit down
with your parents and talk with them and
say hey you know mom dad this is what
I'm going to be doing with my computer
if you're an adult sit down and look at
and decide what are you really going to
do with the PC that you're using that's
really how you start out with things
you'll go into somewhere like Best Buy
or these places they're always going to
try to sell you something beyond what
you need it's just like if you go in and
you ask for a car you're gonna go in
they're gonna try to sell you a better
car
that's just sales alone don't fall into
the sales trap don't fall into that
little box be your own master
create your own destiny and make your
own choices but making your own choices
means doing homework so at the end of
the day what I say for you if you're
gonna go out and buy a new PC seriously
you value what your needs are
evaluate the money and then make a
determination of whether you need to
actually spend big money or just a
little tiny about a money to suit your
needs in the PC world thanks for
