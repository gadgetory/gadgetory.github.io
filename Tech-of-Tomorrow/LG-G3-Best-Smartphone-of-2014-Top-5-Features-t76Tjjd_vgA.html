there's been quite a lot of talk about
the LG g3 now this is LG's flagship
entry for 2014 supposed to be competing
with things like vs 5 for HTC One m8 the
Oppo find 7 and this really has tons of
great features but these are my top 5
features of the LG g3 so diving it right
at number one will be the display it's
an obvious number one choice since the
LG g3 is dominated by a five and a half
inch panel taking almost all the space
on the front of this phone and I really
have to give a hand to LG for cutting
down the bezels there's almost none on
the sides which means there's more room
for more display but getting back on the
display LG packed a five and a half inch
quad HD IPS LCD now quad HD stands for
2560 x 1440 or 2k and to put it in even
more understandable terms the same
resolution as your 27-inch imac if you
got one this pushes its pixels per inch
envelope all the way up to 538 pixels
per inch which means it's an absolutely
insanely clear display finding any
individual pixels at this level is damn
near impossible also the quality of this
panel is pretty good too when I reviewed
the HTC One m8 earlier this year I
thought IPS panels couldn't get any
better well I find myself really wrong
with this LG g3 because it's the best
display I've ever used even better than
its panel adopting cousin the Oppo find
7 the g3 has a supreme viewing
experience for any type of content I
just wish it had front-facing speakers
to seal the deal my number 2 is going to
be the laser autofocus almost everyone
this year is adding some kind of camera
Park HTC sadly added the duo camera
which really didn't do much in terms of
image quality but LG on the other hand
added a laser auto focusing system this
little black dot is actually where the
laser fires out little beams of light
that actually hits with subject bounces
back and comes back with distance data
which in turn will tell the autofocus of
the camera where to focus and it's
really quick as well actually
autofocusing is about the same or even
quicker than the samsung galaxy s5 and
you do have a cool
rate of DSLR type focus points on the
panel but the downside is they're all in
the center which is really limiting to
where your subject could be for auto
focus now my number three is going to be
another camera feature but this one is
extremely beneficial to anyone who takes
video or photos oh I yes on the 13
megapixel camera is a fantastic thing to
see so 0 is if you don't know stands for
optical image stabilization which means
the lens element inside will be moving
to compensate for the shakes to phone
might experience while you're taking a
photo or video this feature works
absolutely fantastic in video mode as
well allowing you to capture awesome UHD
video in a very smooth fashion number 4
is going to be the software more
specifically knock code and the wave of
software is designed not code as a
feature that allows you to set up
certain patterns of taps to unlock your
device but it also allows you to turn
with display on or off by the simple
DoubleTap of this display it's a nice
alternative to have if you don't want to
reach around for morir buttons now the
software has been redesigned for a much
more flat appeal all the UI elements
have been made to look nicer and the
colors really complement Android KitKat
and everything happens fairly quickly
which is all great things my number 5 is
going to be battery life wow this is not
really a feature it's a nice benefit to
have on a smartphone my on-screen time
on the LG g3 has gone over five hours or
so of overall tile on batteries around
15 to 18 hours with kind of light to
moderate usage sometimes and even gone
two days with one single charge and also
you do have wireless charging on the LG
g3 just a nice perk to have these days
so those have been my top five features
of the LG g3 if you'd like to see the LG
g3 review and some more verses videos
including phones like the one plus and
the Oppo find 7 make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and let me know that
you guys would like to see that and if
you have any questions you could ask me
directly on Twitter to app Marco am
Hannah and while you're there give me a
follow that would be awesome and as
always my name is Mark Johanna from
techna tomorrow and I'll catch you guys
in the next one
and be
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
