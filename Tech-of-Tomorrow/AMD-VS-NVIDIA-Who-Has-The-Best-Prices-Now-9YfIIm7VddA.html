that I get asked almost daily is who
makes a better video card AMD or Nvidia
and to be honest with you it's a pretty
loaded question and I don't think
there's actually any just flat answer to
say that one is better than the other
and there are reasons for this usually
AMD always comes the table and they
bring the budget that's been the big
thing with AMD from the get-go like a
lot of people say oh yes they're beating
Intel they're beating Nvidia honestly
those things are cool goals for AMD but
AMD has always been traditionally
including when they were ATI before that
before they bought the company has
always been about pricing getting the
absolute best prices to the market to
get the video cards to you people now as
far as gaming goes you're gaining
experience I don't think from a visual
aspect when I say this what I mean is
sitting in front of the computer you've
installed your video card you're up and
you're playing your games I don't really
think that you're going to see that much
of any difference whatsoever in just how
the game looks now it's true that Nvidia
card has hardware physics and their
software physics for AMD but still at
the end of the day when you're playing
your games and you're looking in the
screen I don't think that pretty much
any person can just walk up and go hey
oh yeah man that's an AMD card oh yeah
that's an Nvidia card so as far as the
visual experience goes and I'm talking
about strictly about being a gamer a
game are only you use your computer for
surf from the net you do gaming you're
not streaming you're not editing you're
not doing anything else
you're just gaming from that aspect
alone I don't think that there's truly
that great of a difference between the
two cards now one thing that is
definitely different between the two
cards though is support for your monitor
now with AMD you get free sync freesync
technology like the name implies is
absolutely free it's a software solution
that's by AMD and it allows your monitor
to work in sync with your video card to
eliminate screen tearing and all this
other type of things that in game that
make the gaming experience just not very
nice helps get rid of eye fatigue and
all that other stuff
now Nvidia solution is called g-sync
but it always does cost a few hundred
dollars more and people you know get
really kind of crazy about this but the
reason for this is is that that is a
hardware solution inside your monitor is
actually a chip that's actually helping
run your monitor so unlike being a
software solution it is a hardware
solution when you're paying that money
you're paying that money to get that
hardware solution and depending on how
hardcore of a gamer you are this may be
a very very very important feature and
may be the one that helps you make your
decision I mean if you want the absolute
best gaming experience no tearing no
nothing you want to just play great your
best bet is going to be with an Nvidia
card with a g-sync monitor however this
is also a more costly investment like I
said the monitors alone when you're
getting g-sync are usually a few hundred
dollars more than a free sync monitor
because you're gonna pay for that
technology but I have to say that the
difference between free sync and gsync
is pretty noticeable free sync works
pretty well but g-sync just works better
all the time now if you're a person who
does more than just gaming you're a
streamer you're an editor you do all
kinds of different things there are some
differences between an AMD card and an
Nvidia card now anything with direct
seeyou is going to work better with the
AMD card and AMD cards are really good
for streaming on that type of stuff but
if you're rendering videos you're
rendering Photoshop stuff you're doing
stuff like that it's really tough to
beat an Nvidia card
it just really is those cards work
really well NVIDIA has the cuda cards
now we know it they have fire GL's and
the AMD side things that's not for the
gaming market whatsoever that's for the
workstation type market but still if you
are a mainly a gamer and you do other
stuff you know with your card depending
on what you're doing there could be a
you know a big difference for you if you
go to your computer and you see that
most of the stuff that you're doing uses
direct see you then you might not want
to get an Nvidia card for what you're
particularly doing now the biggest issue
between the cards always though is
frames
second right at the end of the day when
you're playing your game you're doing em
in the thing that you always look at are
the frames per second you're like hey
man this game is getting 60 frames per
second this game is getting this many
frames per second and here's where
things right now get a little bit weird
so let's go right now
to the top of the line a 1080 TI card
for some reason has not gone down in
price whatsoever they're still selling
for $900 why this is going on and why
that price hasn't dropped I don't know
now if we're gonna compare it directly
over to the Vegas 64 the Vegas 64 is
five hundred and eighty nine dollars and
performance wise there's a giant leap
though between the 1080i and the Vegas
64 the performance differences is just
it's really quite a lot so if you're out
looking for a video card right now I
honestly could not really recommend at
this point either one of those cards but
check this out you can get a 1080 card
for about 515 bucks
they range right around in there right
now and that 1080 will beat the Vegas 64
and we'll do it over and over and over
again
now the Vegas 56 even though it's a good
card and used to really be like a really
nice price spot at this point that car
is you know almost the same price it's
only a few dollars less than a 64 so I
mean if you are gonna get an AMD card
and you want the best I would recommend
paying the difference in getting the 64
because the performance difference is
between those two cards is quite a lot
so a 1070 card though is also around
that same price range and if your
budgets right in there that particular
card actually gets better frame rates in
most cases then either the 56 or the 64
so things get really really kind of
weird right there at the very top end of
things you see the Nvidia card priced
way higher than the AMD card but the AMD
card also has a lot less performance and
if you drop down a tier and just go to
the 1080 which is also dropped in price
a little bit you get a much better deal
that's just the way things are now it's
really kind of strange that AMD hasn't
released a new video card in quite a
while I was really expecting them by now
to release a new video car but now that
we hear all these rumors that it's
possible at the 11th series that's
coming out is going to be a rebrand that
obviously will give AMD if that comes
out to be true a time to catch their
breath and release new cards but where
these new cards are right now I really
don't know so if you're a person out
there right now and you're getting ready
to make a video card purchase and you're
like hey I really really want a good
deal honestly the best deal that I can
suggest right now across the board is
even though it's older technology is an
rx 580 I built a computer for a friend
of mine with an rx 580 he plays all his
games he does VR he's totally happy with
it that card is $300 now it competes
almost with the 1070 it's a little bit
slower in some cases but you're also
talking about a 200 to $250 price
difference between the two cards so
honestly at this point right now the rx
580 is a really great deal we'll also
have some links down below to a few
different cards if you guys want to
check them out let's check them out for
yourself but currently in my opinion
that's the best deal that you can get
because that cards $300 like I said it
plays all the games it does great stuff
even though it's not a Vega 56 or Vega
64 it's not the latest greatest card
these cards are still very competitive
and at 300 dollars I think they're quite
affordable now a lot of people has tried
to say before that these cards hit the
market and they were like a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars I personally have
never seen the cards $499 some guy sent
me a link some time to if I looked at it
was kind of like and if the car was 199
dollars honestly I would say it's like
the best deal that there is on the net
right now but at 300 dollars it's still
a really good deal so here's the break
up if you're a gamer and that's all you
do you play games every day in your
computer not a weekend war you just
don't come and play a game Friday
through Sunday when you have some time
you really are dedicated to your gaming
you're looking for a car that's going to
produce lots of frames per second it's
going to run nice and cool in your
computer and it's not going to cost you
an arm and a leg
like I said the 1070 is a really good
card it's a really nice car but it's
also still kind of pricey we're seeing
the 1080 and a 1070 and the price in
between those two cards really isn't
that much and if you look at a 1070 TI
this card's prices actually shoot up
higher than a 1080 so that's kind of
crazy you see a 1070 TI which actually
now will beat pretty much a 1080 it
costs more money so as far as the prices
go right now between the two companies
getting yourself a GTX 1080 or an RX 580
honestly to me is where the speeds the
sweet spot is excuse me and like I said
if you're a gamer you're in game you're
playing the game you're not really going
to be going oh my god I can tell this
particular spot this is an AMD card or
no this particular spot it's an Nvidia
card that's not happening so the gamer
experience between either companies
between AMD and NVIDIA as long as you
have the proper drivers and your card is
running fine your gaming experience
other than the frames per second is
going to be pretty much the same and I
hope I'm getting my point across very
clear with this because exactly what I
mean is I set two computers up side by
side I keep the cards within the within
the tolerance range of the scores and
you put two people to play the games you
blindfold them you put them in the front
their computer and you let them play no
persons gonna be able to come up I don't
think go hey man this is an Nvidia card
and this is an AMD card and that's the
gamer experience and I think that most
of you guys out there are gamers and are
looking for the gamers experience and
like I said before also the big
difference between the two is the g-sync
and the free sync if you want the
absolute best of the best you want a
hardware solution that you know is never
going to fail on you
then definitely you want to be looking
at Nvidia and you want to be getting
yourself a decent monitor even though
it's a little bit more costly and might
cost you some money
still if you want the absolute best
that's what you want to get in now if
you're on a budget like I said the RX
580 right now really really hard to beat
and beyond the gaming experience yeah
there are a few things that are really
more technically you know different
between the nvidia cards and the AMD
cards but if you're really a gamer and
you're doing other stuff it's possible
that you might even want to have two
different computers I know that a lot of
my friends who do a lot editing and
stuff they have quadrille you know cards
inside of their computers that they're
doing all that rendering and stuff and
then they have AMD cards inside of their
gaming systems and they're completely
completely happy so it really just
depends on where you're coming from I
honestly hope that we see a new card
from AMD very very soon because you guys
all know it the Vega 56 in the Vegas 64
even though they came out and they were
kind of cool they still were not even
what we were looking for or what we were
expecting and if the rumor about the new
11 Series from Nvidia turns out to be
true and it is just a rebrand that's
honestly giving him D a serious benefit
in time to just go take a deep breath
and get the RAC together and get their
cards out now you guys may not realize
this some people always say oh you're a
fan of this you're a fan of that and
that's just not true I'm a fan of all
technology
I want AMD to put better products on the
market always and why is this because
the better the product on the market
from another company forces the other
company to improve their game you guys
really don't realize this but AMD not
releasing new video cards and being a
long time between the releases just like
Nvidia really kind of kills the market
and that's why it's been so long since
we've seen Nvidia even release a new
video card because there's really no
demand right now
Nvidia's got the market as far as the
frames per seconds go they've got that
hands down sure there are some good
deals on the AMD side of things but at
the end of the day people are really
going to want performance
it's either performance or budget and
that's really how it comes down stand if
you notice that most of the guys who do
game with AMD are really looking for a
budget and a great deal but in the
current you know scheme of things you
buy yourself a Vegas 64 and you pay $600
for it you probably be kicking yourself
in the
but a week later when you see that the
cards on the nvidia side are lower price
and you're still getting better
performance from an nvidia card i have
no loyalty to brands i have no loyalty
to companies what i have loyalty is to
the numbers and the performance and we
bring you guys the reviews we show you
the numbers and the raw performance we
show you guys those those really low
lows and all that other stuff but you
guys can see that pretty much at this
point in time most of the nvidia cards
are honestly better priced than the AMD
side of things rx 580 like I said
multiple times this video great deal but
the other cards
not so much of a great deal so if you're
somebody out there right now and you're
on the fence you're like oh man I want
to buy a video car but I don't really
know what to buy I mean if you're
strictly an AMD fan and you let all the
things like weird business practices or
other weird stuff that has nothing to do
with the video card itself you know
influence your Buy that's on you me
personally I don't get involved with
politics like you know unless Intel
comes and like kills my family or Nvidia
comes and does something crazy to me
when I go to buy a product I go buy the
product and its merits I mean it's not
like you know I see you know and Vidia
out beating seals with a hammer or AMD
out polluting the ocean with oil you
know they're not doing any kind of stuff
and I've said this many times before in
videos that these are all corporations
and they don't have soldiers they have
lawyers and all these guys in the
business side of thing really care about
is getting your business and another
thing that you guys might not realize is
that Nvidia dominates about 80% of the
market and that's being fair the small
amount of AMD marketing for the video
card section is actually really small
comparative wise so sometimes I do admit
when I hear like crazy stuff like that's
that goes on with these business
practice I even wonder why sometimes why
and video would honestly waste their
time and in the back of my mind I
sometimes think that Nvidia does stuff
they don't realize that what they're
doing my end up biting him in the ass
and they'll pull it back just like when
just like we saw with you know the G
force experienced all that solid stuff
that was going on before you know what
having having companies can only by
certain name cards like I don't even
know why Nvidia would even get involved
in that kind of stuff because they're
already winning the battle but for you
the consumer really the only thing that
should matter to you is what you're
going to get for your money let me know
if you guys disagree with me but as a
consumer I'm usually looking for the
company that gives me the best bang for
my buck now like I said if I knew Nvidia
was that abusing children or beating
seals or doing something really bad to
the environment or to the world then I
might say oh hey you know what I don't
want to buy from these guys because
ethically they really suck turd you know
I mean but neither one of these
companies ever does that in fact AMD
really doesn't do too much shady stuff
out in the big business world there's
probably a reason for this they don't
want to get caught in anything getting
lawsuits and getting screwed so that's a
smart move from them and videos got a
little bit more money so they can play
that game but for you who are just
buying the cards why at the end of the
day would you really care what these
guys are doing on the corporate level I
mean really it's like complaining about
the president playing golf that day it's
not gonna do you any good I mean he's
out playing golf and when you're gonna
go spend your money on a video card who
cares about those things you want price
versus performance if you disagree leave
me a comment down below like I said I'll
have some links down there to some of
these video cards and the prices but at
the end of this video I just want to
reiterate one more time to me the RX 580
right now is pretty much the best gaming
card deal you can get 300 bucks if I was
going to right now suggest building a
system for one of my friends or family I
would be pushing them towards that card
it plays games great it does VR and
overall right now I feel that it's the
best bang for the buck and the next one
up other than that if you want a lot of
performance and don't want to break the
bank well then hey that's a gtx 1080i
Mellor Copeland's explains a few things
love seen you guys in the channel if you
guys would share this video and give it
a like I greatly appreciate that and
we'll see you guys back on here for more
tech and hey
