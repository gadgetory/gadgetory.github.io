who are otherwise Hardware addicted
welcome back TECA tomorrow where we feed
your fix with all the tech all the time
now I went to CES and the first day that
I was there mister camera boy here
behind me wasn't able to get off from
his normal job so I wasn't able to film
all the people who I really wanted to
one of those people was a company called
J labs now it's pretty funny because the
person who is in charge of PR is named
Jordan now me I saw the name Jordan I
just assumed it was a dude so the tone
of my email cuz you guys know me was
like hey bro penis right on man cool and
you know and then finally I got a
response once it was like um you're
gonna be surprised and so I was like
okay you know and then I went and I met
them and it was just like honestly drop
dead I'm sorry Jordan
if you're a boy you're the prettiest
damn boy I've ever seen girl because I
would give you a solid ten you are one
cute girl you're also smart and funny
anyways I went there to their booth and
I didn't get to film all the stuff I
wanted to but they did give me a couple
of their products to give to you guys so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to unbox
these things well not really unbox them
but unpackage them and then I'm going to
choose two winners on our Sunday video
and just give these things out to you
guys so you guys can have some cool shit
so this Sunday make sure you pay
attention because the random drawing is
going to involve these two sets now
these guys are based in San Diego the
first one I have up right here this is
the Diego the Diego earbuds the second
one I have are the J buds by J lab so J
lab is the company behind it all they're
the people doing all the design all the
packaging and they have all kinds of
different products they actually had a
booth full of all kinds of stuff
including over ear headphones a little
speaker boxes and clean like that one
that I showed you guys that had the
really cool stuff where I played by
American beautiful cool stuff
so now let's go over here let's go to
the table and let's take these things
out and let's just check them out and
see what they're about
shall we alright folks you guys can see
these are the J buds by
jlabbe I showed before but you know
these things are the Metall earphones
with microphone show you guys the back
real quick not very much to it
what matters is actually what's inside
the bag I don't want these packages too
bad because like I said I'm going to
send these out to you guys so I'm even
gonna leave the tab on there I'll go
ahead I will pull these ones out of here
see what we got all here in the box
let's see it looks like we got a sticker
right here open that up nobodies aren't
stickers so here we go
jlabbe audio.com custom you can see all
this stuff so these guys also custom
make stuff so say that you like had your
ban do you want to make some stuff that
said hey you know like Payne cylinder
you could like go ahead and put that on
there and have your own brand made by
these folks that's pretty cool I think
especially people who are doing
marketing so here we go here are the
actual things themselves they have extra
ear pads and ear buds in here in case
some seal does and they have different
size and stuff for different sized ears
including some very large ones it looks
right right here yeah alright so here we
go let's go ahead and take the little
loopy thing off right here get this out
of here for you guys it's all loopy off
of here look at the Cameron so we can
get on this alright here we have them
let's get them all out okay so let's see
your folks I'm gonna try to keep it as
camera range very very long so they have
a very very good reach here is the gold
connection on the end that plugs in you
can see that rubber flexibility around
here
also protection right here to not break
will come down I'll bring it down here
we see the control
we move along down here this is also the
microphone by the way this is the
microphone and the control all on one
little thing right there I'll go ahead
and I'll pull one of these out so you
guys can see that up close and the other
one's going to be exactly the same so
voila
one for each ear that's right cuz people
mostly have two ears these days I know
there's some aliens out there you know
at three but for you guys you have to
buy from a different brand because you
know they haven't stepped down at the
galaxy yet they're strictly you know
earth got a little logo right there you
guys can see it the cross connector and
that's pretty much that for those ones
so I'm gonna go ahead and just put these
things back in their little plastic
containers back here and get them out of
the way and we'll show take a look at
the details next alright folks so now we
have the Diego earbuds post mic now the
Diego series is supposed to be geared
towards the lifestyle in San Diego so
they have a lot of different color
themes and stuff like this that's
supposed to relate to the lifestyle in
San Diego so with that said let me
here's the front here's the back not
much to it just says Diego days which is
kind of a little motto I'll go ahead and
once again just go ahead and take from
the package here rip it but not all the
way leaving the tab on so that we can
repackage it for our Sunday winter and
let's pull these out now these are very
very sporty I mean you know what I
actually like these I think I'm gonna
call up and actually ask for another
pair because these are actually cool I
like these for some reason this color
combination just strikes me as something
go running with so look here we have the
gold connector right here yellow color
once again being protected actually the
cable on this is even better designed
than the one on the other headset we
looked at a second ago here we have the
mic once again bring in this lube could
you get it
I will go ahead and just take off the
little thing again one more time I'm
sure though like the other one it's
going to have plenty of length they're
giving you good options Wow let me see
how long this thing this was even longer
the other one I believe as well so yeah
this one's actually even longer if the
other one was uh I don't know I don't
have a measuring tape to be exact but I
know that the villain did not go as far
way up into the air to the poster as
this one did so let's look at the
earbuds now go ahead and pull this
little plastic thing up they actually
seal these ones in there pretty good go
ahead and pull that out check that out
it's very sporty looks like snow like I
can see it totally could see a
snowboarder with these things here
welcome yo bro what's going on I can't
hear your mind I've got my headphones in
dude all right I can totally see that
couldn't you were skater I mean that's
the color of this theme outdoorsy yellow
right so check it out
hello wait let me get it better hello I
am an alien or a droid wink wink
alright that's that hey I gotta say
these are actually pretty comfortable so
whoever Wednesday's you can say hey they
were worn by the doc first check it out

to wash them no I wanna watch them man
