see you guys back from the channel for
another edition of tech of tomorrow now
today's video is brought to you by I of
the CV p.m. they bought and paid for
this video because they want you guys to
know about their great product now
IVA C is a really strong company in fact
these guys have won the best VPN comm
award for having the fastest speed with
their Virtual Private Network and
overall they've won an award for being
the third best VPN around the world and
IVA C VPN does a lot more things than
your standard VPN most bps just focus on
hiding your IP address but with IVA C
there's just so much more to offer from
streaming videos to secure downloading
to even saving money on your next
vacation all this gives IVA C VPN an
edge over the competition
and just the fact that obviously has won
awards shows this VPN is a very solid
product and I know a lot of people out
there have a lot of questions about VPNs
and all that different type of stuff so
if you've never even heard of a VPN
before let me give you just a kind of a
quick description about what exactly
this is now a VPN is a Virtual Private
Network and what this means is that you
can surf the net and your IP address is
hidden in mask so that you do everything
in complete privacy let's just face it
some people don't like people to know
what they're doing online and if you're
one of those people I've a CE VPN may be
just for you so let's jump in and let's
check it out now like I said VPNs keep
you safe and secure from hackers
identity theft and third-party
surveillance that might have the Rye on
you and it does all this by hiding your
IP address from any online threats and
if you often connect to public Wi-Fi
spots like coffee shops or hotels where
anyone could be an online threat a VPN
could definitely give you that peace of
mind that your surfing safely and with
IVA C you can even stream movies safe
and securely all with just a couple of
clicks of your mouse
IVA si is a very big company they have a
thousand plus servers in a hundred plus
locations around the globe and they
guarantee the fastest VPN service out
there I mean they did win the 2019 best
BPM award for the best speed and this
was at the affiliate West Summit 2019
the largest summit in Las Vegas and here
you guys can see even when I skipped
around the movie triple frontier on
Netflix it loaded pretty damn fast and
it plays in HD clearly and buffer free
as well so seeing the speed firsthand I
can safely say it is definitely the
fastest and I have to admit old Ben
Affleck he's looking pretty sexy for the
camera and if you're thinking okay what
exactly kind of privacy does is he offer
we'll check this they offer
military-grade 256-bit data encryption
which makes it almost impossible for
hackers to steal your data or even log
your activities another thing really
cool about the IVA see app is that it's
easy to download and install and it
doesn't matter whether you're using a
Mac or a PC you still get that same
great protection you can even get it for
Linux Cody and many others as well so
stay safe now after you download the app
it's easy to use with just a single
click you can activate the IVC VPM and
start surfing the web anonymously in no
time you can also choose from a list of
countries or cities to connect to
and with obviously smart features you
can configure your VPN to fit your
desired purpose with just a couple of
clicks it really is pretty easy to do
once inside the app you can see that
there are actually four smart features
you get smart connect which gives you
fast unrestricted access and like I said
before you can choose the country or
city to connect to and when you are
connected there's also a little
drop-down menu that shows your location
as well as how long your connection time
has been and some of their features are
shown - like no log and hidden IP the
next option you have is secure download
which I'm sure you can guess lets you
download from the net safe and securely
just choose a country and you'll be
connected in seconds now once you enable
the secure downloading option you will
get only those servers to connect to
which will let you download securely and
the secure downloading feature
automatically scans and removes any
viruses or malicious files and it does
this in real time while you're
downloading so you won't have to worry
about any bad files making it on to your
device and with IVA sees optimize
peer-to-peer servers obviously promises
you'll get the best speeds it can give
for peer-to-peer file sharing another
cool thing IVA see also has unlimited
data transfers so you can exchange an
unlimited amount of data over IVA sees
network without any restrictions
whatsoever obviously also has a
streaming option that you can choose
pick a streaming service or country to
connect to and with one click your
streaming anonymously
I kind of like this option because once
you connect to a streaming service it
will give you an option to open up that
streaming service in your browser and
then you can start watching instantly
and you can get services like Netflix
Amazon Prime
Hulu Fox BBC and a whole lot more they
also have an unblocking option as well
in case you're in a geo restricted area
where you can't get specific content you
can connect to a list of countries and
unblock your freedom just like in the
app
you also get an account tab where you
can log out upgrade or install IVA C on
other devices as well as a setting tab
and a help tab in case you have any
questions that need some answers now one
awesome thing about IVA C is how it can
save you money the next time you decide
to plan your vacation IVA C can save you
money on car rentals hotel and even your
flights all you have to do is connect to
different servers and countries and
check sites like Expedia or economist
comm to see if you can save money on
your next trip or even when you're
shopping online and you can switch
between countries and servers as many
times as you want there's no limit at
all IVA C has monthly and yearly plans
as well as a two year plan for a mere 54
bucks which is basically two dollars and
25 cents a month a 77% discount and a
real deal if you're looking for a
product like this so if you're looking
for a VPN that's not only really really
affordable I mean this is really
affordable and works great you guys
