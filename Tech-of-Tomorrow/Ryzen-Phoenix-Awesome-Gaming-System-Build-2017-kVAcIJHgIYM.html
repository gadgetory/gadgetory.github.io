been waiting for it hell - yes we've all
been waiting for it but it's finally
here the rising phoenix system featuring
that's right the AMD 7 series 1800 X and
check it out at $1,800 so we got an 1800
X system at $1,800 it's a very nice
system if you're really expecting
something much cheaper it's going to be
kind of hard to do because let's face it
the CPU itself is 500 smackaroos so
right there you know you're buying a
high-end system so we decided to stick
things that's pretty high-end we could
have went even crazier I had a bigger
case we decided to save that for a bill
that's totally dedicated to doing
content creation today let's just talk
about the gaming system which is the
rising phoenix here on Tekken tomorrow
let's check out those specs for the
rising phoenix build we chose the case
that was pretty well priced and still
had a lot of features and look really
clean now this is their Shogun case it
features all kinds of cool stuff
including the Aces or lighting systems
you can change all the lights inside the
system which i think is a pretty cool
thing in fact if you wanted to you could
even use the old-school colors of AMD
which were actually green and black
which is kind of cool if you're doing
that throwback thing now the case also
has some other really cool features has
dual glass panels one on the front one
on the back now the reward is solid
black glass you can't see through it but
when you pull the back panel off you
guys can see it there's plenty of room
for doing great cable management in fact
we were able to do our bill without any
cable sticking out whatsoever and one of
the reasons why we use two SSDs is just
because they look so cool sitting right
there you guys don't have to use the
SSDs that we used in our build you can
omit that completely but you guys got
admit that those two drives just look
really nice all around we also use a
bunch of different BitFenix pans in the
system as well we even replace the fan
on the Nook to a cooler with one of
those fans so that everything matches
for the motherboard we wanted something
that actually matched the build really
well and I was on a fence about whether
I should use the gigabyte gaming 5 or
this motherboard but this motherboard
won out just because of the simple fact
that it's silver and you guys can see in
the build this thing just
totally kick-ass now this is the MSI X
370 X power gaming titanium motherboard
obviously for AMD risin this board is
VBR for ready and it just has a lot of
features that make it a great gaming
motherboard you can run SLI you can run
crossfire just all-in-all a well rounded
motherboard and what the hell this thing
just looks like I said badass and look
at all those pretty lights it's like
Christmas
obviously since we're building a
high-end build for AMD we want to use
the highest end AMD card that you can
get to your gaming environment and that
is the Red Devil RX 4 80
now this 8 gigabyte bad boy features
three fans it has all the colors at AMD
fans like the red and black theme and
this thing is just one hell of a fast
card and obviously since this build is
called the rising phoenix we use the AMD
risin and we use their latest one their
greatest one this is the 1800 x come to
the market at 500 bucks now one thing I
want to talk about folks in my build
experience and testing the system we did
have some problems with the memory I
tried much faster memory in the system I
tried changing the specs around but I
wasn't able to get the memory to go any
faster than 2133 at the moment anything
else other than that sitting and my
system would just freeze up time and
time again so we finally agree innocence
Network which was the Corsair Vengeance
lpx 16 gigabyte kit and this is - 8
gigabyte stick to ddr4 at 3000 megahertz
but like I said I can only get it to run
to 2133 speed stable this problem is
well-documented if you want more
information just type it into Google and
check out the information now powering
this bad boy is of course there are MX
series RM 750 X's a fully modular power
supply 80 plus gold and along with this
we use their brand new cable kit and
it's a black and red cable kit gets rid
of all those mustard and ketchup cables
you guys eight so gone is the mustard
and ketchup so no free meals and this is
the power supply we use in this build
and one thing I really do like about the
case is that the power supply is a
completely hidden and sewn shroud so if
you don't like seeing the power supply
hey in this build its hidden one thing
we were having one hell of a time with
our build was actually finding a cooler
that would work with the new am force
system a lot of the coolers are out
there
plain and simply don't work on many of
the motherboards now I heard the
gigabytes a little bit more flexible I
don't know yet but as far as things go
we ended up using the nock to a CPU
cooler that we got in the kit so until I
actually got the kit from AMD I wasn't
able to get a cooler from anybody else
that would actually just fit natively
onto the board take that in mind if
you're planning on building one alright
so obviously this is a gaming system and
that means I'll have to have somewhere
to put my games but I also wanted to
boot up very very fast so I want to put
something in raid but some that wouldn't
break the bank so I chose to kingston
128 gigabyte SSDs i rated these bad boys
up that's our boot drive and then we
have a single one terabyte western
digital black drive and that's what we
store the games on in addition to that
we just have a portable drive that we
take and when we need install extra
games we just take that with that using
any system that we want to in fact I
would suggest you do that too because it
not only keeps all your games backed up
you can take with you everyone and play
wherever the hell you want now you guys
can see though that the overall look of
the rising phoenix is just totally cool
all the lights look really cool together
the ability to change all the lights you
people out there who love RGB stuff hey
this is a baby for you it's totally
clean inside you can see the cable
management is completely beautiful
nothing is restricting the airflow in
the case whatsoever and gone like I said
are the mustard and ketchup cables so
now all you guys get is the beauty of
the custom cables from the people over
at coarse there so that's the system and
the specs let's check out those scores
overall though you guys can see it this
system can handle 1080 gaming with
absolutely no problem it handles 1440p
pretty damn good but 4k now that's just
out of the question with this particular
build you're going to have to get a much
better video card for that or maybe just
maybe a crossfire system now as far as
attempts go the 1,800 X idled at 34
Celsius and under full load it was 43
Celsius so that's really not that bad as
far as the VGA goes we added at 38 and
88 SATs 38 Celsius on idle and 88
Celsius under full load alright folks so
there you have it now if you guys are
wondering why I came with the $800 price
tag it was you guys because I asked
before in a previous video to give me
your comments and where you guys thought
the system should be and actually the
most common one was the 1800 X at $1,800
the 1700 X at $1,700 and the 1700
vanilla at like $1500 so I'm trying to
keep in those things and bring those
systems to you guys to the table
now obviously the next big questions on
everybody's mind and we'll be getting
there with the next few days is how does
this system take SLI and crossfire so
I'm going to be doing a bunch of testing
we're going to test to 480 s2 1080s
to 1080 eyes and if we can find
something else we'll throw them the
table as well I'll see if I've got two
980 is still lying around don't know if
I do but if not Apple will at least have
those scores for you we'll also have
different systems like I said on the
1700 X and the 700 vanilla we'll have
all different systems for different
price levels if you guys want to see
certain testing that's pretty simple to
do please leave a comment down below and
asking what you want to do if it
involves me saying adieu test it against
you know 47 computers of this thing
honestly there's so much stuff coming
out right now I don't have the time but
you guys can look for this next week
next week live gaming footage live
gaming footage of how this card does in
this system how the 1080i does and then
we'll have it in a comparable system by
the Intel folks obviously you guys can
cut this bill down and you can make it a
little bit cheaper obviously you guys
could use a cheaper power supply you
could use cheaper stuff all the way
around and make it obviously I think the
case though at 139 dollars that's kind
of hard to beat for that price I think
it's a really badass case but obviously
you can change some of the parts on you
don't have to have these badass cables
that's 100 bucks you can knock off the
system right there you know obviously if
you have a copy of Windows you're not
going to need to buy a copy of Windows
your comfort there you know you can just
change things around obviously but the
CPU at $500 that's going to be in big
investment right off the start so if
you're going to invest $500 on a CPU why
not invest in the badass motherboard
badass memory and all that stuff we're
also trying to work out the weird memory
issues because like I said memory on
this thing was actually a real bitch we
formatted a couple times I kept into a
software with software but all of a
sudden I was like damn what's the helm
and the memory neither changes memory
back to 2133 otherwise it just kept
freezing up so that's an issue I've read
online that there's lots of this going
around hopefully this will be addressed
really soon I would really like to put
some really fast three 200 megahertz
memory in here in fact so got some right
here from Kingston I'm going to try it
out and see if it works but I don't know
if it actually will but I'll let you
guys know the results so stick around
because we've got lots of more stuff
coming here on Tekken tomorrow about
risen and just all kinds of other cool
 like usual all the information the
parts about this will all be down below
down that like button hopefully you guys
will go Chuck Norris style and love this
video I hope you guys do and with that
said if you're not subscribed hey you
know what to do
we'll see you guys back on Tekken
tomorrow for more tech goodness tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
