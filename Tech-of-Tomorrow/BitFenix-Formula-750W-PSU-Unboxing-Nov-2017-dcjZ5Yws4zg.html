means what that's right more tech and
what I want you guys to think about
today well it's a brand new product from
the people over at BitFenix this is
their brand new formula 750 and gold
power supply it's not modular it's got a
cable coming out of the back but it's
about a hundred bucks and it's got some
really cool features so let's jump right
in let's do the unboxing and let's see
what's inside the box so on the front of
the box you guys see there's a picture
the power supply itself the name the
Formula gold 750 watt and they probably
called it the gold because it is 80 plus
gold certified which is a really good
rating there are a couple that are
higher but this is actually a pretty
high rated power supply on the back it
just tells you more stuff about the
power supply how many different cables
they're all and all that type of stuff
which we're gonna get to as we unbox it
anyways on the side just more
information it's going to repeat itself
all over the place
the name once again some more
information and then last but not least
the SKU and all that good stuff on the
end of the box
so now let's pop the cap and let's check
out what comes inside so first off we've
got the user's manual is gonna tell you
a bunch of stuff about the power supply
so if you're all those people who wants
to get totally anal about your
information it most like will be inside
of this manual now yeah I'm that we get
the power cable itself obviously gonna
need that bad boy to plug into your wall
otherwise you'll have to get a couple
rats in a spinning cage to power your PC
all right so we've got a little
container here yes you use it for
something later on like I said this
particular power supply is not modular
so the cable is going to be coming out
right out of the back of it so we see
that there's also um let's see here
got some of this right here these are
straps for doing all your cable
management all that stuff so if you're
one of those guys who's totally also
ended doing cable management you've got
some stuff here to help you with that
now get the power supply out of here
have a little plastic thing my dude
you're here oh there's also some screws
so these little screws are to help but
not your power supply in some case you
can do that so if you want to mount it
in there
he's the screws to do it so the power
supply itself on top we see the nice pan
to keep your power supply running nice
and cool why it's powering your
equipment we see the formula series on
one side and the same thing repeats
itself on the other side on the back of
the power supply we do have an on/off
button you won't see this though unlike
really high you know power supplies
usually if you see a 1200 watt 250 under
watt power supply you usually don't see
this little button some have it but not
many do and then last but not least on
the bottom it's just more information
about the power supply you know all its
ratings and all that good stuff I think
most people care about it just working
and working good for a long time and for
some people the specs may do that so so
as far as connectors go we have a single
24 pin power connector now as far as
video cart connections ago there are two
six plus two pin power connectors there
are two here two here and then there are
two eight pin power connector so you
have enough power connectors to do SLI
or hookup any type of video card now as
far as SATA connectors go there are
eight SATA connectors and there are four
molex cables alright folks so there you
have it the formula gold 750 watt power
supply for the people over at BitFenix
now I'm not exactly sure if bit Fenix
makes their own power supplies but they
probably outsource them to another big
company that makes them but the price on
this is a very good price now if you
personal only likes modular power
supplies then obviously you know that'll
be a caveat for you on this particular
model but it's about a hundred dollars
it's actually a dollar more expensive
over on Newegg but they have more stock
I believe there's only one in stock
right now in Amazon but it's a dollar
cheaper so I mean I don't think a
dollars gonna bother anybody but it's 80
plus gold it's got a great certification
there are enough cables for you guys to
SLI 750 watts oh pretty much power
almost anything out there I mean if
you're trying to do you know dual 10a et
eyes I mean you'll probably be pushing
it a bit but you know any of the lower
end cards of stuff you'll be able of
enough power to do I sell I with
absolutely no problem and as it seems
you know crossfire and SLI are both kind
of coming to an end with Mike restoring
all that stuff I don't even think in a
few years people are even gonna give a
crap about that but the end of the day
if you want a solid power supply that's
not gonna break the bank has a great
five-year warranty and it's an 80 plus
gold certification then this might be
something you want to check out a little
bit putting into one of our build soon
so you guys can see it in action and if
you want any more information down below
at like button we'll have a link to it
peace out
