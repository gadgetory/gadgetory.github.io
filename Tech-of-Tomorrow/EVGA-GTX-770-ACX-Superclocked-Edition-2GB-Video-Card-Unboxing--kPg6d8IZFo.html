techyv tomorrow its launch day of the
new geforce gtx 770 from the people at
nvidia and we've got one of their
non-reference partner cards right here
to take a look at that we were just
barely able to get our little lands on
here on launch day now this is EVGA z'
SC addition there's superclocked edition
that features the new AC ex cooling now
this is their active cooling extreme
it's something new with that said let's
jump in let's take the first look of
this card and see what it's all about
alright folks first off let's go ahead
and get off this anti-static glare
packaging here take my old trusty knife
here and go ahead and wrap that and get
this stuff all off the earth is it's
probably glaring in yours and the
Camerons face so let's just go ahead and
rip the stuff off against Christmas
morning a brand new Christmas present
get that out of there
and let's first take a look at the box
first off we see two gigabytes of gddr5
memory and then the GPU boots 2.0 GPU
boost 2.0 relies on how cool the card is
so the new AC ex cooling should have a
lot to do with how well this car
performs especially in overclocking and
in the boost speeds so here we see the
EVGA name here as we transition down at
the bottom of the card we see it there
the number one partner with Nvidia
that's right it also features 3-way SLI
we see it's the SC superclocked edition
and obviously the geforce gtx 770 just
flip it around the back real quick let
you guys see the card there's nothing
really much back here about support for
for concurrent displays talks about that
the AC ex once again that's the active
cooling extreme which we'll get into
more as we take the car out of the box
but that's all there is and with that
said let's go ahead and once again take
the trusty knife out i'm gonna go ahead
and make another little surgical
incision right here on the side of the
box and go ahead and begin the unboxing
so pop the cap here
you wouldn't pull this out EVGA always
puts all their cards in a nice clear
plastic shroud there's also a bunch of
other stuff in here for us to take a
look at here in this unboxing so let me
get this out of the way and let's start
looking at some of this accessory stuff
that's falling out before we move on to
the card so where to start my friends
okay yes we'll start out here here's the
EVGA graphics card user guide inside is
a CD and also a case emblem with the
EVGA logo right there a few folks who
want to use that powered by EVGA next up
we see the attention sticker in bright
yellow just making sure to tell you guys
that the car will get hot in operation
and to make sure that you plug your
power into it to make sure the card
one's properly it doesn't plug it I'm
just gonna go beep anyways I'm not gonna
run so make sure you plug the doggone
thing in so next up we have the EVGA
GeForce GTX 750 new to it we also have
important notice the EVGA GeForce GTX
series graphics is a cutting edge card
that ships with the latest technology
including a full UEFI BIOS so you guys
can see it's current with all the latest
motherboards and all that stuff a thank
you note from EVGA we also get stickers
enthusiast built EVGA enthusiast built
for those people who like stickers you
will like these they're pretty flashy
and pretty cool now we also have done
Ton Ton Ton Ton a giant-sized poster
which I guarantee you is going to be on
the wall in fact if I can get the
cameraman to angle up you guys can see
on my wall right now I have my
old-school EVGA gaming poster it's up
there on my wall and I guess I'm gonna
have to probably replace that bad boy
with this one alright folks we had to go
extra wide on this at the same time for
you guys for when we use for our audio
setup you can see right there what we
have it's pretty cool stuff and we check
out the post right here it says the game
of bones and then down there at the
bottom folks it says arm yourself with
EVGA so with that let's pull it up
and move on alright folks so the other
three bags I went ahead and just took
the stuff out so now let's talk about it
we have two molex to 6-pin then this
plugs into your eight pin power on your
card and if you don't the proper type of
connection there are two 6-pin adapters
right here so you can use those on your
power supply last but not least we have
the DVI to vga adapter so that's all the
stuff as far as accessories now let's
jump in and look at the card alright
folks so here's the card and you guys
can see this thing actually looks quite
bad azz it's all black on the shroud
features two fans you see the EVGA name
and the geforce gtx 770 right here on
the side of the card now down here on
the bottom it's a little more difficult
to see but it says AC X active cooling
extreme you guys can see that down there
that's everything that's on the front of
the card now I don't know personally I
just think as far as looks go this thing
looks really really cool now you guys
can see it's a dual slot design see
they've mixed a little gold in there
underneath here are all of the aluminum
heat sinks right there that are helping
you take the heat away from your card we
also see the pcie 3.0 interface right
there flip it around show you guys a
long angle of the card that looks really
really cool you guys can see the three
different heat pipes that are all right
there here's another one right here now
like I stated in the very beginning of
the video folks we just got this car
today so we'll have all the performance
specs and everything about this card for
you guys in just a couple of days now
let me spin the cart around to the side
right here and you guys can see this
actually looks really clean got some
nice little design right here all in
gold GeForce GTX 770 once again see the
heat fins all the way down the side of
the card in truth this card is really
badass looking as I'm holding I'm going
down this thing really does look cool so
for some of us doing money and they want
to do black and gold this may be your
card just want to use so check it out
here's a six pin and the eight pin power
now this card has a 200 watt TDP I'm
gonna flip it around show you guys the
very back of the card you guys can see
most people now are implementing a black
PCB we've kind of steamed that across
the board with all the cards this time
and I go ahead and pull this off right
here we see the two SLI fingers and this
card can do triple SLI configurations
they place this back on here real quick
and let's move around to the rear i/o of
the card where we see DVID DVI HDMI
standard DisplayPort and these are
pretty much the same across the board no
matter what car we've looked at they've
all been the same alright everybody so
what do you guys think because in all
honesty this is actually one of the most
highest requested cards that is on the
market in fact I bet when this thing
hits the shelves at places like new wake
and Amazon it's gonna pretty much sell
like that being that it's probably going
to be priced just a little bit over $400
and it's got its new AC exit cooling
it's gonna be a very very popular item
now we know that you guys want the full
review of this unfortunately it was just
launched and we just barely got our
hands on this card but if you guys want
to see a list of pricing and different
cards make sure you guys look at the
link down the description below we'll
have all of that stuff also if you guys

bringing you here on launch day hit that
