what's up fellow youtubers and fans you
asked for it and now you've got it our
ultra crispy 4k desktop tour we even
refried this baby for you so let's first
check out the badass PC that's powering
this entire gaming area this is called
the t-virus system it's based on AMD
hardware has pretty decent scores and we
had a total video that was dedicated to
that and now it's even more cool with
NZXT SU lighting installed now it really
pops I don't want to drone on about the
system but if you guys want to see more
make sure you guys check out the link
below I get a lot of questions almost
everyday when they see our videos saying
hey man what desk is that you were using
and this desk is from ikea it's one of
the Alec series and it's really well
priced for what it does now this desk
slash table features two drawers in the
front and very excellent cable
management to keep your desktop from a
bunch of messy stuff now just recently
all of my gaming goodies are all by
Corsair and they're really nifty
products starting off with the MM 300
mousepad you guys can see that this
thing really along it's an extended
mousepad and it fits underneath my
keyboard and my mouse and I can use
everything in comfort sitting on top of
it and sitting on top the MM 300 our two
brand new gaming products from Corsair
it's the M 65 mouse and the K 70
keyboard the M 65 pro features a backlit
RGB LED it also features a high accuracy
custom grade sensor for pixel precise
tracking with up to 12,000 dpi it's
lightweight durable and also has an
aircraft grade aluminum structure on the
bottom of the M 65 Pro you can see that
it features an advanced weight tuning
system there are actually three
different places where the weights are
located you guys can see there's a
little slot you just simply unscrew this
and remove or put in the proper weight
for your gaming style and since not
everybody has the same mouse pad you
actually get a sensor that detects a
different type of surfaces so that you
can make it fit exactly what you're
using and for those who like making the
killer headshot how about some optimized
sniper button positioning this means
that you can change the DPI on the go
setting it so that you can make the
ultimate hit
in total there are eight buttons on the
m65 pro two for adjusting the DPI and
the other six are totally programmable
for your in-game environment and if
you're worried about your mouse ever
getting that weird clicky clicky clicky
sound they say they say that this m65
pro can take over two million clicks
before it goes bad that's a hell of a
lot of gaming now next up on the desktop
tour is the keyboard now this is the
corsair k70 rapid-fire edition which
features some really cool new features
now in the past there have been other
versions of the k70 this is just the
latest iteration and a series of mini
keyboards from these guys they have
entry-level ones that come in at about
$119 but this particular one is about
149 dollars and that's because of all
the new features it actually features
these brand-new Cherry MX fast keys
that's right so they're called Cherry MX
speed switches and they're really fast
usually all the old-school ones we're at
2 milliseconds for the response time
these are at 1.2 milliseconds response
time so it's really made for SuperDuper
high in gaming now underneath the keys
you can't really see it but it's a
totally aluminum frame which makes this
thing lightweight and still very very
durable and what's really awesome is you
can can program every key on this that's
right every single key on it can be
programmed you can do macros you can do
shortcuts
anything that you can think of in your
mind for gaming it's in there all
through their software package and their
software package is pretty cool because
it not only will control the keyboard it
also controls the mouse as well so you
only got to do one software download for
two products so you killed two birds
with one stone and that's pretty awesome
another cool thing about the k70 rapid
fires it comes with extra keys and all
the keys are very easy to remove so if
you want to set up your keys in a
different way or just do something to
your own design you can do it pretty
simply with the k70 on the top of the
k70 we have very minimalistic controls
we see one button that controls for
different lighting sequences then we see
a Windows lock button now what this
button does the Windows key sometimes
you hit that in a game you throw
yourself out with this button you hit it
and it locks you from being able to hit
that key at all so you don't get knocked
out of your game
I'm in the middle of an important thing
where you don't want to die and then to
the right of that we see all of our
media controls you get your pause play
all that good stuff volume pretty much
anything you need to control your audio
environment and on the back of the k7
you guys can see that there are actually
two USB cables that are going out these
both plug in your system and this
creates a USB pass-through so the any
USB device that can be plugged directly
into the keyboard without additional
power something that both the k70 and
the m65 share is the ability to change
all their lights to you know kabillion
zillion colors and this is all done
through their cue software suite that's
right
not hue many of that this is actually Q
C UE and it's you know specifically for
stuff from Corsair but it's just like
all the other stuff you see from Philips
and anybody else is just a complete way
to control all the lights now the really
cool thing is is that the way this
keyboard is made and the way the actual
keys are made the light comes through
very very clearly as you guys can see
nothing's blocked and this makes sure
that all of your lights shine brightly
whenever you have them on inside of the
cube profile you can control a lot of
different aspects it has places for
profiles action lighting and settings
and you can also to the effects window
change many different things of these
lights I mean there are so many
different lighting effects that you
could spend pretty much hours just going
through all the different ones and
trying them out another question you
guys are always asking you guys are like
Elric what are those speakers okay well
those are the audio engine a2 plus red
limited edition premium powered speakers
the audio engine 2 plus speakers are
pretty cool they have their own built-in
deck which allows you to send
high-quality digital audio directly from
your computer's USB port they feature
built-in power amplifiers dual analog
audio imports USB audio inputs custom
Kevlar woofers and silk tweeters and for
you energy-efficient people they even
feature a power saving mode the monitor
I'm currently rocking is the Acer
predator xB 271 HK this is a 4k uhd IPS
NVIDIA GC gaming monitor it features a
27-inch black display with a 4
millisecond response time and 60 Hertz
refresh rate
and if for some reason you don't have
the space or the money to afford some
desktop speakers there are two speakers
built inside and real quick folks before
I talk to you guys about all the light
that you guys see in the video I want to
send a special shout to Braintree for
making today's video possible even the
best mobile app will not work unless you
have the proper payment API and that's
where these folks come in to solve all
your problems
this is where brain trees V zero SDK
comes in one amazingly simple
integration gives you every way to pay
it supports Android iOS and JavaScript
clients and it offers a simple
integration that you can do in minutes
if this sounds good to you try it out
for yourself in the sandbox all you
gotta do is go w w Braintree payments
comm /t o T so real quick before we say
bye-bye to all you folks I want to talk
to you guys about the hue lighting
system this is what's lighting up
everything behind us in the desktop we
have a lighting strip back there behind
the desk we also have a spotlight and
then we have two light bulbs inside of
the two table lamps that you guys can
see the hue lighting system is really
cool and you guys have probably seen it
in many of our videos lately because we
use the heck out of it because it's just
really cool so if you're looking for
something total like spice up your
mancave your your room the hue lighting
system is really cool because you can do
so many different changes so many
different variations that you can pretty
much make it look like whatever you guys
want it to look like now like usual if
you guys want to find out any
availability or purchasing any this
stuff that you guys saw in today's video
and make your own man cave your own
little bit desktop we'll have that down
there below the like button if you guys
liked what you saw you know what to do
I'm Eric you've been watching teka
tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
