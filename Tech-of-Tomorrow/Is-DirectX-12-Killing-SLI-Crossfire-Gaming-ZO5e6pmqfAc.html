back once again to the channel where I
talk to you guys about something that
seems to me is starting to just slowly
fade away and that's SLI and crossfire
now DirectX 12 when it came out it
brought very little improvements to
games as far as I'm concerned I want to
hear you guys opinions like always
because we heard decade' Mart we're
interactive but for me DirectX 12 really
hasn't made me go home in any really way
shape or form and in another way it
seems like we're seeing less and less
crossfire and SLI now even though
crossfire and SLI is actually a pretty
small segment of the market you probably
be surprised out of all the triple-a
titles you're probably talking at best
maybe 26 percent of the games that are
out there so and I mean I'm being fair
with that it's probably a little bit you
know a little bit less than that
actually because none of the little
small games that are out there you even
bother to get that kind of support
because you don't need it only those
triple-a tires with explosions tanks
people airplanes explosions you know all
kinds of killer you want to see the face
all that kind of stuff all those type of
games you know will benefit with using
two cars but any game you know like
you're playing like back John or some
you know thing you're looking down on
Dungeons and Dragons type stuff I mean
sure having two cars might be cool but
any single card is going to kick ass
because let's just face it you can play
those games on a Mac I'm sorry I said
the bad word but anyways as we see
DirectX 12 coming out right now there's
actually no games on an Envy aside that
supports SLI and only a couple of titles
over on the AMD side so with that said
is DirectX 12 actually killing SLI and
crossfire or other devs
just becoming lazy now with the release
of DirectX 12 we see a lot of things
going on on both the a and B and NVIDIA
side and that's using low-level api's
now high-level API does a lot more stuff
you can't control it as much by the devs
it's all like pre-programmed but it's
already done so a high-level API which
you saw in DirectX 11 which what you
know why it supports crossfire and SLI
better is already done a lot of the
programming stuff with a high-level API
when the devs get the stuff they don't
have to do is
much to make stuff work but with a
low-level API it's easier for them to
work with but all that stuff that was
already pre-programmed in there just
isn't there
so having multi GPU support even though
it should be there seems to be something
the devs are either just it's either
just way too freakin hard for them to do
it or they're being entirely lazy I mean
let's just face it directx12 it took a
 ton of time to get here it got here
and honestly it was just kind of it's
like ok it's here
you know Vulcan came out and obviously
for Vulcan it did help for a and B for
their side you know it gave them some
good stuff but it was nothing to do with
he's only saying oh hey we landed on
Mars you know it was just like okay it
actually made AMD just act a little
better with just you know since AMD has
been the underdog for a long time we all
cheer for the underdog I've said this
many many times now in front of my mark
poppin over on babel tech reviews he's
done tons of reviews like with sli and
crossfire and stuff and actually just in
the last few years alone the support for
doing crossfire and sli even before
DirectX 12 was just slowing down there
weren't as many games if you guys
followed my channel you know I've done
videos in the past where we showed you
like all the older games you know
DirectX 9 DirectX 10 DirectX 11 there's
a ton more games back then that
we're supporting SLI and crossfire and
now we see ourselves at DirectX 12 and
there's hardly any games whatsoever now
I know that some people I could slip
this in the past they were like oh dude
you're wrong but I'm not wrong okay
Nvidia only supports natively and says
oh hey you know we agree with this two
cards in SLI they don't support three
they don't support for that's not saying
that they're against it they're saying
it's not going to work I want to clarify
that it's just saying that they're not
they're not going to put their name on
that and say yeah you're going to get a
lot more performance because you don't
after the first two cards that start
slowing down you know 30 percent and 15
percent now for the true enthusiasts
though who wants that kind of power and
doesn't give a flying frak about the
cost of that well right now DirectX 12
is pretty much killing that market I
mean if you're building a system today
and you're like oh wow I just want to
play the latest DirectX 12 games you're
going to be Sol then this is just not
going to happen so I mean I feel right
now I don't really know what's going on
because obviously both AMD
Nvidia they're not going to be going oh
yeah just forget about crossfire forget
it forget about SLI they you know I'm
sure that they wish that it was working
better so I don't think that it's
actually the companies themselves the
video card companies because why would
they there makes little reason for them
to do that whatsoever
you know what I mean but for the devs on
the other end maybe they're just
thinking oh well people don't care about
this where it's just so frickin hard to
implement that they're just not able to
get there yet because let's just face it
this low-level API from these guys
they're given out now is a lot different
than the high-level API that you saw in
DirectX 11 so that's going to make a big
change in the market now will this
change in the next few years
hell I don't know but I really hope that
it does most of my systems including
ones you guys can see behind me I
usually use SLI or crossfire I just like
it regardless of the micro stuttering or
lalalala I have it I have a g-sync
monitor so that doesn't really
matter at all it corrects pretty much
all those things so it's you know going
to constantly hopefully bill you can see
the same thing in free sync the only
thing I really see between free sync and
gsync though is most of the free sync
monitors that I see only support up to a
hundred you know megahertz I'm not
seeing you 144 120 I'm sure there's some
app that I haven't seen every single
solitary market but with a g-sync Conor
you can get 144 heard so there is a
little side of a difference there so at
the end of the day folks what do you
guys think do you really even care about
SLI do you care about crossfire anymore
is it something that you're like going
wow I like yeah it's like a big thing
we're missing you guys it's like yeah
that shit's past name man give me the
absolute that is the best video card
there is and screw the rest you know I
want to know what you guys are thinking
because obvious you guys the audience
you guys out of the world I'm just me
here at tikka tomorrow guy with two
thumbs layin peace out so check you guys
out later is directx12
killing SOI and crossfire</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
