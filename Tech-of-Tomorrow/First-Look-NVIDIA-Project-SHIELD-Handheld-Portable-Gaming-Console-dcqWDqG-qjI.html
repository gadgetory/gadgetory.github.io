first marketed product that we're
selling as an nvidia branded product it

leader in mobile and mobile processing

there's three primary use cases the
first one is it runs Android so you can
do basically anything in Android that
you can that is supported that doesn't
require it to be a phone or have GPS so
the basic instead of trying to play a
game on your phone with all those funky
buttons this thing takes over all the
bumps and functionality and makes you're
basically enter the voice like a super
portable gaming device right exactly yet
and the second of each case is
announcement video grid which is our new
cloud server systems which is going to
enable content providers to provide
console quality games the mobile devices
so now possible you games to mobile
devices now you can get it on this you
know console quality
joy state exactly so basically then how
many different types of games you guys
already have pre developed before this
is going out right now I don't remember
TegraZone has lots of games over 60 and
what do you guys know like basically is
there a target price for this we don't
know that yet I'm an engineer marketing
