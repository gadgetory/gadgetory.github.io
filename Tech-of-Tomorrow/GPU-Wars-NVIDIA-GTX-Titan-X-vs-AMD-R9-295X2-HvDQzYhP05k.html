295x2 are two of the biggest baddest
graphic cards on the planet and today we
put them head-to-head
what up tech fans welcome to tech
tomorrow I'm Eric your host and today we
have a battle royale AMD vs. NVIDIA real
quick a shout out to audio blocks for
that awesome intro music and sound
effects if you guys want to check this
out you guys can get a free 7-day trial
by checking out the link down below the
GTX Titan X is the newer of these two
cards
it's the market at around $1000 and
packs a thousand megahertz core clock it
has 12 gigabytes of memory a 384 bit
memory interface and 336 point 5
gigabytes per second of total memory
bandwidth the r9 295x2 is also around
the thousand dollar price point but this
card is older and you can pick this
thing up for about six to seven hundred
dollars just like the XFX model we're
taking a look at today unlike the Titan
X which is a single GPU card this is a
twin GPU monster which packs a thousand
eighteen megahertz core clock eight
gigabytes of memory on a 512 it memory
interface and 5632 stream processors now
let's check out those gaming benchmarks
and the benchmark song tomb raider at 4k
ultimate settings we see the r9 295x2 at
50 6.2 average frames per second the
Titan X was lower at 46 point one
average frames per second Metro last
light once again 4 km medium settings
the r9 295x2 shows a seventy seven point
five average frames per second the Titan
X comes ahead in this one at 79 Everage
frames per second battlefield for 4k
ultra settings the r9 295x2
the table at 56.8 average frames per
second and the titan exit 44.9 average
frames per second letting the r9 be the
winter and this one clearly next up far
cry 4 in 4k high settings the r9 295x2
gets 38.5 average frames per second the
titan x 40.4 average frames per second
with the lead going to the titan x next
up Crysis 3 in 4k medium settings the r9
295x2 scores 88 average frames per
second the titan x 60 7.1 average frames
per second showing the r9 295x2 as the
clear leader next up fire strike ultra
the 4k benchmark the r9 295x2 shows 4281
the titan x 3938 once again showing the
r9 295x2 as the leader so you guys can
see for the most part in gaming the r9
295x2 is kicking butt now there are some
things taking consideration this is a
dual GPU card but that 12 gigabytes of
memory and all that cuda stuff is going
to come in a lot of play when you're
doing workstation type of stuff so if
you guys want to see some workstation
style benchmarks let us know by going
Jackie Chan style on that like button or
Chuck Norris your choice once again a
