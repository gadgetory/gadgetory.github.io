Thursday so let's do a little time
traveling and go back to five years ago
we're here on tech of tomorrow we built
the incredible Metro last light system
now this was an insanely over-the-top
system at the time it had pretty much
top-of-the-line parts on it it was
custom painted I mean all in all this is
just a crazy looking system I mean from
the front you can even see it's got its
liquid cooler you can see it right in
the front the reservoirs right there in
the front so it looks really cool also
has a lamp Tron fan controller so all
the fans can be controlled digitally and
everything
it even has guess what whoo a CD player
yeah and check it out
the case is the cooler master stacker
case now this case was really crazy
because it came with three different
components a bottom component a middle
component and a top component and we use
these three different components for
different things in the very bottom
component we put all of the different
drive so our SSDs and all that stuff
we're all stored and in the top we
stored all of the liquid cooling and all
that type of stuff
now you guys can see taking a look
inside the system everything is on a
custom-built you know liquid cooler
everything is made it out of Swift tech
parts that we were able to get at the
time maybe a couple of our other
companies but pretty much everything was
made by Swift tech with the Swift tech
pumps and everything and what's really
interesting about this particular system
is it's actually two completely separate
pumps and everything else they actually
meet in the middle to cool off the video
card so both of the video cards are
being a liquid cooled and the CPU and
you guys didn't see the system still
looks crazy umm it has the nice Metro
last light right on the side of the
glass it's all nice and artsy fartsy and
all that good stuff and and all the
components look really nice so we have
an msi empower max motherboard now on
the motherboard we have an i7 4770k chip
now this particular chip is overclocked
to 4 gigahertz
everything's running great actually the
system is will show you a little bit
down the line is still running very cool
as well
and the two video cards are to seven 80s
at the time these were actually or right
before the 780ti scam out so they were
like top of the line at that particular
time and you guys will see that even in
the scoring these particular cards in
SLI are scoring like a 1070 and a lot of
injured instances excuse me so it's
still you know actually packing quite a
punch for a system that is this old I
mean think about it
this system is five years old and it's
still packing a punch now we have two
different SSDs in this particular unit
one by Corsair and one by Kingston
unfortunately the Kingston Drive
actually failed I actually went to go
access the drives a couple minutes ago
and that particular drive just totally
just went and doesn't work anymore and a
lot of people back in the day kind of
kick this kingston SSD and really liked
it I don't even think Kingston even
they've got you know went past that and
made new products we've got 16 gigabytes
of the Corsair memory inside this bad
boy all in all just a really solid
system we're actually using an external
hard drive for all the games I've
started doing that a lot lately cuz I
just feel it's better I can take the
hard drive to whatever system I'm going
on or just playing my games and not have
to worry about limitations of the system
and as long as I backed that hard drive
up my games are here forever so in that
respect we're doing pretty good now this
system does have a little bit of a sound
to it with all the fans turned off with
all the fans turned on and everything
else you can hear the system now right
now in the background the system's
running full blast I have all the fans
running full blast they could be
adjusted to be lower but I prefer to
keep this system just with all the fans
going inside of it keep it running nice
and cool and it looks just nice the
system runs nice it looks nice if we
were five years ago this system would be
like you know the shale I love what's
going on now with that said though let's
jump in and let's check out a few
benchmarks and just see how does this
system that's from five years ago do
today
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
let's see
now check this out Tech fans 36 Celsius
on the video cards that's right these
things are running really really cool
and you guys can see the CPU is running
really cool as well so you know that
liquid cooling systems actually doing
its job alright so there you go our very
first throwback Thursday video if you
guys like this would like to see like us
bring back our old systems and re-show
them or do like retro videos on Thursday
let me know we can make this a new
series in the channel or every week we
have throwback Thursday and we do retro
or old systems please let me know like
usual we will have links to as many of
these parts of they're still selling
down there below so if you like to
design yourself a system like this you
probably can but why do I use old parts
I wouldn't but hey you can find a bunch
of these parts to use and put something
together but you know like I said this
system's five years old but for a five
year old system it's still doing pretty
doggone good and I think many people out
there would still love to have this
system inside of their house for a
gaming rig in fact I'm the guy who works
on my guitars he was really interested
in the system but he wanted to do VR and
I just really didn't think it was
cutting for VR for the future with 270
ATS and if you're wondering what
happened to my finger right here oh I'll
let you know this morning at the
hospital I got my leg broke yeah and I
got my finger caught and crushed and
almost cut off my fingers I won't be
playing guitar for a little while and
even though my leg is fractured I don't
really feel it whatsoever my finger with
the stitches is just throbbing man I
have this nice scooter thing the car hit
me and I fell over and it got caught
between the bait the brake and the curb
and just went kick and crushed it
I had to stitch it up and man it's still
throbbing leg not so much so if you're
running a Hale or what the heck's up
with the bandage on the finger and you
know it's really stuck can't pick my
nose now do that doggone it I'm pretty
place to pick their nose sometime don't
they know I'm just kidding or am i
anyways thanks for watching love to hear
your guys opinions if you guys want to
see more throwback Thursday stuff please
let us know if you're not subbed hey
we'd love to see you guys back here on
the channel for more videos
I'm turning Rodef occations on and maybe
they'll even let you know that we're
making videos sometimes it happens
sometimes well it just don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
