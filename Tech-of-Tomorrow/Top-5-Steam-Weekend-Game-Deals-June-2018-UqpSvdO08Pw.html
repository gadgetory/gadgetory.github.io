again at the channel you guys know me
I'm Elric this is buddy the dogyum
behind the camera we have mr. Jesus so
what's going on this video well check it
out we have the top 5 Steam games on
sale this weekend so the sale starts
today I actually think it started
yesterday and it ends on Monday at 12
o'clock so you have all weekend until
Monday to purchase these games now three
of these games are actually Warhammer I
could have done all 5 Warhammer because
they had a whole lot of Warhammer I
could spend a warhammer weekend but
instead I found a couple other games as
well so real quick let's jump in let's
check out these games and why they're
worth it for you to buy them while
they're on sale so first off we have the
og total war Warhammer now this is
currently 75% off at $14.99 and like I
said this offer ends on June 4th at 12
p.m. so if you're into this type of game
which is pretty much a lot of battling
you get all your forces together you go
and battle the other guys and you see
you know who kicks whose ass at the end
of the day but that's pretty much it man
if you're a fan of Warhammer and you
might have some of the other series but
want to jump in and play the og version
well here's your chance to get it for
dirt cheap next up is total Warhammer -
that's right the second iteration of
Warhammer and it's currently on sale for
25% off at $44.99 now this might seem
like a lot of money at some people but
if you're into this type of game and
this genre and you love the style of the
game then hey paying that much money to
get a game that you really love isn't
that bad of investment I know it's not
like the biggest sale in the world but
still 25% off is better than a kick in
the pants and last but not least on the
Warhammer side of things we have
Warhammer vermintide - now this is also
25% off but this particular game is only
20 to 49 so like I said before this game
ends on Monday at 12 noon and if you
like the series you like the genre then
you're gonna want to get this game and
play into it I personally own all of
them I love the style game
it's lots of fun and to be honest with
you vermintide 2 is a lot different than
any of the other series it's a
completely different things so it's kind
of more like an FPS type thing it's not
so much of like an RPG thing so if
you're into the first-person shooter but
still loved the Warhammer theme and all
that this might be a game well worth you
checking out now if you're someone who's
always wanted to play in the first world
war scenario then this game is for you
this is Tannenberg and it's right now at
30% off so you can get this game for 12
dollars and 59 cents the game has pretty
cool graphics in it the engine seems to
be pretty well built as well it doesn't
lag a lot and stuff I found it to be a
pretty okay game it wasn't the greatest
game they've ever played in my life but
let's just face it it's $12 and 59 cents
you probably spend more than that when
you go out to get lunch for yourself so
why not play a game that you can spend
hours and hours playing for less than 13
bucks I mean seriously it's not the best
game in the world but it's got a lot of
things going for it that I think you'll
still really like now this last game is
Rising Storm to Vietnam and this game
seriously kicks ass it has a meta score
of 81 which means that lots of players
out there favor this game and like it
the engine in this is really nice
the graphics kick ass and if you're into
first-person shooters and you're always
been in like that Vietnam era thing this
game is totally up your alley and
currently it's 50% off so it's only
$12.49 and like I said $12.49 is
absolutely nothing of an investment and
there's plenty of hours in gameplay in
this to make it totally worth your wild
so if you've got an extra few bucks
you're in the Vietnam thing you'll love
purse first excuse me you love
first-person shooters there's all kinds
of things to doing here you shoot stuff
you fly helicopters all-in-all it's hell
of a lot of fun alright so there you
have it like usual we'll have a link
down below where you can check out these
games for yourself there were some other
games if they
all ending in like 20 hours 15 hours I
didn't want to have the fiasco like the
last video I did so I decide to strictly
stick the things that were going to
going off sale that we're going to be
going off sale on Monday so thanks for
watching tech Oh tomorrow we've got a
lot of great things coming up including
a giveaway of a GTX ten atti
in co-sponsorship with nvidia and that's
for tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
