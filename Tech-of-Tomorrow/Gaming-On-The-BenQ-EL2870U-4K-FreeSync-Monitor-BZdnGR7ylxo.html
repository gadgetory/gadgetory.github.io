il-28 70 you 28 inch HDR monitor but
before we check that bad boy out

to look looking for a tool to take on
your PC opponents give the strafe mark
to RGB mechanical gaming keyboard a look
today so if you're looking for a new
keyboard to get your game on
check out the strafe now today we're
gonna be checking out the bank you like
I said al 2870 you monitored and this
monitor features HDR 10 it's a free sync
monitor so to work with all the current
and B cards other so you can get flicker
free gaming now everything about this
monitor is pretty much geared towards a
gamer this is a gamers monitor it's not
really meant for people who are going to
be doing artwork or stuff like that the
color correction on this won't be exact
for one thing this particular monitor
features a TN panel we talked about this
in other video TN panels actually have
the fastest response time this
particular monitor has a one millisecond
response time which is very fast however
the color gamut on it is only 75% of
what real color is so if you're an
artist and you need to match colors and
do stuff like that in Photoshop you
probably would not want to get this
monitor but for a gamer who's playing
games
none of that stuff really does matter so
let's talk about the design first off
about this monitor the one thing I want
to mention right off the bat it's on the
front you guys will see there is a very
giant bezel around the side I think this
is a really giant bezel and today's you
know technology
and if I was going to be you know using
monitors for building surround vision or
anything like that
putting threes monitors together for me
wouldn't exactly be the best thing
whatsoever because of this the screen
itself is a very very nice screen its
flicker free it has eye care
technologies it has a different bunch of
different stuff inside of it for blue
also has some brightness intelligent
plus so all kinds of technologies inside
of the particular panel are geared to be
so that you can play your your games on
your monitor though for hours and hours
on end um 16 + 9 aspect ratio it is a 4k
monitor 3840 by 2160 s the resolution
the brightness on this particular
monitor is 300 c d the contrast ratio is
a thousand to one the dynamic contrast
ratio is twelve million to one so
there's a lot a lot of stuff there
although like I said before the colors
on a TN panel aren't going to be the
absolute best reproduce you know like
life life but that truly doesn't matter
if you're a gaming you're looking for
technology it's going to be very fast
and it's not going to give you a
headache now as far as the stang go it's
really basic stand
not too much adjustment either that's
one thing about this particular model I
guess it's a caveat about it is the
stand itself only gives you a tilt from
5 to 15 percent so that's really not
very much there's no kind of adjustment
for you know the height or anything like
that you can't pivot the monitor and
although I guess you know probably most
gamers won't want that anyways but for
other people who are doing stuff I guess
you know they do there a point it's
gonna matter they're gonna say oh I
don't care I'm just gaming that's it
just depends on you your aspect of you
know what you're doing with the monitor
and if for some reason you don't want to
use the stand the monitor can be mounted
to your wall by the vase amount i'm also
inside the panel you can't see them
there are 2 2 watt speakers inside of
there so if you don't want to use you
know audio speakers you can use these
there's also a headphone jack which will
also double for a speaker jacks if you
want to plug your speaker's directly
into the panel you can do that the
on-board speakers do provide adequate
sound they're not going to blow you out
of the water and they're deaf
not so loud that your neighbors can hear
it but for generalize gaming surfing the
internet and just doing stuff like that
the speakers do work pretty well we'll a
discrete set of speakers with a
subwoofer sound better
yes but hey this is onboard nets
included
the on-screen display it's really easy
to use it's right located on the front
and you'll notice right on the
right-hand corner of the monitor there's
a little button that says HDR and this
particular button allows you to turn the
HDR on and off when you're inside of
games they'll let you know if um HDR is
being enabled and being used like in the
game pray that I've been playing a back
you're behind me and pray it actually
shows that the HDR is being simulated
inside of the game now HDR is really
meant to give you the actual best
lighting inside of a game it makes a lot
more areas inside of the screen are all
lit up and the pixels per inch is
particular monitor 150 a in the panel by
the way bet it mention that and you can
also access the on-screen display right
from the front on the bottom right hand
corner right underneath that HDR button
so you just click the buttons down there
you can easily scroll through all the
different things inside of the OSD it's
very simple to use now the only other
thing about particular monitors I wish
that it was a little bit faster you know
on the refresh rate it's only 60 Hertz I
kind of wish that it was a little bit
faster but I will say this even after
playing games for hours on end with the
flicker free technology and writing
inside the monitor I wasn't getting a
headache which kind of surprised me
usually in the past by play on the
monitors that didn't have a hundred and
forty four you know I usually started
getting a headache and I didn't get a
headache whatsoever so the eye care
technology inside of the monitor
allowing you to play games for a long
amount of time um is actually a really
really good thing the monitor does excel
for playing games which is what it's you
know geared for in you it's not geared
for doing art or anything like that and
then you guys can see in game here and
pray everything looks very very nice
inside of this this game everything
looks you know it's still cartoonish
though that's one thing you know a lot
of people have complained in the past
about games you know like if you enable
all the goodies everything starts so you
know getting slower
well that's because inside of these
environments they're recreating you know
we're trying to recreate you know the
natural world as much as possible and
the more natural and
we're real that it's going to look well
then obviously the more taxing it's
going to be on your system all around
hooking up your system to the e l 2870
you is very simply done there are two
HDMI ports these are both the 2.0
version and there's a single display
port and this is the 1.4 version and
also like I said before there's a
headphone jack for either hooking up
your headphones or hooking up to
external speakers games look absolutely
great on the e L 2870 you there's
nothing about this monitor in gaming
that makes you go oh my god I don't like
this and in fact even though this is an
LED backlit monitor there's no light
bleed whatsoever so if you're looking
around the sides your monitor you're not
gonna see any kind of light leaking
through there's no bleeding whatsoever
all the colors are just fine for gaming
now there is one other caveat I don't
think it's really gonna matter though is
that the viewing angle of this is only a
hundred and sixty if you're viewing it
from off to the side instead of like you
know looking at it straight on but when
you're playing your game you're playing
your game straight on
you're not playing your game from off to
the side so having something you know
being able to view it from the side
being important I really think it
doesn't matter whatsoever I really like
playing doom this is just one of those
games you can just go around shoot
things up spin an hour and they're
getting out to your aggressions killing
stuff
there's absolutely really no plot
nothing like that going on you just
simply go around and you kill kill kill
kill kill and you know for a lot of
people that's a lot of stress relief and
when you have a really nice monitor that
you can stare at for hours on end
playing your games I think that's a
comfort all right so there you have it
all the specs and all the features of
this particular monitor I gotta say the
e L 2870 U does have a lot of features
for a monitor that comes to market at
under four hundred and fifty dollars I
mean let's just face it you get HDR ten
you get free sync also this monitor
claims that it does have 10 bit color I
looked into this and I guess that it
actually does a lot of people had said
that oh hey that's just bullcrap but um
TN panels are really slowly slowly
closing the gap between them and IPS
monitors they're really the only
difference between an IPS panel and a TN
panel at this point is really the color
gamut like if you're looking at an IPS
panel they have those two almost a
hundred percent RGB where they're like
perfect
they're mimicking you know whatever
they're looking at almost perfectly with
TN panels you still can't do that but
with the gamer if all you do is game and
sit in front of your computer and game
who cares if the orange is zero 0.58 and
not zero zero point six oh who cares
about that as a gamer that's meaningless
to you you're not going to Senegal you
know what I think the gaming developer
meant this blue to be a different color
blue man I'm not happy with this game so
if you're strictly a gamer and you want
the response times to be very very fast
just make sure you get some of the newer
TN panels that are really closing that
gap this monitor does have a 10-bit
color so you know if you have a video
card that supports all that stuff and
put that out then you'd be good to go
all the games look really great in this
as far as the text and stuff online it
looks totally solid I think that stuff's
calm you know kind of irrelevant isn't
matter whether using an AMD or an Nvidia
card really at this particular point if
you're just surfing the net I don't
really think it matters you know what
card that you're actually using I think
at that point here just you know you're
reading text and you're looking at stuff
online and both cards do that very well
now being an A and B card means that it
you know excuse me being a monitor that
supports all the AMD card so is really
great so if you have a card one of the
newer AMD cards and it supports free
sync you know you can hook it up to your
monitor it's not expensive you get all
that free sync technology means you can
play your games flicker free and not get
a headache Bink you really wanted me to
stress though about the eye care
technology and all that different type
of stuff in the monitor because I guess
a lot of people just take that for
granted and looking at the monitor with
all their flicker free and their eye
care technology like I said I was able
to play games for at least three or four
hours before I was starting to get eye
fatigue and I mean I'm a guy in my 50s
and I used to only be able to play games
for like less than an hour unless I had
a monitor that could do 144 Hertz so
even those particular monitors only 60
Hertz I'm still will to play games on it
for hours on end without getting any
type of headache whatsoever which also
translate if I'm gonna be working online
you know just surfing the net checking
my email doing all that stuff I'll still
be able to do that for long hours of
time without gonna rub my eyes and going
oh my god why am I feeling such fatigue
because the fatigue comes from the
monitor
you know blinking and stuff
all that blinking in the background that
you're not really physically noticing
but your eyes are noticing is what
causes your headaches and so you get rid
of all that stuff about the table
headaches are gone at four hundred and
forty dollars I have to say this is an
editor's choice product I honestly wish
it was a little bit bigger a little bit
bigger virgin you know would have been
really nice you know the 16:9 aspect
ratio though it's perfect for this
particular monitor the price is perfect
I feel the only caveat
like I said before are the very thick
bezel I don't really like that
whatsoever I wish it was smaller so I
could put three of them together that's
just my thing I I've been whined and
looking for the perfect monitor setup in
this corner back here behind that you
guys can't see I want to set up a big
three you know three month or a gaming
year again and have that stuff going on
I really wouldn't want to do that with
this monitor the fact that you really
can't do too much adjustment on it
that's also a little bit of a caveat but
beyond that everything about this
monitor for a gamer is spec on and right
on so if you guys want to see more
information about this particular
product buy one for yourself or just to
check it out we'll have a link down the
bullet like button where you can do so
