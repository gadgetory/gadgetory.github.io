yes I know when I did the unboxing I
forgot to do that actually I didn't
forget I just didn't see it I was just
so excited about having 20 guards in the
outside it started taking that stuff out
of the boxes and look at it and trying
to bring as much stuff to you guys as
possible but there was the cool effects
in the box by the way if you happen to
miss the unboxing and you care what
comes inside of the box check out that
video we'll have a link down below now
today we're gonna actually be able to
bring you guys the scores that's right
how does the zotac amp Edition r-tx 2080
perform well it performs pretty well I
have to tell you guys it's the big thing
right off the bat I just want to tell
you guys this card runs really really
cool compared to all the other reference
models that we've tested in house you
know the founders edition card this card
runs at 67 Celsius under full load that
is the lowest temp of of all that we've
seen at all on these cards now the card
itself is completely based on a
different design than the reference
design as well if you guys hadn't missed
the other video on top of the card you
guys can see there are three fans now
these three fans what's nice about them
is that each one can be individually
controlled which is great because you
know maybe it's hotter in one spot or
another and you want to turn the fan up
or turn them lower on a different spot
with this card you can do that that's
pretty nice feature also the back panel
is very nice so that we don't get your
hands cut on any other stuff and that's
pretty much the differences in this card
compared to the reference design is
pretty much just the fan aperture and
the back of the card the rear i/o is
still identical you have three display
ports an HDMI but what's really cool is
you have a new USB type-c port this is
going to be used for all the new VR
headsets that are coming out which will
make VR just totally much better
experience all the way around when it
gets here now as far as the specs go
it's pretty much also identical to the
reference card 2944 CUDA cores the only
difference is the the r-tx cores that
are inside of this one are at 57 instead
of 60 so and trust me when it comes to
scoring you'll see this
particular aspect of the card doesn't
really make much difference whatsoever
it's still an eight gigabyte card now
another thing about this card is if
you're an overclocker and we'll be
bringing you guys a completely separate
review on the overclocking aspects of
this card these guys have their
absolutely own dedicated software called
firestorm and inside of there you can
actually control the spectral lighting
that the card has as well so if you're
in the RGB and changing your lights
although we're at a different stuff
inside of the firestorm software you can
do all this stuff you can control your
lighter you control your overclocking
all of that good stuff
another thing about the zotac amp
Edition r-tx 28 is it really runs very
very quiet in fact the system fans in
the system back behind me we did all our
testing the card you could really never
hear it even when it's under full load
and the fans are going as fast they can
the card remains pretty damn quiet which
I really like all the way around are
they you know all the r-tx cards the
reference models are quiet and so far
this is the very first aftermarket what
we've seen it runs really quiet as well
I know you guys really want to get right
into the scoring of the card it's the
most important thing but if you guys
wanted to know more about the tu 102
chip that's you know running this entire
card check out my launch day video on
the two cards the 2080 III and the 2080
and I talked about all the different
aspects that are in the technology
behind this card now the system that
we're using for testing we've been uses
for testing for quite a long while
features an i7 a 700 K we've got 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory all in all it's
a very very pretty decked out system
it's not the highest system in the world
but it's still a really nice system for
testing games on we're using the latest
version of Windows with all the latest
updates that are out there for all of
our AMD testing we use the latest
drivers available at the time of our
testing and for NVIDIA we use the latest
beta driver that was provided for the RT
X cards so let's go let's rock out to
the benchmarks
now the bass clock speed of the Samba
dition card is fifteen hundred and
fifteen megahertz and it has a really
nice boost clock of eighteen hundred and
thirty megahertz okay so we're to start
off on my conclusion cuz it's like I
like the card
I admit it it's a really nice car now
it's eight hundred and thirty nine
dollars though for this amp addition
card and when you see really the numbers
right out of the gate compared to the
old 1080i cards the numbers just don't
scream hey I need to go out and upgrade
right now now this ZOTAC amp edition
card it is a very nice card it runs
really nice has really nice I mean
really nice boost clock eighteen hundred
thirty megahertz that's just rather box
not even tinkering around it does that
pretty much just automatically when it
wants to when it's running in the proper
cooling so that's a really good thing
now being that it's eight hundred and
thirty nine dollars you kinda have to
weigh things a dunk okay you know my TI
card gets this many the new twenty
eighty gets this many and the price $839
it makes it really hard for me as for
like you know to recommend is an upgrade
to really be able to up forty two to say
that I really can't say hey go out and
ditch your 1080i and buy yourself a
twenty eighty now twenty eight TI it so
it is more powerful obviously you're
gonna be paying a lot more money but
still eight hundred and thirty nine
dollars is big bucks for a card no
matter how really nice the car it is so
far out of all the cards that we seen
this one definitely runs the quietest
and the coolest it's probably the
cheapest as well because both the
reference ition of cards I think are
like thirteen hundred bucks and then a
thousand bucks so this card still almost
two hundred dollars less than those but
if you're a guy out there you have a
1080i and you're really just going to
okay man I'm thinking about upgrading I
honestly think I'd wait just a little
longer or save my money it's like and
get a twenty eighty Ti so at the end of
the day even though this so tech amp
Edition is a really great card I thank
you guys at ZOTAC and trust me I'm not
beating up your card in any way this
more has to do with in bidding they're
pricing then you guys so don't be upset
but I cannot recommend going on and
paying eight hundred thirty nine dollars
unless you're just buying into
market and getting a new system and you
want to be future proof so if you're a
guy getting ready to buy a new card out
there and you're okay it's like six
hundred and ninety-nine dollars to get a
1080i or it's eight hundred and thirty
nine dollars to get a twenty eighty then
I would definitely recommend just
getting the twenty eighty every time all
the time because that cards gonna be
much more future proof as the drivers
improve the card will actually run
better run faster and be a better card
all around
unfortunately this card and all its
technology are really in its infancy so
I'm Elric like usual level link down
below for more information if you want
to check out so Tech's website or buy
this card for yourself it will be down
there we thank you for watching we
should we should we wish you were sub to
the channel and if you ain't got
notifications turned on well then turn
them on and we'll see you in your inbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
