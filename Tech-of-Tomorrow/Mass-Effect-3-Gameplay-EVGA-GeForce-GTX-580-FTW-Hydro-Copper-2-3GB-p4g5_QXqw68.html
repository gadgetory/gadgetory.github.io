here in the techni morrow youtube
channel bringing you guys something
really really cool now you guys might
have seen on my other channel
motherboards that where i had building
the Beast part 1 2 and 3 well right here
i have the beast back behind me this is
an awesome system it features the gtx
580 the FTW hydro copper to 3960
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz it's got
lots of great stuff but the main thing
is game playing so today I'm going to be
taking a look at one of the latest games
to come out this is mass effect 3 and
this game looks really really cool it's
also a bit freaking pricey though being
priced out at 59 and $79 I was lucky a
friend of mine actually sent me a hookup
thanks a lot brother I totally
appreciate that thank you cuz I I can't
afford 79 bucks can you that's his nuts
shit but anyways I started playing the
game I brought you guys actually a fraps
video paying the very first level of
this game so I have everything set to
fully high 2560 by 1600 there's only
really a very simple GUI on this to
change your video card settings there's
no extensive stuff but I have everything
set to the highest it allow in the game
I'm getting pretty decent frame rates
when i'm using fraps the fraps closes
down the frame rates it makes them lower
but you guys can see right here i'm
playing the game when up here in the
corner if i get the camera in to zoom in
over here in the corner of my screen up
here in the corner we have the 60 frames
per second you guys can see that i'm
actually in game playing now and frame
rate seem to be staying pretty much at
60 I'm I have to go back in and check it
out and see if I have vsync locker some
that it won't go higher that's totally
possible but I'm really not dropping
below 60 frame rates you guys can see
here's on-screen action here's a bunch
of ships flying and still saying at 60
you guys saw it did drop for a couple of
frame rates there for a second but
overall this game looks great and it
plays great that said let's jump in and
let's take a look at this fraps video as
I play mass effect 3 at its highest
level settings
you two all right get down to see you
keep your head down nice job
and back that company
so that's it folks I mean I guess we
could call this video today it should be
basically massive x3 on the gtx 580 FTW
hydro copper 23 gigabyte version on the
dell 30-inch monitor so take that in
consideration I have everything set to
its ultra settings I have a 30-inch
monitor and the frame rates are still
staying at about 60 all in all so that's
really damn good so I say at the end of
the day this is a pretty fun game and if
you guys are looking to get it it looks
pretty interesting I like the way that
you create your character can custom
choose the way you want to play your
character there are a lot of neat stuff
in this game so that said I'm fucking
out of here I'm going to go back and
play the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
