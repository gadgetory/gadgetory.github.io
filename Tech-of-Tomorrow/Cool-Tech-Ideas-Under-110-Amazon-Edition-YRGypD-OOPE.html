here on the channel gotta say it felt
great to take a few days off from
filming YouTube videos and just kick
back and relax I need the rest man so it
felt great so I'm back on the channel
back to doing videos again so well I
have too bad I want to say that all the
products that are in today's video we're
totally sponsored by the companies whose
products you see here be for me on the
table there's like six different
companies here actually five companies
two of them by the same company but all
these items are actually provided by
these companies for me to bring the
information to you guys so I'll try not
to sound too much like a commercial we
played around with all these things that
had a little bit of fun with them all so
with that said though let's just jump in
and let's check out these tech items and
by the way all of these items are also
from China so they're like really good
price they're all I think all of them
are on Amazon except for one and with
that said well let's just check out this
crazy tech stuff from abroad if you're
looking for a drone that won't break the
bank but still have some cool features
the UDI u8 4 2 predator might be the
solution for you
now this drone is pretty cool because
you can not only operate it with the app
you can also operate it with the remote
control that comes with it so if you
like using your phone you can control it
that way or you can actually control it
through the controller the predator is a
6 axis gyro RTF RC quadcopter and for
beginners the predator also features
headless mode another feature of the
predator is if your battery starts to go
low you'll get a little sound on the
controller going deep deep deal letting
you know that you're running out of
battery and for you to get your drone
back to you and on the ground before it
just falls from the sky one thing about
the predator drone that sounds kind of
interesting is that it features a
360-degree flip now when you press the
flip mode button of the transmitter the
drone will enter the flip mode after
that all you need to do is push the
stick in any direction and you'll get
the drone to flip and that's pretty damn
cool because doing tricks is just
awesome
the predator also features a 720p Wi-Fi
built-in camera this can be viewed
through the app on your phone the only
thing about it however is it features no
stabilization so your feeling might be a
little bit wobbly and you can also
remove it if you don't want it on the
drone whatsoever everything you need
comes inside the box but what's even
better you actually get an extra battery
off
110 dollars one thing about the drum
however that I definitely have to
mention is jeez the cameramen when he
went out and flew the thing he just went
balls out which I feels kind of idiotic
on his behalf but he took the thing like
flying into the sky till he couldn't
even see the frakkin thing until it
actually came tumbling to the ground on
solid concrete and even though it came
from solid concrete from God knows how
fricking high in the air it was no
damage then he pretty much repeated that
sequence a couple of times until the
battery catch so mature did she laugh
sucker and and so I got to say this it's
frickin durable I mean he took this
thing so far up I couldn't even see it I
was like getting stressed go man word of
the drone goes so if you're looking for
something that's not like gonna break
the bank and it's really durable which I
think that's very important especially
for beginners you know if you're gonna
be crashing your drone especially you're
gonna be playing around the city which
honestly I wouldn't recommend I'd
recommend going to a park but if you're
gonna do that you want something that's
durable and I will say at the end of the
day this is a durable product all right
so check this out I know you guys all
know what a GoPro is now a GoPro camera
that's gonna be similar quality the
product we're going to show you today
from DB power is about $200 but the DB
power is only $70 for a 4k action cam
the DB power is a 12 megapixel
waterproof sports camera it can fill up
to 4k at 25 frames per second and 2.7 K
at 30 frames per second and it also has
a 170 degree wide angle lens one of the
photo features of the camera is burst
photo which takes three photos and it
also has a time-lapse mode as well now
as far as the waterproof design of the
DB power it can be submerged up to 30
meters which means if you're out surfing
you fall in the water anything like that
the cameras gonna keep going without a
flaw the camera also features Wi-Fi
which you can use through your phone and
it can be used from up to 10 meters away
from your phone and if you're looking to
do all this by remote control it even
comes with its own little remote the DB
power action cam comes in its own
waterproof case and that's pretty cool
so you can take it out wherever you're
going enough to worry about getting
anything wet if you don't want to but
inside of that is all kinds of
accessories including a selfie stick
bracket screws stickers just all kinds
of stuff including two 900 million
have batteries to keep you up and going
now right off the bat I gotta say that
for under $70 this 4k camera is
definitely worth the money I mean let's
just picture it if you go out there and
you ruined your Twitter at all right um
you're gonna be really bummed you'll run
some it's under 70 bucks you might be a
little unhappy but you're not gonna be
like oh my god what did I do now the
only thing about this that could have
been a little bit better but I mean what
are you expecting at 70 bucks it could
have come with its own SD card but
beyond that this thing's badass for the
price are you looking for a pair of
active noise-cancelling bluetooth
headphones and then let's check out the
leo file zero the leo 5-0 headphones can
be used in two ways not only can they be
used in the wireless mode but if your
battery's dead you can also plug them in
so you can keep going all day long if
you're a person who listens to their
headphones for a really long time and
you don't want to be uncomfortable these
headphones feature an ANC neck band and
this is best for a long time wearing
comfort and this also results in reduced
in ear pressure which means that your
ears don't get worn out from having the
cups in them for hours at a time never
miss a call with the zeros because it
actually features an incoming call
vibration alert and it also features a
built-in microphone to answer those
calls the zeros also feature pretty long
listening times you can have up to 20
hours of play time with ANC off and 15
hours with ANC on and it only takes two
hours to recharge the headphones and be
up and going again what comes in the box
will you get the zero neck band
bluetooth headphones the USB charging
cable the users guide three different
sizes of earbuds to fit different sized
ears to wire clips and a dedicated audio
cable as far as the sound quality goes
the zeros sound right in the middle of
the road so it's pretty much gonna
reproduce music as best as the way it
was recorded you're not gonna get any
bass influenced any treble influenced
it's pretty much a flat response which I
like a lot of people out there prefer
this because it doesn't actually flavor
the music or call it with any different
in type of sound you know I mean like if
you like classical music and stuff like
that you don't want to get a pair of
headphones it sound like you're like
you're listening to hip-hop that's just
that it's not going to be the same
transition so these are right straight
down the middle just take that in mind
it and also if you have the a and C on
it does change the way the music sounds
but it also cancels all the outside
noise you don't have any of that
crap going on and if you're on a plane
or something like that and the battery
starts getting low and you don't want to
use the Wi-Fi you can always just plug
it right into the jack and a plane and
be up and going so these are priced
right now at about seventy dollars the
things about them I like though is that
you can wear them for a long time and a
long period of time like at the office
or something like that if you're
somebody who sits at a desk in an office
and you listen to headphones for hours
on end the cups in your ears they don't
really have any weight or whatsoever on
them so you can wear them for a really
long time without going oh this craps
irritating me know what I mean all right
next up we have the blitz wolf selfie
stick and you're going to yell Rick what
the heck is a selfie stick mom the
selfie stick is basically a stick for
helping you take pictures of yourself
with a stick that's pretty much it I'm
just being us with you it's a selfie
stick well what's cool about it is if
you're a person out there and you do a
lot of your own vlogs and stuff like
that and you're like doing on the road
and you don't want something got to lug
around you can just sit in a desk and
all of a sudden start filming your
videos and this product is really cool
for you it's actually only twenty-two
dollars and it does offer a lot of
features for doing stuff like that like
if you're at the beach or whatever and
you've got a bunch of your friends you
can hook your camera for the selfie
stick hold it on in front of you and
take pictures of a group of people and
for that type of stuff it's really cool
but I think for the vlogger though it's
much better because if you're on the
road and you got a backpack you don't
want to lug a bunch of stuff around with
you especially you know you don't want
to lug microphones and heavy this and
heavy that especially you know a giant
tripod is just huge this thing's super
lightweight you just set it on a desk or
like I said hold it on an angle apart
from yourself and do group photos and
stuff like that I mean that's pretty
much it this product is very straight
ahead the boots work selfie stick blue
the Blitz will say that three times in a
row the boots will selfie stick boots
with something I can't do maybe you can
but anyways it's under 23 bucks 22 bucks
on Amazon if you're looking for this
type of product and you're on the go all
the time you'd like to shoot your own
vlogs or just be a little bit of a
narcissist and take pictures of yourself
this may be for you baby and it's even
got its own remote control so you can
take your photos from a distance this
next product I feel is really cool for a
niche audience if you're a person out
there
who
have like parties and you just like to
watch a bunch of stuff with your friends
but you don't have a big-screen TV or
the money and to invest in a big-screen
TV but you got a giant blank wall then
hey the t21 from DB power can really
probably help you out with that because
this projector does full 1080p and all
you really need is a wall plug it in
through your HDMI cable to any device or
whatever it has an HDMI whether you can
do it on your phone or you can do it on
your computer whatever you can take that
image and put it up to the wall and
watch it which is pretty damn cool the
t21 sounds like a terminator but it's
not but you can sure watch movies
through a lot of different sources you
can connect via HDMI USB to the SD card
slot or through VGA the t21 features
1500 lumens and this is brighter than
ordinary LED projectors with the
projector distance between 1.5 meters
and 5 meters the image size ranges
between 32 inches all the way up to 176
inches but for the best watching
experience it's recommended that the
projector is 2 to 2.5 meters away which
produces an image size of a hundred and
thirty inches controlling the t21 comes
in two different ways either included
remote control or through the buttons
that are easily located on top and
focusing the image is done by the
controller located at the front of the
projector like I said if you're in a
dorm or you're in a place it is a giant
wall and you want to have a great
picture on your wall now obviously it's
not going to be like an OLED TV but it's
still gonna be pretty cool so if you're
a gamer and you want to play your games
on a giant giant screen well you can use
this to play all your games it's not
really recommended however for doing
business presentations and stuff like
that it's more geared for people who
want home theater and just want that
giant image on their wall at 1080p and
best of all it's a hundred and five
bucks so it's not even priced really
expensive to get all those great
features and everything in this little
package ok now this last item is one
that I kind of requested because I was
like okay I blew all those things in my
house and not every single solitary
device in my house requires a super
over-the-top power surge protector some
things are cheap like toothbrushes and
stuff like that in the bathroom and I
figured hey you know what I need search
particulars for today
there's a few things out in the garage
that I'm just have going on that aren't
gonna be like the end of the world and
let's just face it not everybody has the
you know 70 80 bucks to pay for those
giant monster power supplies so this one
today that we're taking a look at it's
actually a 2-pack from a company called
power add now this is only $20 for two
of these things now they do have some
pretty interesting features and they're
kind of trippy because they're green and
white I mean they don't feel like you
know super duper heavy-duty and really
look how they really don't seem like
they're SuperDuper heavy made whatsoever
I mean but they are very very
inexpensive you get an actual 2-pack of
these for $18.99 so if you've got like
device in your home that you want to
still have some surge protection on but
it's not like you know you're worrying
about it like I just put it this way
like do you really want to go and spend
70 duck 70 ducks
would you eat 70 ducks No do you want to
pay 70 bucks for a surge protector for
your toaster I mean you know I'm saying
you really don't want to do that so this
type of product even though I know it's
a low-budget type of product does have
its use and I'm gonna hook these up
around the house and see how well they
work now I think what I'm doing with
them
they'll be just fine because like I said
toothbrushes toasters stuff like that
that's really not a high value item I
still want to have protected but I don't
want to go out and just spend seventy
dollars and everything in the house I'd
be spending like you know $7,000 on
power supplies so excuse me on
unsearched protectors so I don't want to
do that so at the end of the day if you
want a couple surge protectors and a low
budget they're real easy to get a hold
of you can just click a button in Amazon
and get them up here you go man the
power add dual pack for $18.99 and that
pretty much wraps up today's video like
I said in the very beginning all the
companies today sent their products in
for me to show on the channel so I try
not to be too commercially about them
and still bring you guys the information
but honestly man I really I don't know
why I kind of go into commercial model
because I start talking about a product
I'm always just so jazzed about
technology I do feel kind of like I get
kind of like in that little kid mode
excited mode about things oh oh new tech
new tech new tech but that's just me
like usual down below like button we'll
have links to all of these different
products you guys can check out more
information or buy one for yourself I'm
sure there's something that we showed
you today that might be
our interest and you're like hey I'd
really like to check that out that's a
great price so with that said I'm Elif
you've been watching Tekken tomorrow
we'll see you guys back on here for
regular videos tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
