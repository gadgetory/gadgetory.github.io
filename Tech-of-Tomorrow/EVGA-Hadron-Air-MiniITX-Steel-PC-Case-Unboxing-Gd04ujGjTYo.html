to tech Oh tomorrow we bring you all the
tech all the time now if you guys follow
the channel last Sunday on our news
video we promised you an unboxing and
first look of EVGA a brand new hadron
mini ITX super case and with that said
I've got this bad boy right here to my
left now the unit that we're gonna be
looking at today is the one that's meant
for air cooling at least it comes air
cooled what I mean is it doesn't come
with water cooling inside there's gonna
be two units this one you can water
cools we'll show you when we get to it
but it doesn't come pre-configured with
water cooling inside of it the hydro
Edition which we'll look at in about a
week or two actually comes with all the
water cooling stuff already
pre-installed so with that said let's
jump in and let's see this had Ron and
see if it gives us a hard-on alright
folks there's really not much this brown
box packaging I mean just has the EVGA
logo the name the only important thing
on it at all would probably be this
right here which actually describes you
know in nomenclature what it is but
beyond that there's not much to the box
I'm not gonna waste time I'm gonna flip
my little knife out there and just go
ahead and start taking this puppy out
make a nice clean slice down there make
another slice right about here and that
should probably do pop it open right
there a little bit more popping sounds
there so inside we see we've got boxes
within boxes so there's multiple boxes
so let's go ahead and start taking stuff
out of the top go ahead just pull this
stuff out and they'll check this at the
camera man like so Oh
destruction poor bastard hope he doesn't
need surgery anyways right here we have
the accessories we're gonna go ahead and
pop that open you guys can see in here
we have zip ties power cable for the
power supply extra things for the fan
just more more parts just for adding on
stuff in there and then plus we have the
Hadron users guide that's right
learn thy case let's go ahead and just
set that stuff off to the side and let's
take a look at the unit this is not
gonna be very heavy for me to take out
so I can just
very easily take this thing out and then
I'll throw the kid sit over the dog row
where he bravely sits and does not even
blink and I see
he's tough that dog all right so squid
just take a little packaging here get it
on out of there come on out of there
come on out what's this data all right
so here we go
bah boom so this thing is 305
millimeters tall by a hundred and sixty
nine millimeters wide you guys can see
it's got a nice winner here on the side
I'm gonna go ahead I'm just gonna go
ahead and pull the window right off
right off the bat looks like there are
three screws and you guys can see I had
no problem with these at all I just
pulled them off gently one rolled
actually underneath the case because
it's a Rollie pollie I couldn't pull
that off no problem at all side window
so you guys can see now inside it's
gonna be kind of hard to see but right
here is actually a gold certified 500
watt power supply now a lot of you folks
might say hey a 500 watt power supply is
not a lot but it's perfect for a single
video card you're not gonna really want
to be able to fit too much in here you
guys can see when you install your board
or whatever you will have room for a
full-sized video card you've got Bay's
right here for your hard drives and
stuff here are all your accessory cables
that are gonna hook up to your
motherboard and everything now this
thing's totally mini ITX but it's cool
because up on top up here you've got two
fans and I can't really show you this
because I'd have to disassemble the
entire dang thing so I'm gonna try to
angle it right here and hopefully the
camera get inside there so right now
this comes with two air fans but if you
wanted to you could pull those fans out
and put in a water cooling solution and
that's what these two little holes back
here that I'm finger fracking with are
four little water cooler tubes come back
through here and then you're gonna have
your rear i/o right here your power
supply back here your power for your
power supply on the back side of the
case there's nothing really at all and
this isn't removable at all so Rodney
Reynolds he'd freak out you know no
motherboard tray he'd be all mad at that
we love you rod you just giving you a
hard time brother so that's pretty much
that
that's the back of it now let's flip it
around and let's show you guys the front
which really looks nice I mean it's very
elegant looking
doesn't open or anything has a simple
power button it's gonna light up here on
top we have the name I had drawn you
guys can clearly see it's got the old
had wrong name right there
all right folks now let's just
transition back one more time to this
side now up here on top you're gonna see
a little button right here this is
actually the eject button for a sim line
CD player that you can install inside
the case I've take the whole thing apart
to show you but basically right behind
this is a place you can install the
slimline CD it ejects right out here and
this is that eject button don't see
anything else too fancy there nope so
down here we have the headphone
microphone jack and then finally we have
the external USB 3.0 and these go in
line with this little cable right here I
showed you earlier what you're gonna
plug into the USB 3.0 port on your
motherboard very easy stuff now on the
bottom
there's not much to the bottom
whatsoever you've got a riser right here
there's really no fans or anything on
here because the power supply is there
and the fan for the power supply is
actually located here on the back so
there's gonna be no fans sucking
anything up into your case to mess
anything up so that's it folks the
little badass ITX bad boy called the
head room and you guys can see this
thing's really awesome has lots of
features for a case that's so small it's
easily be able to travel round places
and with that window you can do all
kinds of mods and show off your shoes
Nick inside this ok so I think it's a
really cool thing I think a lot of users
out there are gonna want to emulate this
and make a system out of this case just
like we are
if so hate we're looking forward to it
if you guys would like any more
information about this case you guys can
see that down there below the like but
in the description we'll have all the
information about this case where you
can buy it all those little fun facts
and stuff like that so with that said I
know make sure you guys subscribe the
chance to don't miss anything and we'll
see you guys back here on tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
