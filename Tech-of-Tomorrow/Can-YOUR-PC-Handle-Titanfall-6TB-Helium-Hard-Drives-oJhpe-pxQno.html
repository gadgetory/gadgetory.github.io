news edition here at tech of tomorrow so
what's up on the news this week well
titanfall it's coming out is your PC
actually ready to handle titanfall now
the little requirements for titanfall
are this titanfall needs a minimum of a
64 bit windows seven but will also run
on Windows 8 and 8.1 on the cpu side of
things if you're an AMD gamer you need
at least an athlon x2 2.8 gigahertz CPU
and if you're an int okay Murr in a
minimum of a core two duo 2.4 gigahertz
CPU other minimum specs include at least
4 gigabytes of ram 512 megabytes of vram
and either radeon HD 4770 or geforce
8800 GT video card now a few folks out
there who are looking forward to this it
comes out March 11th here in the United
States and March 14th over in the
European countries now some people out
there goodness or opinions already said
oh it's no problem whatsoever there's a
like going holy shot going oh my god is
it going to work well we've got an
article about this and we want you guys
to check it out and give us your
opinions and actually is your computer
ready for titanfall I know mine is and I
can't wait till the game comes out but
how do you feel about it next up now
that's some whopping amount of storage
now Western Digital has already released
a drive like this they did this last
November and hit the market it was the
first six terabyte drive on the planet
now when this thing's filled with helium
it does a lot of different things for
the drive it actually allows since it's
so much lighter than air it allows for
more platters to be stacked it'll ads
for your data tracks to be done closer
together and actually keeps the dr
running a lot cooler well now seagate
never wanted to be left behind as saying
hey we're going to have our drive out by
april now where the technical specs will
be exactly the same is questionable but
you know it's going to have to be
something like that it's going to be a
bunch of stack dries inside of a
standard 3.5 inch hard drive pretty
interesting
stuff and the fact that it's six
terabytes is going to be incredible
those people out there who are in the
media stuff so if you two games you're
in the movies and restoring hey six
terabytes is the most you can get and
it's going to be pretty awesome for
those folks out there now the only
drawback is that it's currently coming
to the enterprise market so it's going
to be enterprise storage we're out to
bat and that means it's going to be
costly but as that technology trickles
down to the desktop area you know you're
going to be able to see when these
drives yourself from the next year now
last up in the tech news you guys all
know Samsung one of the biggest swing in
the entire industry will these guys are
going to have their unpacked 5 event
later this month that's really going to
be interesting now what's rumor is there
going to be releasing a brand new Galaxy
s5 at this event that happens that's
going to be very interesting I want to
get my hands on one of those and check
that out because I really love the
Samsung technology especially their
phones I love my note 3 now there are
some other further rumors going on about
this event one of the first ones is that
they're going to ditch the plots of
design and replace that with a metal
design they're also going to be
upgrading the screen to a 2.5 k screen
which would be really really interesting
