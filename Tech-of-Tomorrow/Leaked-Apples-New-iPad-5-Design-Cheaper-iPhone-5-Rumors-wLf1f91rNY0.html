where are you at you're on the tech of
tomorrow channel we bring you all the
tech all the time I'm elric with my
co-host mr. buddy the dog he's not going
to speak too much but today we're going
to bring you some updated tech news from
the folks over at Apple now you guys all
know there's been a rumored
fifth-generation iPad coming out and it
looks an awful lot like the iPad Mini
only it's nine point seven inches
instead of being the smaller one so if
you guys want to check that out see a
lot more stuff about that check that out
over on our website wewt coo tomorrow
calm also rumors of a new iphone coming
out that's right supposed to be the new
5 something 5s you know supposed to be
cheaper which means it's going to be
made crappy now I know you Apple fans
are going to hate to hear this in fact
Cameron he's not going to like this
either because he's an apple fan
boy but the new iphone 5 I consider it
to be a piece of it's so skinny so
lightweight that I feel like if I did
anything with that damn phone it's going
to break makes me paranoid so Apple
saying hey we're gonna even make a
shittier version of the phone the
is wrong with you Apple why do you just
sell it for 40 bucks and and call it the
shitty version I don't know that's my
personal opinion right now I'm kind of
thinking that Apple's made a bunch of
dumb ass moves suing people trying to
get patents on owning a storefront like
these guys are god of the universe I
don't know what's going on with apple
now last thing up and few haters out
there and in fact i have to admit i've
taken kind of laughs at this because
once again mean camera men have fought
lots about apple being the biggest dick
in the universe so for a long time they
actually were I've had some people leave
comments before saying that coca-cola
was no man fact the matter is do your
history bro Apple was until recently the
biggest dick money-making cooperation on
the planet but recently stocks have
fallen and the company seems to be
taking a little bit of a dive so I want
to hear what you guys have to think
about all the stuff and all of these
articles are over on our website Tycho
tomorrow calm so you guys can check out
the link in the description below and
check all that stuff out we've brought
in some good art
goals and this stuff is actually pretty
interesting stuff to take a look at but
I want to hear from you what do you
think do you guys think it's great to
see Goliath get hit and fall down I
personally think it is because in all
honesty I feel apple and a lot of Apple
people have had such an attitude lately
that it's kind of made me and I even got
forced into doing apple stuff because it
got so damn popular you guys know me I'm
a PC traditionalist but Apple got so
damn popular that I was forced to deal
with apple stuff in order to keep up
with the trend so let me hear your
opinions like usual me and buddy the dog
