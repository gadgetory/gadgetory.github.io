all right everybody welcome to 48 hours
with the nvidia gtx 980ti their
brand-new flagship car to hit the market
now this card is not geared it off the
person who's meek of wallet or meek of
gaming this is an all-around super-duper
card that offers incredible performance
and some new features unseen before on
NVIDIA card novices card still based on
the twenty nine of your process its
Maxwell based and it has a lot of things
going for it it's you folks are going to
like out there now right now like I said
I've got the card running in a system
got it back here behind me and in fact
the entire time that we're doing the
video the card will be running in the
background so you guys can see how
actually quiet the card is in full
gaming mode so with that said let's jump
in let's check out the card itself the
features the performance and why at the
end of the day the GTX 980 I is worth
your money
starting out visually you guys can see
this card looks like any other Standard
Edition reference card that comes out
from the folks in Nvidia they've been
using this same Signature Series for
quite a while now single fan nice
titanium looking outside you can clearly
see the 980ti nomenclature on the card
now as you guys can see as we spin the
card around this card is a little bit
different than the previous card as this
card requires a single eight pen and a
single six pin connector the 980ti has a
TDP of 250 watts and the recommended
power supply is 600 watts the geforce
gtx 980ti ships with 2,816 cuda cores
and 22 sm units the memory subsystem of
the gtx 980ti consists of six 64-bit
memory controllers equaling a total of a
384 bit memory interface the card also
ships with six gigabytes of gddr5 memory
the 980ti has a base clock of a thousand
megahertz and a boost clock of a
thousand seventy five now the boost is
entirely dependent on how cool the card
runs meaning that aftermarket cards with
better cooling will definitely be able
to overclock better than this card as
far as the overclocking goes we're not
gonna get to that in this video
everything we're doing this video was
basically on the stock clocks and like I
said there are some new features that
Nvidia brings the table and let's talk a
little bit about those first up our
volume
child resources and sparse fluid
simulation many visual effects using
games are volumetric in nature fluids
clouds smoke fire and fog are common
examples rendering complex scenes that
combine these elements together allows
the GPU to use its memory more
efficiently in turn allowing developers
to integrate more intricate effects into
their games including smoke that's
generated using Sparks fluid simulations
next up is something that's definitely
needed in DirectX 12 and that's
conservative a raster conservative
raster is one of the key requirements
needed for DirectX 12 feature level 12.1
conservative raster provides a more
accurate method for determining whether
or not a pixel is covered at the cost of
being more expressive in terms of
performance in traditional restoration a
triangle is considered covered if a
pixel covers a specific sample point
within that pixel with conservative
restoration rules on the other hand a
pixel is considered covered if any part
of the pixel is covered by any part of
the triangle by providing hardware
acceleration for conservative raster the
GPU can perform these calculations more
efficiently this in turn enables game
developers to employ novel new
approaches to enhance image quality and
last up is Ray traced shadows in the
image you can see the difference between
a ray trace at O and a regular shadow
map this also works in conjunction with
the conservative raster feature all
right so we've seen what the card looks
like we've seen the speeds and feeds we
know all that good stuff now one thing I
guess saying before we jump into the
testing this car does have a 98 Celsius
threshold which means that overclocking
is gonna be pretty good in this car the
cars got to be really really really hot
before it starts failing and that's
great for gaming so with that said let's
check out gaming performance in both
1080p and 4k and rock out to bits
three folks who like live gameplay let's
check out a couple of games in 4k glory
first stop The Witcher 3 a game that
everybody's been loving and in fact it's
really cool and it looks awesome as well
let's go right now let's check out the
settings as you guys can see I set
everything as high as it can go in 4k
and now let's check out that gameplay
now let's checkout GTA 5 another really
fun game that's awesome to play and
looks awesome in 4k
all right folks so there you have it the
new nvidia gtx 980ti in action you guys
can see it's one smoking gun unlike when
the 980 was released this card actually
does show true performance differences
when the 980 first came out the
difference between the 780 Ti in it
weren't very much at all now it actually
did everything a lot more efficient but
as far as sheer performance goes it was
not as much as we thought but the Ti is
incredible as you guys can see in 1080p
performance 20 frames per second over
the 980 in most cases that is very
substantial and in 4k 10 frames per
second awesome stuff push you guys saw a
lot of the gameplay we did in 4k it just
looks beautiful and in fact the entire
time that we've been filming I've had
the 980 running in the background so as
far as how loud the car goes well as far
as how loud the car is actually you guys
can see it's not really that loud I've
got running the test Asian Games running
here back behind me got GTA 5 going now
so all-in-all this card is a severe
winner NVIDIA has at the table was
something that people are really going
to like now all these cards will be
coming out with different models other
than the reference on launch day you
always see the reference cards that we
got that's what we got having trouble
and speech impediments here today but
that is what we have the reference card
there'll be many others coming out with
aftermarket cooling all that stuff and
we're gonna see even better performance
from those as it is right now the
reference GTX 980 from Nvidia is one
incredible card great new features great
performance it doesn't get very loud
stays pretty cool
all in all a winner for the gamers out
there I'm owner you've been watching
teka tomorrow all the information for
this car will be down but like but no
for you guys like this type of video if
not hey I'm sorry but if you guys do
like what you see make sure you hit that
sub button and we'll see you in your
inbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
