land our affairs here on the tech of
tomorrow youtube channel once again okay
so check it out I got my 27 inch imac
the i7 model and I desperately needed to
upgrade from the 8 gigabytes of RAM that
came with it so we showed you a video
previously of how we actually install
this memory into my iMac now this is the
performance video so check out the
difference between the standard 8
gigabytes of RAM and the new 16
gigabytes of ram upgrade kit from our
friends at Kingston
you
ok so you guys saw the test results from
basic just test results you can't really
see what the 16 gigabytes of RAM really
does for you because there's a lot of
other things that are involved in just
these test scores basically in the
multitasking environment with the 8
gigabytes of RAM I noticed my computer
slowing down pretty fast with the 16
gigabyte kit I know that my Mac offers a
lot more performance when I have a lot
of programs with this new memory upgrade
another thing is if you're a musician
and use virtual instruments with this 16
gigabytes you get much broader spectrum
you have many more instruments open than
with the 8 gigabytes also you get video
better video rendering and the system
just basically runs better all together
with the upgrade so overall I say this
is a great thing for people if you
really want your Mac to get the most
performance you really want to have the
most member you can get this Kingston
memory kit upgrades your Mac to the
ultimate that can it can be so thanks
for watching see you back on YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
