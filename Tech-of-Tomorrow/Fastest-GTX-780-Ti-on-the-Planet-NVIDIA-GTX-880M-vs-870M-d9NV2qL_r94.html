its natural habitat in the high grass of
the backyard and you can see he's deep
in the bush waiting for his prey to come
along where he can eat it
today's video is brought to you by
digital storm for a chance to win a free
and videos shield check out the link
down below so what up Tech fans welcome
back once again to the chance today we
got some cool news stories for you guys
going on Nvidia fans something really
cool galaxy right now has this ultimate
card that's come out man I mean this is
the most badass 780ti you're ever going
to see it's the hof hop edition and no
I'm not talking about some cold planet
in the Star Wars world and I'm not
talking about mr. David Hasselhoff
either this is the Hall of Fame Edition
and this bad boy has already set World
Records that's right man some people say
they don't really like the white PCB now
I think this thing's totally badass we
do a lot of custom builds you guys may
have saw the Tron inversion that we did
now this car would've went perfect in
there it's almost kind of a shame you
even got to throw anything on this to
keep this card cool because it looks so
awesome
also this card's made of entirely high
high high quality components and it has
a bunch of different phases for doing
your overclocking now this dude mad see
he took the hit even further man he put
ln2 cooling on this and he was able to
achieve the world record that's right
now this isn't the fire strike extreme
test over there in 3d mark and you guys
can see the record and all that stuff
down below but this guy has gone crazy
what a record needs is barely pushed it
but this card's going to be incredible
and soon you'll be able to buy this car
for yourself and if you want to go crazy
and try to ln2 you can compete otherwise
you know this car just gonna kick ass
even for your down-home and guy home
who's gonna be gaming because it kind of
superior cooling all these components
are already geared for overclocking so
even if you don't use ln2 it's still
going to kick major ass now razor has a
brand-new laptop hitting the market as
an i7 processor and this is their latest
razor blade if you folks heard of this
thing now this thing features 8
gigabytes of ddr3 memory and NVIDIA GTX
870 m graphics processor and a qhd+
display which boasts a resolution of
3200 by 1800 now that's pretty
incredible stuff right now these things
are all supposed to be really really
thin and they're gonna have extended
battery life which is awesome because
you know
you're out there gaming your laptop the
last thing you want to happen is for
your damn thing to run out of juice now
there's also going to be a bunch of
different variation that you guys did
get the configured and those will all be
down the description down below now
while we're speaking of that GTX 870 m
there's also going to be a total refresh
by the people over it in video with this
new gtx 800 M series which includes new
battery boost software now for those who
are curious the GTX 838 40 and 850 M are
all Maxwell based now the gtx 860m
however it comes in two different
variants which means it comes in a
Kepler base flavor and it comes in a
maxima base flavor
now the Kepler based one is based off in
1152 core GPU which is clocked at 797
megahertz and includes boost the Maxwell
version features a 640 core base GPU
running up to a thousand twenty-nine
megahertz plus boost now why NVIDIA has
done this I have no frakkin idea but
from a gamers perspective they're
claiming that it won't matter much
because both these things will run very
similar and not have any difference to
the gamer now jumping up to the next two
big boys the 870 and 880 M these are
both Kepler based variants and feature a
lot of similar things like I said the
ATM is a Kepler based and gets a core
clock bump of 954 megahertz plus boost
compared to the 823 my grits clock on
the GTX 780 M the GTX 870 M is also
Kepler based and jumps up to 940 one
megahertz compared to the 719 megahertz
on the GTX 775 m one thing though
however I just gotta mention that's
really really incredible about the new
gtx 880 and 870 m is that these things
have all been performance upgrades you
get a boost in all the speeds and all
that but the TDP
has remained the same so you get too
much beefier speeds but hey you don't
have to feed the dragon anymore food now
on top of that video is also rolling out
their brand new battery boost software
and what that is it's a software
solution that interfaces with the GPU
and the game in question to maximize
battery life it does this by setting up
a frame rate cap adjusting the level of
detail and incorporating a number of
additional changes that reduce the total
amount of power the system consumes now
lastly I don't know if you guys been
following the channel if you guys seen
this but captain Kevin got this a May
using titanfall PC ultimate deluxe
killer thing and I gotta say man for
once in my life the little kid in me is
jealous I saw that giant robe and I was
like Kevin I want one of those this
thing's cool it includes a whole like
action set including a giant robot a guy
trying to climb in the mother freakin
robot and then there's two dudes below
one trying to shoot the guy named the
guy kind of defending the perimeter call
a my robot alone but honestly 250 bucks
and of all the things that Kevin some
box here a ton TLD he says this is
actually worth the cash 250 bucks and I
gotta be honest with you if you're a
collector and you want one of the most
badass
kick-ass things around this is it now
