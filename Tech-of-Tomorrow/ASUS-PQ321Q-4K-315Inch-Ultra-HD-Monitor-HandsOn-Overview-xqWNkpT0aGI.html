welcome back to tech tomorrow I'm Mel
Ark your host today with my coasts Nick
from Asus and today we're gonna be
looking at some brand new 4k technology
that these guys are bringing to the
table this is pretty interesting stuff
and I'm gonna hand the microphone of the
Nick where he's gonna tell you all the
new details about this new awesome 4k
technology let's rock
so right Nick so why don't we start off
with talking about a little bit of the
technology that's behind this 4k
monitors I understand they're just a lot
of interesting things that gone into
this bill correct yeah so one of the I
mean the the biggest thing right away is
gonna be the resolution right so on 4k
resolution you're gonna get 3840 by 2160
on this monitor that's really gonna give
you a lot more real estate so some of
the key applications that people are
gonna be using this with of course
besides gaming is going to be
photography and video editing so finally
those people that have their DSLR
cameras high resolution pictures that
they're taking them they can finally
edit them and take a look at a much
higher much higher resolution on their
monitor at native at native resolution
and with the screen is big you'll have
plenty of real estate to like spread
your stuff all over the place so people
are doing a lot of editing and stuff
will not only have you know a giant
monitor they'll actually go to play
stuff around the screen to have multi
windows open at one time type of
resolution correctly 4k is technically
four times the amount of 1080p pixels so
if you're going to load up a 1080p video
on this monitor you're only taking up
1/4 of the space of the monitor so that
leaves you a lot of room whether you're
watching videos or want to have multiple
web pages up or multiple browser windows
you have a lot of real estate to work
with you now also some of the other
technologies are behind this I
understand that like this monitor is
kind of like split in half there's
actually like two screens inside of one
that actually creates the 4k can we talk
a little bit about the panel and about
what actually goes into that sure so
essentially the controller is that the
controller that powers the panel is is
only gonna be able to do about 1920 by
2160 at 60 Hertz so to get around this
limitation and be able to offer people
4k gaming at 60 Hertz or just for Kay's
experience at 60 Hertz in general we
just basically have two controllers
inside that do 1920 by 2160
and then we combine them back up into a
single image so they merge to create
that technology so that you can maintain
that 60 Hertz correct and that's use and
that's done actually on the driver side
so on the Intel side I'm you going in
collage mode on the AMD Eyefinity side
you set up the Eyefinity display a 2 by
1 and then on the nvidia side and videos
actually just gonna recognize the
monitor in
matically tile those two displays back
together a lot of people right now
understand but the technology is very
very new and a lot of the drivers from
all these companies are taking a while
to kind of catch up so at this point
right now some of the dryers are very
kind of immature but they're working on
the technology but going correct all the
major things are working you might have
some little bugs here and there that are
all being worked on by the GPU
manufacturers and then we also have some
firmware update available for the
monitor soon as visa standardization
gets set for one-four visa 1.3 right I'm
just basically gonna give all the GPU
drivers or GPU manufacturers a way to
recognize 4k monitors natively without
having to may be hard code specifically
for one model now I understand that the
powers that are used in the X are
actually they're sharp panels and
actually sharp cells this monitor for
actually what close to $4,500 that
correct for a little bit more more so in
the professional space ASIS we co
developed this with sharp and we're
slowing in the consumer space for about
$3,500 MSRP right now so think about
that if you're out looking for this
monitor know that the same technology
that goes into the sharp minor the cost
a thousand dollars more is being brought
down to a lower level to you folks at
$3,500 which may seem a little bit
pricey but this technology is so new
it's cutting edge and anytime anything's
cutting edge it's always pricey I'm sure
as these things go on we'll probably see
these things down the thousand dollar
range right probably year year and a
half yeah I mean you shouldn't be too
long and I think a couple of things that
we can mention about the monitor in
general one of the big differences is
that people that go out and buy monitors
they're really used to saying hey what
type of panel is it is a TN panel or is
an IPS panel um this is gonna be a big
change so this is neither a TN or an IPS
panel this is a new technology
altogether this is what's called IGZO
and stands for indium gallium zinc oxide
the basics all you need to know
basically is that using this new process
you can create smaller transistors and
dense pack more pixels into a dense area
so this is what allows so many pixels
over 8 million pixels to fit in one
panel now one thing I have to definitely
say to the audience I don't know if any
of you guys out there have monitors or
big TVs one of the biggest things that I
noticed about them to take it hotter
than hell there's no heat rating off
this Nick so how you working that
because I'm not feeling any heat come
off this monitor at all it's actually
almost cold and this is actually a touch
this is a really this to me the thinnest
4k monitors there are
other monitors out there moreso in the
professional space that would cost
thousands and thousands more no but this
is going to be the thinnest one and the
most affordable one and like you said
heat wise it's only gonna have about an
87 watt TDP when its operating yeah I
mean because I can feel and it feels
lower than my body so that's pretty good
on my other monitor in my room I have a
Dell monitor and I touched that thing
it's a thirty inch it's hot I mean
almost burn your hands this having no
heat at all is great I mean if you
you're stuck inside of your room and
you're working you don't have a lot of
air circulation a hot monitor increases
the temperature in your room so this
won't do that at all because it's
actually running cooler than your body
temperature I know that we're kind of
I'll set it in England right now with
the camera - so viewing angle wise it's
gonna be very similar to IPS as well so
IPS panels usually coming at around like
178 degree viewing angles um this one
coming at 176 well me I'm sitting here
totally at an angle and I can pretty
much clearly see everything on the
monitor and I'm sitting in a very odd
angle many of the monitors that I have
even around the house if you get to an
angle like this the screen kind of looks
kind of blurry and you get a lot of
color shift maybe I'm saying no color
shift I'm seeing complete even color
across the monitor and even screen but
then again you know for $3,500 you're
gonna expect but yes right you wanna you
want a quality display so some some of
the other features on ports wise it's
gonna have a display port it's gonna
have two HDMI and it's gonna have a
little USB port on side which is
essentially only intended for firmware
updates
what about Thunderbolt Thunderbolt does
not have a thunderbolt port now okay
and I understand you guys will have
different models this particular model
doesn't have like the normal splendid
technology and that some of the other
stuff does we you guys actually have
another model coming out that will have
all that as well it's kind of geared
towards the gaming more we will have
other models available they are gonna be
based on different technologies and they
will likely have more uses type features
since this was co-developed with sharp
this is kind of a bit different as far
as OSD menus if you're used to Asus
monitors in the past we've used many of
them around here as you well know I want
to buy something look I've been looking
this like the whole time and I'm really
noticing I don't really see any type of
flicker at all and I know you said
there's only 60 Hertz but looking at
this monitor I've been staring at it for
a while I don't even feel any really eye
fatigue to strain to look at it all I
mean is that normal because you know
usually people are like saying 120 Hertz
monitors were my eyes don't strain but
I'm looking at this and I see no blurry
no refresh at all I mean I suppose when
the camera guys are recording we might
see some of that in there but I'm seeing
none of that through my human eyes yeah
I mean I've had I've had a really good
experience of the panel one of the one
of the quirks is that so if you're not
in SST mode so maybe this is a good time
that we go over DisplayPort so
DisplayPort has two different modes one
that you can go through the cable with
SST which stands for single stream
transport and then it also has an MST
mode which stands for multi stream
transport so some of those that may be
familiar with daisy with daisy chaining
DisplayPort the MST is what allows
DisplayPort to be daisy chain to send
multiple signals through one cable so
you could have multiple monitors up
through a single connection in theory
with with DisplayPort but essentially
what we've used and we talked about the
dual controllers in the monitor is that
we're using MST mode to send two signals
over one DisplayPort cable to the two
controllers in the monitor so if you're
not enabling MST mode on the monitor and
you're used in 4k you're gonna be at
around thirty Hertz refresh rate okay
once you enable the MST mode and you
power the two separate panels you can up
each of those panels to 60 Hertz and
then join right so it combines the two
it combines the two of them together to
create an overall signal for the whole
panel correct and that's not gonna get
60 Hertz at 4k for the meantime until
more powerful controllers come out maybe
a year from now a bit more yeah and I
mean I'm sure as technology you know
grows they'll be coming with more stuff
as it always as always so the technology
is always growing well hey everybody
thanks a lot for watching this is pretty
much just the introductory video we're
just gonna show you some of the
technology behind this new 4k monitor
we've got plenty of stuff coming up
we're gonna show you some gaming and
some other stuff so stay tuned
protective tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
