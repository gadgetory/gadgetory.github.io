4 o'clock in the morning last night and
all of a sudden I get a text from a
friend of mine in Singapore tell me I
should really check out this thing
called bully hunters well I thought okay
well you know this boy hunter thing it's
probably Ferb like hunting bullies right
well only thing is she's telling me the
message that it's completely utterly BS
there's really no truth behind it
whatsoever it's just this completely
elaborate scam basically to buy some
SteelSeries headphones so my problem
with this is actually on all kinds of
levels now for one thing
bullying cannot be solved online by
playing a video game and going and
supposedly you know beating up on the
bully so let me try to just wrap your
guys head just a little bit around this
csgo you guys all know this game I've
played it a lot they pretty much had
this campaign going we're saying hey
women get bullied in gaming and there's
all kinds of them from around the world
you know millions of women supposedly
being bullied and online gaming so let's
just start right there first of all when
you're playing a game how do you even
know it's a girl on the end of that
character I mean how would you ever
really know I mean my son's gone online
and played a girl character plenty of
times so is somebody gonna think that
you know he's a girl and they're gonna
bully him because of that oh I mean that
to me right off the bat the first thing
is complete utter nonsense
okay not or nonsense there were a bunch
of surveys done a few years ago and
after the numbers came out even they did
that it showed to be like 284 women out
of the entire war while complaining
about being bullying and there was no
substantial proof that they were
actually being bullied as a woman now as
a man I feel that everybody should be
equality I mean let's just face it we're
almost in 2020 this is an 1840 this
isn't the caveman days this isn't the
Old West
there have been women who go to space
they're amazing women doctors and
throughout history there have been tons
of women who stand out as extraordinary
figures so why anybody Zima at this
point trying to
make women a subject of like oh the big
bully I don't even know just thinking
that way and putting that kind of
thought into your head is just complete
utter nonsense
it really is I honestly feel that no
matter what race you are no matter what
creed you are no matter what you believe
in if you're a good person and you try
your best you should be treated with
equality the only people that I feel
that should be treated with disdain are
the people who crap on society murderers
thieves Liars the people who take
advantage and abuse other people those
are really bad people and we all know
that when you're online you're playing a
game people talk a bunch of madness I've
said it before my other videos even my
son aaron has been banned from many
gaming accounts for telling people I'm
gonna kill you I'm gonna come get you
I'm going to come do this ok well gee
the cabmen kind of look stuff up and no
one has ever died in game no one's ever
come through a game no matter what the
threats and come to your house and
killed you and got you in the middle of
night they cook your children took your
food name and take the game milk and
cookies it just never happened how can
it happened you're playing inside of a
game and this gets even more ridiculous
because SteelSeries and the cum they're
doing this they're asking you to
actually give them access to your steam
account say what you fuckin hi I'm not
giving you access to my Steam account I
spent years and years and years building
my Steam account up and the last thing
that I want to do is have some idiot
hacked my account or do anything with my
account in a negative way to affect my
account so why would I want to give
somebody access to that that's just
insane and kind of no even that really
pisses me off too is since you're
bringing up this whole bullying thing
you're kind of making people become a
victim right because let's just face it
if there's a bully there's got to be
somebody who's being the victim of that
bully correct so any of these people who
are out there you know putting
themselves this position saying oh I'm
being bullied they're just putting
themselves out and saying oh hey look
I'm a victim first of all don't ever be
a victim ever be the
master of your destiny and I mean
honestly this thing is just so deep and
so crazy it's just insane
other things that we're finding out
about this is that basically the boy
hunters are all the exact same person
what oh my god there's really only one
bully hunter hmm stupid so let me break
it down even more simple so basically
you go on to csgo you log into the game
you give these guys access to your
account you're going and play the game
when you find somebody you feel who's
being a big bully you go and report them
and then supposedly this so-called bully
hunter comes into the game and goes and
kills the bully okay but when the bully
and the bully hunter are the exact same
person what in the hell is with this in
SteelSeries why in the Sam hell would
you ever attach your name to anything
like this so much money was put into
this I mean it's this huge campaign
they've got doctors specialists all
giving their opinions about you know how
it's a male-dominated society and how
males are forever dominated society well
you know what that happened for one
reason and one reason only okay when
cavemen were here cavemen were big they
were strong they were burly two burly
excuse me they went out they did the
hunting they did the gathering so
obviously back in the very beginning of
time males were predominantly providing
for the females and the children so
obviously in that particular situation
you know males had kind of I would say
an upper hand but they were more in
charge because they were the ones doing
all this stuff but Society has changed I
got raised pretty much predominantly by
my mother my mom played mom and dad for
the most part my dad he was there very
irregularly you know and there are a lot
of dads that are like that so you know
today's society isn't based so much on
Oh men are totally ruling yes there is
obviously the good old boys club there
are many segments still that need to
work around that and trying to find the
exact word I want to use equal I guess
there probably are some you know
countries out there and some places
where women are
not treated equal and I watch TV and I
see other countries I see women are
still in shawls and they can't show
their body parts and all that kind of
stuff when I watch that I feel so sorry
for these women because nobody should be
treated like a second-class citizen
nobody no woman should be afraid of a
man no woman should be in fear of her
husband and no woman should definitely
be just stuck in her place like coach
needs to be barefoot pregnant in the
kitchen if you think like that you're
fucked up because this is the modern-day
world and I've read a ton of books in my
time watched a lot of TV programs and a
lot of them makes sense killing people
treating people badly is the worst thing
that you can do because what if there's
some woman out there who just happens to
have the Kega cancer you know it's
happened you know other doctors in the
past come up and just matter they're
male and female they come up and they're
like oh hey I have this great idea so if
you're shoving some woman down this
woman might be the woman who saves
Society a really good example for you
guys out there who watch Star Trek is
they had a show with levar burton a long
time ago Star Trek next generation and
nobody could figure out these problems
except for levar burton because he had
these special glass that made him see
stuff and like the whole you know the
whole butt thing about that entire that
entire episode was that basically if
they would have killed him as a child
because he was different then he would
have never been able to save all these
people from the plague and all this
stuff because he would have been dead so
putting people in a little niche and
sticking them there is ridiculous now
this bully hunter thing to me as far as
I'm concerned is the biggest bunch of
horse malarkey that's ever came out
first of all the concept is complete
bullshit
the way it was lay out oh hey let's go
play csgo how is one game csgo going to
eliminate boy in this world it's not
it's just a ploy number three getting a
bunch of people to come in and say oh my
god these are validated facts women are
being abused in gaming is crazy I'm
gonna try to sell your product number
four trying to sell your product off of
this is just completely nuts and number
five
I honestly think at this point right now
you should boycott SteelSeries products
I have a couple of their headsets here
and I'm not
to review them right now I feel that
this company and these people owe a
public apology at this point right now
they need to apologize for what they've
done there was no reality at all to this
so-called bully thing it didn't even
exist and let's just face it like I said
in the very beginning I start talking to
you guys you can't even tell who you're
playing and in game if somebody's
messing you all you have to do is mute
it you don't have to pay attention to
them so if you're feeding into them and
they're singing direct message you want
to accept it that's on you because if
you're an adult you can just choose to
simply ignore those people ever heard
the term sticks and stones may break my
bones but words can never hurt me well
honestly for any of you people out there
who are living in this world to think
that oh my god these bullies can affect
me in games you really need to pay
attention to what I just said words
cannot hurt you unless you let them hurt
you it's just the absolute truth let's
just say you're an overweight person and
something something goes oh my god
you're such a fat bla bla bla bla bla
you don't have to let their words bother
you maybe you have a problem you know um
I forgot the thyroid exactly maybe have
a thyroid problem you can't help how
heavy you are so somebody coming up and
telling you that you're a big flat slob
you need to eat less noise stuff you
know in your heart that that's not true
you have a medical condition so why even
let that get to you whatsoever being
thin skinned online honestly is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard of when
you're in game play the game who cares
what people are saying to you you know
we watched a few clips today to this
guy's all saying in the video oh you
know what I'm going to rape you I'm
going to do this to you I'm going to do
all this stuff to you how did that guy
even know that that was a girl he didn't
because this shit was all set up by the
company and it's been proven now this
entire bully hunters thing was just a
complete utter setup so they spent all
of this money all this hard-earned cash
he'll just think about that okay all
that money that they just spent they
probably spent a lot of money could have
been used to lower the price of those
headphones right I mean let's just face
it you could have put all that money
into a much better campaign
to sell those headphones than a bully
campaign now obviously if this was real
the concept is cool we all know bullies
suck ass they pick on people smaller
than them they try to go around and
badger their way around and make
everybody afraid of them now when you're
in school you know and you're a little
guy with glasses and you've got this big
old giant guy who's picking on you
that's a true bully situation and the
guy really doesn't have you know much
where to go so this guy's chasing you on
the way home from school trying to take
your lunch money hassling you that's
true bullying but online
I honestly think there is no such thing
as online bullying I think it's all
complete bullshit people just talk a lot
of crap online in csgo people are going
around killing each other and like
another guy made a point of like
nobody's gonna go in there and start
searching around for this so-called
bully and csgo you killed the next
person you see that's just how it is you
want to kill as many people as possible
so even trying to put this inside the
game makes absolutely no sense
whatsoever
SteelSeries I don't know what you guys
are thinking I really don't I don't like
it I do not give it my stamp of approval
here at Tech go tomorrow as at this
point right now I'm boycotting
SteelSeries stuff until I see these guys
address the public and apologize for
this crap
because regardless of their intent I
guarantee you that there are some women
out there even though they may only be 5
or 6 of them that felt like oh my god
this is a real thing oh you know III I'm
I'm getting a woman who's beating me the
game so I'm going to beat her up that's
just completely ridiculous another one
other experts made this thing about how
their daughter made a soccer goal
against some some other kid they're like
oh you got beat by a girl who cares I
mean if you're an athlete you're an
athlete Maddie Bowman's a female she's
got gold medals for skiing do you think
the males in this game were like oh my
god that frickin biatch man she got a
gold medal and I did and I guarantee you
that they're not thinking in such
petty-ass ways we all need to grow up
until this world can honestly learn to
live together without hate without fear
of change without fear of getting beat
by a woman because who cares
my mom's SuperDuper smart
she worked at Litton she worked at
Philips I'm sure a lot of men back in
time felt threatened by my mom's IQ but
no one ever bullied my mom just because
she was smart and I really don't think
there's too much of that going on now
obviously like anything there's going to
be a little bit of that going on yes
there's bullying going on all around the
world in small increments but as we grow
as a people in the world we're gonna
finally realize they were all so much
more alike than we are different we all
breathe air we all eat so what if your
skin colors a little different so what
if your religions a little bit different
you know I've heard people say before oh
there's no such word as tolerance in the
Bible well then okay I really don't
believe in the Bible I believe in God
hardcore I always have I've always taken
the Bible and religion though with a
grain of salt because as far as I'm
concerned God wasn't sitting here in
person you know dictating out this stuff
people made their own their own views
their own translations and let's just
face it
the Bible's been translated how many
times who knows what actually the real
words said equality is the way of the
world and the way the world needs to be
we all need to love each other embrace
each other and when you're in game let's
just face it people talk shit it's not
necessarily bullying now if somebody's
calling you out or emailing you or
something like that I can see that but
how are these people in game going to
get your personal information if you
don't share it honestly think about it
you're in csgo right now you're going
around some dudes telling you hey dude
I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna come to
your house so I'm gonna cut your balls
off and feed them to your dog without
gravy I mean how is this fool even going
to do that so if you absorb that you
believe that you're letting them win
don't let other people win by you
succumbing hey think that's where it's
succumbing to him sorry I'm having
trouble speakers my headset head's full
full of stuff anyways if you succumb to
such petty bullcrap
then you're just being weak be strong in
the mind be strong in the spirit and if
you really feel like someone's picking
you out in the game mute them or just
get out the server and go play a
different server what does it really
matter are you so would you know
addicted to one particular server that
you can't go play I mean
cs:go has servers all around the world
with people playing in all kinds of
different arenas so if you don't like
where you're playing you have the option
of going and playing some where else I
don't know what's up with this bully
hunters thing but it was the biggest
bunch of bullcrap and marketing that
I've ever seen in my entire life I hope
it ends and goes away this other guy
joked it says hey it was nice knowing
you and goodbye well that's pretty much
how it is because you guys came and went
faster than a fart if you guys want to
check out some more information I'll
have some links down below you guys know
what to do by now hit that like button
if you like what you see here subscribe
we'd love to hear you back here once
again see you back here once again and
actually hear you I want to hear your
guys's comments down below do you think
that any part of this bully hunter thing
had any sense to it whatever any logic
any reason or you like me think this
entire thing which is a complete bunch
of bullshit to sell some headphones at
the expense of making other people feel
like they've been bullied and at the end
of the day I think that that's what's
the absolute most suck ass thing about
this entire thing is that those few
people who really felt like oh my god
I'm being bullied in-game you weren't
being bullied in-game this entire thing
was a setup the bully the bully hunter
all the same person
shame on the people that did this shame
shame shame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
