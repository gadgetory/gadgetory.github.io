to you by the Corsair k63 gaming
mechanical keyboard get your game on
with Corsair
hey tech fans what is up good news you
guys all know it probably as well but
AMD has announced that they will be
releasing their brand-new rising 3 CPUs
on July 27 so that's just right around
the corner baby and they've got two
miles that are coming to market right
now the 1200 and the 1300 X now both of
these CPUs feature four cores and four
threads they also feature eight
megabytes of level 3 cache they support
ddr4 2666 and they also have 65 watts of
TDP so on paper these things sound
absolutely amazing at least I think so
now the base clock speed on the you know
entry-level 1200 it's at 3.1 gigahertz
for your base clock and 3.4 for the
overclocking or the boost and on the
1300 X it's 3.5 on the base and 3.7 on
the boost this is pretty cool and the
fact that they have 65 watts of TDP is a
really good thing because if you want to
do any type of mining and stuff like
that you want to have a low powered CPU
to do that it's going to be absolutely
great for those people that are doing it
now right now Intel really I don't think
has the CP with any of their new cab you
like stuff that's going to be able to
compete at price performance ways to
these things they were just way more
expensive and one thing is really nifty
one thing that's really interesting is
that inside of an i3 is only a 2 core
CPU so both the CPU is right off the bat
has more core power underneath their
hood but here's the caveat about these
new Rison 3 CPUs there's no SMT SMT has
been completely disabled and what I'm
wondering is though you know the rise in
v and the rise in seven they all rely on
that SMT to make all those cores you
know work together nicely and make
things faster now you pull that out of
the equation
how do you guys think that's really
going to do is it really going to matter
is it going to perform about the same as
an i3 since you really you know don't
have that SMT going on there or would
actually be faster these are the
questions in my head and probably your
head as well now no prices have been
leaked whatsoever
so nobody
actually knows how much these you know
particular CPUs are going to be but
that's a question in all of our head now
real quick before we get into more stuff
about the rise in three let's check out
a word from our sponsor course there the
course there k63 is made for the gamer
who needs a minimalistic keyboard that
has a lot of features on it but doesn't
take up a lot of dead space the k63
features perky red LED backlighting and
large font keycap so you can see
everything perfectly clearly even in a
dark room the keys are also fully
programmable and you can do this using
course there's cue software it also
features dedicated volume and multimedia
controls to totally control your gaming
environment the k63
features a very small footprint due to
its compact 10 keyless design and best
of all in my opinion the k63 features
cherry MX red switches these are fast
accurate and they feature a really great
linear response time alright I hope you
guys liked that keyboard it's a really
cool product check it out if you can now
let's talk about testing simulated
testing where there's already a you know
website they're called tech spot and
they've like release some stuff that's
kind of tripping they basically take in
at 1400 disabled the SMT clocked it down
to what the AMD Rison 3 will be and then
release those scores now these scores
although you know you should take them
with a grain of salt they're actually
kind of interesting for doing this now I
don't think the numbers are going to be
totally accurate I there's just no way
that I think they're going to be
perfectly accurate because this is like
a simulated thing kind of a guest but
it's still interesting to check them out
so real quick check this out
they show that pretty much the Rison 3
blows away anything that intel has out
right now especially anywhere near the
same price point now how this is
actually going to translate into
real-world testing and stuff will be
really really interesting but just for
now it seems like on paper
hey the AMD risin threes are kicking
some serious serious ass and I mean
let's just face it if they can come to
market with like an $80.00 cpu I'm
talking about the 1200 and 120 dollars
for the 1300 X that's going to be very
interesting now one thing you guys
should note as well the rise in i-5 14
it is very very similar to the 1300 ex
so I don't know people are really going
to want to buy the 1300 ex you know
they'll probably buy the 1200 because
the excuse me the 1400 it has 4 cores 8
threads and the 1,300 ex it has 4 cores
4 threads and obviously SMT has been
disabled so I'm not really sure people
will really want to buy that CPU because
the price differences is most likely not
going to be that different and you're
going to want to have that SMT and
you're going to want to have those 8
threads if you want to get the absolute
best performance in gaming but right now
we're talking about the budget market
and for years
Intel has just dominated all over the
place as far as performance goes we know
this dance it's been going on for years
AMD the budget guys until the faster
guys that's just how it's been but can
Andy now with these brand new rising 3
CPUs dominate that marketing kick Intel
right off their spot I mean lately
there's been a lot of weird going
on with Intel and it's just it's just
really really strange I know they've
been doing wild crazy rants and just
weird stuff and that's just not a no
it's insane I don't know the heck's
going on over there if they don't really
change the way that they're doing things
even though AMD still is the underdog
right now if India keeps making mistakes
like this in the next few years AMD will
obviously be able to take over a lot of
these different slots I mean hopefully
until we'll get their together just
for you know the people out there who
buy CPUs because competition is always
good we know this you know the more
these companies compete the better two
CPUs get and the better our price point
is and at the end of the day that's what
we're all looking for so July 27 is
coming up I'm going to buy my CPU board
and bring those tests to you so we can
see together how well these brand new
AMD 3 CPUs do in the real world I know
if you've been watching taken tomorrow
once again a special shout-out to
courser for helping bring today's video
to the table peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
