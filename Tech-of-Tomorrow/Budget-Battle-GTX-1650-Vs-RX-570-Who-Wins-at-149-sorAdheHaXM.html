rumble it's fight time ok so check this
out
head-to-head battle once again my two
cards that are completely identically
priced now people out there can say oh
my god this is unfair testing this is
this is that but I'ma be straight up
with you no BS this is the best way to
test period when you're testing things
and you want to do a head-to-head
they should be items that are the same
exact price that way what you're
spending your money on you're getting
equal value testing a $900 video card
against $100 video card now that's
downright psycho now these two cards
we're testing today are both priced at a
hundred and forty-nine dollars this
particular head-to-head video is based
on the brand new card from people over
at Nvidia this is their 149 dollar
gaming solution this is the brand-new
gtx 1650 and it's gonna go head-to-head
with the Radeon 570 which is also one
hundred and forty nine dollars now a few
differences about these cards will jump
into really quickly but the test is in
that we're using I decided that we'd go
with the system that we built just like
a week and a half ago because I figured
if anybody out there is gonna be buying
an entry-level car that's basically a
149 dollars these guys aren't going to
be the guys who have the highest AI
sevens the highest i9 processors these
guys are gonna be people who are
probably getting entry-level systems and
building stuff off of that so also one
thing really cool about the test system
that we're using and by the way we'll
have a link below so if you guys happen
to miss that video we'll have a link
where you can check it out it's the
talus case back here from the guys over
at Gambia sand it's really kind of an
interesting system everybody seem to
like it quite a bit and guess what no
matter how you configure it whether you
configure it with the AMD card or you
configure it with the Nvidia card the
price is still going to be $700 so
that's kind of something interesting
with that said though let's jump in
let's real quick let's take a look at
the differences in the card specs and
then let's jump into those benchmarks
and let's see how these cards do in a
head-to-head battle so let's rock ok so
some major difference that you're gonna
see between these cards on the right
will have the
videocard you guys can see this card has
four gigabytes of RAM but it has a very
very low power requirement only 75 watts
is needed and this is completely
provided to the PCI slot the AMD card on
the other hand it has 8 gigabytes of RAM
but it also has a much higher power
consumption now the minimum power
requirements on the AMD card are a 500
watt power supply and I believe the
power draw is right around 120 because
you have to have an 8 pin power
connector and you have to have the PCI
so just depending on how much is being
drawn through that 8 pin is going to be
the difference now on the Nvidia side of
things there's no power requirement
whatsoever except for through the PCI
slot so that will probably make a
difference especially to some people
with older systems obviously there is a
difference between a 4 gigabyte and an 8
gigabyte card but they are priced
identically so with that said though
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
let's check out those benches
now one thing is really cool is you guys
can see that the Nvidia card only got as
hot as 64 Celsius even under full load
and the RX 570 it's running quite a bit
hotter at 89 Celsius under full load so
that's something to take into
consideration alright so there you have
it the scores and more in this
head-to-head battle between the a and D
rx 570 and the Nvidia 1650 card now we
ran all of the tests on this particular
video different than we ever did before
and all of our videos we set all of the
settings to their ultra settings the
highest they can get but I figured out
149 dollars that really wasn't something
worth doing so at these resolutions that
we tested at we ran everything at medium
which i think is very very fair you guys
can also you know if you add more you
know add more special effects on the car
those frame rates are going to drop but
as it is these cards did very well with
where they're at now as far as sheer
performance goes obviously the AMD rx
570 it went and a lot more of the tests
it does how if however more memory
bigger memory bus and all that stuff but
the power requirements are also a lot
more which is a lot of people are going
to be taking this into consideration
because if you don't have that 8 pin
power connector and you only have the
power coming from your PCI slot well
then you're not going to be able to use
that card so one of the you know
cabinets between the two cards is the
Nvidia 1650 only needs the power from
the PCI slot so if you have an older
computer and you're just like hey I want
to have one of these newer Nvidia cards
so I can play some of the newer games
but you know I'm not gonna go out and
buy myself a 20 atti or anything like
that
I want some 449 bucks then I would have
to say that you were gonna be much
better off getting the GTX 1650 card
because you know if you don't have the
power requirement and guess what you
don't have it and you're Sol but if
you're a person out there who's just now
building a computer and you only have a
hundred and forty-nine dollars to spend
in a video card that's just where your
budgets that brother well then I would
definitely buy the AMD rx 570 over the
1650 because it just performs better
at the exact same price now this is kind
of trippy because usually usually here
this is this is the area where nvidia
usually wins now I'm sure that maybe you
know the four gigabyte car because
obviously the difference being an 8
gigabyte card in a 4 gigabyte card there
probably would have been a wee bit of
difference but what does that matter if
you have $149 why would you buy the 4
gigabyte version there's just no reason
to it whatsoever you're gonna be like
yeah right I can cap it I can get an 8
gigabyte version for the same price so
why not buy it so depending on what
you're doing and where you're coming
from there's really two sides to the
coin like I said if you're looking for
just sheer performance for the same
price point then the AMD card the RX 570
it is the clear winner here today it
takes home the crown give it its belt
let it go on its way and let's go get
lunch some lunch you know but if you're
a person out there like I said and you
have an older system or you don't have
any type of power cable and you really
want to keep the power down to nothing
well the Nvidia card does run a lot
cooler it has a lot less power
consumption and hey you guys can see it
there's the numbers we'll have all the
information down below if you guys want
to buy one of these for yourself or the
other card will have it alright so that
wraps up today's video like usual we'll
have all the information for these cards
and everything down below we'll even
have the unboxing if you want to check
that out so check out the links also if
you're wondering about the music and
stuff we'll have a link to that as well
you can purchase the music the new
benchmark song isn't quite out yet it
will be out pretty soon then we'll have
that link as well a few people who like
the old-school one it's still there for
you as well and hey if you like what you
see we'd love to have you subscribe to
the channel so hey please hit that sub
button and we hope to see you guys back
here on techo tomorrow so peace out
we'll see you back here for more tech
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
