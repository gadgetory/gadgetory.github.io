tomorrow now last week we brought you
guys a graphics comparison for watchdogs
and you guys really ate that video up so
we're going to do it again with another
recent big release Wolfenstein the new
order now just like last time we're
going to show you the same piece of
gameplay four times over in this case
the first chapter of Wolfenstein during
an indoor combat segment we're going to
have it at the games for different
preset graphic settings of low medium
high and ultra now it's important to
note that for Wolfenstein the game is
always hard capped at 60 frames per
second so it'll never go above that no
matter what you do with the settings so
as a result there's not really a lot of
variance with our benchmark tests now in
our test system which includes an i7
4770k processor overclocked to 4.3
gigahertz and a GTX 780 Twin Frozr
gaming Edition we never really saw the
gameplay ever dip below that 60 frames
per second mark the only time it would
is when we headed on Ultra settings at
1440p resolution and only during highly
intense combat segments you'd see it go
down to around 55 frames per second so
let's go ahead and check out those
gameplay clips right now
so there you have it Wolfenstein new
order running on all four different
preset graphics settings on our test
system at 1440p resolution now normally
when you change it to 1080p you expect
to bump up in the framerate but because
that frame lock I mentioned earlier it's
going to still stay at 60 frames per
second even at a lower resolution now
there is one other important thing I
want to note about Wolfenstein the new
order there is a particularly annoying
bug that's been happening on some
graphics cards where you'll see the
framerate take a major nosedive down to
single digits now these are isolated
incidences though sometimes they can't
happen back-to-back all you have to do
fix it though is just reload the level
and a lot of times you'll end up working
just fine hopefully this is something
that gets patched in the future but for
right now if you encounter that problem
you first boot it up just restart the
level and that should fix it now if you
hadn't looked into Wolfenstein before
and this a little bit of gameplay got
you more interested I do have a full
review posted on my own YouTube channel
which is linked down below but for now
here's the short short version
Wolfenstein the new order is a beautiful
return to form of classic FPS mechanics
delivered in modern day visuals it only
consists of the single-player campaign
which is not only surprisingly lengthy
but is worth at least two playthroughs
thanks to the game's split timeline
decision made near the start gunplay is
fast and satisfying letting players
tackle enemies using tactical cover with
a single gun stealthy takedowns with a
silenced pistol or knife or just running
and gunning with a pair of shotguns or a
portable turret Stealth's attends silly
at times but a lot of levels are made so
that you can't rely on just it alone
it's not the deepest game out there but
it's straightforward good old-fashioned
FPS fun team together with solid visuals
and storytelling
well that was just a quick look at how
Wolfenstein performs on our test PC as
well as a quick overview of the game
itself don't forget if you want to see a
more full review of it check out that
link down in the description we also
have links with pricing availability if
you've already decided you want to grab
the game for yourself if you guys

let us know why absolutely destroying
that thumbs up button and if you're not
