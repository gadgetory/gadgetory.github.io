previously in our series of videos we
took you down to a place we showed you
guys some cool hydro dipping methods in
the way that it was done now falling in
those series of videos we have another
case that we duel hydro dip now this
system is really really cool and
features the silver stone fortress
series ft 0 5 case this system is called
the camo tech system and you guys can
see right from the outside that it's
really kind of a unique looking thing it
has dual hydro dipping so the first dip
was based off a circuit board type of
design and the second was off of a
camouflage design which actually gives
the system a really interesting look as
you guys can see the colors on it are
totally unique but the general theme of
the thing is pretty much predominantly
green now the fortress FTO 5s in mid
tower case that supports mini-itx
motherboards it also features a really
interesting 90 degree motherboard
mounting system which mounts the
motherboard totally different than any
other case out there on the market the
FTO 5 also features a foam padded
interior for great noise reduction on
the top of the case there is room for
either 220 millimeter fans or an aio
liquid cooler like the one that you we
use from Corsair and at the bottom of
the FT 05 you can see there are two air
penetrator 180 millimeter fans these air
penetrators are really large fans and
they help a lot with keeping great
airflow inside the system it also
features a slim loading optical drive
slot which we took advantage of using
another product from Silverstone one of
their optical drives I can drone over
and over again about the features
because the case has a lot of features
but i'm sure you guys want to talk about
the entire bill but basically what we
want to do in this video is show you how
cool the FTO 5 case was how easy it was
to put different parts inside of it and
well at the end of the day how cool it
looks with obviously the hydrogen being
paint
real quick before we check out the rest
of parts though let's just check out the
simple design of the FTO 5 you guys can
see this thing is pretty minimalistic
doesn't have a lot of buttons on the
outside just enough to control it the
features are really nice a single band
surrounding the bottom of the case just
for elegance but all in all just a nice
simple straightforward case the one that
we have also came with the window so
that's pretty cool because you can
actually see the build inside now as far
as the motherboard goes we had one
sitting around this was the ecs LGA 1155
motherboard I know it's an older one but
really didn't build this system so much
to sell a system just to like make the
system look cool for you guys to see and
that motherboard was the p 67 h 2 dash a
2 this is a mini-itx 1155 motherboard
that fit this build pretty well as far
as the CPU goes we used in intel i7
3770k the older 1155 edition but because
that one fit the board the video card is
not the video call we're actually going
to leave in the system but for now it's
a sapphire HD 7770 as far as the memory
goes we use the kingston hyperx be 16
gigabyte hit good memory all around it's
always stable one of my preferred choice
when i use memory in the system and just
so we had a storage drive we put in a
kingston hyperx 256 gigabyte SSD even
though we probably won't use this system
for anything other than show the power
supply was also provided by the good
people over at Silverstone and this is
the text rider gold s-series 750 watt
power supply now this bad boy is an 80
plus gold certified fully modulated
power supply like I said previously the
FTO 5 really is geared towards those
people using an all-in-one liquid
cooling system and we want the corsair
hydro series 880 I and this is a GT
performance liquid cpu cool
all in one unit that's pretty popular
around the world so we thought hey let's
use this one for the optical drive
silverstone also provided this as well
this is the esso do to be 12 point 7
millimeter slot-loading 8 x CD DVD RW
combo drive so there you guys have it
folks the camo tech system a pretty
basic system and like I said they're
very beginning we didn't build the
system trying to push a system sale or
anything else we've pretty much just
want to show up some components that we
have from these different companies and
put a system together for you guys now
if you guys want to build a system like
this like usual down below the like
button will be all the information just
hit the show more and they'll be links
to where you can buy these parts for
yourself and a similar system just like
it do you guys want to do some hydro
dipping you guys want to make check out
some sites out there do that this is a
popular thing it's becoming more and
more popular as the days passed we
actually have a few more systems coming
out with this including for the people
over at EVGA who gave us a little
hydrant system so stay tuned to TECA
tomorrow we've got more videos coming
your way and something really cool that
I think you're really gonna like coming
up soon I'm elric thanks for watching
teka tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
