been following the channel you know that
we've been having some pretty cool
giveaways going on so what this video is
once again to announce another giveaway
we're like we're gonna be doing every
Friday so first off for everybody who
wants to know who the winners were of
the last contest that we did please make
sure you check your inboxes on Twitter
and on Instagram and on Facebook so make
sure you check your inboxes because I'm
going to be sending the game codes
directly to you folks now for the
patreon people you'll have a video over
on the patreon site announcing the
giveaway and who won those prizes now
here's what's gonna be going on this
week for those people who follow me on
patreon we're now going to be doing a
mouse giveaway so we're gonna be giving
away all kinds of mice gaming mice to
the people who follow us on patreon I
think I have about 10 of those so we'll
have 10 winners there once again we're
gonna be doing the games it'll be 10
games once again I'll be doing it on
Twitter Instagram and wherever else we
have social media going on we'll be
giving stuff away so there you have it
make sure that you pay attention to your
inboxes and check them you know I send
this stuff out sometimes people don't
even go and check the rim box and they
email they go hey who was the winner
when they were actually the winner so
you have to do a little bit of work on
your own it's not really too much
footwork for you to check your inbox so
this is basically it for the people who
follow me on like Instagram who are
following me on Twitter and on Facebook
all I would do for you guys is when I
put the announcements up on those pages
that you share like and follow it's
simple
you know I'm not worried about it if you
want to sub here on the channel that's
great we've already kind of discovered
that you know can't really do any
contests here on YouTube anymore
whatsoever because there's absolutely no
way to communicate whatsoever so that's
you know a dead-end road a lot of people
ask me why I'm not just doing the gleam
stuff well the gleam stuff actually cost
money too it's about two hundred and
something dollars a year it's not a lot
but still I have to pay for that to do
it and things just right now a real
tight tight nip the Belcher's trying to
keep the channel going
so there you guys have it check your
inboxes and once again we're gonna have
another giveaway and we'll announce
those winners again next Friday so stay
tuned to the channel got lots of stuff
going on we've got lots of more
giveaways coming up next week
we'll have something even cool for the
people for Twitter and for Instagram I'm
actually going to be doing a headphone
giveaway so stay tuned and for those
people who are wondering about patron
stuff I'm gonna be doing something
interesting on patreon because like I've
said before YouTube is kind of getting
where it's not even paying us any money
whatsoever getting paid you know lesson
four hundred bucks or a month of work I
don't think anybody out there would
really work a month and not make that
much money so it's not really worth it
to me so we're gonna be doing like I
said a lot more patreon stuff now I'll
announce it here as well I'm gonna do
stuff on patreon like this when I get to
five hundred dollars on patreon I'll be
giving away every month to the people on
patreon I'll be giving good prizes away
they'll be mice there'll be keyboards
there'll be whatever kind of stuff that
I'm making more sponsors for to be
giving away when I get up to a thousand
dollars I'll give better prizes and I'm
gonna try to work this all the way up to
two thousand dollars a month and when I
get up to two thousand dollars a month
I'm gonna try to get it so that every
month we can give a system away to
people who follow us on patreon because
those people are actually really helping
a lot of people even they're only
donating a dollar you know or more even
every dollar still adds up you know if a
million people went there and gave me a
dollar right have a million dollars I
could give you guys so much stuff I
could get like Oprah's so really the
more you help me to stay around the more
I can help you by giving more prizes
away if I don't have any money and I
can't be in business it's really hard
for me to get stuff to give to you folks
sometimes sponsors are willing to give
stuff other times what I do is I get the
stuff that I've been reviewing and I
just take it instead of giving it to my
family I give it to you guys the fans so
there you have it make sure you're
following us on Instagram on Twitter on
Facebook you know if you want to be a
patreon supporter that's great that's
we're gonna be giving our biggest prizes
away and you might ask why well the
reason why is because those people like
I said are direct
they supporting me so that people that
are directly supporting me I'm gonna
actually help them and give them more
stuff but that's just you know that's
just really fair because they are taking
money out of their pocket and even if
it's only a dollar you don't know how
much your dollar is actually appreciated
I appreciate everybody who supported us
in any manner so before I get out of
here check your inboxes because I'm
gonna be giving all that stuff away from
last Friday today so stay tuned
keep watching taken tomorrow we've got
giveaways coming every Friday and like I
said as things advance we'll try to make
these giveaways even better
peace out hope you're having a great
weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
