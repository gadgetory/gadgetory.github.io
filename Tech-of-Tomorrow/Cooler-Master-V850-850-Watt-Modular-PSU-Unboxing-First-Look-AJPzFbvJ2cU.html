christmas is finally over and even
though I had pneumonia I'm starting to
get my voice back not all the way there
are still something got a small frog in
there I don't know maybe it's a bullfrog
I don't know what's up with that but hey
glad to see you guys back here on tech
of tomorrow once again we're getting
ready to roll in a 2014 we're at the bat
we'll start off with CES and then after
that again the NAMM show so it's like
consumer electronics and rock and roll
but today we're going to do the unboxing
and first look of the v8 50 from the
people over at coolermaster now this is
an 80 plus gold fully modular 850 watt
power supply coming to mark about 169
bucks
this thing's geared for the enthusiast
who likes to have everything modular and
high-quality components now everything
in it is made of superior Japanese
components so this thing is going to be
running really well and it's made
superiorly well so with that said let's
jump in let's check out what comes in
the box and what the VA 50 is all about
alright folks so first off was putting
out the old trusty little knife here
let's insert it over here make a quick
cut I'll just tear this thing out of
here like a Christmas package so we can
take a look at the Box all is glittering
shiny stuff like I'm not crazy
so let's get all this stuff off of here
so there's students to do to do to do
all right then kind of looking like
liquor colors right there the the purple
and the gold alright
front of the box cooler master v8 50
fully modular power supply hundred
thirty-five millimeter FTB high-quality
extended life silent fan wonder-percent
Japanese made capacitors like I said
before 80 plus gold flipping around the
back just real quick they just have some
stuff about the fan curve and stuff and
it's efficiency curve so it's going to
be quiet and silent now if we get really
close up here to the box
you guys can see that they have the
motherboard power connectors some more
CPU and four pin connectors next up PCI
6 8 pin SATA more profiles or molex
cables and a floppy connector so we're
actually going to see that let's flip it
around the back here just shows the
specifications the
model number the form factor atx12v
version 2.3 one active PFC the
dimensions 150 by 170 by 88 millimeters
or five point nine by six seven by
three-quarter inches one hundred and
thirty-five millimeter FDB fan ninety
percent in a typical load is the
efficiency and mean time between fares
is a hundred thousand hours or us the
stuff you guys can see once again they
tell you the connectors one of those one
of those six of those nine of those four
of those and four of those and it's a
USA type with the little USAA yellow
sticker
alright pup side off right here I feel
so rusty doing this I was sick for so
long and there was actually actually
been almost a few weeks until I actually
done uh product videos so I feel a
little rusty here a little rusty
alright pull this bad boy out of its box
hmm
move this off the old side here yeah we
got this right here here we guys concede
schoolmaster I square box yeah yeah yeah
uh good to go you guys want to see this
so pull this off got this thawed at the
cameraman you guys love that mister Oh
with the Cameron and landed on his head
like a hat damn I'm good
so check it out Gigantor super thick
sized power cable right here good enough
to use to plug into your wall or beat
your enemies down into a pitiful moment
here we go with all the connectors
inside this little package here bang
that out here we'll go ahead and let me
just push this a little bit that way for
a second let's get the cables out here
and go over them sorry folks I took the
cables out got them here all on the
table let's start taking a look at them
right here we're going to start off with
our power cables you got your eight pin
your two four pin they say CPU on them
clearly PSU CPU all clearly labeled SATA
cables not clear label but you guys know
what SATA cables are and we've got one
to two sets of those one set of molex so
two sets of those one set of molex
some more SATA cables then another power
this is your 24 pin legal thick ranging
thing there we've got more power right
here these are PCI there's actually
three PCI cables so you can hook up
three video cards you can do triple SLI
or standard SLI or a triple crossfire
that's you can do not quad but there's
three of them so that's them to power
those and then the last cable is just
another molex cable right there so
that's all the cables you have the
screws right here to mount the power
supply to your case and now let's go
ahead and pull the power supply itself
out we've also got basically an
installation guide right here this is
for the V 700 watt 850 and thousand
watts they'll be actually three models
of these coming out we have the 850 set
that down go ahead and just pull the
unit all out of there start from the
back right here power plug the switch
you can see all the components inside of
the unit on the side here at the
coolermaster V 850 the fan the bottom by
the way it looks very nice to just from
the way it looks you guys can see it's a
very elegant looking unit here's the
backside Coolermaster v8 50 80 plus gold
again as you guys can see it's
completely modular for people who are
enthusiast and who like their stuff to
be very very clean this is the cleanest
design you're going to get so that's
basically comes the box this all the
lovely cables including the one I
dropped on the floor here yadda yadda
the power cable and two different
containers Kapow
alright folks so there you have a cooler
masters latest entry into the basic I
think this is about the mid-level power
supply market I mean you know 850 is
right in there you know in the middle
it's not like a thousand or 1200
anything giant it's not either 600 or
500 either so I think it's like right in
that nice sweet spot it'll support SLI
crossfire and like I said this thing's
come in to market about one hundred and
sixty nine dollars few people out there
interested in buying it down there in
the description box below like button
you guys will see all its information
well
links to her if you guys want to be
either more information or purchase a
thing you guys can do so hope you guys
like this stuff we'll be back here for
more videos really really soon I was
down for a while but now I'm back so
look too nervous here on tech come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
