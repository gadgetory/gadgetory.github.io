caught me going
Zen in the park and why are we going in
the park where we're going Zim for you
folks like we said before we're going
all 4k here on tech of the mall and
right now this thing is being shot in 4k
by the Lumix gh4 that's right now this
is a mirrorless Micro Four Thirds camera
that's really about as technical as I'm
gonna get you guys know I'm usually in
front of the camera the camera is
actually filming it through this though
so we're gonna bring everything to you
guys from 4k from here on out I
basically want to show you guys the
stuff that we be using for our new 4k
system now we're using a lot of
different stuff on my chest I have a
little Rhodes pin mic right here that we
use and then down here behind me for our
recording our vocals everything I got
this little Sony thing right here so
this is what we're using for all of our
audio I know a lot of people out there
always asking what are we using so we're
gonna give you the whole setup
everything we use so it's the rode mic
this thing like usual everything will be
down below now we also have some other
stuff back here we have the camera
itself
the really fast I mean really fast card
you need to run this bad boy this
thing's really extremely fast and that's
32 gigabyte so with that I'll store
enough stuff on it for us to bring our
videos to you folks now next up is the
lens
obviously by Panasonic this is the
Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12 35 millimeter
F 2.8 now the way this thing works
though it's actually going to be double
this so it's gonna be 24 70 millimeter
when using it with this camera now the
camera actually comes with one battery
but you guys all know how that goes when
you're using 4k like we're using that
Blackmagic thing if you swim really fast
so with that said we actually got a
little wall charger here this is the
wasabi power and it comes with two extra
battery packs so now I have three
battery packs to bring you guys lots of
4k goodness so let's start actually
taking a look at this stuff so alright
since we're in the park let's just go on
naturelle and we'll use the land itself
as our canvas the background so now
let's do light flip the top we can see
that they show all of the optional
accessories here oh wow isn't that
always nice but nice have options I
guess but it's cool if I come to stuff
so let's go ahead and pop the other cap
right off the bat we've got a creating
still pictures from 4k motion pictures
interesting stuff there and we've got
just some more stuff dear customer dear
customer here we've got all the software
the basic owner's manual and I've now
got flies buzzing around my head
irritating me I want them to go away
they're like ants at a picnic irritated
so here's all this stuff this is all the
drivers everything in different
languages the basic owner's manual tells
you about the body and everything else
in another language and just some
product registration stuff so that's all
the extra goodies let's continue on keep
opening keep opening
I'm hoping I got that fly but
unfortunately I don't think I did it's
okay inside it here you guys can see
it's all sealed up and everything
cameras all sealed up let me just see
what else is in here though before we
bounce around okay so here's a strap
good for carrying the camera or spanking
that bad girl let you know here's the
charging unit for the battery the core
that goes to it obviously this is going
to be for American sockets and for those
that use that type of electricity here's
the battery so three of those bad boys
altogether and then here is the USB
cable I'm Magisters for firmware or for
transferring stuff directly to your
computer depending on your need and now
let's take a look at the body of the gh4
pull it all out this thing is very very
light you can see all internally there
this is actually a very beautiful body
it's about $1,600 right now though but
it is like one of the very first 4k
things on the market that's like this so
we were looking forward to using it a
lot bring you some videos for you guys
to the top all the control units all
that kind of stuff I'll spin around
think the angles probably little bit
better this way you guys can see all the
basic controls and functionality the
same as most cameras basically there's
gonna be a few other options here and
there were a few guys out there who are
you know total camera buffs you're going
oh yeah I know all that she'll like the
back of my hand I am NOT the cameramen
but this stuff obviously is going to be
a very good one because the people who
work and manage the companying they
chose to buy this one and therefore I'm
trusting their judgment that it's going
to be awesome because they usually make
awesome decisions on my equipment so
next up let's take a look at the lens
got the lens box right here you guys saw
that a second ago not much do that just
see what comes in and though just for
the giggles you get the paperwork like
usual always some paperwork
something nifty right here want the fly
buzzing around my face doing problem
with the outdoor video is that till you
get those bugs okay so this is just a
case for your lens so if you need you
tear your lens right in the case here's
the case for it it's a little black bag
it can also be used for a change carry
or something else depending on what
you're doing mostly pretty much my lens
is going to be on my camera so not to
worry too much about that but now let's
get the old lens out man that's pretty
much it in the Box here's like a little
Sun filter
yada-yada doesn't work as good as the
one that we actually bought that one's
like $70 and here's the lens itself it's
get a close-up of that bring it up to
you guys in full 4k glory shamu shamela
shamela shamil the loom XG and by the
way just to let you guys know everything
that is being filmed right now is being
filmed this exact same equipment so
beyond that let's go check out more 4k
footage in the barcode
all right folks so now that we're done
monkeying around in 4k hope you guys
