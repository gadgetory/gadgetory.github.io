question keeps getting asked over and
over again and I wanted to wait till
actually the latest drivers came out for
the 1080 and 1074 we actually really
compared to anything because we all know
when the cards first come out the
drivers they have are like basically
like newborn children they need to grow
and since this is a brand new chipset
and everything from Vidya with new
drivers you're just going to see the
1070 and 10a there's going to keep
getting a little faster
the 980ti however though since its last
generation technology you know it's
pretty much hit a wall with all the
drivers they've taken that card almost
as far as it goes you may see a frame or
two here there but nothing significant
so everybody's asking right now I have a
980 I should I upgrade to a 1070 or
should I upgrade to a 1080 well today's
video lets you see the actual score so
you can know what the actual real value
difference is between that card and the
two new cards are so let's first check
out the test system check out those
scores and let's see at the end whether
it's worth it for you to upgrade your
card
alright there's the test system which by
the way we will be upgrading to an i7
6700k very soon but now it's time to
rock and check out those benchmarks
let's go
okay folks so there you have it you can
see that right now with what's going on
there's not very much difference between
the 1070 and 980ti now obviously as more
drivers come out you're going to see the
1070 begin to see you know get farther
and farther away from that but at this
time point I think that if you have a
980 I you should probably just chill out
for the moment and keep your card I
don't think there's any really a reason
right now for you to go out and sell
your cards and stuff
unless you're totally trying to do 1440
and giant monitors or you're trying to
do 4k now with the 1080 if you're really
looking for the ultimate performance you
can see there is quite a bit of
difference almost 20 percent difference
between the 9 8 1080 that excuse me
there between the 980ti
and the 10a there's almost you know 16
to 18 percent seems to be about the
average but sometimes up to 20 percent
so that's a really good margin with that
card so if you honestly just have to
have a absolute fastest and best of the
best then the 10 a is going to be what
you want to get also you guys keep
asking me when is the 1080 TI going to
come out I mean I'd imagine it's
probably going to come out near the end
of the year
Nvidia is going to want to milk this
card for a while and until AMD comes up
with something that's truly competitive
why would they release a card to beat
this card it just doesn't make any
financials you know sense for them
whatsoever so you'll be waiting a while
to see a TI so at the end of the day
there you guys have it about a you know
16 to 19 percent difference with the
1080 maybe a 5 maybe 6 percent
difference if you upgrade it to a 1070
from the 980 I but hey na ATI is still
kicking ass the only thing is though
like I said it's hit a wall pretty much
as far as drivers go and there may be a
few little inches out here where the
drivers update a game per se here and
there but at the end of the day
obviously if you want the best of the
fast right now the 1080 is still the
King of the Ring and possibly what you
I'm on upgrade if you're that type of
person
so I'm aware more information about
these cards down below plus we have lots
of other non founders edition cards
coming in you guys saw the unboxing of
the gigabyte g1 gaming we've got that we
also have a card from EVGA the FTW
version I know it's not used to get twe
but
for the win so I'm Eric been watching
taken tomorrow we'll see you guys back
here on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
