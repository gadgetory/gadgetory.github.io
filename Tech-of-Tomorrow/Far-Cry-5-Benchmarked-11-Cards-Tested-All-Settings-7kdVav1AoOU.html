in the channel of the day well we've
been checking out Far Cry 5 now few
folks who follow the series you guys
know far cry 5 is always usually about
survival that's right
keeping us from getting killed by the
other people in the game or the
characters inside the game itself now
Far Cry 5 the cats meowing I don't think
she wants but Far Cry 5 is pretty
tripping so if you guys haven't seen it
yet over on Amazon you can probably
google it and find it there's this 30
minute movie that kind of explains you
know how you get to what's going on in
Far Cry 5 so basically it's you and
these two hot chicks and they're hot to
me I'd do them now I'm saying taste very
you'll see for yourself but you're
basically these kind of vlog people so
you're cruising your van your Montana
your you admiring all the beauty then
you go check these people out see what
they're saying because other people in
town are saying hey I'm Keith these
folks are kidnapping folks yep
downright stealing them taking them
making them into dummies you know what
I'm saying after they go there they
don't even know what the hell going on
with a laugh that just dumber than a
rock that's right so with that said we
decided that we would run the benchmark
that actually this game has an end
canned benchmark which means you don't
have to go and run you know weird test
yourself you can actually run this
benchmark it does all the testing for
you it's the lazy man testers dream and
what's best of all that if you own the
game you can run the test yourself so if
you have it you can do it but we did is
we test at 11 cards and we test them at
all their different settings so you guys
will find out what's going on the game
is that you are going to investigate
this cult who's taking people and well
obviously the cult doesn't like that so
they're going to kill you but with that
said real quick let's just check out our
test system it's pretty much all modern
Windows 10 we've got an i7 a 700 K we
just leave it at stock speeds we've got
16 gigabytes of memory inside this
machine it's a really nice machine we've
got an SSD for our boot drive and we've
got a standard hard drive for our store
drive pretty much as to all the
essentials and we do all the updates
that we get on Windows 10 we're using
the latest drivers that are available at
the time of this testing so with that
said let's check out the game scores now
we tested in 1080 1440 4k we tested an
ultra we tested in normal and we tested
in low so pretty much I mean obviously
our CPU is a higher-end CPU so if you
have some lower end CPU you might want
to just shave just a few frames you know
rates off there and and pretty like you
know you can do the mathematical thing
in your head and kind of figure out
where it's at you can actually do that
just by looking at the scores now I'll
tell you this generally a rule of thumb
is there's around 10 frames per second
difference between the card which means
that you know if you were using a 480
and it was getting 30 frames you know
hopefully when you get a 580 it should
be doing 10 more frames in addition to
that now with Nvidia cards that holds
pretty much true a lot of the times you
can see their card sometimes even do
better than that
but that's the average so with that said
let's check it out and now let's talk
about it at the end
I know that most people really want to
play the games that ultra because they
say you know I want to get all the bells
and whistles that I can get but how much
when it's on ultra are you really seeing
that much of a difference in because I
gotta be honest with you in the normal
settings I thought this game looked
absolutely great and you can see that in
4k it did really good on the normal
settings so I mean if you can sacrifice
you know a little explosion detail here
maybe a little bit of grass detail there
and just want to have a whole lot of
gameplay that plays really great with
it's a small sacrifice and like the
visual greatness I think this game plays
great on normal settings on a lot of the
cards even the 1050 was doing really
good she's been I think of 1050 Ti
excuse me even the 1050 TI was doing
really good watching the tests on that
game and normal I was like hey this is
actually very playable 4k just barely
but at 1080 and at 1440 hey you are
gaming baby and it looks absolutely
great even in just those normal settings
so like I said before if you guys have a
lower end CPU just shave a few frames
per second off and that should be right
around where you can expect your you
know game drone with your system if you
have one of these cards so thanks for
watching we'll see you guys here for
more tech me buddy the dog a mr. G
behind the camera please and don't
forget to rock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
