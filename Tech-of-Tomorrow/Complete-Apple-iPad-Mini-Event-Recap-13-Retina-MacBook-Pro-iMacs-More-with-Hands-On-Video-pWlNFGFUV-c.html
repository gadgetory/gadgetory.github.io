tech of tomorrow and today is very
exciting for the people out there who
are fans of Apple many new releases were
announced today and we're going to talk
about those products so five new things
have been announced all the way from a
brand new Retina Display 13-inch MacBook
we've also got the new mac mini imax new
ipad and new ipad mini so now let's jump
in check out those products and their
release dates let's go
first off is the new 13-inch retina
MacBook Pro which features a 2560 by
1600 Retina Display four times the
pixels is the current 13-inch MacBook
Pro also a pound lighter they dropped
the optical drive though there and it is
a dual core i5 and i7 CPU options but
unfortunately no dedicated graphics only
integrated HD 4000 we also have a new
mac mini refresh with updated Ivy Bridge
I 5 and i7 CPUs with dual-core and
quad-core configurations also for the
first time USB 3.0 you can get up to a
one terabyte hard drive or a 256
gigabyte SSD with option of fusion drive
which is essentially the same thing as
Intel's srt which is smart response
technology which uses both a hard drive
and an SSD to make your computer run
faster by caching also comes standard
with 4 gigabytes of 1600 megahertz
memory and is configurable up to 16
gigabytes now these things start off at
five hundred and ninety nine dollars but
one thing there's a downturn you might
disagree with no dedicated graphics only
the internal onboard graphics are
available in those and that is kind of a
bummer next up are the new iMacs which
really have an incredible incredible new
design they're five millimeters thin 80%
thinner than the previous imax they have
updated faster quad-core ivy bridge cpus
and nvidia graphics what happened to AMD
the highest-end imac comes to the gtx
670 5m x graphics solution you can also
use up to 32 gigabytes of ram and you
can use up to a 768 gigabyte SSD 3
terabyte or fusion drive options now the
21 inch model ships in November and the
27-inch and December so if you guys are
fans this be on the lookout I plan on
getting one of these into my studio
because hey there's no new Mac Pro being
released and I want to see just what
these new things can do next up is the
new iPad force a little bit
controversial and quite a shock actually
too many is because they didn't even
think this thing is going to be out
until at least 2013 but Apple is slit a
curveball out there as releasing it
anyways now as far as specs Co this
thing's supposed to have a mud
faster a 6x processor which is supposed
to outperform even the third-generation
iPad by a huge amount it has the same
retina display same pricing new lighting
port and pre-orders start this friday so
make sure you jump on this shit quick if
you want one and lastly we can finally
put the rumors and all you naysayers
leaving those crazy ass comments yes the
iPad Mini is coming and here the specs
to that one the new iPad Mini has a 7.9
inch 1024 x 768 display an a5 processor
the same as the 5th generation ipod
touch it also features a 5 megapixel
rear camera an HD front camera LTE comes
in white and black is going to be up
three hundred and twenty nine dollars
and can be pre-ordered this friday as
well so if you guys are looking for that
