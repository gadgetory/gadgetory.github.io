monitor market they make tons and tons
of monitors I was able to get ahold of
the p8 to 490 which is right here behind

for the artist and the professional
person I know a lot of you guys out them
you read the art gonna go oh why did it
pay five hundred dollars let's monitor
what I can get these other gaming
monitors for cheaper well yes you can
but those monitors are not gonna work in
an environment where you do print and
you have to match up all the colors on
your monitor when you need all those
type of features the PA 2 for 9q really
kicks ass it has portrait
picture-in-picture
