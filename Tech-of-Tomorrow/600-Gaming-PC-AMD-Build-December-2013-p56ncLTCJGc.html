folks welcome back to the channel we're
always having a little bit of fun there
so check it out what's going on you guys
are always asking for AMD systems that
are a great price so check it out put
all the parts together we tried a bunch
of different configurations just trying
to figure out what was the absolute best
way we could bring you guys a
six-hundred-dollar system using AMD
stuff so check it out my logic is kind
of different than some people like some
people say you should just you know go
with a really entry-level motherboard
and cpu and go all out of the video card
like I'm kind of not of that thought
because the motherboard and the apu in
this case are going to be installed
inside of the system I think it's much
easier to change your video card out or
do something like that than to taught
the motherboard and do all that stuff so
with that said today's video was about
the six hundred dollar AMD system
featuring either a 6800 k or 5800 k from
AMD a little bit of a price difference
there we'll bring you some options so
with that said let's jump in right now
and let's talk about the parts plus
another thing is these are going to be a
series of three videos and you guys are
going to like them why well because it
involves giving you guys shit at the end
well not literally shit I'm not going to
let go in my hands and you know and it
out from the crowd like that that's not
happening we're talking about the system
mateys so today's video introducing the
parts next week's video Anthony will put
the system together the week's video
after that will show you the guys system
up and running and doing everything and
then we'll give it away to you guys
that's right so that's going to be
really awesome stuff so with that said
let's jump in and let's now check out
the parts that we're talking about in
the six hundred dollar AMD build so
first and foremost folks let's start off
with the motherboard now I figured that
because we're building a system we want
the motherboard to be very good because
you want to stay in your system and be
as flexible as possible so we chose the
asus f 285 vpro this motherboard comes
to market at about 120 94
you guys can see that back here behind
me we have it open up on the table we
actually had the CPU already installed
we use the retail cooler because we
figure what's keeping this budget we'll
just go ahead and use that you want
upgrade it later hey that's your option
as far as the APU goes we are going to
use the AMD a10 5800 k which is 10 999
or the AMD a10 6800 k which 130 499 and
which is actually currently installed
inside of the system for the memory
everybody says it's best to stick with
very fast memory on AMD boards so we
chose the crucial ballistic tactical
tracer 8 gigabyte 1866 megahertz this
stuff's a hundred and eleven dollars and
eighty-six sense right now and you can
overclock it to 2133 megahertz without
any problems the gigabyte radeon HD 6670
is also the video card that's
recommended on the side of both the
boxes and is said to work very well with
this apu this video car will be able to
play games at medium settings no problem
at all at 1920 x 1080 p perfect for Kim
to your TV and stuff like that has all
the proper connections now obviously
we're going to need a power supply to
supply this thing with some power we
chose the thermaltake TR to ford and 30
watt ps2 this thing actually runs at
about 500 watts even though they call it
a 4 and 30 watt psu and video cards all
the way up to some of the modern 7
series cards could actually be used as
this power supply without any problems
the thermaltake TR 24 and 30 watt psu
comes to market at 58 87 now as far as
the case we chose the cooler master half
912 this thing comes to market at 59
point 99 all right and last but not
least an optical drive we chose the
samsung it's coming to market about 20
bucks this way we can install the OS no
problem you don't really need it for
anything and Worthing downloads but hey
what the heck it's nice to have you want
to burn some cds it's there now two
options you can go with like we sit with
the 6800 k the system comes into the
market at about five hundred and
ninety-four dollars if we use the 5800 k
it's about 569 so this keeps a system
under the six hundred dollar level also
a lot of people say oh the oh
whatever the monitor the keyboard I
think that a lot of people out there
kind of have this stuff like lying
around and these are kind of parts that
are easy to get keyboard and mouse I
mean you can find it anywhere and
honestly you guys always make the
comments about pirating I want online
the other day and I just typed in to get
a code you can find codes online if you
look for like 25 bucks now I don't know
exactly how legitimate they are but
they're selling it through ebay and
everywhere else selling codes I guess
they have a code generator so it must be
somewhat legit so even buying that code
you could still stick right in that
little six hundred dollar limit the
reason I chose a very good motherboard
is I figure it's much easier in the
future just a slap a new video card in I
mean if you want to take out the
motherboard and change all that stuff
out i mean that's cool but i don't think
most people want to do that it's much
easier to go out grab a video card stick
it in there that foreign 3 watt power
supply like i said it'll support pretty
much some of the lower in 7 series video
cards you know like obviously gonna be
able stick a 780ti in there and get
enough power but hey even with that all
you have to do is pull that out put a
new power supply in put in the video
card in and you can compete with
anything but that you can compete with
pretty much anything that's a pu is not
really going to bottleneck it's a
quad-core so it's really good to go i
see the system being very upgradable and
plus just say you don't want upgrade it
you can easily pull out the video card
leave the marriotts in there and leave
this thing of the way it is and pass it
on down to some family member and sell
for lower price Tim using the onboard
video that's already available on the 68
150 800 k so anyways I like to hear you
guys's comments down below plus a few
guys are interested all the parts for
this will be listed down below or you
can check all those out you can pick all
this up on amazon for a deal right now
by the way these are today's pricing
they may fluctuate some may go down some
may go up but today these are the actual
prices for these things I'm elric hope
you guys like this video if so hit that
like button if you're not subscribed hey
I think that you do so because christmas
is coming we're given this system way
but dude Santa's bag is
and be with you
