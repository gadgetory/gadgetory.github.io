bucks with this month's build we've got
you covered welcome to the knicks
gearing up for 1080p gaming in
battlefield 4 on high settings we saw
just under 43 average frames per second
on Tomb Raider always a favor on
ultimate settings we saw close to 42
average frames per second next up crysis
3 love that game on medium settings we
saw 40.3 average frames per second and
last but not least far cry 4 medium
settings 35.1 average frames per second
and i know that some of you folks out
there want to do more than gaming so we
ran geekbench and we also run it on
32-bit this way you can compare your
system as well for the single core score
we saw 1134 and on the multi-core score
we saw 3662 on cinebench 15 on opengl we
saw almost 23 frames per second and the
cpu score was 151 seed bead so now you
know what the systems capable of let's
see what it actually looks like and
what's inside for the case we went with
the city cs2 now this thing's packed
full of features for under 50 bucks and
it even has a window it features USB 3.0
solid fan support and supports ATX micro
ATX and mini ATX motherboards there's
also plenty of room for a beefy s video
card and this thing has some awesome
blue LED lighting to add some life to
your build for the processor we chose an
AMD athlon APU this is the 5350 now this
bad boy features 4 cores clocked at 2.05
gigahertz and also integrated graphics
so if you wanted to use it at a cheaper
build you could but for this one we
paired with a dedicated GPU for more
gaming power for the motherboard we went
with the asus a.m. 1m dash a now this is
a micro ATX form factor motherboard that
supports memory up to 1600 megahertz USB
3.0 and doesn't come up short for
something that's under 40 bucks for the
video card which is really one of the
most important things in a gaming build
win with the XFX r9 270 now this bad boy
pax 2 gigabytes of memory has 1280
stream processors a 925 megahertz boost
clock and it packs enough power to kick
ass
EP gaming to round out the build we went
with 4 gigabytes of crucial 1600
megahertz ram a one terabyte western
digital blue a hard drive and a 550 watt
cooler master g x to power supply now if
you folks looking to build one of these
things for your pc gaming pleasure we'll
have all these parts listed over on
Tekra tomorrow calm which has been
completely revamped using Squarespace
