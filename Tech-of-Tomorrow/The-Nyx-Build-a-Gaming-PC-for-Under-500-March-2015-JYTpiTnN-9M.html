battlefield 4 on high settings we saw
just under 43 average frames per second
on Tomb Raider always a favor on
ultimate settings we saw close to 42
average frames per second next up crysis
3 love that game on medium settings we
saw 40.3 average frames per second and
last but not least far cry 4 medium
settings 35.1 average frames per second
and i know that some of you folks out
there want to do more than gaming so we
ran geekbench and we also run it on
32-bit this way you can compare your
system as well for the single core score
we saw 1134 and on the multi-core score
we saw 3662 on cinebench 15 on opengl we

solid fan support and supports ATX micro
ATX and mini ATX motherboards there's
also plenty of room for a beefy s video
card and this thing has some awesome
blue LED lighting to add some life to
your build for the processor we chose an
AMD athlon APU this is the 5350 now this
bad boy features 4 cores clocked at 2.05
gigahertz and also integrated graphics
so if you wanted to use it at a cheaper
build you could but for this one we
paired with a dedicated GPU for more
gaming power for the motherboard we went
with the asus a.m. 1m dash a now this is
a micro ATX form factor motherboard that
supports memory up to 1600 megahertz USB
3.0 and doesn't come up short for
something that's under 40 bucks for the

pax 2 gigabytes of memory has 1280
stream processors a 925 megahertz boost
clock and it packs enough power to kick

megahertz ram a one terabyte western
