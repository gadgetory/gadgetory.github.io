strange things are once again happening
in the PC industry it's probably just
the way things are going to be because
well it's the PC industry it's full of
drama it's full of crazy stuff always
going on so first up it seems like even
though everybody waited for navi you you
know everybody sat with their fingers
crossed and we were all like hoping it
was going to be the next coming of
Christ you know when it came to video
cards I mean a lot of people knew that
it was probably only going to be you
know mid-range but you know really is
not be dead on arrival
I mean is it dead on arrival I mean I
mean it's $4.99 and since then videos
released the super cards well does that
kind of make it like almost irrelevant
right out the door and if so I mean I
know that's kind of really kind of sad
for Andy cuz they're like hey we've got
Navi we've come to save you all from the
demons that in video those evil horny
Devils but no it arrived lease on paper
$4.99 and there was supposed to you know
be able to keep up you know with some
clubs only maybe even a 27-year i oh
well okay well so now that 2070 supers
here it's gonna beat it so out of the
water
it's kind of weird now a lot of people
are kind of going crazy about these
super cards you know they're complaining
about the price everything else but for
me the 2060 super at $399 is a good deal
I'll tell you why you can get mad when
the 1080 was out it was 499 dollars
originally for the car and people are
gonna go oh my god you know price price
price so let's take one thing into
consideration right off the bat it's
called inflation so things are
definitely going up we all saw that with
the 2080 I where's the price that's like
$1500 you know which is what you know
Titan cards and all the super duper you
know basically workstations slack you
know gaming cards are priced at and and
video like basically up the a me which
I thought was a pretty kind of you know
messed up thing to get to do you know it
kind of really changed the whole gaming
parameter because like here's a card
that's like more expensive than most
people are actually investing in their
systems and we've talked about this lots
of times people who are in poor
countries and stuff they don't have the
cash they want them by these SuperDuper
expensive systems they just don't so
this cards being $399 it's faster than a
1080 cooler than atte it does have all
the ray-tracing features and all that
stuff in it you know so I think that
that particular card is a solid card for
$399 now the 2020 seventies super we all
know why it's here it's only here to
counter navi and basically beyond slap
AMD as soon as they had a release so
it's like you know AMD had like this
giant like presidential party saying we
won the election and everybody's like I
know we just retaliate the votes and
guess what well you didn't win that's
kind of almost what it is you know kind
of political slap in the face there
which leads me to the next part of
today's like news stories so currently
right now there are only nine games on
the market right now that are supporting
r-tx which really isn't a lot nine games
let's just face it nine you know mm-hmm
it's it's there but it's not a whole lot
of games but there are things like
control that's coming out that's gonna
support different features and we're
finally gonna actually see some game
developers that are actually developing
their games from the ground up using
ray-tracing features and making it a
core element of the game now stay in the
light is going to be like I said the
very first game that from the ground up
we'll have all the r-tx features in it
it's going to be a core element of the
game so far what we've really seen for
the ray-tracing stuff has really been
just eye candy you know a lot of
reflections hey you guys have said it a
bunch of times it's a bunch of shiny
stuff but now that a game developer is
going to be doing this from the ground
up this should change things quite a bit
and although this guy is
a single guy is like one guy doing this
developing it's still going to be you
know a new trend and we're also seeing
other games that have Vulcan M you know
such as doom eternal and stuff
that's where Vulcan this was announced
it also supports rate racing and you
know I don't even know if really Nvidia
was really even aware this was actually
happening but people are starting to
pick up on the rate racing stuff in the
industry it's starting to get picked up
yes it's been a while when the cards
first came out yeah they were overly
priced we all know this it's you know
it's just the way things are you know
but now we do see the prices going down
so you can get yourself a twenty seventy
super which is gonna be a pretty dang
fast card it's gonna play almost
everything out there everybody knows
pretty much that 4k gaming is just BS
anyway so who really cares you're
talking 1080 1440 in that particular
area so that should do good now when
Navi gets here
I'm really hoping that Navi has really
good numbers and that may be the first
car that we're gonna see you know that's
coming out in the market this 5700 maybe
that'll just be like the entry level
that we're going to see hopefully maybe
we'll see some higher end cards from
that because just coming out with a card
you know I'm making a big hoodoo about
it and they're only competing in kind of
the mid-range and then getting kind of
smacked right after that I don't know it
I don't know that's kind of a weird
situation I think really that a and D
needs to kind of step back and choose an
area where they want to compete like
they're doing very well against Intel on
the CPU side of things on the GPU side
of things though it's almost like
they're just hanging in there because
there's no other fighter to really fight
the fight with NVIDIA and since you know
you really can't have anybody having a
monopoly here it's like they kind of
have to exist by law now by the law of
nature should that really happen because
the law of nature is really this I mean
if you go to the African plains and you
go watch animals and they need to eat
they eat another animal they do whatever
they need to do to survive survival of
the fittest that's the way nature's been
going on forever so I mean if Nvidia
really can they'll make better cards and
not have anybody compete with the only
thing that really kind of sucks is that
then they can go really crazy on pricing
because there's nobody
there to compete with them so it's kind
of a really weird thing the way the laws
are set up here in America it's like
according to nature it should be some
rival of fittest but the way the law is
here you can't have that you have to
have competition like even for newer TVs
you can't bring your brand-new TV so
let's just say today that me and the
Cameron G has come with this great TV
idea blows everything out of the water
we can sell it for cheaper we want to
bring it here the first thing that we're
gonna run into as well we have all these
TVs that are already here that we need
to sell that we've brought and paid for
so until we actually sell these TVs you
guys can't bring your TV even in here so
it's kind of a weird market because it
really is no longer survival of the
fittest it's just not that way at all
it's about marketing strategy planning
business corporate BS all over the place
so it's really kind of crazy now nothing
want to talk to you guys about is like
people like going crazy about you know
the price of stadia you know they're
like oh my god it's gonna be this much
money but you gotta understand something
that the PC industry is an entertainment
industry everybody wants to be
entertained George Carlin said it you
know the only reason you're even here on
this planet is to be entertained that's
why you're here so as long as it's not
like hurting anybody you should really
try to entertain yourself as much as
possible so that industry is always
going to be there and they're always
going to be charging you they're gonna
get you coming you're going so you're
either gonna be playing paying money in
the gaming industry you're gonna be
paying a high money to have yourself a
really SuperDuper high-end gaming
computer to play all these games or
you're gonna be paying monthly service
fees to somebody to be able to stream
all of their games now it's kind of a
mixed bag I mean in the future when all
these games are online you can play any
game you want us some little cheap-ass
little thing because everything's done
online I mean you've gotta admit that's
gonna be kind of cool but you're gonna
be paying for this hardware either way
so instead of going out right off the
bat and just paying for this computer
that's two or three thousand dollars to
play your games well now you're gonna be
probably paying some 30 or $40 a month
fee you know I paying up by paying for
your electricity or everything else just
to be entertained
to be a gamer so either way you're gonna
get stuck paying for your entertainment
it's either one way or the other
high-end equipment or high fees every
month there's just no way out of it so
people think oh well you know the
staties gonna come the gaming industry
is gonna be like totally change yes I
think it will change quite a bit because
a lot of people who don't have a whole
lot of money upfront but who work and
can afford you know at least a monthly
fee you know that'll be cool now what I
really hope though is this stuff is that
it's more of a sliding scale stuff
because I don't feel that a person who's
like India or Indonesia or any these
companies that don't have the same
dollar rate as we do should have to be
paying the same amount of a monthly fee
I mean everybody knows that you know
America Europe these countries have more
money so these countries should
obviously be paying more for the service
fee and the countries that don't have
that much money shouldn't have to be
paying that much money for it it should
work on a sliding scale we're like if
they know this particular reason region
you know cannot afford you know $30 a
month these people could only afford two
dollars a month well they should only
have to pay two dollars a month because
they're making their money anyways and
everything's going to be online so like
always I want to hear what you guys have
to say so right off the bat first thing
we talked about na'vi do you guys think
that it's dead upon arrival I kind of do
I was really looking for something
better I know it was gonna be mid end
you know so I don't you know maybe I
shouldn't have had such high
expectations and maybe that's my fault
but I think a lot of you felt the same
way also we all know that RTS came out
the cards were overpriced yadda yadda
yadda that's already been said done
sliced up and bread it up and cooked
every which way that you can do it more
ways than chicken so like now we just
have to decide okay you know when is
r-tx gonna be viable now the cards are
getting there you know that you can get
a nice car for $399 that's faster than a
1080 which was like the second you know
fastest car a couple years ago that's
still not too bad what do you guys feel
about that you guys still feel that like
r-tx is complete ripoff you don't want
to buy the Nvidia cards or you feel that
hey you know what since the cards are
coming lower and there are more
technologies coming that you know these
cards and the technology will be more
and last but not least do you agree with
me that no matter what's going on in the
gaming industry you're gonna be getting
charged one way or the other you're
either gonna be paying big money to like
have all of your equipment in your house
so you can run every game that you have
which is a lot of upfront investment
money which means coming up with a lot
of cash at one time or do you think it's
cool to have to pay this monthly service
fee and do you agree with me that the
scale should slide according to how
people can afford it even though I'm
probably living in a pipe dream with
that I just think that's how it should
be I'm mark I thank you guys for
watching tech go tomorrow we'll see you
guys back in the channel lots more stuff
got some headphones top-five comes up
coming up next week and obviously you
guys know well we got more Super coming
we'll see what it's all about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
