back here once again on tech Audemar
we've got more tech on the table for you
today what's going on today we've got
some really nice under $100 gaming
headphones from Kingston these are the
cloud alpha headphones and these things
are really nice they have a lot of
features and they're also totally
certified for discord and teamspeak so
when you're online you want to play with
your friends and be able to communicate
with them you're gonna be able to do it
very easily with these with that said
though let's jump in let's check out the
unboxing that features at the end of the
day if you might want to buy these for
your gaming environment now inside the
box you get the headphones themselves a
bag to carry them you also get a
detachable microphone and there are two
different braided 3.5 millimeter cables
and if for some reason you don't know
how to plug in the headphones or put
them on your head there's a manual now
first off let's talk about the design of
these brand new cloud alpha headphones
for one thing they're made out of very
durable and very light aluminum in fact
it's red anodized aluminum for you folks
out there who like that red and black
design like Ferrari or team red this is
gonna be something really nice and it's
also very very and I do mean very
durable the band on top it's actually
double seen and inside right here it's
very very soft everything in here is
actually called warm leatherette now for
you older guys you probably know I'm
talking about because in the 80s there
was this weird song called all leather
res and that's the only time I've ever
actually seen anybody actually used the
word leather read sounds kind of kinky
right sounds like one of those
dominatrix ladies her and her leather
red outfit right anyways this leather
red stuff is actually very nice on your
ears the cups when they're on your ears
you don't sweat you don't really feel
them it's so really natural soft it's
like almost like even softer than skin
so you can wear these for a really long
time in your head with getting a bunch
of discomfort and going like this
itching it never does that and if you're
playing hot I know a lot of times some
headphones you get that sweat going
around your ear I find that really nasty
why do you guys probably feel the same
way and you don't get that feeling at
all with these now they're not super
duper ultra lightweight but they are
pretty lightweight and something that
definitely sets them apart
and the pack are the drivers inside the
headphones inside of these headphones
are 50 millimeter drivers most
headphones up in the market feature 40
millimeter drivers and these are
actually much bigger which means you're
going to get more sound being pushed
through the cups which means actually
more dynamic sound in your head and the
design of these is also very different
than most traditional headphones as well
most the time you see a pair of
headphones they have either the
subwoofer or the woofer and the tweeter
right next to each other
well the design of these headphones is
completely different it's completely
chambered up so your bass speakers in
one chamber your next speaker contains
your tweeter excuse me the next chamber
contains your tweeter and so on which
means that your sounds totally separated
so you get none of that weird flubbing
stuff that I've talked about in other
videos because it's just not there when
you hear the bass and everything on this
it's just solid and no matter how big
the explosion is or what's going on it
never distorts whatsoever and to me when
you're in game that's really the most
important part you want to hear what
you're doing but definitely when all
those explosions start you don't want to
like you have to like go back turn your
audio down and go oh my god these things
are just sorting out and sounding like
crap you never have to worry about that
whatsoever
with these brand new cloud phones these
things are just really nice the cloud
Alfa's I have to say are at $99 probably
one of the better dealers you're going
to be able to get out there now another
thing about these headphones is the
detachable microphone the microphone
itself is actually really nice it has
noise reduction which means that the
outside sound will you won't be hearing
that when you're talking all the talking
and everything you do will be
encapsulated right by the microphone so
if there's background noise and that
stuff going on you're not actually going
to hear that in the microphone that's
much better because when you're playing
online you don't want people to hear
what's going on behind you you want them
to be able to hear your voice and that's
something really nice about these as
well and when you don't want to use it
whatsoever
it's great that you can just attach it
and set it off to the side a feature I
really like now it also has a braided
cable very very durable and all the
controls for muting your mic and volume
and all that are also all contained
within the cables so if you don't have
to worry about reaching up for any
buttons your playing game just want to
really adjust the volume or hit your
micro quickies you don't want to talk it
can all be very easily done now another
important thing is how well the
the microphone worked well in game it
works absolutely flawlessly whenever I
didn't complaint somebody saying hey we
can't hear you or anything like that
kind of actually hard to show that exact
quality in game but when I close the
video out I'm gonna go ahead and use the
microphone so you guys can hear just how
well it actually sounds and records
there are a few other models in the $99
price range which you guys are probably
familiar with the Logitech G 430 3s and
the SteelSeries Arctic 5 headphones
these are all at $99 but if you look at
the features all the way across the
board the cloud alpha wins alright so
there you have it
everything about Kingston's brand-new
HyperX cloud alpha headphones now right
now everything you're hearing is being
recorded through the microphone mister
buddy wanted to be in the video and say
hello to you guys so here he is for all
the people out there missing buddy say
hello to mr. puppy he's here now here's
what my bottom line is these $99 is not
a lot of money to pay for a set of
headphones it's just not we've had
videos out there showing you guys
headphones all the way down like the 10
dollar range they've got a lot of cheesy
stuff out there
my biggest favorite thing about these
headphones I have to say though is the
way the chamber design comes across in
gaming like I said when you're in game
and you've got all these explosions
gunshots and all that kind of stuff that
comes to the type of games I play you
want headphones that can really handle
all that sound without distorting or
sounding weird in any way and you
definitely want a microphone that people
who are on the other side of the
microphone can hear you and understand
just what the heck you're saying in game
and this microphone does that absolutely
flawlessly so at the end of the day I
have to say at $99 against the
competition with all the features the
braided cable the microphone being
detachable the design the 50 millimeter
drivers everything that goes into these
the lightweight design the aluminum this
the anodized one of the way it looks
just overall looks functionality sound
everything for an in-game experiences
here and I give these things a definite
editor's choice here on Decca tomorrow
for a gaming set of headphones now take
this in mind audiophile headphones are
different than gaming headphones at the
end of the day audiophile headphones
our men strictly to reproduce audio at a
very flat level and trying to color it
too much so you can hear the music but a
gaming set of headphones is much
different they're more made to handle
loud excruciating sound and be able to
reproduce it inside of the cans without
distorting and sounding like crap and at
the end of the day if you put these on
your head and you try them out I
guarantee you're gonna like them
I'm alaric you guys been watching
ticking tomorrow this was not a paid or
sponsored video and like usual down
below there be a link we'll have a link
to these headphones and like usual we
want to hear your comments and if you
want a pair of these let me know what
you think peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
