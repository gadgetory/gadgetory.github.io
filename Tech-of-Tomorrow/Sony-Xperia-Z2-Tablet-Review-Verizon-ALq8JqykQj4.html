Squarespace your free trial and 10% off
your order and RT ot a check out hey
what's going on
friends family and fellow tech lovers
around the world
I'm Elric come at you guys in 4k thumbs
up if you guys love pixels today we'll
be reviewing and taking a close look at
the Sony Xperia z2 tablet Verizon
edition now some people out there will
call it the z2 but here in America we
pronounce our Z's with the SUP so with
that said let's jump in and let's check
out what this new tablets all about
first and foremost I know that most of
my fans out there are PC enthusiasts so
with that said let's check out what you
guys love the specs internally the z2
features a Snapdragon 801 quad-core
processor now this thing's clocked at
2.3 gigahertz and for the GPU it
features an Adreno 330 now as far as the
RAM goes it has three gigabytes which is
pretty good for something that's small
and held in your hands all things
considering and it also features for the
OS KitKat 4.4.2 now as far as storage
goes it comes with 32 gigabytes onboard
but if you're out there and your media
junkie
this thing can have up to 128 gigabytes
via the microSD card slot the battery of
this thing is also pretty damn beefy
6,000 milliamp hours that's pretty beefy
my filament things got like 2800 so this
thing's got a lot of power it has NFC
Bluetooth 4.0 obviously Wi-Fi and like
we said earlier it also features
Verizon's 4G LTE to me the screen is one
of the absolute most important features
of any tablet device phone or anything
else because for one thing you got to be
steering this thing constantly so it's
important to me is something that should
never be overlooked
now the z2 features a 10.1 inch screen
that features a resolution of 1920 by
1200 now although the pixel density
isn't quite as much the Nexus 10 or some
of the iPad retinas watching movies and
stuff at 1080p this thing still looks
amazing
viewing angles are great thanks to its
IPS display one thing that sets the z2
apart is its live color LED which
actually looks great so what this does
in layman's terms it basically takes all
of you
colors makes them as accurate as
possible makes all the color depth as
real as possible and makes everything
really super vivid so that way you're
looking at it's like looking at
something live sound on the Z 2 to me is
pretty damn good now it's not like off
the charts like whoa
but compared to an iPad and a lot of the
other things I've heard out there when
I'm watching a movie on this the sound
is very very nice it has almost kind of
like that simulated surround sound and
so it's really good you're looking down
to your picture and when you're hearing
everything the speakers are located
right down the bottom so it's really
like a fully like immersing experience
with the sound a lot of the other stuff
I listen to out there it gets very tinny
this isn't like that whatsoever even
you've got the bass rumble not obvious
or not kind of like a subwoofer
but it still it balances out where you
feel like you're immersed in the movie
with your sound which i think is pretty
impressive on the z2 obviously this
thing's meant to take and travel around
with you everywhere so when you're
taking something and traveling around it
you don't want something that weighs a
fricking brick this thing weighs 0.97 of
a pound very very light and it's only a
quarter-inch thick that's right man
point two-five
so the thing's super duper thin
SuperDuper light style if you're lugging
it around with you it's not going to
become a big hurdle some thing like
you're carrying around a big old brick
in that aspect of it I think a lot of
people are going to appreciate that and
although this unit is very very thin and
lightweight that does not mean that it's
not durable this little bad boy is
waterproof as seen by our ice bucket
challenge and it's also dust and scratch
resistant and real quickly going back to
the ice bucket ALS challenge we were
actually incorporating that into the
testing of the Xperia z2 and as you guys
can see even with a bucket of ice over
my head the z2 came out lickin and
tickin the z2 also comes with two
built-in cameras and be honest with you
I wasn't really all that impressed with
how they worked but that's a whole other
thing
I'm not going to be taking a whole lot
of pictures with this thing but it does
feature an 8.1 megapixel rear facing
camera and a two point two megapixel
front-facing camera now with that said
though let's jump in and let's check out
how it does video and see what you folks
think about that
what up you watch in the camera test
because of TOD we only bring the best
what you looking at you looking at the Z
- I'm looking at me and you're looking
at you so there you guys have it folks
now you guys can see the video quality
isn't like you know drop your hat
outstanding but still you have the
convenience of having it with you
whenever you have your Z - so if you're
out traveling around and you need a
quick camera all of a sudden hey you've
got it right there at the tip of your
fingers and I don't really think that
Sony's really pushing this for their
camera abilities I think they're more
pushing it for its multimedia abilities
and things like that
now also smooth things we didn't talk
about this thing you can easily check
your mail it comes with actually some
software for doing business so you could
do light business everything traveling
around with this so if you actually
don't want to use your laptop and you
just want to have a tablet the z2 offers
quite a bit of features for those type
of people and this device might fit your
needs very well you know along the sides
of everything you guys can see that on
one side you have your power your rocker
buttons for your volume then on the
other side you have all your Bay's now
here in size where your USB chargers
here to your s DS did all the things are
hidden behind these things if they
weren't hidden you wouldn't be able to
have the ability to have all this
waterproof stuff now we did the ice
bucket challenge if in these things
we're open obviously they're take a
chance of it getting wet and R in the
device but the way that it's made this
thing is completely waterproof
now battery life which I know a lot of
people out there's going to be wool very
very important stuff now for me when I
was using this thing constantly watching
light movies checking my email
two-and-a-half days of battery life and
standby has been incredible I bet this
thing just sitting for the last seven
days and it's still at 74% of its
battery charge so that's actually a
pretty incredible feature of the z2
another question I know all of you
people out there going to be asking what
are the LTE speeds well in my
neighborhood and things aren't that
great they're not abysmal but I get
basically seven up eight down which you
know that's just kind of moderate now
I've seen other speeds at thirty and
thirty in other locations so for those
people you're getting a really grand
experience my house has never really
been known
that great to work really well with
Verizon in any case so don't let that be
a factor for your decision because in
your area you might get great
connectivity speeds now me personally
I'm not that big of a tablet gamer but
due to the adrenal 330 and the fact that
the games are played at 1080p this thing
can play them without any problem at all
and they do look pretty good you guys
can see we bounced through asphalt 8
this is a very popular game in fact I
play it all the time on other things and
this is something that a lot of people
are going to be playing so I think it's
a good representation of what games do
now one drawback about the unit and I
don't really know if this will affect
that many people but there are less apps
and there are on an apple type device
but if you're not an apple fan anyways I
don't see you buying an iPad and with as
far as the Google Play Store is come I
don't really think that's going to be
that big of a deal to a lot of users now
that about wraps up today's video folks
but before I bounce on out of here I
want to give a special shout to the
people over at Squarespace for making
