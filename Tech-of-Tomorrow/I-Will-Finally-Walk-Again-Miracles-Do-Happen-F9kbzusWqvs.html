you guys here on my channel now check
this out you guys all know I've been
having some medical issues with my foot
the surgery was a complete success my
diets monistic says my foot is almost
completely healed they're saying that
within one to two weeks maximum I'll be
up and walking again that's going to be
incredible because I've missed walking
my dog I've missed being able to have
any kind of normal life because I can't
even able to put any pressure at all on
my right leg or my right foot and it's
that means every time I want to go up
and down the stairways I got to crawl
like a dog crawl like a dog down hop
into this little little cart thing I got
and then you know pushed my way into my
room then when I'm in there I'm pretty
much stuck in my bed so it's been kind
of a boring you know kind of thing to do
luckily a lot of people have been really
cool I was able to get that really nice
PC but I showed you guys that is just
amazing my parents kicked me down and
got me a TV so all in all it's been
really really great you guys have been
the most wonderful wonderful people in
the world so many great comments so much
support from around the world it really
makes a person feel appreciated and I
know the views in this channel are down
I don't know what YouTube is doing to me
because we've had videos that have gone
to 500,000 you know that are the same
subjects that we're doing normally this
particular thing's been broken we have
no idea about it but doesn't matter we
make our money in different various ways
so we're gonna keep coming back to you
and back to you and back to you unless I
just totally like cut us off and at that
point we just start a new channel and do
something different for you folks so I
know it kind of sucks and you guys come
in you see the views and it kind of like
you know kind of bothers me as well
because I know that something's just not
right but I don't know what to do to fix
it so all I'm concentrating on now is
just making sure we make good videos
making sure I stick to my diet hopefully
this will be like one of the last times
you guys see me in my wheelchair
hopefully my appointment the doctor is
next Tuesday I won't show you guys
another picture might focus a lot of
people kind of freaked out about that
but the foot now is pretty much
completely closed so from view guys who
did watch the other video you saw that
first picture where was all like
hamburger now it's all the way closed I
think he's going to do probably one more
debris VA ssin surgery next week what
that is that
much is taking ask Apple he goes around
my foot he takes and cuts off all the
dead skin all the dead callus all that
stuff and I believe after that I'll be
able to wear a shoe I think I'm gonna
have to have some kind of like
protective pad that I wear under my foot
for a little while so it doesn't get
damaged but hopefully by the end of next
week I'll be up and walking again which
is gonna be great because CES is coming
and then the NAMM shows coming and I
want to go out and see the people I
haven't been able to do any of these
shows that have been going on like the
packs or anything else because I haven't
been able to walk in a long time
correctly hopefully now I'll be back to
walking so I can go out and actually
meet you guys the public a lot more my
body feels great I feel great I thank
you guys for all your support thanks for
watching this video you guys have been a
wonderful audience
just so much appreciation on my behalf
for so many people the doctors the fans
my parents the people support me to use
the cameraman bill my roommate there's
been a lot of people who've helped
support me and help me carry through
this weight cuz it's real like I said
it's been a burden to be stuck in my bed
or in a wheelchair it's just very
limiting I can go to my garage even to
play my guitar is a pain in the butt
because I got to be very careful just
trying to get my guitar on one leg so I
don't drop it and break it so it's been
an ordeal I'm glad it's almost over
thank God thanked all the people
you guys have been wonderful we'll see
you guys background teka tomorrow for
more videos but the good news is is
guess what I'm healed up and I'm gonna
be walking within two weeks at the
maximum that's just good news so
hopefully my Christmas present this year
will be hey Elric your foots totally
healed you can walk see you guys from
the channel for more tech we ain't going
nowhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
