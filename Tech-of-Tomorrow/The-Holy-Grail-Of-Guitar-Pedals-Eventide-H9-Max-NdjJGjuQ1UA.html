something a little bit different here on
techno morrow today we're gonna be
taking a look at what I would probably
consider to be probably one of the most
awesome effects pedals that any musician
could ever get their hands on and I
really mean this I wasn't paid any money
for this whatsoever I got this product
and it's just simply amazing I'm talking
about the Eventide h9 now the version
that I got is the maximum version which
means it comes with everything pre
packed inside of it it's got 50
algorithms inside of it
99 presets and it's kind of unique it's
in another way as well because there's a
control panel that you can use either
through your Android or iOS device
excuse me Android or iOS device and
there's 500 presets all built into that
now you guys can see it's right back
here be honey I'm gonna go ahead and
grab my little iPad back here now what
you heard on the intro that was called
crush station metal and that's the
preset that we were using from the
Eventide h9 behind me I'll talk a little
bit about our signal changes I know a
lot of people don't talk about that when
they're doing their videos and I was at
go mad and go hey how did you record
this crap man
so I have my guitar but you guys can see
right here it's my soul are 16 mile
Englund signature model I love this bad
boy guitar I have a line 6 amplifier
behind me I have a cab by a company
called joy oh it's got vintage 30s in it
so it's actually a really nice cab I've
got a weber mass up there so I have the
volume really turned up on the clean
channel here and I'm using the Eventide
h9 and that's all that you're hearing
for the effects I do have the reverb
turned up to the middlegame and pretty
much everything except for the bass I
have almost at the 12 o'clock position
on the app I do have the bass turned up
a little bit more and I do have the
drive turned up on there just a slight
bit because even though it's a super
duper clean channel I have a tube in
there and you have to really drive it
even you get to have sound come out it's
really made for clean stuff but it
sounds great with what the pedals
running through the front of it um my
goal once I got this pedal hover was
thinking about how I could incorporate
not having this giant pedal board
anymore
you guys know I don't have any toes on
my feet so it's kind of really hard for
me to be just stomp
a bunch of stuff so the h9 is really
unique because you can see that the h9
has 5 different categories to choose
from
there's the h9 exclusive their space
pitch factor mod factor and time factor
and you can see all of the different
algorithms down below there there are 3
different models you can choose from the
h9 introductory model you can see it's
got a few presets and then there's the
h9 harmonizer has a little bit more in
the h9 max which has everything inside
of it now one thing really cool though
however when you buy the h9 max is that
any future stuff that's released from
Eventide you get for free so when you
make that purchase no matter what these
guys release in the future you know it's
automatically going to be incorporated
into your pedal now showing you all the
different sounds inside of this pedal
would be crazy the videos would be hours
long I just want to say this though when
I first got the pedal I thought okay
cool this is a great thing for a guitar
but what I've discovered as I've been
playing around that and looking online
is this thing is way beyond that this
particular product can be used with a
guitar with a bass with a keyboard even
with drums pretty much if you can get a
signal inside of it and get a signal out
of it you can use it and that makes it
really amazing for a lot of different
things I'm Evan tides of company it's
been around a long time I'm in the 80s
like pretty much everybody had their
products inside of their rock guitar
players everybody because it was just a
really good stuff and in the studio it's
the same type of thing so with that said
though let's really take a closer look
at the pedal I'll show you guys how it
operates how you can control it and then
I'll show you guys five of my most
favorite tones that I liked right out of
the box and just play them as like wow
amazing just like the one I played in
the intro and you guys can hear in the
intro how it actually sits in a mix it's
it's really nice you know by the way I
didn't mention this I've also got the
cab miked up with an sm57 going directly
into an ID 44 and then into Logic Pro so
that's pretty much the signal chain so
let's jump in let's take a closer look
at the pedal so first off let's take a
look at the face of the h9 at the very
top you can see there's an LCD screen
inside of here you'll see all of your
different presets and what you're doing
and those little blue lights off to the
side that's your Bluetooth letting you
know that you're up and running your
Bluetooth is connected now right below
that you'll see there are five different
buttons now the far right button this
will actually set you up with your
presets and then everything else is
operated with these different buttons
you have your x y&amp;amp;z factors and a scroll
wheel which you can scroll through all
of the different functions there's also
a tap button to the right and then an
active button we click the active button
that means the pedals on and the pedal
actually has true bypass as well so if
you don't want to use it'll completely
clean through your mix making no noise
whatsoever now before I go any further
all I want to talk about the control
panel app because this app is really
simple to use yes you can dial
everything in from the top of the pedal
and I mean that's really cool that you
have the ability to do that but using it
through your Android or your iOS device
it just makes it so much simpler um you
guys can see the screen it gives you all
kinds of different options for
controlling your environment and all
these different types of things and this
just makes it very very easy now on the
left hand side of the pedal you guys can
see there's MIDI in and out now usually
a MIDI pedal to control this is the
optimal way I think to control all the
different effects because you can
program all kinds of different things
and then scroll through all your MIDI
stuff to get exactly the sounds you want
I want to get two of these pedals and
have the most minimalistic setups as I
can have as possible just two of these
my pedal that's going to be driving my
distortion and that type of stuff and
probably a volume expression pedal and
then obviously a MIDI controller pedal
now in the back of the h9 you can see
there's two stereo inputs two stereo
outputs the power connection and then
there's also a USB connection for
connecting directly to your PC or your
Mac so that's what the pedal looks like
you can also like I said hook multiple
pedals up together you can hook up an
a/b switch you can also hook it up an
expression pedal volume pedal lots of
different ways to control the h9 but
with that said though let's jump in real
quick and let's just check out a few of
the cool sounds that I thought were just
amazing with I have to do any tweaking
whatsoever it would just basically hit a
button and play so I think I said it
wrong earlier it's actually crush States
I think I said crunch station because
it's all crunchy but it's actually crush
station this is
the metal setting and I think this
sounds good as it is I don't need any
other effects anything with it it just
sounds great to mix sounds great through
my app and for people out there looking
for that heavy crunchy 80 sound you can
definitely get it through this
particular setting it just sounds really
nice man
really really nice sounding to me this
is just really ballsy I enjoy this
setting quite a bit you can adjust it
four different ways you like it through
your ramp I'm running it like I said
through a clean channel you could
actually use your dirty channel and
combine it I don't know exactly how that
would sound but I know that the way it
is right now I really like it
[Laughter]
so this is my number one favorite
setting for just jamming on guitar my
house so my number one favorite ah I
like it crush station metal ah let's
move on to number two now this next
effect is called black hole dark matter
it's a very very ethereal sounding if
you ever heard the YouTube boy album
you've definitely heard this effect it's
probably been used on a few Pink Floyd
albums as well it just sounds really
really I got to tell you just a really
beautiful effect
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
sounds really beautiful right that's why
it's my second favorite preset jump do
anything to it just turn it on and go
and have lots of fun for hours okay now
number three is pretty incredible and
it's actually really new to the h9
family this is the hot saws
I'm music sounds like hot sauce right
it's hot sauce and this is the wasabi
lead preset this thing sounds really
incredible I have to incorporate this
somewhat into a song somehow because
it's really crazy it sounds like a
keyboard and the different ways that you
hit the string and the way that you you
know that you phrased that the string is
how this sounds so if you hit it really
hard as one sound a little bit softer a
different sound with that said though
let's check out the wasabi Lee because
it actually is pretty crazy
it goes away
Oh didn't it the note heart Nazi
that shorts out there
I love that one you guys can see though
the different ways that you attack the
strings affects the note so if you don't
hit the string like really hard you know
the notes just not going to come out so
you really got to make sure that you
time your attack when you're pressing
the string down at the same time
otherwise it's not gonna sound right but
I'm sure there's a lot of adjustments
that I can change in the attack and
stuff to get it to play exactly how I
want it to be but right out the box to
great effect just for having lots of fun
wasabi baby it's hot all right number
four of my top five is an OG this is the
cue wah and this is the vintage wah now
this sounds great there are a lot of
adjustments this can also be done with
also you can control this by the tap
tempo on the pedal I like to just set
the automation for just jamming on and
stuff like that but I have to say this
has a great tone to it and cuts right
through a mix plus it's pretty
interesting sounding
you think I did a couple of scores
little too powerful but anyways the the
Q wah definitely has a lot of different
options inside of there and the vintage
wall it's a really cool one like I said
you could do a lot of adjustments to
make it suit your exact to tome but you
guys can hear just out of the box
it still has potatoes it sounds really
crazy because it sounds like almost like
it's inside of a box and it's like
coming out of a box sounding many ways
let's move on to number 5 now for my
fifth favorite preset I'm using
something totally different this is
called model a funk echo I also have my
amp off of the clean channel now and I'm
on to the dirty channel kind of like a
jcm800 to My Line six
that's the modeling thing for this
particular lamp at this time so I've got
that turned on and let's just hear how
it sounds because this is a pretty
interesting thing especially for people
out there who play leaves I'm obviously
not a lead Blair miss the beginning guy
who just loves a guitar but you'll hear
the sounds in it just kind of really
nice I like this preset a lot
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
all right so not your average tech
review but hey it still has tech
involved it works with a PC or a Mac
baby so there you have it though the h9
Macs all of that goodness in that pedal
what's best about the pedal I think as
well as that you can hook up multiple
pedals and if you buy just honestly two
of these pedals you can probably get rid
of almost every other pedal that you
have the sounds on these pedals are
amazing I did not find one sound on the
h9 where I was just like oh that's just
okay and I have lots of other pedals I
have lots of multi effects pedals
I've got line six stuff I've got digit
tech stuff I have an axe effects I let
Shawn have the axe effects now so I
guess technically I don't have it
anymore but I had an axe effects for
years and honestly the sounds that I'm
getting out of this are just so much
nicer now there were a lot of modeling
things inside the axe FX for amps and
stuff like that that was really cool but
as far as just pure tones go I have to
say that these pedals are amazing real
quick let me just show you something I
got a couple of these diesel pedals back
here these are amazing sounding pedals
now what I'm planning on doing is I'm
planning on using one of these pedals I
have two different ones I have the
original one which is like the Metallica
one and all that stuff which is this
particular model and then I have the
other one which is which is which is
which is the Herbert when she's a little
bit different now my plan is though is
to use three different pedals I actually
have a Bogner ecstasy pedal so it'll be
the Bodnar xt one of those petals maybe
both um depending on what's going on a
couple of the h9 units a volume and
expression pedal and then a MIDI
controller and I don't really need to
have a giant MIDI controller because I
don't use a whole lot of effects but I
would like to have maybe six or seven
and there's some nice flanges and stuff
like that pays or stuff that I like to
play with some of the metal stuff that
we jam out to it's gonna be really cool
now my advice is this though if you are
going to buy all these pedals I would
buy the pedal because if you buy the
entry-level pedal it's honestly don't
tell him I told you this it's honestly
cheaper to upgrade the pedal to the max
and outright buying the max I know it's
crazy right but it ends up actually I
think a little bit cheaper plus you can
demo the different thing so you can find
the ones that you really like and if you
find that you like all of them you're
like oh my god I can't live without any
of these you can upgrade to the max but
if you listen to all of and you're like
you know what I really only like the
delays I really don't like you know this
or that you can just buy whatever
particular stuff that you like and
incorporate into your pedals it's really
simple to use
I don't know maybe you guys saw it I
mean controlling it through the app it
is unbelievably easy there's so many
different options that you can do inside
of here like I said with a MIDI pedal
you can program the different sounds for
onstage and stuff like that I love this
pedal the h9 is honestly one of the best
if not the best pedals I've ever heard
in my life and every sound inside of it
sounds good so if you're a guitar player
out there and you've ever been going man
I got all these pedals in my pedal board
some of them sound good some of them
don't and like I have some boss pedals I
have some harmonizer boss bells do they
sound anywhere near as good as the
harmonizer inside of the 89 though
absolutely not those pedals are what
like two hundred and seventy nine
dollars a piece so you think about it
you buy a couple of the high-end boss
pedals they're gonna sound okay
sometimes I'm pretty good but are they
gonna sound as good as the Eventide h9
absolutely not so at the end of the day
if you want the highest quality and
pretty much the best pedal that you can
get your investment in I would
definitely suggest looking into one of
these here the demos go into a store
play with if you can get your hands on
one I definitely don't think you'll be
disappointed like usual we'll have a
link down below so you guys want to
check out some more videos you can
there's guys doing bass demos that are
incredible guys doing the drums the guys
doing piano keyboards anything you can
pretty much think of there's a video out
there showing you how to use the h9 it's
very very versatile I'm Elric you've
been watched eka tomorrow
