by J and L real hey what's going on
YouTube welcome back once again to TECA
tomorrow another holiday edition I need
my head hey what's going on buddy
welcome back to another holiday edition
here on tech of tomorrow is just me with
Santa yep that's right Santa is a pooch
this year you didn't know that it's been
a doggone good year so what's going on
today what's today's video about well
first of all I just want to thank all
you people that stuck around me through
the year through 26 th been one hell of
a long crazy year so many people have
died so much has happened just a
crazy crazy ass year YouTube's changed
Vic the whole freaking world has changed
in 2016 Alan Thicke just died the other
day man bums me out to so many people
are gone hopefully 2017 is going to be a
better year and help make the next
coming year good for you folks I'm doing
something cool once again I'm gonna give
away a bunch of steam codes this time
I'm going to be giving away 50 steam
codes for games that's right so that's
50 games I'm gonna be given to you guys
now you're asking so what do I have to
do to win these games what's pretty easy
I want to get my Twitter subscriptions
up so based on my do it this way I have
50 games right now to give away but if
you guys get my Twitter up to 50 k heck
I'll buy 40 more and just keep giving
these codes away so that means almost a
hundred games that you guys can get from
me on steam how do you gotta win hey go
over and follow me on Twitter I got a
couple other things but real quick let's
take a look today's sponsor and why I
can keep doing these videos for you the
JL 85a is a really cool gift idea it's a
20 watt outdoor wireless speaker with
enhanced bass and let me tell you this
thing can go very very loud
and
it's super duper loud and not only that
it's waterproof so getting water and
thing won't run it which can be really a
great thing when you have those times
you have that little accident and get
some spillage the 85 a features 22 hours
of playback time v it's 5,200 milliamp
hour battery now this thing is an extra
large capacity power bank and with that
much power you can not only run your
speaker you can charge your cell phone
at the same time it also has 20 watts of
booming power and is kind of Army drab
green and this holiday season you can
get the JM l 85 a 4-under $60 so thank
you guys for bearing with me through our
adda and I know a lot people don't like
that out there but hey it's pretty much
the only way that we can make a living
is by having someone once in a while
helping out to keep the channel going
2017 is right around the corner like I
said all you have to do is win these
videos is go and follow me on Twitter
and please leave a nice comment saying
give me a game that would be found with
me or Merry Christmas for happy holidays
anything you want but you got to let you
down as Barmes killing me but that's
pretty much it so we're actually going
to be taking a vacation here next week
we'll be taking a vacation will be off
youtube maybe even up to 15 days are
going to be doing a complete
reorganization like I told you guys
before we're going to go back to our
roots doing more pc stuff but now that i
see what's going on in youtube and stuff
and that the algorithms and everything
have changed and it's all about making
entertainment I think we have to relook
at our entire situation and what we're
doing and come out from a different
angle my sub count personally has been
kind of weird lately so I just feel we
need to change the channel and get you
guys more engaged back in these videos
so we're going to change things around
get all of our PC platforms together and
try to bring you guys stuff in a more
fun light so that you guys remain
engaged in the video beyond that I'm
Network you guys been watching teka
tomorrow happy holidays we do have a few
more videos come in we'll let you know
what's going on when we're on vacation
but that's it we'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
