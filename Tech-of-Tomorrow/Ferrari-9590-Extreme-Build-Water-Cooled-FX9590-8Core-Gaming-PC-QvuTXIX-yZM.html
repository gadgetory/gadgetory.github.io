Squarespace do folks like that intro
if so hey make sure you guys hit that
like button and let the team know to
appreciate that shizmik so what's going
on today well you guys have been asking
for it and now we've brought it to the
table that's right the Ferrari AMD 95 90
system has finally arrived and you guys
can see it's totally looking bitchin now
for all the parts and all that kind of
stuff we've already went over those in a
video but you guys know it's the AMD FX
it's the 95 90 processor we payed a
buttload for it you can get it for a
much better deal now and by the end of
the video you'll probably say hmm this
is probably worth it we have an AMD card
buy power color there this is the 7970
gigahertz Edition looks nothing like it
did those you guys can see now we've got
water cooling on it by Swift tank and
we've also got that very cool Ferrari
logo on the backside got a neutron buy
Corsair 240 gigabyte SSD completely hid
on the back side we've got a three
terabyte Seagate drive in there we've
also got a lot of married by the people
over at Kingston this is their HyperX
memory I think got 32 gigabytes in this
bad boy
so this machine's really geared to run
fast now Anthony totally custom built
this thing you guys can see it's totally
badass
it's got switches for lights I mean I
can turn it off turn it on originally we
want to use this switch to like turn the
entire system on we were trying to get
it to go but it didn't work that way but
now at least makes a nice shiny cool
little red light you know but let's jump
in now and let's look at some of the
performance of the system now even
though we have the entire system water
cooled by Swift tech you guys will see
that this CPU when it pushes its limits
is running very very hot we didn't spend
a lot of time testing the video card app
we had no problems with it but you will
see that this CPU when pushed runs
rather hot so without this water cooling
system I don't really think that we
would get the results that we were
getting I think I'll probably go crash
out
but that said let's jump in now and
let's check out some of the scoring on
the Ferrari 95 90 first up we have
Geekbench 3.0 64-bit
with the single core score of 2775 next
up we have the multi-core score at 14000
and 2 next we have Cinebench r15 with
opengl at 105 point 46 frames per second
and the cpu at 428 CB pc mark seven
basic had a score of five thousand three
hundred and ninety nine BioShock
Infinite at 2560 by 1440 we see it 58
point forty eight frames per second and
at 1920 by 1080 we see it at 84 point 86
frames per second next up Metro last
light 2560 by 1440 score of 40 point
eight frames per second 1920 by 1080
shows sixty point seventy three frames
per second The Witcher 2 2560 by 1440 at
24 frames per second and at 1920 by 1080
thirty seven point four frames per
second
last up Crysis 3 2560 by 1440 at 40.88
frames per second and 1920 by 1080 at
fifty-six point seventy six six frames
per second now those the scores I know
the big question that everybody's mind
is like damn how hot was that CPU really
running okay between 37 idle and 105
under full load so you know that thing's
really running hot when it's at 105
Fahrenheit that's some really hot stuff
so you know it's Celsius it's like oh
you should translate if it's way up
there now before I bounce out of here
