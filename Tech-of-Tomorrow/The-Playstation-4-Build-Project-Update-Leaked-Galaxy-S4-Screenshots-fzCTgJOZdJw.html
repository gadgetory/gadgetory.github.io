way here from tech of tomorrow so we had
our very first video we talked about
building our own playstation 4 and we've
run into a bit of a little you know I
call ill a hedge Grove because like
we've come to a little bit of a fork in
the road we're trying to make a decision
and we actually need your guys's help to
try to jump over this bump so we started
working with a Zeus on building this
project now the big question that we're
having is do you folks feel that we
should use a 5800 which is an APU which
is kind of like more what the
PlayStation 4 is going to be or should
we use an 8120 CPU which is actually an
eight core cpu now you guys all know
that when the PlayStation 4 comes out it
uses a modified a core APU it's going to
be based on the Jaguar core it's
actually pretty damn low end actually
compared to what's going to be on the
market so our first question is going to
be to you guys what cpu should we use
should we save costs use the four core
cpu and go with the apu 5800 or should
we stick to our guns and get the 8120
which is an eight core cpu this time
we're going to make it easy for your
folks we're actually going to have a
pole over on our website we can keep
track of all your votes there'll be a
link in the description below for you
guys to check out also the new s4 is
coming out and there's been a bunch of
leaked screenshots that have come out
now a lot of the stuff is exactly what
we thought it was going to be and
there's going to be actually some really
gimmicky features as well supposedly
you're going to be able to look at your
phone and by your eyes be able to you
know move your screen you'll mind thing
screen you shall move upon my command I
don't know if it works but it's a pretty
gimmicky thing now over on our website w
WQ tomorrow com I have all of the
screenshots that have been least you
guys can check out all those things plus
we'll have a few more notes about what's
going on so anyways folks that kind of
wraps up what's going on make sure that
you guys leave your comments below we
love to hear what you guys have to say
this new playstation 4 thing is really
cool
I really appreciate all of the comments
that you guys have sent in even some you
guys have sent me long love letters
through the personal message thing I
really appreciate that so far though we
know for sure that we're going to be
working with a sous we're going to be
working properly with Kingston and we're
going to be working obviously probably
with thermaltake on getting a case so
we're getting things rounded out make
sure you guys vote let us know what you
want if you like this video hit that
like button and make sure you let me
know that you love me in this video
