back once again to the channel and this
time we're doing something pretty cool
we haven't had a system giveaway in a
long time so I decided hey it's time to
give a system away now one thing I wanna
mention right off the bat is that the
reason that I have everybody go on to
Twitter and do stuff is I've given away
stuff on the channel and asked people to
send me a message and 9 times out of 10
it just never happens I get a bunch of
questions of like how do we contact you
how do we do this how do we do that and
that's why I announce stuff and have
people follow me on Twitter on Twitter
you guys can communicate with me very
easily I can communicate with you very
easily and I don't see what the big deal
people say oh I hate Twitter this is
that it's no big deal it's just a social
media account you don't even really have
to use it but I'm going to pick the
winners off the people who add to the
comments so what I'm gonna do is once I
put this video up today I'm gonna have
over on Twitter a link to this and the
people who leave comments down below
that are the people who I'm going to
pick for a winner now do you have to
really do anything well yeah I'd
appreciate if you'd be sub to the
channel because hey I'm giving you guys
stuff so I'd really appreciate your sub
to the channel and you just follow me on
Twitter and just leave a comment now
what's the contest all about okay well
you guys saw the Hellfire stand that we
did last week
well the Hellfire 2.0 system I'm gonna
give that bad boy away and not only am I
gonna give that system away I'm also
going to have four runner up winners so
there'll be the system a copy of csgo
which is Counter Strike global Offensive
for anybody doesn't know that because
every seems to ask for that game and
then the four runner ups they will get a
copy of the game as well so the first
winner the system and a copy of csgo and
the four runner up winners will all get
csgo so five winners in total which is
pretty cool and if you guys saw the
system it plays games very very nicely
so when anybody gets the system you'll
be very happy especially if you play
games and like 1440 1440s this seems to
be the absolute sweet spot for the
system so if you've got a monitor
that'll do that you'll be perfectly
hooked up and doing that one thing I am
going to change though is I'm going to
change the video card out to a to a 560
because the 560 you guys can do free
sync with so I don't want to give the
system way and have an Nvidia card then
people go oh my god but it doesn't have
free sync so for you guys that throw
free sync you guys will be even half
because you can get a system that has a
free sing video card in it right off the
bat so you can beat up and gaming so
please the only thing I ask that you
guys please leave a comment down below
tell me why you think you'd like to win
this system follow the channel please
follow me on Twitter and on Twitter I
will announce the winners within two
weeks and by the way yes this is a
worldwide contest we're not gonna strict
dinos make it strictly to the USA and if
someone you know wins from from another
country Jonathan Morrison from TLD he
will provide the shipping
I will provide the products and you guys
will get your prizes so that's pretty
much today Monday's announcement giant
giveaway here on TECA tomorrow the
system five copies of csgo for the
runners-up 1 to the og winner just
simple follow me here follow me on
Twitter on Twitter once you guys see
that I post this which will pretty much
be right up the video comes up just go
over there leave a comment and tell me
why you guys want the systems excuse me
why do you guys want anything
game system would ever leave whatever
comments you want and then two weeks
from now I will announce the winners I
will announce them on here and I will
announce them on Twitter as well so if
you guys for some reason happen to
missed the video of the Hellfire 2.0
system I will have a link down below as
well as a link to where my Twitter
account is so you guys can do all that
so it's Monday it's Monday but why did
the weekend have to go by so damn fast I
was really enjoying my weekend this week
and had my son come over one day and my
buddy Anthony come over building systems
by the way we just built a badass system
which we're bringing to the table in the
next couple days you guys are really
going to dig it it's totally badass
features an EVGA awesome freakin case
top-of-the-line gigabyte motherboard a
orce GTX 1080i video card over the top
it's actually my personal gaming system
so it's over-the-top and crazy just like
I like my system so with that said
though you guys can now get a chance to
win the Hellfire 2.0 get a chance to win
some free copies of csgo and it's all
very easy no stress so I'm Miller you
guys been watching Tekken tomorrow if
you want a free system or some free
games hey you know what to do and by the
way for some reason you don't know this
there's another benefit to follow me on
Twitter
there really is every weekend I give
between 10 and 30 Steam games away if
you don't believe me go look at the
channel and it's no

negative thing you think because you
might just get a chance to win something
every weekend for as long as you follow
me and believe me I don't pick the same
winners I meticulously go through stuff
and make sure that I picked new people
every time so that's about it man

don't like this this and you hate me
