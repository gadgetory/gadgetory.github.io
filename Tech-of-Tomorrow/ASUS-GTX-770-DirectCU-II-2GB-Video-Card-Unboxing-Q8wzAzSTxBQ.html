hope you guys did its launch day you
guys all know the new geforce gtx 770
has hit the market that's right and we
have the asus directs you to overclocked
version what is direct to you to me will
see you as the copper standard to means
there's two fans in the direct so you
means direct contact with that copper
20% cooler vastly quieter they have
ultimate fan control tuning which means
the card ramps up cools down as needed
overclocked two gigabytes digi+ GPU
tweak you guys see it there windows 8
ready move out the back of the box just
real quick you guys can see once again
they're just talking about all the
nomenclature about the card the i/o is
shown here once again we see the direct
see you too here's their digi be rm+
super alloy power this actually allows
your card to run with 30% less power and
less noise and it actually will make
your card run a lot longer due to it
running that way instead of eating a hot
cold hot cold it rises make it nice and
even and keep it going
GPU tweak for those overclockers out
there who want to get crazy you can
overclock your card very easily with
this if you guys happen to miss it with
the gtx 780 we overclock that thing to
100 megahertz very easily if you guys
missed that check that out in the video
with that said let's just go ahead and
get this stuff out of the box alright
folks so out of the box she be let's go
ahead and just open it up this is
exactly how it came from
Mace's so we see anti-static bag here on
top I'm going to set that off to the
side here is our accessories box we'll
go ahead and pop that open real quick
let's take a look at the accessories
that come inside of here real quick take
that set aside as well
we can see we have the molex to eight
pin power connector cable right here the
driver and GPU tweak CD let's see that
thing right there yeah complaining side
the Aizu speed set up graphics card guy
just telling you I'd install your car
and I think most people know how to do
that it's this little stuff out of here
move on and there we go dun dun dun dun
dun dun dun ah there you go so check it
out there's the card and all of its
glory so let me go ahead and take the
card out and this is anti-static foam so
putting this on the anti-static foam for
you users out there will not shorten the
card out at all plus these guys have a
beautiful back in the car which we'll
get to in just a second so here we go
let's start out right here on top - fans
Direct see you - meaning there are two
of the fans you guys can see it right
here again at the bottom over here going
to show you the side of the card here
you see some of the tubing right there
it's your heat pipe right here is your
pcie 3.0 interface right here on the
bottom they have a nice little plastic
cover there we'll go ahead and remove
that real quick so you guys can see that
go ahead and place that back on there
you guys can see all the components and
everything all driving through the side
here you see the fans being connected by
a power cable right here to slot design
here's the back of the card flip it
around show you guys the side of the
card six pin and an eight pin power
requirement more heat pipes all right
here part of that directs you to cooling
flip it around over here here you guys
can see there are two of the SLI fingers
so you can use a quad SLI configuration
I'm going to flip this bad boy around
now one thing to take notice is bad
ass back plate I love this means you can
set the card after worried about
shorting your card out at all
thumbs up to aces for that I wish all
companies would do that here you guys
