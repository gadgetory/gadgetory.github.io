okay Tech fans so check it out for some
today is a very big day in tech news app
was released their brand new iPhone se
it's got a lot of cool stuff about it
we've got an unboxing and some specs so
let's check all of that out so Before we
jump in and actually check out the specs
and right thing let's just do a real
quick unboxing and see what comes in
well the box so first off obviously we
have the box that the iPhone se comes in
on the front if you had a nice design on
the back you'll see the nomenclature
this is the 64 gigabyte edition then
we'll go ahead and we'll just pop the
top and as we remove the top we can see
the new iPhone se we can also see it as
a four inch display and it also has the
same body as the 5s
but with new matte chamfered edges and
there will also be a new rose-colored
edition now internally what you can't
see is the new iPhone se features a
64-bit a nine processor and an m9 motion
processor and as we flip it around to
the back we can see it has the same
Apple logo as the 6s underneath the
phone come the accessories we can
clearly see the ear buds the wall
charger and the USB charging cable okay
so there's the unboxing for you diehards
out there who loved unboxing but now
let's actually take a look at the iPhone
se a little bit closer now the front
like I said before it features a 4-inch
display down below that we have the
fingerprint scanner and ID thing now
with this come something new with the
iPhone se they're introducing Apple pay
of which we'll talk a little bit more
later and on the top we see the
front-facing HD camera which features
true tone retina flash the true tone
retina flash offers something unique in
the iPhone se what it does it actually
makes your entire 4-inch screen become
the flash and this produces three times
the amount of light as previous
generation phones this technology is
really great for doing selfies in low
light or just taking pictures in
low-light environments earlier in the
video I told you guys this is pretty
much the iPhone 6s and a 5s case but
there are actually two things about the
new iPhone se that are actually lacking
compared to the success those things are
the front-facing camera and the
fingerprint scanner the fin
print scanner is actually a little bit
slower on the SE than it is on the s6
hey Siri what do you think of dogs hey
Siri what do you think about
girl-on-girl porn I don't know how to
respond to that huh on the right hand
side of the se we see the SIM card slot
as we turn the phone to the bottom we
first see a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
next up the built-in microphone the
charging port and then finally the
internal speaker on the left hand side
on the table we see the silent or
vibration mode button and then
underneath the vibration toggle we see
the volume controls and on the top we
see the sleep/wake and power button now
as we flip it around to the rear side on
the bottom we see the iPhone se
nomenclature then above that we see the
new Apple log which is the same logo
they have on the 6s and above that we
have the rear-facing camera and rear
flash so few folks wondering you know
how the iPhone se does on video and
video recording well am i walking the
dog and I'll cruise over here and this
is all shot with the new iPhone se and
probably glorious 4k like we usually do
but uh let's do a little bit more let's
actually show you guys some still shots
and then let's show you how this thing
shoots nice pictures and video of
beautiful things outdoors let's go for a
walk
you

the 12 megapixel iSight rear camera
features focus pixel and true tone flash
you can also do panorama shots up to 63
megapixels now that's a lot of pixels
another really cool feature about the
photo capabilities of the SE is its
ability to take still photos and
actually turn them into live motion
pictures this is something really crazy
and with the SE you can now stream
download and edit two 4k movies
simultaneously all using iMovie and you
can do it all on this little four inch
screen the new SE also offers battery
life improvements across the board 10
hours of additional audio and 2 to 3
hours of additional stuff depending on
the application you're using the SE also
features faster LTE speeds and better
roaming features around the world
another thing you can't see but is
inside the SE is the NFC radio and
secure element and these new features of
the SE make sure that your information
is kept secure when you're using things
like Apple pay I know for some people
this may not be a big deal but if you're
like me and you care about the planet
and you want the plan to continue going
and we all know that you know the
resource the planet are getting smaller
and smaller everything about the new
iPhone se is completely recyclable the
iPhone 6 se hits the market March 31st
and there'll be two models available a
16 gigabyte model for $399 and a 64
gigabyte model for $499 now I don't know
about you but if I was getting a brand
new phone
I want the 64 gigabyte version and pay
that extra hundred dollars what I think
is kind of up on Apple's part
because they really should just release
a 64 gigabyte version and lower the
price but hey that's just my opinion
now real quick before I bounce out of
here if you're into your PC and you want
to control your PC from anywhere in the
world
check out NZXT scam for serious and
novice gamers alike there's no more
powerful companion to your PC than

interface and offers real time component
monitoring to ensure your rig is doing
exactly
what it should be when it should be and
if it isn't cam will let you know plus
the best thing is this software is free

allows you to control your cam enabled
hardware from just about anywhere and
one last thing before we bounce out of
here folks now we just showed you guys

got a bag of goodies here with all the
top 5 brand new cases for the SE which
is going to be coming up as well so if
