you guys looking for a mid tower case
with a totally black and green theme for
the build then you want to check out the
H 440 razor edition the H 440 razor
Edition is a mid tower case and you guys
can see all the colors externally are
matte black and on the front it's really
clean no external bays or anything but
you do get that killer snakehead logo
and as we move around to the windowless
side of the case you guys can see that
there are a bunch of air vents for
keeping the air flow in the case going
nothing else will be there special just
a nice solid wall and actually the
entire case is made out of nice steel
material that actually has sound
dampening material inside of it going
around to the back of the case we can
see at the very bottom is a removable
Bay for installing the power supply
there are also two grommets for water
cooling as well as all the industry
standard stuff as we come around to the
window panel side of the case you guys
can see that this panel actually has a
smokey look to it which looks pretty
much like a tented window in a car and
taking a look at the bottom of the case
you guys can see there's plenty of room
by the vents for airflow as well as a
very nice removable air filter and
lastly as we go to the top of the case
you guys can see there's your standard
power on button your reset button now
something unique about the power button
here though is it also controls the LED
lights there's a cool green LED on the
bottom of the case when it's plugged in
as well as that front Razer logo snake
also lights up in green we also see the
standard mic and audio connections as
well as two USB 3.0 ports and two USB
2.0 ports and as we're still checking
out the outside of the case this case
sizes in at 220 millimeters by five
hundred and ten millimeters by four
hundred and seventy five point three
millimeters like most NZXT cases you can
completely disassemble this case which
makes it great for doing the build and
also for cable management you can remove
the front panel put top panel and both
the side panels very easily all the fans
included in this system are all of their
brand new FN v2 series and we start off
on the front we'll see it there are 320
millimeter fans located here as well as
a magnetic dust filter now this dust
filter is really easy to take on and off
and can be washed and reused as many
times as you want
so no more excuses for that filthy nasty
dirty case and as we spin around to the
rear we can see there's a single hundred
and forty millimeter FN v2 fan here as
well but on the top you can have an
additional 240 millimeter fans or 320
millimeter fans depending on your choice
liquid cooling support is a big question
in today's builds in fact liquid cooling
has gone from being the bastard child to
the mainstay and the H 440 doesn't let
you down on the top you get support for
up to a three hundred and sixty
millimeter rad and on the front you get
the same support just by removing all
the HDD cages and on the rear of the
case you can either use a single hundred
and forty millimeter rad or a single 120
when removing the front panel you guys
can see there's a cable ring from the
case to the front panel this is the
light power for the logo on the front as
we move the back panel you guys can see
there's actually a cool integrated 10
port fan have built into the case itself
and there's also plenty of room for
excellent cable management and cable
management in a build it's what
separates the men from the boys and as
you remove the top panel you guys can
see right underneath there is where you
can stall those fans we talked about as
well as the top mounted rad last but not
least as remove the windowed side of the
case inside you guys can see that it's
completely matte black it supports mini
ITX micro ATX and standard ATX
motherboards the GPU clearance without
removing the HDD cage is 294 millimeters
but if you remove the HDD cage you get
four hundred and six point two
millimeters of space and the CPU cooler
distance is a hundred and eighty
millimeters this is the distance from
your motherboard to the panel now as far
as internal expansion goes on the rear
we see seven expansion slots we also see
an HDD cage with room for six 5.25
devices and also an additional two
spaces for a 3.5 or 2.5 drive and as we
scroll down to the very bottom you guys
can see once again that snakehead Razer
logo and this is protecting the power
supply alright Tech fans so there you
guys
have it the NZXT h 440 razor edition now
there were a couple of things I couldn't
show you just in the case review I'll
have to actually do the build but those
are the lighting features like I said
the front logo it lights up and on the
very bottom you get a cool green glow
just like when you see those really
killer cards going down the street and
they get that glow underneath them it
looks badass any of you guys who play
any of the games out of there like GTA 5
you've seen that modification well it's
actually on this case and being that the
theme is black and green I'm going to
say that people are probably going to
tend to want to probably do more Nvidia
type builds in this I'm just saying that
because of the theme I mean you can
build an AMD builds in it but I'm just
saying the green theme is you know green
and blacks kind of invidious colors you
know red and black is the AMD theme so
you know I'm just saying that not take
inside so don't go crazy on me but for
mid-tower case this thing has lots of
features you guys saw plenty of
expansion you can put mini rads in there
three separate ones which means ultimate
liquid cooling you've got room for lots
of their fans they even include some of
their brand new F env2 fans these things
are silent and work really well to
remove a lot of air from your case so if
you're looking for great airflow all in
all the design here is pretty cool now
this case comes to market about 149
dollars but like I said it's pretty much
fleshed out for you guys who want a mid
tower case that can do a lot now if
you're looking to build like an extended
ATX motherboard or something like that
you're not gonna be able to use that
inside of that case there's not that
many motherboards out there but if
you're using one of those type of
motherboards you're gonna have to get
probably a full tower case but for a mid
tower case I think this razor Edition is
a pretty cool case I want to see what
you guys think down below also once
again hmm
I'd like to hear you guys once again
name the system Hey that's right I'll be
picking the winner for the the other
system that we did the other day I'll be
announcing that on Twitter you guys will
like who I got I think it's pretty
interesting name and for this one we're
gonna do the same thing so please leave
a comment down below let me know what
you think about this case and what you
guys think the name of this system
should be huh pretty interesting stuff
like usual download like button will be
all the information for this case you
can check one out for yourself get more
information or buy one if you're looking
to do a build yourself look forward to
this build we'll see you back here and
