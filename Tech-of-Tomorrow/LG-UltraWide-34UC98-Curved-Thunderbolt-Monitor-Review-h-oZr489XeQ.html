again to the channel today we're
checking out something brand new from
the people over at LG a 34 inch curved
monitor with a 21 to 9 aspect ratio
we're talking about the brand-new 34 you
see 98 white edition so today
the UPS driver dropped off the brand new
34 you see 98 - W monitor the 34 you see
98 features a 34 inch curved display
with a 21 to 9 aspect ratio it also
features a wqhd IPS display the monitor
also features a pixel pitch of 0.23 by
0.23 millimeters now what this means is
the distance between each pixel the
lower the number the closer pixels are
together the better it's going to look
the monitor also features a response
time of 5 milliseconds and a refresh
rate of 60 Hertz the resolution is a
brilliant 34 40 by 1440 with a
brightness ratio of 300 CD a contrast
ratio of 5,000,000 to 1 and a viewing
angle of 178 degrees and what that
translates to it means that no matter
where you're viewing the monitor no
matter what angle you're at you're still
going to see a great picture so if
you're doing business and working on it
if there's somebody behind you or
somebody decide they're still going to
be able to see the screen very well it's
not going to be like the old days
looking at your laptop or you're
like--you're the side and going what the
heck is that no you'll still be able to
see that very clearly this is also a
feature they have on many of their OLED
TVs which makes those nice as well and
last but not least the monitor features
a 3h anti-glare hard coating now taking
a look at the front of the monitor you
guys can see this thing features a
pretty awesome design and the bezel on
this is the smallest that I've seen on
any monitor yet and with that 34 40 by
1440 resolution everything looks really
sharp a big concern to artists
photographers and people who do printing
is the srgb and what this is is pretty
much the color gamut or how the color
translates to when you're printing to
what you're viewing on the screen this
particular model has a 99% value which
means it's pretty almost exactly the
true color representation of what you're
viewing on your screen will be what
you're printing
it's a well-known fact that IPS monitors
usually have a lot of background bleed
and people complain about it they also
complain about the lighting not being
completely equal around the monitor
causing hot spots and all these things
now if I had like millions of dollars of
equipment I could probably find a flaw
somewhere in this but this monitor has
very little back bleed at all when you
show a constant black background there's
hardly any light bleeding through and
it's pretty constant as far as the color
goes I can with my eyes see no visual
impairments at all which means that
there's no one area to meet it seems
really SuperDuper bright another area
seems SuperDuper dark you guys are
watching the video we're filming exactly
what I'm seeing here you guys let me
know what you guys think but so far the
screen seems pretty pretty nice for me
to view it and this monitor also has a
new feature called screen split 2.0 now
what this does is it allows you to
totally customize the picture-in-picture
environment now you guys have seen this
on TVs but swear you can have different
little channels up all at one time and
view them all on a single monitor and
with this aspect ratio and all the 34 40
by 1440 resolution you get up to like
four windows you can have open and being
viewing all at the same time and in a
decent size or you're not like going
what is that the viewing experience of
the twenty one to nine ultra wide curve
qxd display is about 1.8 times larger
than an ultra wide Full HD 21 to 9
monitor and about 2.4 times larger than
a full HD 16:9 aspect monitor in
Microsoft Office programs it displays 47
columns and 63 rows in Excel and that
gives you a hell of a lot of work area
to work in and the on-screen control
allows you to easily control the screen
configurations and display settings this
way you can customize your workspace and
this can all be done by an easy toggle
switch located at the bottom of the
monitor I know a lot of you fans out
there did not like a sirs version of the
OSD but I got to tell you LG has this
down the little toggle switch is easy to
operate it's easy to control and really
easy for anyone to use before we jump
around and take a look at the back of
the modernist and there's one thing I do
want to mention about this the monitor
is actually quite thicker than a lot of
the previous ones we've seen it seems
like everybody's trying to go
thinner thinner thinner thinner but this
LG model is actually a little thicker
than the ones we've seen previously but
it seems to be running also a little bit
cooler and I don't feel any heat
radiating out of the back of the monitor
which is a good sign and as we take a
look at the back of the monitor one
thing I got to tell you guys which is
really easy is how this monitor sets up
it has a simple click and press design
which means that all you have to do is
pretty much take the monitor put to the
stand click it and press it and they're
connected there are absolutely no screws
or anything additional that you have to
do to get set up it also has a height
range of 110 millimeters it also
features a tilt angle of 5 to 15 degrees
having height and tilt adjustment
options are very important to a person
who's going to be sitting in front of
that monitor for hours on end you do not
want to get fatigued or strained while
you're sitting in front of that monitor
and being able to adjust it to your
perfect eye and looking level is great
option to have located in the rear of
the monitor are also the inputs and
outputs we see 2 version 2.0 HDMI ports
a single display port two thunderbolt
2.0 ports there are also two USB 3.0
connections and one of these actually
doubles as a fast charge connection
which means you can plug your smart
phone or smart device into it and charge
it really fast so instead of sitting
around waiting for a long time or having
to get a separate device to do it it'll
all be embedded inside your monitor the
power connector is also located in the
same space but there's something that
you can't see and that's the 2 7 watt
speakers that are actually built into
the monitor now LG calls these speakers
max audio how max are they here so you
guys can clearly see the 34 you see 98 -
W looks really nice it's really really
elegant that complete nice white
background that's on the back of the
monitor makes it a standout feature and
if you're looking for something really
elegant for a video that you shooting or
just something look really nice and
high-tech on your desktop this monitor
certainly fits the bill and there are a
few other features that I know gamers
out there are going to really like and
that's the ability to have game mode so
this monitor has a bunch of different
viewing ways and you can set this the
toggle at the bottom of the monitor and
you can go through a bunch of different
settings and something that's also
really cool
I know you AMD fans are going to go ah
its freesync baby that's right this
monitor has the ability to use free sync
technology so if you have an AMD card
and you love AMD stuff then this is a
monitor you're definitely want to
consider because free sync is the
technology that's on the AMD side of
things and those fans liked it a lot
better because they don't charge you
extra money for the monitor according to
some people because it's true a g-sync
version the same type of monitor is a
couple hundred dollars more and since
we're on that subject this monitor is
about eleven hundred and ninety nine
dollars now when LG first contacted me
and said they were saying this to me a
couple months ago the price was at a few
hundred dollars higher price point so
they've obviously lowered the price
point down so now you can get a totally
awesome 34 inch ultra wide IPS monitor
for around twelve hundred dollars and it
just has a lot of features you have pure
black and all that kind of stuff with at
all control on the bottom making easy
OSD access people are just going to I
think eat this monitor up for the price
range so you guys tell me what you think
though I mean gaming looks really
awesome here we have some quick footage
of GTA 5 which is definitely a fan of a
lot of people out there including my
family and then we also run the
benchmark for ashes of the singularity
this is pretty much the only directx12
video game that there is out there and
we're actually running an AMD card as
you're looking at this we're running an
r9 390x and it powers these games very
nice and you guys can see with free sync
enabled just how smooth everything looks
just like g-sync free sync basically
makes your monitor there's no screen
tearing or ripping when you're playing
that game you guys know what I mean
you're playing game you're moving around
stuff stuff just looks blurry for a
moment you don't have to worry about
that at all with free sync orgy sync
technology alright folks the 34 UC 98 34
inches of glorious curved gaming 34 40
by 1440 resolution now there are a few
little cabinets that I want to mention
here we actually have built a couple
little systems and we have this little
stick that we use a USB stick that we
use a computer and it would
fit at all in the back of this matter I
don't meet people out there even going
to use this or whatever but if you want
those people out that's using a computes
tick it will not fit into the HDMI port
it actually hits the side of the monitor
so we had to actually bring a whole
computer in here and then bring the vid
to you that way it's really easy to
actually use a little stick though but
that's a caveat of this monitor beyond
that I don't really see anything that I
complain about other than I know if you
don't have a lot of money you're not
going to be able to probably buy one of
these but all high-end technologies that
way and we are talking about high end
technology you really can't complain
about the price you really want to talk
about the features and is it actually
high-end technology and worried the
people who have the monies dollar at the
end of the day I have to say this is a
really superior product I'm not totally
completely sold on the 60 Hertz for the
refresh rate I think that you know you
should have the ability to overclock
that and make it higher like some of the
other monitors we've seen that might be
a Cabot to some people if you're a
person who can really see that you need
144 Hertz or 120 Hertz 60 Hertz just
isn't going to be enough for you but
beyond that overall we're using it as a
workspace monitor and that type of thing
it's going to work really well and
because it uses that Thunderbolt
technology you can connect all kinds of
devices up to it including using it with
that little trashcan Mac if you so
decided to do so alright folks before I
bounce out of here it looks like our
special guest buddy the dog has decided
to show up but there is one thing I want
to mention about this monitor at this
last year's CES show this monitor won an
honorary award which means that it is
very nice cutting-edge technology and
that all the people the show said hey
this is a nice product now like usual
down blood like button which I know
you're going to go crazy on you're going
to do some kind of uh I don't know
Jackie Chan Meets Bruce Lee meets
Muhammad Ali meets the Thundercats I
don't know do you know they they are
sure the name but anyways it'll all be
down there so if you guys want to
purchase one of these check that stuff
out you guys can do that for yourself
I'm Network this is buddy the dog behind
the camera like usual Jesus we'll see
you guys back here on TECA tomorrow for
more tech videos
