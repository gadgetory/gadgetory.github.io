Kingston makers of the HyperX brand and
some of the fastest SSDs and flash
drives in the world what's going on
everybody
it's Friday I'm sure most you are like
looking at the clock going when can I
get the out of here and go home but
anyways we're here to brighten your day
I'm tech Oh tomorrow I'm Eric and today
we're going to be talking about Apple's
latest fusion drive now I know there's
been a lot of controversy out there and
a bunch of talk about this thing saying
what exactly is it now for the last year
or so we've had Intel's latest z77
motherboards they all feature Smart
Response technology which uses a hard
drive and then an SSD as the caching
device so what it does is basically it
has the more information you access the
SSD spills over into it it makes things
faster as you access it well now this
technology in the fusion drive it's kind
of been the same principle but it's
totally different than that four
gigabytes of information can be first
brought through the SSD before even
going to the HDD and what's totally
different is that the SSD is the first
drive to be used now traditionally you
go through the hard drive and then to
the SSD with the fusion drive you go
from the SSD and then to the HDD now
this option is going to be available in
both the Mac Mini and the new iMacs that
we'll be seeing coming out very soon
hopefully it's going to be about $250
but let's go in now and let's run a few
tests and let's show you why this is
actually a very fast option for those
people wanting an all one self-contained
unit that still has very fast access and
transfer speeds so let's check that out
first off we'll be testing the new
fusion drive against the standard 5400
RPM HDD will also be testing it against
a full-fledged SSD this is the built-in
one in the 2012 MacBook Pro so with that
said folks it's time to rock out with
your sock out here's the benchmark
so all right folks there you have it now
obviously for PC guys and those guys who
are going to go out and buy a Mac Pro
this isn't really going to be that big
of a deal but it is showing Apple brain
server great technology down to the
desktop arena and all of these things on
units that you're not traditionally
going to open up there pretty much you
know you buy them they are and you keep
going and you want to get those things
as fast as you can now anybody out there
who prefers the Mac and using that OS
for that environment they're not going
to give one rat's ass about the small
price 250 bucks for them is not going to
mean anything to the cost of not having
that type of productivity so at the end
of the day I got to say it is very
interesting technology it's taking a
twist turning it around improving it and
then bringing it on to their products
now I have to say I do believe that
Ars Technica summarized this very very
excellently with the way they have it
picture that you have two glasses and
the water is coming out of a fountain
now the first glass it receives as much
as it can and then the overflow goes
into the second glass but the first
glass being able to take that four
gigabytes of information is quite a big
glass because you know most users aren't
going to be using that type of file size
in any case so it's going to work very
very well and the way that they
summarized it
I do believe gets a hats off from us
over here at Tech them tomorrow like
usual I hope you folks liked this video
if so show me that by hitting the like
button also I ask that you subscribe to
the channel that way you don't miss out
on any of our giveaways or any of our
announcements also many you people
always ask how can you support the
channel where you can support the
channel by showing some love to our
sponsors at Kingston now these guys make
some of the fastest USB 3.0 flash drives
on the market and now that the new Macs
all support USB 3.0 you can seamlessly
take it from a Mac to a pc and get that
great fast response everywhere so with
that said make sure you check out the
links in the description below and we'll
see you guys back here on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
