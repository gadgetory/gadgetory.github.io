welcome back once again to tech tomorrow
we're bringing you the latest technology
to day so once again I borrowed
something from my buddy at TLD this time
it's the iPad Mini with Retina display
now what's this thing all about well
it's got the new a7 processor dual-core
processors it really kicks ass
it's supposed to be really optimized -
even better than some quad-core
processors now really the only
difference though between this one and
the one that we unboxed last week is
pretty much the screen size they're kind
of reversed this one's a 7.9 the other
was the 9.7 all pretty much the same
features except this is the 64 gigabyte
verizon model that's right 64 gigabytes
it's still got you know the 1 gigabyte
of memory in it and everything else that
the other one had it's actually clock
just a daily weeny bit slower I've heard
but essentially pretty much the same so
with that said though let's jump in and
let's see what comes inside this little
box and well hey what it's gonna do for
you so I've got my little trusty Batman
knife that's right thank you mr. Anthony
front of my Christmas presents flip the
old knife there you guys like that I'm
gonna take it right here along the side
here make a nice little surgical
incision that's right don't try this at
home kitties I am a doctor see I'm
making these nice precision slices with
this beautiful knife here this is
beautiful
I think it's beautiful nice and
precision cuts hey they were supposed to
be more even precision than that doggone
it put alright here we go
check it out look at that nice and
smooth so I'm dropping it out of there
sofa boom like serving it up set it down
cut blooming so first off let's just go
ahead and look what's in the box the
accessories they've got a designed by
Apple in California
I thought apples were from Washington
somebody's gotten confused somewhere and
it ain't me dang it next up we have the
lightning to USB cable right here charge
a little bad boy phone and then we've
got this little thing right here let me
knock it out here you're a little
powered charger thing where you guys can
see the USB is gonna hook up into there
these little two little things right
here are going to pop out
haha and plug into your wall socket so
that's the accessories there right there
next up we have the unit itself now this
thing has 2048 by 1536 screen full-blown
Retina display so this thing is gonna
have an awesome looking clear display on
it seven point nine inches
tough-as-nails let's go ahead and just
take the back paddle off so you guys can
see it oh by the way this thing is also
Space Gray that's right it's not silver
space grey check it out check out the
space my homies up top we have the power
button and then we have the 4G bar right
here across the top headphone jack next
up we're going to move around the side
where we see the silent button the
volume controls and then down here you
can see where the SIM card goes as we
were on the bottom you guys can see here
is the Lightning port and there are also
stereo speakers down here on the front
we have the home button lit up here we
have the front camera 1.2 megapixel 720
on the back you actually have a 5
megapixel 1080 camera we'll flip that
around you guys can see that but dean so
that's everything that comes in the box
now before I bounce out of here let's
give you guys a couple of more things
let's check out a speed test and let's
check out a video test to see how this
thing does in real life performance so
here we are right now we're testing out
the verizon network now I want you guys
to take into consideration that this
will change in whatever your area that
you're at so please don't take our
numbers as what this is is just the
numbers we're actually getting in our
area and with that said let's now take a
look at the rear facing camera hey so
what's up guys here we have kind of a
semi low-light it's Twilight the Sun is
going down right now we're filming the
video no special effects this is just
the camera off the new you know iPad
Mini what you guys want to see so here
you have it now check it out phone dog
bone chase dogs let me set dog down
well there you have it
dog and bone now back to the video so
what do you guys think right up the back
of the video quality I think it's a
pretty important aspect everybody these
days is out shooting video with whatever
they got in their pocket their camera
their pad anything out there also
another question which would you guys
prefer not you've seen both do you want
the 9.7 version or the 7.9 inch version
now this one that we have in our hand
it's a little bit more pricey because
it's a 64 gigabyte verizon model but
these ones do come to market at about
399 dollars
so let us hear what you guys think about
this thing I think it's pretty cool like
I told you guys in the other video I'm
gonna be getting one to do my music
me personally I'm going to go with the
larger 9.7 because I'm doing a lot of
music stuff and truthfully I'm just
getting old and blind I just want to be
able to see the screen but I gotta say
this thing's lightweight it feels really
bitchin in my hand I mean you guys can
see it totally actually does fit in my
hand comfortably
it feels pretty ergonomic and I think
it's gonna be a pretty decent product so
just let me know what you guys think
it's more what you guys think cuz your
feedback actually gears where we're kind
of going you guys really like this stuff
and we see the comments go up a we'll
keep doing it if you guys are interested
in buying one of these or want to get
more information down there in the link
in the description we'll have anywhere
you can buy it and more information if
you guys aren't subbed the challenge you
like this make sure you do so and hey
that's pretty much it I'm gonna go set
this thing up do some more playing
around
we'll see where it takes us see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
