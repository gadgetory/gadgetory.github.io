tomorrow and while our looks busy
rocking out somewhere I'm here to bring
you guys my full review on Splinter Cell
blacklist now there were a lot of people
that weren't entirely happy with how the
last game in the series was handled
conviction mainly because there was a
lot of reduction in stealth elements in
favor of making it a lot more accessible
and more action-oriented
and while they haven't removed all of
the changes made in that game there has
been a lot of promises that this one
gets a lot more back to the stealth
basics so the important question of
course is how well do they live up to
that promise now before we start
breaking down the gameplay let's talk
about visuals for a moment as well as
bring you guys the specs for those that
are interested now we're running this
with MSI's GTX 780 as well as an i7
4770k overclocked to 4 gigahertz now if
you're interested in the complete parts
list of the system we're using you can
check that out on the link below now
when it comes to the games look and feel
the environmental and character
texturing is pretty good it's nothing
too fantastic but certainly not below
average one of the things it really is a
high strengthen though is the lighting
which is really important in a game like
this because well the huge focus is
hiding in the shadows
so while playing the regular campaign on
a mission that has a lot of sunlight on
ultra settings we were seeing in average
range per second of 118 on high settings
you were seeing an average frames per
second of 131 and on medium settings we
were seeing 143 and a half so now to
talk about the actual gameplay itself
now it's clear right away there are some
moves to make it more like the original
games mainly because we do see a return
of Sam's hallmark night-vision goggles
now of course some of the additions that
were made in conviction have stayed well
they are still very relevant to the
stealth feel these include the ability
to mark multiple targets to execute them
quickly all you have to earn the right
to first with regular kills and the
ability to see a ghostly layout of
yourself for where anything saw you last
now we're also seeing the return of some
other mechanics that were left out in
conviction that definitely helped make
the game a lot more stealth focused such
as the ability to hide bodies of enemies
so patrols don't get alerted
now while stealth is much more of an
option in this game than it was in
conviction the game still gives you the
option to play it like a third-person
shooter and in fact each level ranks
your performance based on three
different tracks
you get rankings for your performance as
a ghost which means you're avoiding
enemy encounters or using a non-lethal
means of subduing them Panther for those
you that still want to use stealth but
don't mind a little
work and actually killing your enemies
and last but not least their soldier
which is for those you that want to
treat this like a third person shooter
and just unleash a hail of bullets on
everything now missions in this game are
in an episodic manner and before each
one you're given a briefing period where
you're told which of the three styles
will fit most giving you an idea of what
kind of equipment you should bring so
for instance if it's a ghost style
mission you should bring some grenades
they don't kill anyone or soldier style
mission where you just wear a heavy body
armor and shoot everything apart with
assault rifles well you're free to use
whatever loadout you like there are some
missions that show a very clear
preference for one style or another you
can make the game a lot harder on
yourself by not being properly prepared
for instance either being really easily
noticeable in missions that instantly
fail when you're discovered and missions
where combat is more or less completely
unavoidable and it only takes a couple
of bullets to take it down now this
point really strikes home in the game
side missions which serve as both a way
to give you extra experience and a way
to play co-op with friends each of the
missions is very focused on just one
method on the other and they're actually
some of my favorite ones because they
really have the most consistent
objectives especially the stealth
missions where as soon as you're caught
the mission ends as I said these side
missions can be done in solo or co-op
and Club really does make them a lot
easier
not just the combat oriented ones where
you have extra firepower thanks to a
buddy but even the stealth ones where
you can work together to distract
enemies or make use of unique routes
because you need to work together to
reach high ledges or breach doors so
overall as far as gameplay is concerned
while you can still play the game like a
straight-up third-person shooter you
benefit a lot from making sure to use
stealth tactics and careful planning
so overall stealth is a lot more
rewarding than it was in conviction
especially on higher difficulties now as
for what plot the game has it's not the
most original it's pretty
run-of-the-mill as far as the different
kind of military espionage storylines go
it's not too intriguing but it is enough
to keep you going through missions it's
also really drawing to hear the change
in voice actors in this one especially
because he just sounds so young got
something to say say it admittedly it is
something you get used to over time but
in the end it still just doesn't feel
the same without Michael Ironside now
one of my most favorite things about
blacklist however is the fact that it
now features the return of the spies vs
mercs multiplayer mode which is
something I honestly never really tried
in the older games and now completely
regret it now for those of you that
haven't played this mode before
the traditional modes have you divided
into two asymmetrical teams on the one
hand you have the mercenaries they're
slow-moving heavily armored they play in
a first-person view so they have better
long-range shots but don't see as much
around them directly and they have a
much more reliance on lethal methods
like assault rifles and grenades and on
the other hand you have the spies who
still play the game the traditional
third-person mode of Splinter Cell
giving them a lot more awareness of
their surroundings they also have the
ability to make use of exclusive routes
and levels such as using ductwork or
climbing really high ledges
now they don't have as many offensive
weapons but they do have a lot of ways
to distract enemies like smoke grenades
and flashbangs and can perform an
instant kill and melee if they get the
chance and while there is a deathmatch
mode that allows for mixed teams to just
shoot the crap out of each other
the multiplayer really shines a lot more
when you play in the traditional modes
which more objective based and have
teams focused on just one or the other
play style one of the really hard things
to do in asymmetric games is making sure
that both sides are balanced and this is
where blacklist does an excellent job I
do feel like mercs have an easier time
early on when they're a lot easier to
learn once you get into higher levels
and people start learning how to play
spies right it gets a lot more balanced
and a lot more interesting
overall Splinter Cell blacklist is a
great stealth game the main campaign is
a little on the short side but it's
supplemented by being able to do the
side missions as well as the spies vs
mercs mode which is a welcome break from
usual multiplayer games and actually
rewards good stealth gameplay in a
multiplayer environment there's also a
good bit of replayability in the
campaign if you're the kind of person
that wants to get all the different
little hidden collectables or just clear
it on the highest difficulty settings
not to mention that any money you make
in it can still be used to upgrade your
character and multiplayer with how few
stealth games we see coming out these
days especially this year Splinter Cell
blacklist is a welcome return to the
older Splinter Cell formula and is
definitely worth playing not just for
fans of the series but just fans of the
overall genre looking for something new
