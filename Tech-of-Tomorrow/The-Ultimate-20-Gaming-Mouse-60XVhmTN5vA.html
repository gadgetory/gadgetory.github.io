again on techo tomorrow so you or those
people out there who only has one of
these for your budget but you still want
a nice gaming mouse let's check out the
GX m4 enhance and see if it's worth your
20 bucks like I said the enhanced GX m4
is a $20 mouse but it does have some
pretty decent features for being such a
low price entity for one thing it has
adjustable DPI from 800 to 2400 dpi the
adjustable buttons right on the top so
it's easy to locate
you also get five buttons for control of
your in-game adventure two of the
control buttons are located on the side
two are located on the top and the
scroll also doubles as a control button
and there's also seven blinking LED
lights that constantly change colors as
you're playing your games
the GX m4 also connects via USB port and
I would have to say the overall size of
the mouse is pretty much made from
medium sized hands it's not too large
it's not too small it's pretty much
right in the middle as far as comfort
goes and control goes the GX m4 is
pretty comfortable
it's obviously not reinventing the wheel
and it's not something that you're gonna
go crazy about but neither is it
anything bad that you're gonna complain
about either but the really big thing
that matters is how does it actually
work in in game playing and it does just
fine I know some people out there will
consider it a definite caveat to not
have a higher adjustable dpi but for me
820 400 dpi works pretty well I know
there are a lot of people out there that
are professional gamers looking for that
serious killer headshot and you want
more dpi but this mouse is definitely
geared for the budget or casual gamer
but if you're looking for a mouse that
definitely has looks that your friends
will talk about the GX m4 definitely has
it down in that category you guys can
see that even though the lights don't
adjust they still look pretty cool and
since it changes to seven different
colors eventually we'll get to yours so
check it obviously this mouse isn't the
most professional killer gaming mouse on
the planet you can get obviously a way
better Mouse if you want to invest that
extra cash but for 20 bucks
the GX 7/4 offers some pretty cool
features that other mice don't have and
if you don't have a lot of money and
you're looking for some that'll just
have you covered hey you can't go wrong
with spending $20 because if anything
happens even it's not like you spent a
lot
of money now the good things about this
mouse are that it's really low-priced
it also has like I said five control
buttons for you to control stuff none of
them have programmable macros or
anything like that but just for simple
in-game controls it works just fine I
mean you guys can see as far as looks go
I think this thing looks pretty nifty I
know there's gonna be some haters out
there gonna go I just some you know you
can't avoid them they're gonna be out
there but personally I think it looks
pretty cool now like I said there are
some drawbacks one of the major
drawbacks that I don't like about the GX
m4 and this is just my personal opinion
is the fact that nowhere on it can you
change the weight adjustment I like a
really heavy Mouse this lights this
mouse actually excuse me is very very
light so if you like a light Mouse this
might be some you're like hey okay I
really like that alright but for me
personally I like being able to change
the weight adjustment and make it to be
as heavy as I like it to be so it's like
sitting on the table like I said five
buttons controllable but none of them
you can program so it's not programmable
also like I said I know you guys out
there like a much higher dpi right 820
400 dpi might not be your thing but if
you don't really care about that and
especially ever years playing games like
The Sims or stuff like that or some
light you know first-person shooters
you'll be just fine
but at the end of the day it's $20 it's
pretty much throw away money at that
point and I think for that amount of
price I think it's a winner let me know
your thoughts down below i'm Elric all
the details everything will be down
there as well also you guys have been
hearing me talk about it pretty much a
lot of my videos lay about this new NZXT
cam soft but we're actually doing a
build we're gonna bring you guys all the
details on how to operate it how to use
their hue lighting system but all the
details for this mouse plus that will be
linked all there down below that like
button and if you like what you see hey
sub and i'll see you in your sub box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
