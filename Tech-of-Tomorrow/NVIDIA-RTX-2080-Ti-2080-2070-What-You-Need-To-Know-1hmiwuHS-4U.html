tomorrow probably the most exciting
video card news that we've had since
2016 that's right since 2016 NVIDIA has
finally announced their new video cards
ah yes fine and guess what a lot of us
were all wrong with all of our
speculation there is no 1180 there is no
1170 none of those cards actually came
out it's actually 2080 20 atti
and 2070 and this time it's kind of
unique because right at launch they're
launching their TI card now this is
something that's usually not done at
Nvidia usually the TI card gets released
later on down the line and you first off
usually get just the 1080 sometimes at
10 70s you know sometimes I'm saying is
you get to 70 miles but this time you're
getting all three models right out of
the gate you get in the 20 80 the 20 80
TI and the 20 70 all out of the gate and
the really big thing about this card is
its ability to do rate racing ten times
faster than the previous be in the
previous generation card so ten times
better than a 1080i you're gonna get
with twenty eighty I using the straight
tracing technology now rate racing
pretty much just it outlines the entire
the entire object that you're looking at
makes it so it's much better and easier
to look at it makes the colors much
better this will improve shading all
that kind of good stuff now obviously
we're not gonna have the scores today
because the cards were just announced
this morning but as soon as we get our
samples in here we'll bring the scores
now like I said three new cards coming
out first up is the GeForce r-tx 2080 ti
at $1200 that's right 12-under bucks now
this card has four thousand three
hundred thirty-two cuda cores a base
clock of 1350 megahertz
a boost clock of sixteen hundred and
thirty five megahertz the memory speed
is 14 gigabytes per second eleven
gigabytes of GDR six memory that's right
GDR six memory 332 bit memory interface
memory bandwidth of six hundred and
sixteen gigabytes a second to two slot
card features 260 watts of a power draw
they're saying to use Italy
the minimum is 650 watt power supply and
it has two eight pen power connections
okay now those were the specs for the
founders edition card but they'll be a
non founders edition card being released
as well and it only have a couple of
difference it'll have a twin and fifty
watt power draw and a boost speed of
fifteen hundred and forty five megahertz
but those are the only differences
beyond the price next up is the r-tx
twenty eighty founders vision card
coming to market at at eight hundred
dollars and this particular card has two
thousand nine hundred and forty four
cuda cores it has a base clock speed of
fifteen hundred and fifteen megahertz
and overclock speed of an 1800 mega it's
pretty fast stuff their memory clock
speed of fourteen gigabytes per second
eight gigabytes of ddr2 and root six bit
memory interface on memory bandwidth of
four hundred and forty eight gigabytes a
second it's a two slot card recommended
power supply is 650 watts and the power
draw is 225 watts off your power supply
now the requirements for this card are a
single six pin and a single 8 pin
connector
there's also another edition of this
card as well that's the non founders
Edition it comes to market at seven
hundred dollars and the only difference
is a boost speed of 710 megahertz and a
power draw of 215 watts okay now last
but not least coming in the market at
$600 is the geforce r-tx 27 t card now
this card has 2300 for cuda cores a base
clock speed of 410 megahertz
a boost clock of 1700 and 10 megahertz
not bad once again 14 gigabytes a second
as far as the memory speed goes 8
gigabytes of ddr2 and 56 bit memory
interface the memory bandwidth 448
gigabytes a second it's also a 2 slot
card like all these cards are the power
draw on this card is 175 watts and it's
recommend that you use at least a 550
watt power supply on this particular
card
there's also once again a geforce r-tx
27 t non founders Edition at $500 the
differences in this card is it has a
boost clock speed of 1620 megahertz and
185 watt power draw alright Tech fans so
those are the specs and the car
that are currently coming out for you
guys to have questions on what really RT
X stands for RT X refers to real time
ray tracing a computationally expensive
process of accurately modeling how light
bounces between reflective surfaces in a
scene so this means when you have a
bunch of things on a scene the way it
the light bounce at it in shows is
showed through the ray tracing which
means the better the ray tracing the
better the image is actually going to
look just to show you how much faster
this card is in the current 1080i a
1080i can do 1.2 gigabytes a second a
twenty eighty I can do ten wow that's a
big huge difference and it's really
gonna translate into your gameplay but
to see all that stuff will actually have
to get the card in-house as soon as we
get these cards in the house we'll bring
all the scores for you we'll test them
out in different systems and bring all
that information to you folks but for
now this is pretty much all the
information that's available on these
cards on launch day so I'm Network you
guys been watching techo tomorrow like
usual we'll have a link down below where
you guys can check out more stuff about
these cards I don't know about you but
I'm really excited like I said it's been
a long time since we've had anything new
to talk about now all these cards are
based off the brand new touring
architecture so gone in the past of all
the old stuff we're now into the touring
stuff and hopefully here on Tekken
tomorrow we can take a nice little tour
with these cards we'll have the scores
we'll have more stuff for you here on
Tekken morrow as the cards arrived like
usual we'll have a link down below to
all the information for these cards you
can get right now and like I said as
soon as we get the cards in house I'll
bring you guys the scores we'll see how
much faster these cards really are than
the 1080i and why you might wan siddur
upgrading to one of these brand new
