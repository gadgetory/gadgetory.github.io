is totally geared towards gamers and
enthusiasts and as the latest thing from
Intel I'll tell you what skylake
yesterday Intel is once again push the
envelope of technology and their
brand-new sixth generation of Intel's
Core pressing family CPUs codenamed
skylake have hit the shelves offering a
couple of new SKUs - an eager crowd
Intel introduced right off the bat -
brand new SKUs guys oh no excuse our
that's their cpu nomenclature stuff one
is an i-5 this is a 6600 K offering 3.5
base clock 3.9 turbo boost and other
things that are totally geared for the
overclocker
the big news however is the brand new i7
6700 K now this bad boys top of the line
and even has Intel 530 graphics embedded
into it right out of the box the 6700 K
is at 4.0 Giga that's right right out of
the box and offers unprecedented things
never seen before in a CPU for the
overclocker on this screen right here
though you can see how the overclocking
parameters have been totally fleshed out
and like I said there are also
overclocking additions via the ddr4
memory which now has finer grain
increments allowing more precise
stepping as well as DDR ratio overdrive
capabilities a question I know that's
going to come up you're gonna go hey
okay these things are great for gaming
but what I do for productivity well
obviously if they're going to game good
they're still going to be good for
productivity they're not gonna be as
good as the x99 chipset if you go out
into your sub Z on platform but this
thing is gonna be something that you can
game on and still do all your work I
mean most people aren't at home you know
rendering their 3d games out their
living room if they are they usually
have a much higher end systems these
systems are pretty much for the gamer
the enthusiast the guy who watches
movies plays games as all that stuff but
it still has those features that'll make
it good for doing your productivity so
if you're editing stuff in Photoshop
you're making movies and all that kind
of stuff this thing's gonna do great for
you now I know they look questions
people are gonna ask well I want to
upgrade but what do I gotta do all right
well if you have an old CPU cooler good
news there because all of the CPU
coolers that fit the 1150 are gonna fit
this absolutely no problem so you're
gonna also have to buy a new motherboard
because with these new CPUs like I said
comes a
ran new chipset that's right the z170
has hit the market it's a brand new
motherboard it's really fleshed out
basically it's just more of everything
much more PCIe support much more support
for the USB 3.0 just you know that's
pretty much what it is and it also works
with this new CPU is going to be much
better for ddr4 and all that kind of
stuff so let's talk a little bit about
that the big thing that Intel is pushing
about these new z170 motherboards is
their ability to have 40% more
high-speed IO lanes that means like I
said more USB 3.0 more PCIe lanes until
rapid storage technology also gets a
boost with Intel's latest PCI Express
storage support the z7 10 will be able
to handle mass amounts of data transfer
without hindrance Intel also offers the
following kind of comparison they're
saying that if you have a year old
system you're basically going to get 10%
better performance by this platform with
a two-year old system 20% better if you
have a three-year old system 30% better
performance now these numbers should be
take with a grain of salt but that's
pretty much a roundabout way of saying
hey here's an easy way to show you what
this can do compared to something before
and with video cards I have had a
tendency to notice that if you buy
another video card up it's usually like
10 frames per second more so if you buy
a 980 you know it could be 70 frames you
buy 980ti over the 80 frame so I guess
the 10% thing could kind of fit in there
in the last few months I've been seeing
a lot of comments down below saying hey
man like when are you gonna like change
up your test system some of the tests
that you're doing like you're you're
running them a medium settings that's
totally crazy so this is actually going
to be my completely new system for doing
all of the gaming tests and the gaming
benchmarks now I got two motherboards in
for this launch the first board up in
the test station is one of the g1 gaming
series motherboards that's right this is
the z1 70 X gaming 7 from gigabyte kind
of a crazy name but as you guys can see
in the test station this thing looks
really really incredible we're still
using our custom Swift tech for all of
our cooling it's a water cooling system
it does pretty decent at overclocking
and you guys can see that we got brand
new memory in as well it's the brand new
vengeance lpx which is rated at a
devilish
2666 just getting around but that is the
number this is some very fast ddr4
memory it's a little bit hard to see but
in between the CPU and the first video
card slot we have our little tiny little
M 2 SATA thing there and that's what
reasoning for the boot drive I've also
got another 512 gigabyte SSD we use that
for some stuff storage and then the last
but not least I have a 2 terabyte
Western Digital black drive which i
think is what many people out there used
for storing their games on because it
just has what mass amounts of storage
it's pretty damn sturdy it's fast enough
to make your gaming experience still
pretty cool now I wish I had the bucks
to go ahead and just buy completely SSD
and have 2 terabytes of SSD but even I
ain't that cool yet the other
motherboard that we're gonna be testing
as well for you folks is this one right
here this is a bad-ass motherboard this
is the Asus z170 deluxe some of you guys
know anything about the deluxe series I
know a lot of people go I like the raagh
series I'm gonna be honest to you raagh
is cool but I built so many damn systems
that are just black and black and red
and black and red black red am i right I
kind of like this board it has just
black and white it's really easy using a
different colored system kind of like
the one back here behind which we'll
talk about real quick
so anyways I'm sorry folks if we don't
have all the test scores and everything
down for this stuff but like I said we
only got the motherboard yesterday but I
don't want to let you guys down so some
cool things are about this any of you
guys we have out there water cooling
equipment you're not have to worry about
going in the new block or anything Matt
even with the brand new chipset it still
mounts up no problems no additional
equipment is needed that's one cool
thing obviously if you want to jump into
this brand new chipset well then you're
gonna have to buy a new motherboard if
you don't have ddr4 you're gonna have to
buy ddr4 memory and obviously you're
gonna have to buy the CPU but if you're
somebody who wants the most cutting-edge
stuff and you want to really be able to
use a lot of video cards on your system
without it going you know and freaking
out you're gonna want to get into this
kind of stuff I know that some of the
older chipsets did do pretty well with
handling multi video cards but if you
were doing three and four video cards
you were always pretty much forced to go
to annex 99 unless she wanted to be
bottleneck I'm gonna try my testing with
this and we'll actually see if this
bottlenecks so I thank you guys for
watching him by the way I know some user
put a question down this
back behind me this is the blue fury
it's finally done there's still gonna be
a little more little custom tiny things
but essentially the entire system is now
done you can see it behind me
it's basically until x99 mixed with a
couple of fury axes inside that bad boy
we'll talk about that another day for
today though hey sky lake has arrived
for pricing available all that kind of
stuff
hey take a look down below we will have
some links man I'm Ehlert I'll see you
back here really soon I got actually do
a lot of testing on this stuff then I'll
bring you guys the numbers and they'll
bring you actually the features of each
motherboard because basically nowadays
every motherboard is only going to be
varied slightly faster or slower than
the other one so small it's going to be
almost indistinguishable the best things
about motherboards these days are its
features and if you're an overclocker
pow wild over crimes you're not an
overclocker well that pie doesn't matter
to you're looking for stability on Lake
so hey thanks a lot we'll see you guys
back here on teka tomorrow for more tech
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
