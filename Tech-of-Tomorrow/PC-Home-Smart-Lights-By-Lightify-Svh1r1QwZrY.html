everyday things we grew up with are
changing and in the new digital world
app based appliances are very growing
and booming business in the past you
guys have seen it I've upgraded buy a
home with a few of these type of devices
such as the August smart lock the ring
doorbell and with some new products from
the folks over at Osram I'm getting
ready to upgrade my lighting today we're
taking a look at the light of fie home
now the light of fire home is a product
line that consists of four different
lines that all run in their own mobile
app be your home Wi-Fi and on both the
Android and iOS platforms on many of
their products you can also change the
color of the lighting this is great for
a variation on a theme or for just
setting a mood so I know all this sounds
good
and it looks pretty cool too but how
does it actually work well to make it
work is really very simple the first
thing you will need to do is set up your
account by activating the gateway now
the gateway it works off your home Wi-Fi
and getting it set up is very simple all
you do is download and install the app
register the gateway which then sends an
email to your account then simply enter
the activation code and then you are
ready to light things up we set up the
light of Phi tunable white a 19 bull now
this bulb allows you to automatically
adjust the light temperature along the
white spectrum depending on your need
the a 19 offers 805 lumens and then at
an estimated energy cost of $1 20 per
year and one of the really green things
about the light of Phi line is that it
uses up to 80% less energy compared with
an ordinary light bulb Osram also offers
indoor luminaries including the Flex RGB
W the Flex RGB W can be used for many
different things from home lighting just
doing something in our home to make it
look cool to using it inside of a custom
PC to light your PC up and with the
ability to change colors it makes it a
very flexible product that is only as
limited as your imagination the strip
can also be cut and bent to fit the
application that you are using it for
and with clearly defined cut out points
this makes sure you do not damage the
Flex when altering it and all the colors
can be custom controlled via the
application let's say that the Co you're
looking for
isn't currently in Oz Rams choices one
of the really cool features of this
device is its ability to clone any color
by simply taking a picture with your
Android or iOS device and then the app
adds the color instantly which is
totally awesome
for those looking to take the smart home
out into the garden to make their garden
a smart garden Osram offers luminary
options called garden spots these lights
can be used for lighting up your garden
or just for adding flair to your walkway
or porch from changing colors too many
spot lighting this can be a really neat
addition to your outdoor environment you
can extend the garden spot to longer
links by simply removing the end cap and
attaching an additional line to it
now every one of these lights can be
controlled independently via the odds
Ram light a Phi app or you can create
custom groups allowing you to control
multiple sets of lights at the same time
you can also set schedulers by simply
setting a start and end time for your
chosen light
all these products are very interesting
and I have to say I like them quite a
bit just because they're unique so if
you're looking for something to totally
upgrade your smart home or upgrade your
smart garden Hey
the odds are my defi offers you
something very unique and something
that's really easy to use like usual all
the information about this stuff will be
down to the bullet like button so if you
guys dug what you saw hey go Chuck
Norris on that like button so if you're
not subbed
hey you know what to do and I'll see you
in your Inbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
