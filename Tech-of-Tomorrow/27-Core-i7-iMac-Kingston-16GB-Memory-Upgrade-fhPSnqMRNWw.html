YouTube Elric Faris your host here at
the tech of tomorrow YouTube channel
well check it out my iMac 27-inch i7
model only came with 8 gigabytes of RAM
and so that kind of sucks where I'm
trying to use Photoshop or do anything
major with my computer so my friends at
Kingston thanks David we're able to
provide me with a 16 gigabyte upgrade
kit so what this video is is this video
is showing you how to install this
memory into the 27-inch iMac so check
this out it's a pretty easy procedure
and I think anyone can do it
alright so the probably the very first
thing you want to do before doing your
upgrade is set down a soft closet that
not scratch your screen now this is my
27-inch iMac i7 Edition what we're going
to be doing here is gonna be taking out
the standard memory and replacing it
with the 16 gigabyte kit that we got
from our friends at Kingston so what we
have to do first is a plate down here
there's three screws that must be
removed we'll remove them and then we'll
move on ok so now you can see where the
memory is at there's gonna be two
plastic tabs in there what you need is
you need to pop these tabs both open
first because what these do is actually
pull up the memory so you take these and
you pull those out and those remove the
memory so you have to take out all the
old memory and we'll get past that first
as you can see it's very easily done
then after that you got to put the new
memory back in so we're gonna start from
bottom to top and this you can see the
bottom is actually the lower part of the
screen and then we're gonna follow on
that procedure going to the top now what
you want to make sure to do is you wanna
make sure the memory makes a solid click
when you install it like check this out
right here you can see as it pushes in
it kind of has a little click probably
might not hear it but that's what
happens then you want to take this and
follow it and but the black tabs tucked
back into the system
just like you remove them after that put
back on the outside little bracket and
you're good to go
you should be able to start your
computer up and see your new 16 gigabyte
upgrade so thanks for watching I hope
