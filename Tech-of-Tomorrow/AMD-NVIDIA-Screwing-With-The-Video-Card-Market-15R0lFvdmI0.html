awful lot of finger poking by pretty
much everybody in the industry towards
minors claiming that minors are the sole
responsibility of why there are no
gaming cards available and I'm gonna
tell you this right off the bat there's
no way that just minors alone are
responsible for the situation even if
they're buying hundreds of cards and
stuff like Jays two cents made a video
than science guy replied and all these
guys replying disagreeing with Jo Bob a
lot I mean minors are a small part of
the problem but I want you to really
identify something that I believe is the
true culprit of all of this and I think
it's AMD and NVIDIA themselves now you
might ask well Rick why are you saying
this well in the past we've seen
shortages for little links of time we
have it's happened but never for the
longest period of time like it's been
going on now it's been going on
literally for almost a year it seems
like we're video card prices have just
gotten outrageous AMD and NVIDIA are
obviously not making enough cards
they're just not making cards at all now
are they doing this on purpose I mean I
seem to think that they are and another
thing that kind of jumbles into this if
you're paying attention to what's going
on in the market a lot of these
companies now are talking about selling
directly to you which means they'll
eliminate all the board companies they
won't be you know you won't be able to
go get an exuse branded card you
wouldn't be able to get a gigabyte of
card or an msi card EVGA card you
wouldn't be able to get any of those
cards because the companies would be
selling these things directly to you so
if they sell you directly to them who
you excuse me
you totally completely cut out the
middleman now I don't know if it's going
to be bad or good but the video card
companies themselves AMD Nvidia both
have to be guilty of not making cars
because let's just face it if these
companies were manufacturing cards and
putting out cards at a constant basis
why would there ever really truly be a
shortage think about it even if a minor
goes out there and he buys a thousand
cards
why isn't nvidia AMD making a lot of
cards to replace these cards I mean it
doesn't really make much sense to me
having this large gap in for the
prices going on for so long like this
there's no way that just people who do
mining are the ones that are responsible
for this stuff and if you guys can hear
the garbage truck in the background I
hugely apologize I'd love to go out and
slap the guy for making so much noise
but he's just doing his job it's driving
me nuts as I try to talk to you guys but
at the end of the day man
AMD and NVIDIA have to be guilty at some
level for this shortage of cars because
if they were making enough cards to fill
the market there wouldn't be this giant
shortage and prices wouldn't be where
they're at now all these companies both
sit back and they say oh you know hey
we're not making any money off of this
or anything you know everybody else is
gauging the prices we'll check it out as
the prices are getting gouged now all of
a sudden you see these companies going
well gee we'll sell to you directly why
do you think that is think about it they
want to sell to you directly because
then they'll claim there are shortages
and you'll get completely utterly
screwed now you guys might not really
realize this but diamonds are worthless
I'm being honest with you if you really
look and do the information it's
completely worthless the reason that
they cost so much money is that these
guys called De Beers they've basically
put a cap on the market that only allows
a certain amount of diamonds to trickle
onto the market and since they only
allow those certain amount of diamonds
trickle on the market they control the
price because in all honesty they have a
warehouse that's full of so many
diamonds that your diamonds that you
have are virtually utterly worthless and
I'm telling you the truth here they are
completely worthless now is this same
thing gonna start happening in the video
card market so like where these
companies are just going to hold back
and let things trickle out so now Nvidia
and AMD themselves can charge you $1100
for their card directly from them
because then I'm gonna be completely
utterly off of you there's no way on
God's green earth that these suckers
want to sell directly to you unless they
want to be making more money off the
cards so instead of letting knew a god
you instead of letting Amazon Bob's
mom-and-pop shop gouge you now AMD and
NVIDIA will gouge you directly so when
you go to buy these cards if there's a
shortage guess what and he'll be like oh
well there's a short in the car we can
make any you know so now you're 1080i is
gonna cost you $1,400 is that gonna
become the normal because if it is am
being video you have completely utterly
screwed over the PC gaming industry what
once was a very fun thing got to be
competitive in gaming will now become
something that really like I said before
only the rich will be able to get into
because if all your video card prices
start costing more than any other
component in your computer that's just
crazy traditionally the most expensive
part in your computer is when you buy a
really really good CPU if you buy a
super duper high-end
Intel i7 latest generation with all the
bells and whistles you usually see those
between nine and $1,300 for the desktop
and 2000 to 3000 for workstation and
even more for other things so that's
usually where people put their money
into people using to build their PC then
all of a sudden get the video card and
go wow my video card just cost me as
much as all the rest of my parts and
that's where it's at right now I release
the red dragon a video just yesterday
all of a sudden I'm starting getting all
these emails people asked me to sell it
to him at cost or trade it to him and do
this and we just got the card in here
for review I haven't even had time to
even review this card but yet people are
always you know already asking hey can I
buy this car for you can I buy it at
cost and get it I'm not selling any of
my samples at this point it's just too
hard to get a hold of the samples and
replacing them is next to impossible the
only way like I said before to get a
video card for a decent price is to buy
a pre-built system now you can find pre
belts from all the way low end all the
way to high end so you really can get a
good system that way I know yes for
those people who want the total personal
touch everything that kind of sucks but
if you want to be able to afford a video
card that's pretty much what you have to
do so at the end of the day I want to
know what you guys think do you guys
agree with me because I honestly think
that miners sure miners are a problem
they buy a lot of cards but the bottom
line is this if there were plenty of
cards on the market why would there be
price gouging you see how many cars
there are right you drive around the
world you see cars parked everywhere
they're all they they have so many cars
so that many cars they really can't
start
the prices but they could do the same
thing with the car just stop making him
and that's what I feel that AMD and
NVIDIA are doing at this time point they
have ramped the crap down out of their
manufacturing process therefore creating
this huge vacuum in the industry that
everybody's now pointing their fingers
to the miners and saying hey it's the
miners it's the miners well you know
what that's an easy scapegoat we can all
easily sit back on our loyals and go yep
it's those filthy freakin miners yep
it's them but no way in God's green
earth no-win hell either that miners are
solely responsible for the entire market
having a shortage on video cards AMD
Nvidia I don't know exactly what you
guys are doing right now but it just
smells awfully fishy don't you agree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
