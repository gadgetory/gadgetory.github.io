my bed has pretty much been my lifestyle
since I had my foot operated on and in
that instance I really wanted to make my
room as comfortable as possible and so I
started asking around all my friends in
the industry as if hey can people kick
me down some part so I can build myself
a really nice awesome system you know so
that I can sit up here in my room and
just game on my TV in my bed well if I
don't have to move you know cuz I'm
pretty much was stuck there for a long
time with the IV but now you guys see no
more PICC line that is off of me my
health is getting a lot better so thanks
to all the people out there who
contributed to doing this Brian thank
you very much from Nvidia for the video
card thank you do the people over at
deep cool thank you very much for the
people at Kingston you know thank you to
all the people who helped contribute
this stuff for this build thank you very
much to the people over at Intel who
gave me the CPU all in all the parts in
this build are about $4,000 and like I
said pretty much people gave me these
parts so I could be able to build this
really nice PC for my room now you guys
can see the PC right here behind me and
I have to tell you guys that Anthony did
a really nice job putting this entire
system together I mean everything about
this computer I probably look at you
guys you can hear it everything about
this computer is really nice so let me
adjust the camera real quick and let's
take a look at the insides and I'll tell
you about the parts and what I really
like about this particular case and the
build first off the case that we're
using in this particular build is by
deep cool this is the new arc 90 now
this particular case is a full-size
tower case and it features a lot of nice
stuff first of all inside the case you
guys can see it actually has its own
built in liquid cooler that comes with
the three fans that you see here as well
as well as the back fan I believe so you
get a nice set of fans when you buy the
case now the case is really really great
for doing a building because as you guys
can see plenty of room inside of here
for everything there's a nice little
spot on the bottom for your power supply
you can even see the model the power
splice through there which makes it
really cool especially they like you
know one day you want upgrade you go hey
what power supply do I have again
you can look right through the window
and see it so that's pretty nice now
from this particular angle right here in
the front there's actually room for more
fans if you want to put them in there we
chose not to do that because the airflow
with everything that's going on right
now is actually perfect you can see that
cable management from this particular
direction is very very nice the front of
the case is very very simplistic the
controls are located right there so that
you guys can access and turn on your
system and all that stuff whatever you
want to do if you remove the back panel
the system will just show you real quick
or you can see that there's just plenty
of room in the backside for doing all of
your cable management stuff and that
makes the build really good you've got
really nice rubberized feet on the
bottom of the case as well so the case
isn't gonna go sliding around when
you're doing your build
now the motherboard that we're using is
the a Zeus raagh Strix Z 390 motherboard
the very latest in the Intel series we
have an Intel this is an I 999 hundred K
CPU underneath this little cool right
here and the cooler actually functions
very very well as you guys will see as
we go into the video the cooler casually
keeps the CPU really really nice we have
sixteen gigabytes of the night hot tea
forced memory this is 32 hundred
megahertz memory I have it set on
profile - that's XMP profile - for
people out there who wondering exactly
what I'm talking about the motherboard
is actually really nice as well it has
plenty of expandability there's also
even a little fan up here that's help
keeping stuff cool on the motherboard I
like the way that all the lights and
everything match inside the case RTX
card 28 ET I once again thank you very
much - in video appreciate that video
card does take quite a lot of power
though to power this thing up is I was
thinking about one point maybe doing an
SLI build but then I figured out I don't
need to go that far this is actually
pretty cool I have a kingston SSD in
here
this is their HyperX it's a 480 gigabyte
PCIe SSD very very fast boot times and
all that stuff and I chose to go with
the sound card as well and I had one
from a Zeus that I just had lying around
from previous generations of videos and
stuff that we did this is the zone our
sound card I always really liked the
clarity of that especially with
headphones and everything so I decided
to go ahead and put that in here instead
of just using you know this is the
standard sound card that comes on the
board even though that sound is okay I
think having a discreet sound card to me
is actually
overall just for the performance of the
system and I wanted to have you know the
absolute best and fastest system that I
could get you guys will see the system
really does kick but as far as the
scoring goes now for the power supply
you guys can see through the window it's
the g.skill ripjaws now this is a 1250
watt power supply completely modular
very nice power supply still fits inside
of this case so the arc 90 does have
like plenty of room inside of it for you
know large size power supplies now even
though you guys can't see them right
here are my two Seagate Barracuda 2
terabyte hard drive so I store all my
games pretty much like you know all my
origin games on one all my Steam games
on the other and then the other smaller
companies I just mix them between the
two so plenty of room there for storing
all of my you know games and software
music anything I want to store on there
is all contain you know within these two
drives and they're completely hidden
which is really nice and if I wanted to
expand and get a even bigger drive I
could put one here and if I wanted to
expand with more SSDs on the back side
of the case there's still plenty of room
back there for me to put some more SSDs
back there so if I want to add more hard
drives SSDs or some of the back there's
also you guys can see right here I don't
think it really interfere with this
cable very much but I could put an SSD a
2.5 Drive right here as well so if I
want to I could really just add like you
know a 1 terabyte SSD right here for
even more expandability only thing it's
really kind of trippy as I couldn't get
these particular lights just to match
the green of the system so they go all
kinds of different colors I was kind of
hoping I could just lock them in on
green there probably is a way to do it I
just haven't been able to get them to do
that yet but overall this system runs
very very quiet I mean it really does
it's a very quiet ring system I have it
up with everything running full blast
right now the microphones literally
right in front of my head so you guys
can hear how quiet this system is even
why it's running that's really a nice
thing and even when I was playing games
I never heard the system like rev up
like I didn't hear that you know the
fans in the video car suck when I didn't
ever hear the fans inside of your circle
so I got you know no kind of fan warble
you know from loud fan speeds whatsoever
even when I'm using the computer you
know under full load aesthetically
speaking you guys can see this is really
one badass very very
built system honestly I mean I
personally I call it the Green Hornet
cuz I just think it's a really nice
system the green just kind of booms it
stands out when you're looking at the
system especially in the dark you know
you can see all the green lights
everything just going it looks really
cool anybody who comes into my room at
night and they see they're like hey wow
what is that thing it looks really cool
but other than the aesthetics you guys
are obviously wondering okay lark this
system does it's worth quite a lot of
money so let's see how it performs and
Before we jump in to the performance I
am running the latest version of Windows
it's Windows 10 is the anniversary
edition and I believe there was an
update actually just very recently as
well so we have all the latest updates
we're using the latest drivers from
Nvidia at the time of this video so
those are the drivers that we're using
as well but with that said though let's
check out a song from my band seven
deadly sins called insanity and let's
check out those benchmarks what they
think you'll be pretty impressed with
you guys can see the CPU got as high as
68 Celsius and the r-tx 28 ET i got up
to 84 Celsius alright so there you guys
have it so check this out most of the
games that we tested at even 4k
resolution we're running it over 60
frames per second and that's pretty cool
because everybody like oh nothing runs
anything at you know over 60 frames per
second well you guys saw it
this system will do it it runs actually
most of the games I'm sure if I went out
and tested 50 games that probably you
know probably 30 35 of those games at
least are going to be running ahead over
60 frames per second in 4k and I think
that's pretty impressive on the system
upstairs I have a totally wireless
keyboard and mouse setup that was given
to me by the people over at Corsair it's
really really nice stuff I'm actually
we're going to actually have a video
coming up and of course there is going
to be giving away a whole wireless
system on Christmas Day here on Tekken
tomorrow so actually stay tuned for that
but overall like I said this system is
worth about $4,000 but we'll have links
below to other parts that you guys can
buy and substitute so that you can make
this build cheaper for yourself you
don't need to use the absolute highest
in you know parts to build your system
if you really like the case and you
really like the liquid cooler being
built inside of it then this is a really
good option to you know to go for it now
how long this particular system is going
to keep running especially you know with
the a i/o loop I don't know how you know
particularly long it'll last
hopefully deep pool has done a lot of
research I know the temperatures on it
are very nice you guys can see it's
running nice and cool I mean let's just
face it this is the latest Intel CPU
it's a 9900 case so it's obviously going
to be you know probably good to be
running a little bit warm but it's you
know it's doing really ok I haven't
really done the overclocking but also
you guys can see that this CPU most of
the time was running at almost 5
gigahertz so I mean it had really good
speed throughout everything so it's a
very super fast system it looks really
nice obviously at the cost of 4k you
know I don't know it seems to me like if
you went out even just bought one of
those systems from those places who pre
build your systems they might have done
a little bit more on the liquid cooling
side they might have you know done a
complete custom loop and liquid cooled
the video card and all that stuff but
even if you know I did that liquid
cooling the video card itself makes it
kind of so like you're very limited for
one thing if anything happens to your
liquid cooler or anything you're gonna
probably get your card to be shot to get
any liquid on the card it could be shot
there's just all kinds of risk in doing
that this particular system anybody
who's at home can build this system you
can do this and they does a really good
job because he's been doing this for a
long long time for me he can do all the
greatest cable management look
everything beautiful but if you take
your time and just really pay attention
to what's going on and do different
things you can make your system just as
beautiful as this and with a lot of
different parts but as is hey I'm
calling this baby the Green Hornet once
again special thanks to all the people
out there who gave me all these parts to
build this beautiful system where I've
been trapped in this wheelchair you guys
Rock I'll have another video with an
update I don't think I'll be in the
chair very much longer like usual all
the links will be down below make sure
you check them out if you want to build
a system you can do it or just check out
different ideas for building a system
and what it might be for you peace out
we'll see you guys back here on Tekken
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
