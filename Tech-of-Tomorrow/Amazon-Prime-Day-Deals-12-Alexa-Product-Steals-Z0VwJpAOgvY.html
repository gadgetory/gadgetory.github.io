many emails and it seems like a lot of
people were really excited and waiting
for Amazon's Prime days we'll check it
out
Amazon Prime day starts today at 3:00
p.m. Eastern Standard Time so if you're
an East Coaster and might already be
hitting there and you can jump in on
these deals already for those people out
here in California they'll have to wait
just a few more wee hours but what that
said though let's jump in and let's
check out some of the products that are
being offered on Amazon Prime day and I
have to say that a lot of the product it
does seem like though are actually
Amazon based products but let's check
them out so first up today a Toshiba
50-inch 4k TV with a fire TV actually
built into it for two hundred and eighty
nine dollars that is a great deal
50-inch TV 4k lots of great features on
the TV really nice remote if you're
looking for something that's not gonna
like be too big to be you know too big
for your bedroom something that's like
right in that really nice spot a 50-inch
TV is really nice it's still big screen
but it's not so big screen you couldn't
put it in your bedroom so if anyone out
there is looking for a 50-inch 4k TV and
they like fire TV well pay its built-in
size you don't have to worry about
getting a separate remote buying one of
those little boxes or anything else you
get 4k right as yun box for TV and stick
it in your living room
another great deal on prime day is the
fire seven tablet with Alexa now they
have two different models they have the
8 gigabyte model which is $29.99 which
is 20 bucks off or they have a 16
gigabyte model for $44.99 which is $25
off now both these obviously they have a
7 inch screen they feature a lot of
different things
they're not exactly full-blown like
interview other tablets out there
they're not gonna be like your iPad or
anything like that but they are pretty
similar you can play games you can do a
lot of stuff you can read books and with
these kind of prices um you really don't
have to worry about going oh my god this
tablet got lost or broken because the
prices are cut really amazing
this is actually one of the best deals
that I've seen today the firetv stick
with Alexa voice remote this is only
$19.99 this is 50% off and it's pretty
cool because you can stick at any
computer any TV anything that has a USB
port you can plug this in and get up and
going and be watching all of your stuff
that you do on Fire TV so $19.99 great
price the second generation echo dot is
on sale today on the deal for $29.99
this is a savings of $20 now what is the
echo dot well pretty much it is a voice
controlled device that you can control
your TV have a conversation with Google
has a similar device with this one you
know you just obviously don't say okay
Google but with the echo dot you can
check the weather you can check all
kinds of different things that will
interact with you you can control your
TV it's really kind of a nifty little
product you can also call or message
almost anyone hands-free with your echo
device it also instantly connects to
other record device in your home using
just your voice and the ability to
control lots of different devices with
the dot is also pretty cool and being
able to buy this on prime date for 30
bucks a killer deal it's 40% off saving
you 20 bucks if you're looking for a
security camera and you really want to
save some money the Amazon Cloud cam is
$60 off today that's right 50% off now
this thing is 1080p HD recording it
features night vision so at night you
can see everything it has two way audio
so if you had one in your front yard you
could actually communicate with your
family or if your dog was barking in the
backyard you could yell at him hey
Sparky shut the heck up and earlier we
talked about that little dot this will
also work with the dot device so it'll
totally integrate with your Alexis stuff
in your home so you can have security
and make it all integrated through the
Amazon products I'm a person who reads a
lot of books so I own this particular
product and I can endorse and say it
does work really really well now this is
the Kindle paperwhite e-reader today on
sale for $80 with the special offers or
it's $100 without the special office and
what the special offers is Bates
you turn it on you go to looking at
there's like a little commercial ad I
get to just push a button and go away
from it if you never want to see that
stuff that may be worth paying you know
an additional 20 bucks now the product
has a six inch high-resolution display
300 pixels per inch it has a built-in
backlight it features Wi-Fi and right
now it's a really good price I have to
say honestly this particular product I
endorse because it does work really well
and if I could have bought one in 80
bucks I definitely would have done it if
you're one of those people who's trying
to turn your house into a smart house
and you're using a lot of the Alexa
products to do so this next particular
product is $90 right now it's a savings
of $30 25% and it's kind of interesting
it's called the fire TV cube so we're
like okay a cube it's not a board cube
it's just a cube but what's kind of
interesting about it is it's completely
hands-free which means that when you
like come into the room you just say TV
turn on TV volume down next episode
everything you want to do is all done
through your voice so if you tired of
using a remote control you're tired of
looking around for that remote control
and dealing with it with this fire TV
cube you no longer need a remote control
whatsoever and everything is done
through your voice and like other Alexa
devices you can get the weather it'll
talk to you you can get the time you can
do all kinds of different stuff it
supports 4k and for 90 bucks I gotta say
I mean when you're buying the regular
product which we'll get to later in the
video it's about 50 bucks to 60 bucks to
get the different products especially if
you want the 4k so paying $90 for
something that you never have to ever
worry about the remote control that's
actually kind of cool I'd probably buy
one if I had the money and something
that the fire TV cube offers that's
honestly really cool earlier in the
video we talked about that security cam
will using this device you can actually
talk to the Vice and say something like
hey Alexa show me my guitar room or hey
Alexa show me my recording studio or
outside and it'll automatically switch
to that on your TV and show you that
view which means you can actually turn
your TV in your security cam
and the more cameras that you have the
more coverage you can get that
voice-controlled cube is actually a
really cool product maybe out of some
people's price range but if you still
want to have 4k Ultra HD and an Alexa
voice controlled remote you guys can get
the fire TV ultra 4k Edition for $34.99
that's 50% off which is a $35 savings
and that's really pretty cool you can
also get a fire TV plus an echo dot 450
998 or a fire TV plus an HD antenna for
$39.99
I own this product as well it's actually
in my living room it's what I watch all
my TV through and the remote control is
really easy to use
if you use the voice control button at
the top you can search for whatever
programs you're looking for it's really
easy to use and honestly for $34.99 I'm
thinking of buying one just to have one
in case one breaks because why pay
seventy bucks later when I can pay
thirty five bucks today
now this next particular product to me
seems a lot like the cube the only real
difference between this and the cube is
the cube controls your TV and this does
everything else and what's cool about it
is it actually has a window on it that
shows you a picture and this way any of
the cameras that you are using if you
owned cameras you could all monitor
through there and see through that
particular picture frame so instead of
like seeing your TV or whatever you
could go cam one cam two cam three and
you could monitor your entire house
through those and you can use as many as
you want through the house now this
particular product is a hundred bucks it
has a savings of thirty bucks but if you
buy two of them they'll give you $80 off
which is $40 off each one so obviously
they want to push this product quite a
bit you can connect Bluetooth speakers
or you can connect through a 3.5
millimeter stereo cable you can let you
do Pandora Spotify any of that type of
stuff so you can stream your music you
can show all your cameras through it
personally I really feel that this is a
product that's very similar to the cube
it's very similar to the cube instead of
monitoring everything you know through
your TV you get this little window
personally I feel at the echo spot is
very
like the TV cube very very close the
only difference is is that the spot has
its own little built-in screen and with
the cube you obviously use your TV but
if you were doing home monitoring
through their security camera you could
have a bunch of these a monitor a bunch
of different rooms each on a separate
spot another very interesting product on
prime deal days is the echo Shona this
particular product has over 12,000
positive customer ratings and currently
buying a single one is a hundred and
twenty nine ninety nine which is the
savings of a hundred dollars and if you
buy two of them you can save two hundred
and twenty dollars now the echo show is
something really kind of interesting now
it's everything that you like about
Alexa but you can watch things right
through the window there you can watch
videos flash briefings Amazon video
content you can actually see the lyrics
you can monitor the different cameras in
your house it's all completely
hands-free you can even see lyrics on
screen with Amazon music all you have to
do is ask to play a song um it's
supposed to have powerful really nice
speakers that has Dolby processing which
means you can hear your vocals really
good and nice bass response and all of
this for one hundred and twenty nine
ninety nine or like I said if you buy
two it's a little bit less but I would
get this product probably if I wanted to
do the monitoring more than any other
products because the screens a nice size
and it will fit right on your desk so if
you were working in stuff it wouldn't be
you know so you know blatantly obvious
on your desk that would best be an
annoyance and you could sit and monitor
everything in your home right from your
desk and for that particular thing I
really like it if I had some extra cash
right now I have to admit I would jump
on one of these because even though I
only have one of their cameras I'd like
to add more and be able to monitor
everything in my house just sitting at
my desk working that would be pretty
cool and you gotta admit the price ain't
bad like I said at the very beginning of
the video most of the products that
they're showing today on Amazon Prime
day are Amazon based products there are
a few different ones now the big catch
to all this is you have to be a prime
member and the Prime membership does
cost about a hundred dollars for a year
what's cool about it is like you do get
unlimited TV and all kinds of others
free shipping and all that so my family
does buy it but you do have to be a
prime member now some of the products
look really interesting the echo show if
I had some extra cash I have to admit I
would buy that right now because the
ability to monitor everything in my
whole house I could monitor were the
cameraman when he's editing videos I
could my guitar room make sure that you
know the animals are going and they're
getting in the stuff monitored the back
yard the front yard and be able to watch
everything right from my desk on a nice
small screen that's pretty cool now also
another cool one was that cube being
able to talk and change all the things
in your TV would never happen to find a
remote control I have to say is a pretty
damn good deal so if anything in there
looked cool to you check it out if
you're a Prime member these are great
deals now tomorrow hopefully they'll
have something different honestly I'll
be quite completely blunt with you I was
a bit disappointed I was expecting there
to be all kinds of different products on
prime day but there's really not as many
as I thought that was going to be
hopefully tomorrow one the second day
we'll have some new interesting products
and if we do we'll bring you another
video but for today there will be links
to all these products down below so if
you want to checking them out for
yourself or purchase one you can do so
we'll see you guys back from the channel
for more tech peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
