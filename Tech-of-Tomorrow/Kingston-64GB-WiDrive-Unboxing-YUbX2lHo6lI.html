at a really cool product and the people
over at Kingston what is this this is
the new Y Drive product now you guys are
probably asking why Drive when I can
walk no I'm just joking anyways what the
Y Drive is is basically this is portable
storage that will connect to pretty much
any wireless type of device be it tablet
or phone it works with mac device it
works with the Android works with all
those different things at 64 gigabytes
and it's really cool and one of the
special things about it is that three
users can use it all at once that's
right you can have a digital that's
right a digital manoj at hua without any
degradation in this drive which is kind
of kinky can get kinky kinky I've got my
knife here we're going to do an unboxing
gonna start here on the side here and
take a little incision go ahead just cut
it down here nice and cleanly like a
doctor like a surgeon it's good for the
very first time I'm a cursor
oh sorry that's the 80s and me showing
excuse me all right so here we have
anyway so yeah Kingston why drive 64
gigabytes I'm going to bring it to the
cameramen so we can just get a little
close up look in the box there show you
guys side the other exciting side one
more exciting side and then last before
the orgasmic unboxing up the back of the
box oh my gee willikers okay folks so
here up in here I got it I'm going to do
the unboxing here you can see it dun dun
dun dun oh look at that the cap came off
I got some of foamy stuff underneath
here I guess what things really really a
nice and light so we've got right here
we got to check it out got the manual
not to be confused with manual the
cameramen I'm just kidding it's couldn't
help but throw that in there plus it off
the side got the little power connector
right here it's very very small little
wall circuitry thing a module I like
that like that word wall thingy majigger
know you've got the little USB plug you
no longer need this box so we'll set
that down over there so here we
basically let me take the plastic off
completely no actually though folks
don't bring it up here by the mic now
that is live action sound there folks oh
wait I've got a second one here ooh now
see that's not even sound effects that's
real live sound baby so check it out
here's the Y Drive 64 gigabytes totally
portable now what does this thing good
for say you're in your house and you and
a bunch of people want to listen to a
bunch of different types of music you
can have all the different itunes stuff
all located on this thing and three of
you at a time can have a menage at wha
and listen to different types of music
in the house or movies or anything else
they do have some other size of this
Drive I'm sure they're going to be going
even bigger as time goes by you guys can
see it's very thin it's very lightweight
there's a little power little button
thing here on the side right here you
guys can see it it's all lighting up
it's all turned on now it's all charged
up ready to go so now all you have to do
is your wireless devices that you have
like your iPhone or your Android tablet
or your Android phone you need those
types of things so like say you
like listen to music in your phone and
then your mom or your brother somebody
they want another room watching movie
and then somebody else actually wants to
do something else with it as long as you
have either like an apple TV or any of
those type of devices in the house
you'll be able to Wi-Fi on to it take
the information off of this and stream
it and you can do it with three people
at a time which is pretty cool I know
it's kind of a niche market there's a
lot of other products that are emerging
onto the market that have the same type
of thing but hey Kingston's here first
this thing's pretty cool aye milord
Ferris we'll see you here later on tech
