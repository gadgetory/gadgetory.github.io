back to tech tomorrow I'm Elric your
host now you guys all know that the new
ultra ebooks from Intel are hitting the
market now these things are really
incredible for the traveling businessman
they're lightweight they're thin they
have awesome features for being on a
plane just overall a really cool thing
for the traveling person who wants to
get a lot of work done now today we're
going to be looking at the Lenovo
ThinkPad carbon x1 this thing has a lot
of awesome features on it and it's
priced quite right as well you can find
this thing anywhere from $1,200 to $1600
depending on what type of SSD you get
inside the system so anyways let's jump
in right now and let's check out all the
features of this brand-new Lenovo x1
ThinkPad carbon let's go now this
thing's really cool
it features roll cage technology and
Gorilla Glass that way if you drop this
thing or anything bad happens to it it's
pretty likely to survive now the
particular model that I'm looking at has
an Intel Core i5 3 4 to 7 u which is a
1.8 gigahertz processor with turbo boost
technology 2.0 going up to 2.8 gigahertz
also has 3 megabytes of smart cache now
this unit also has 4 gigabytes of ddr3
1333 megahertz SD RAM and 128 gigabyte
solid state drive now the solid-state
drive gives you silent operations very
fast boot and access times as well
now the screen like winched before it's
a 14 inch HD screen with 16 by 900 LED
backlit display with anti glare now this
thing's pretty cool because you can also
view it from many different angles and
looks very clear obviously the unit
contains the intel HD 4000 graphics it
also has stereo speakers and includes
Dolby home theater v4 technology you
also get an integrated HD 720p camera a
fingerprint reader Bluetooth 4.0 intel
centrino advanced n6 205's 802 11 a BGN
network connectivity 4 and 1 media card
reader which reads MMC SD
SDHC and SDXC now this is a really cool
feature that I myself really like it's
the spill resistant backlit keyboard
that has ultra nav and TrackPoint now
this thing's very ergonomic to use the
track point is very accurate for your
finger and it's actually very
comfortable to use for long periods of
time and the fact that spill resistant
means if you have to spill your drink on
something it may not break that quick
now as far as external connections go
you get a single USB 3.0 connector a
single USB 2.0 connector a main display
port and a combo audio mic jack
now the actual dimensions of the carbon
x1 are 13 point Oh inches by with 8.9
inches in depth and point zero seven
four in height which is how thick the
thing is which is actually less than an
inch now some of the other features that
are centric to this particular unit are
the latest in the lenovo technology
which features their latest rapid resume
and rapid connect technology this allows
you to wake up very fast from sleep and
to be connected even when you're not
using the laptop now lastly like I said
before this thing is really geared
toward the traveling businessman battery
life if you're using it constantly is
about two hours that means if you're
like running DVDs and all that time
you'll go down if you're using it Lite
about four hours and if you're not using
it very much maybe six to eight now a
really cool thing though is when you go
onto a plane this thing automatically
goes into airport mode and allows you to
be on the plane without to shut anything
down because it does it all itself all
in all great things for those who are
traveling all right so there you have it
folks
now some of the really cool things that
I think about this thing are the way
that you can charge it up so very very
fast being that you can get eighty
percent of a charged battery in 35
minutes by rapid charge is just
incredible that's something that Lenovo
is definitely gonna get a thumbs up from
me because you guys all know when your
battery starts dying you're right and
working on something that's the last
thing in the world you want it to do now
the Lenovo ThinkPad carbon is actually
the thinnest one that's ever come out
and that said it's definitely going to
get an editor's choice here on tech of
tomorrow for the business class
traveling person now obviously if you're
looking for something to play games
and that type of stuff this isn't it but
if you want something that has great
reliability good power for on the road
plenty of battery life great charging
ability and just excellent features all
around the Lenovo carbon x1 ThinkPad is
a serious editor's choice here on tech
of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
