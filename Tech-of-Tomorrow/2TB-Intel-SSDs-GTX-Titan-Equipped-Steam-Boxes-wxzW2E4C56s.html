doing welcome to the Sunday edition of
Tecna Mar we've got some pretty cool
news stories and also an update about
what's going on with the 25 days of
Christmas giveaway so first up all of us
people that are into storage we all love
SSDs because obviously everything boots
faster no mechanical parts runs much
cooler longer life time we just all know
SSDs are the future and we've been
waiting for the prices to drop and for
storage to get better so there's been
great news from the people over at Intel
that's right
intel has released news that they will
be releasing next year to terabyte PCIe
and 2.5 inch SSDs to the market imagine
that so you're gonna have the PCIe SSD
it 2 terabytes and you'll have 2.5 at
that capacity that's pretty incredible
stuff now the first question is what are
the prices going to be on these things
well obviously probably when they first
come out they're gonna ask you for your
firstborn child an arm one leg and
possibly a testicle but you know prices
are falling and dropping on SSD you guys
see it all the time before you want to
you know get a terabyte SSD they were
like thousands of dollars I think there
was a sale on one last week that was
like you know really really low it was
like what 469 bucks during the Black
Friday week so that was just incredible
stuff so if you guys are into this kind
of stuff I know I sure AM this stuff is
coming like usual for all the full
information about this down there below
the like but in the description i will
have the link over on our website WWF
Morecambe i've wrote a full article on
this subject you guys should check that
out now next story up company called
pixel they're releasing their own steam
machine but it's not your traditional
type steam machine we've seen other
people iBUYPOWER came out with theirs
last week it's about $500 it looks kind
of like you know just a standard console
not really what we all envision when we
first heard about the steam machine you
know we thought it's gonna be like a
steam box really small really
compact iBUYPOWER one came out it looks
you know pretty much same size
everything as a consult but now these
people pixel have come with this totally
other unique idea now this thing fits
between your vase amount and your TV
from 30 to up to 17 inch TVs you can
stick this thing right behind your TV so
check it out
slides back behind your TV to access it
it has actually a sliding port that
slides open so you can see all of the
parts inside and change them around now
the thing about this though is this
thing's totally really like a PC sure
it's gonna run that Linux OS and you
know that we're gonna have for the you
know steam OS coming out it's gonna run
that Linux kernel but this thing will
also run any other OS there is you know
except for obviously Mac but it's going
to run you know anything Windows 7
Windows 8 Vista any of those things and
the other ones you want to run and it's
like a PC it's totally gonna be all have
an overclocked i7 you can use a Titan
you can use a GTX 780 that's right you
can use pretty much anything and expand
this thing out and make an extremely
badass computer also has some typical
fans inside of it so you guys can see
the pic totally keeping the thing cool
and keeping it quiet now like always
with this kind of technology there is a
drawback that's right I by powers unit
is $500
this unit is $1,000 so it's pretty damn
pricey because obviously you're buying
well a PC it just hooks on the back your
TV widget itself is a unique idea for
those who have the cash now the last
story of the day now we all know young
kids are coming up and there's a lot of
things going on in school and they're
trying to gear a program to get it where
every kid in school can learn
programming from a very young age it's
called one hour of code and the spirit
of computer science education week code
org is launching the hour of code
Computer Science Education Week from
December 9 to the 15th
it's an annual shout out to the birthday
of Admiral Grace Hopper a pioneer in
computing the hour of code is basically
a one-hour introduction on how to learn
code which means
all these young minds thinking all these
young minds going and get them into
programming which i think is really cool
if they already had programming when I
was a kid I'd be much farther ahead of
the curb than I am now I would be here
you know doing my little spit I'd be out
there designing something you know maybe
making some big dollars you know but hey
that's it man those are the top three
stories a week really cool stuff I'm
really glad that young people are gonna
be getting involved and getting things
that will help them be educated in the
future because hey those people one baby
taking care of my old ass you know when
I'm footing around in a wheelchair or
something so weekly announcement of the
giveaway you guys all now we're having
25 days of Christmas now I want to
change something about this the shipping
