asking where we do our at how we do
it this is basically the lab of
motherboards out or in tech of tomorrow
so let's start off right here this is
test station number one I've got an old
thermaltake case right here this is the
rolls azar case it's totally completely
a refrigerated cool case this is we do
all our writing we're going to look now
the desk area you guys can see so this
is where Brian Ramirez myself for my son
Aaron Williams is where all the reviews
are writ we have all of our stuff on
there are Dropbox on there we even got a
little thing up there were little camera
thing where you can actually talk and
talk your reviews if you so choose now
moving on we're gonna go up here the top
up here we've got one of our main
monitors this is for hooking up
different systems on the ground level so
if you want to bring in a system and do
some testing on or do repair we use that
you guys can see that some of our
sponsors stuff up on the wall
coolermaster gigabyte you can see that
up there we have another station for
mono right here where right now we just
have some good old arctic silver and a
nice big tube kicking it then we're
going to move down right here now this
platform right here this is our LGA 2011
platform this is where we've been doing
all of our current SSD testing some of
our video card testing and we're
actually going to be jumping in and
doing some more liquid cooling stuff on
the LGA 2011 platform pretty cool stuff
and we're going to move down a little
bit more you want to see down the floor
right here this is our server we play a
few games on there not that many anymore
but we still play game so when I go and
play a game this is our server I'm going
to pop back up we have another test
station area here this is an additional
14 actually doing ground testing which
is being systems on the ground or going
to the server either one we're going to
move back we have another monitor the
monitor up here this monitor is used for
the last test station this is the LGA
1366 platform this is where did all of
our current and before video card
testing we're kind of moving past that
moving at all the LGA 2011 but she's
still here getting ready to move on so
in all of these things basically though
we have thermaltake power supplies
thermaltake uses provides us with all of
our power supplies most of our cases are
keyboards sometimes use some different
stuff if we get it but that's our main
sponsor so guys this is me I work Ferris
your home
on both motherboards on ready to take
them tomorrow and this is actually our
test lab we actually have one additional
thing our shelf over here which is like
full of goodies this is like all the
tests parts and stuff we've got stuff to
like turn on cases tools system or video
cards lots of memory this is raw stuff
globes in fact we starting to get a
gigantic collection I don't ask why of
freaking couple days everybody wants to
review their thermal paste these days
trying to come with the way to review
thermal paste don't win to the best way
to do that but we're going to try so
that's it guys you guys seen it this is
where we test this we're basically all
the magic happens here if you're seeing
custom cases built like that that's
usually done by Brian Ramirez or if
they're done additionally they're done
over at Anthony Reynolds our other techs
house so thanks for watching guys has
been basically the hey the tour of the
tech of tech of tomorrow see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
