tomorrow welcome to my 2016 setup to
now just to clarify with you folks you
guys already saw my gaming setup this is
actually my setup for shooting so let's
start out with the desk now this thing's
from Ikea and it's called the Alex and
one of the great things about it is it's
great cable management and that badass
monitor you see back there that is an
Acer predator 27-inch monitor with a
2560 by 1440 resolution it has great
features but the really cool thing about
it for this is that it matches are built
completely with that red bottom that
just adds ambience to the setup and
right about now you folks out there in
the audience are probably going Elric
where is the PC well it's there it's the
eye view of cyber PC now this is a
compute stick that goes right in your
HDMI port and it's operated by this
little gadget here and it's so small you
can't even see it which is exactly what
we wanted for this new set up now this
is just the set up tour but if you guys
want to see a full video of this little
guy smash that like button as far as the
audio goes I've got a great set of audio
engine a2 plus speakers now these things
are limited edition red and they totally
go with that predator monitor now you
guys might notice that right now these
speakers aren't hooked up but we want to
find out the absolute best way to hook
them up to our comp you stick so if you
guys got any ideas at all here's your
time to interact and leave a comment
down below with your idea and last but
not least for you folks out there or
wondering hey man where did you get that
really cool lighting system well the
lamps themselves they came from Ikea but
the lighting system is the Philips hue
system and the really amazing thing
about this is completely mind controlled
through my mind and to the power of my
mind you can see I'm changing the colors
no I'm just kidding it's from done off a
smart device but hey it's a great idea
and the cool thing about it is on the
fly you can changed absolutely any color
you want set up groups and control all
the lights in your house all to your
smart device other than that I don't
know if you guys happen to see it but
we've got some cool stuff on the wall be
behind me over here on this side I've
got Thor's hammer coming out of the wall
all the way to the far side I've got the
Death Star that's right baby the Death
Star coming out of my walls so I'm at
work thanks for watching taking tomorrow
like usual will have a link to all this
stuff down below where you guys can buy
this stuff and change it around and make
your setup area ultimate as well
peace out we'll see you guys back here
