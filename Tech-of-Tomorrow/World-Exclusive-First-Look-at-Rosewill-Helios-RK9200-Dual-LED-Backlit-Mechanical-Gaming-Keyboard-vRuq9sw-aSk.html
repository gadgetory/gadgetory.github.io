tickle tomorrow we do all the tech all
the time and today we have something
ahead of the game that's right we've got
a world first exclusive here why do we
have it well first of all we swing over
winter to Rose will when we kidnapped
Chinni their product represented because
you said they were gonna have some new
products now we should only had one of
my hand they have more than one coming
out by the way but I stole this one this
is the Helios arcane 9200 supposed to be
the world's first dual it keyboard
coming in a price at about a hundred and
nineteen dollars it's fully mechanical
supposed to have cherry MX blue switches
inside of it you guys can see when I had
behind me it's not even market released
that's right so let's unbox this thing
take a look at it and when they're going
to do the full release at CES will be
there as well but right now let's look
at the product alright folks you guys
can all see right now to stay plain
white box nothing from roseville is
probably actually the very first sample
that they've gotten across the seas and
that said I'm bringing it to you folks
first so we're going to check this
little bad boy out take my trusty little
knife here by the way I guys you can
always ask so this knife here today
we're using is the SWAT knife so you
guys want to do that you can go out and
find on the internet just type in Swat
knife a lot of them come up this one's
actually pretty cool i got it for about
15 bucks so let's see if we can start
opening this lamp without the destroying
the box too much as you guys know me
Oliver I'll just go crazy and destroy
the box if I have to but I don't think
they want me to do that because they
want to take it and show it the show so
there we go so let's just pull it out
and we'll go slowly over this thing
alright see the power cable all right
about moving the box all around folks
I'm getting all crazy here let's get out
of the way alright so first off let's
take a look at the cable it's actually
pretty long I don't the camera you can
actually stretch that far but i'll try
to pull the thing away it's really long
does it say the least its pretty long
got dual gold connections on each end
gold plated here gold plated here now
this is the power one it's going to go
into the back of the keyboard I'm sure
going to find one of those around here
so we'll just start off right there on
the back you can see it's completely
clean we've got a single port will go
and just plug this in let's go to the
bottom you can see there's two little
flip switches right here to adjust the
level the keyboard it's been okayed okay
so now let's flip it around the front
get the camera to zoom in on the
keyboard itself will start start off
over here you guys have seen keyboards
before as far as just like the look it's
pretty simply laid out cherry MX blue
now i'm going to go ahead and plug it in
turn my system on so you guys can see it
so now we're powering on the roads will
read Don over here I've plugged it in
you guys can see the first power lights
have all come on so Jenny before we let
you go do I need a driver is it all
automatic no driver alright folks so
there you have it now all of the color
lights and all that stuff we'll be
plugging it in at CES and giving you
guys a full demo there they've asked a
little bit of hold on about that but at
least they let us show you the product
which I thought was pretty cool so we
have the very first look at this Helios
you know pretty cool RK 9200 it's going
to have dual lights the WASD keys are
all going to light up green as well as
these you'll be able to choose from five
different color schemes on the keyboard
but we'll get to that because actually
today is our last day of filming here in
California we're off to Vegas where me
and the team will be shooting at CES
daily to bring you guys videos starting
on Wednesday morning Monday and Tuesday
were busy in meetings so that's it make
sure you guys hit that like button show
