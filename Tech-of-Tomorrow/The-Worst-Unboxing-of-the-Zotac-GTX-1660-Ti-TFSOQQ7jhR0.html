entry-level Turin card has hit the
market now for you folks out there who
follow the channel I released a video
actually about a week ago talking about
all the specs and all the stuff and
actually that video panned out to be
pretty much true pretty much all the
specs and things that I released are
pretty accurate to what the cards are
being released today where there's no
three gigabyte version that I've
actually you know seen or heard about
yet they didn't even talk about in the
briefing but we do have the six gigabyte
version right here in front of me this
is the zotac gaming edition and one
thing about this car is it's very very
small it only needs a 450 watt power
supply so what that said though let's
jump in let's do the unboxing and then a
little bit later on today we'll have the
full video with all the scores and all
that wonderful stuff for you so let's go
ahead and let's uh let's take it out of
the box shall we so we have it the front
of the box pretty simply just has the
nomenclature what's going on with the
card
this is otech gaming edition gtx 1660 TI
with six gigabytes of gt-r six memory
192 bit memory interface 450 watt power
supply requirement here's the back of
the box not too much there either
nothing much on the sides a little bit
of stuff here on the side of the car
that's pretty much it not a lot to look
at that's pretty much it as far as that
goes now let's go ahead let's just see
what actually comes in the box I'm
thinking there's not going to be too
much it's going to be coming in here
anyways just because it's an entry-level
card so hey like I said open it up right
on top right here what have we got here
incident it's just some more paperwork
talking about their mech systems and
stuff like that so it's just got some
paperwork and there's some advertisement
and stuff like that not too much there's
no actual driver in the box we actually
had to download the latest beta driver
from the Nvidia site to do these testing
so there's that and then there's that
and there's this and there's nothing
left in there whatsoever alright hit him
right in the head that time I did and I
got him I got him so take it out of the
anti-static bag right at the front we're
gonna see there's two nice little fans
here and
guys can see this card is very very
small it's gonna fit in even microwave
TX cases no problem whatsoever
you can see all of the cooling fins and
everything underneath that all those
aluminum heat fins and all that stuff
down there and EB hime there on the back
of it you're going to see there is no
protection whatsoever
obviously it's in trailer cards they're
trying to save money I believe this card
is going to come to market at about 200
and something $229 I believe is what
this card is going to come to market on
so it's not going to be very expensive
it's really small
pretty simple on the back side you just
see more of those heat fins and as far
as monitor hookups go you get it up to 4
monitors in this card we have three
display ports in a single HDMI
connection alright tech fans so there
you have it the unboxing and first looks
of the brand new low tech gaming edition
gtx 1660 TI card that's right we'll have
a link down below if you want to find
out more information stay tuned we only
actually receive the card yesterday
afternoon so we barely even had the card
like seven or eight hours literally so
bear with us we'll have the full review
coming up in just a couple hours love
all the scores and see how this competes
against its fellow AMD cards in the same
price range so I'm a lark you've been
watching tikka tomorrow hey if you like
the channel like what you see please sub
we'd love to see you back here we have
lots of links to our music all that
stuff that you can check out and in hey
check it out if you do not have your
notifications turned on you won't be
notified about what's going on and see
the new videos peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
