you here once again now today's video is
pretty much our build in the corsair 500
d case but we did something really cool
we actually tested it did a full
building it and made a time-lapse video
showing anthony putting the entire
system together which is actually pretty
cool so this particular system i want to
state right off the bat it's about
fifteen hundred dollars i have all the
fans on it right now turn up to full
blast so you guys can even why we're
filming how loud it is so if you're
building a system your name wall how
loud are those ll fans okay well this is
how loud they are they're really really
nice fancy they're complete RGB and even
when you turn them up on full blast they
work pretty doggone well if this is
inside of my room with me i wouldn't be
complaining i mean oh my god turn those
fans down and you guys know how some
systems are any of the fans turn full
blast
you can't even barely hear yourself
think unless you were on headphones this
is the full-on
now this particular system is based on
an AMD build so it's pretty much AMD as
much as possible no i didn't use an AMD
SSD or AMD memory but the cpu the
motherboard all the basically heart of
the motherboard is all an AMD build it's
a 2600 x the system looks really really
nice the attention to detail and the
build and everything is really really
cool i think you folks are really gonna
like it but with that said though let's
jump in let's check out the parts then
let's check out the time-lapse video
check out those scores and at the end of
the day why even though this doesn't
cost 1500 bucks there's still a lot of
room that you guys can do for upgrading
and making this system even better than
it is today so let's jump right in the
corsair obsidian 500 d is a mid tower
case that features smoked tempered glass
on both the front and back and you can
open these very easily just pop them
open and close and they all work off
magnetics so it's really effortless to
open and close the windows
it also features aluminum trim the
entire inside of the case is really nice
and smooth and as you guys will see
later on the video doing cable
management this particular case is very
easy as well the power supply is
completely covered by a shroud there's
plenty of room inside of it for
different radiators different fans it's
got just enough room to fit pretty much
like the maximum sized parts that you
can get and if you want to use an
aftermarket cooler between the mother
bored and the window there's just enough
room like I said to put in just about
any part out there for the motherboard I
wanted something that was really nice
but yet something that wasn't going to
be in the three hundred four hundred
dollar range making this system just
completely excessively priced so I chose
the Asus prime x4 70 Pro this is an AMD
rising 2 board am4 technology you can
use ddr4 all that good stuff at
overclocks pretty nicely as well all in
all for 155 bucks this is a very solid
motherboard and I've had no issues with
it whatsoever the AMD Rison 520 600 X
processor it actually came with its own
Wraith cooler but I decided that you
know I really didn't want to use the
Wraith cooler I want to use something
just a little bit better even though
those work really nice I'm not knocking
it I wanted something that just had a
little bit more oomph
now this particular processor about 225
dollars right now but if you're looking
for a really high-end AMD processor one
that has six cores and twelve threads
it's completely unlocked it has a
maximum frequency boost of 4.2 gigahertz
all in all this is a really really super
powerful CPU that can be used for gaming
for editing all kinds of stuff and the
price really isn't that bad and on
Amazon it's actually one of Amazon's
best selling processors and an Amazon
choice product like I said I wanted to
have a cooler that was a little bit
better than the stock cooler how much
better I really don't know but I just
wanted to experiment around with the sky
fula now this is the revision B of this
particular cooler it's about $50 it
features a dual tower design this helps
increase the heat dissipation and it
actually doesn't more effectively by
helping dissipate that heat all away
from your CPU and then blowing it out
with those fans now the sky it came with
two of its own fans but we modified that
design we took the fan out of the middle
we placed that on the outside and the
middle we put a really nice ll corsair
fan featuring RGB technology this helps
dissipate and get the air away from that
hot CPU the memory we use in this build
is the Corsair Vengeance LP X 8 gigabyte
kit do you guys all know that memory is
pretty expensive right now
and this particular kits about a hundred
and twenty-six dollars I know don't hit
me I know it's really expensive from
memory but you guys know that right now
memory really is at a premium
this is ddr4
200 when you go inside of your biases
particular motherboard you just sent it
to that speed and you're good to go
I'm the AMD motherboard doesn't have XMP
profiles directly but when you set it it
just works at that speed automatically
making it really simple to set up inside
of this system you guys will see there
are a lot of fans and so we chose the
commander proof from Corsair to control
these fans and it integrates really nice
this particular case the only caveat
about this particular product is it is
$65 but it makes managing all the cables
hooking everything up and controlling it
a breeze and this can all be done to the
Windows environment as well
so if we're you're inside your Windows
environment you want to change some
stuff you just click some buttons and
hey you can change anything you want to
the speeds like you want most of the
fans inside of the system are the
coarser ll series ll 120 RGB fan these
are 120 millimeter dual light loop RGB
fans they're really really quiet they
can come in a 3-pack and you can get
three these for about $80 I have to tell
you folks though these fans even turn to
full blast as you guys can see in the
video are really quiet so if you're
looking for something that not only
looks good can move a lot of air and not
produce a lot of noise
these fans are really nice I know they
cost a few dollars more but I think
they're worth it and controlling all of
these fans and everything is done
through the corsair link software which
you guys can download and install on
your system really simply the power
supply we use this build as the C Sonic
prime AirTouch 850 gold power supply now
this is a fully modular power supply and
one thing really nice about this
particular power supply is on the back
there's a button where you can change
the fan speed so if you're doing a lot
of gaming and you feel your system's
getting hot you can adjust the fan
speeds all the way up to pretty much
loud and this particular fans on the
power supply get even louder than those
ll fans when it's turned on full-blast
so you know that that power supply is
getting really really cooled it's about
a hundred and sixty dollars has a great
warranty great fan it also has a self on
tester and a 12 year warranty which is
really killer the boot drive in this
system is something really really
unbelievably cheap it's an SSD 120
gigabyte SSD that's only $25 and if you
want to get a 250 gigabyte model it's
only $42 now this is
the inland professional 120 gigabyte say
two three six gigabyte a second 2.5
internal solid-state drives a mouthful
right 120 gigabyte SSD pretty fast
speeds a decent warranty and a price
that's only a 25 bucks for the storage
drive and for playing all the games I
chose the Seagate 2 terabyte Barracuda
Drive now these particular drives 7200
rpm drives they're very fast they're
reliable they're not quite as fast as
the fire Cudas which are kind of a
combination of an SSD and a hard drive
but they're really well known it's a
solid drive and it's under $60 currently
$57.99 and another Amazon choice product
video car prices have been skyrocketing
up and down and we did this build we
chose the gigabyte ARS Radeon rx 580
card this is an 8 gigabyte card it's
currently under $300 so it's a really
nice price card it still plays games
good obviously if you're gonna get the
latest video cards from them they're
gonna play games a little bit better but
hey the 580 is nothing to snuff at
especially the 8 gigabyte version ok so
those are all the parts and the parts
themselves are about for $200 the reason
I said $1500 that some people out there
get really picky if I don't include the
Windows software and to get Windows 10
Pro is about a hundred dollars making
the system about $1500 like usual though
you can make some different part changes
inside of this system you could
sacrifice some or get something
different there's all kinds of different
parts out there but with that said
though let's jump in and let's check out
Anthony putting this system together in
a time-lapse video and seeing how all of
this comes from a bunch of separate
parts on a table into the nice system
you see here before you so first off
after we've gotten all of our parts
together and we know exactly we're going
to put inside of the build the first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to mount the CPU on to the motherboard
this is a pretty easy process we'll be
having a video later on showing you guys
exactly how to do this in more slow
motion so you guys can take advantage of
that but after that it's just installing
the CPU on the motherboard then
installing the cooler and then after all
that stuff has done it's now ready to be
stuck inside the system so let's move
over and let's start preparing the
system for the build
first up we're gonna entirely gut the
Obsidian 500d and the reason that we're
gonna do this is once you've got the
entire system out it makes it much
easier and cleaner to start putting all
the parts back inside of it this only
takes a few minutes and as you guys can
see once everything's outside of the
system it's really easy to get back into
and put those parts back first we're
going to install all of the front intake
fans these are all really nice Corsair
fans and they all feature RGB in fact
all of the fans used in this build today
are all RGB fans you get lots of
lighting options
before we put the rest of the fans in
we're gonna install the power supply
figure out where all its different
wiring goes all the different
connections you guys can see the power
install installs in the 500d under the
back into the bottom and it also has a
shroud that completely covers it so once
the power supply is installed you can't
see it whatsoever
the 500d has ample room in the back of
the case to install your SSDs and your
hard drives and here you guys can see
that we're mounting the SSD back there
and there's also plenty of room back
there to work with so when you do your
cable management later on in the bill
you'll see that there's just enough room
in there for you to get everything in
there nice and snug and still get the
cable management looking good earlier we
showed you guys installing the CPU onto
the motherboard installing the heatsink
and then installing the memory and all
that stuff but now we have to install
all those parts inside of the system now
installing the motherboard inside the
case isn't really all that hard
especially when you have a nice case
like this all the offsets that on the
back of the case make installing the
motherboard really simple and then once
you put the motherboard inside of there
then comes the real kind of tricky part
of connecting everything on it and
making sure at the end that all that
stuff works that you've just connected
it's a lot of wiring believe me
now starts all of the cable stuff and
like I said the cable management is
where I think our builds really do shine
we have excellent cable management due
to mr. Anthony he's really good at this
he's been doing it a long time he pays
attention to detail he takes his time
right now he's hooking up the Corsair
commander to all the lights and all that
stuff the Corsair commander it actually
controls all the different lights inside
the system we didn't use the onboard one
that came with the case we actually used
the commander we just think that one
gives more options all around so that's
the one that we installed now earlier I
told you guys about installing the hard
drives in the back of the case and had
there was ample room inside of the case
for doing all that cable management as
you guys can see is he meticulously goes
through and does all this stuff all of
the cable management starts to come to
fore tation in this video I know it
seems really really fast and I keep put
this whole computer together in about
five minutes but this is actually a
couple of hours of time just condensed
down so you guys don't get totally bored
watching our long videos if you really
like to see a video that's not you know
not in a time-lapse like this and you'd
like to see the full event of it let us
know and we can make a video and we can
do that it just be a very very long
video because this does take quite a bit
of time to do properly next up we're
going to install the video card make
sure it's all in there make sure it's
not sagging also you want to make sure
when you're installing the power supply
and getting all that cable management
stuff that you definitely have the right
leads for your video card so if you need
to eight pins or you need to six pins or
an eight and a six you got to make sure
that you leave those connections open
and if you also plan doing crossfire or
SLI later down the line you want to make
sure you leave all those lines out and
available to you so that you're not try
to dig it out once the systems built
could trust me getting to the power
supply and doing all that once the
systems completely built can be a real
pain in the butt so when you're doing
your build make sure you know what
you're going to the future if you don't
plan on doing SLI you don't plan on
doing crossfire then obviously that
isn't meaning to you and just make sure
you have that you know the wiring out
for one video card
finishing up the cable management is
where it gets really meticulous because
you've got to make sure that you wrap
everything together you've got to lock
it down you got to make sure that it all
fits in the backpack there that it
doesn't look all messy and that the
airflow through your system is
completely clear which means there's
nothing just lying around in there you
know causing airflow restriction I know
some people say oh it really doesn't
matter but I feel having the cleanest
air flow path possible is the absolute
best thing that you can have in your
system
after the cable management's done it's
just a matter of putting all the parts
back onto the outside of the case and
getting it ready to put windows on
you have to admit this system looks
really bad ads it's a very
well-put-together system it's nice clean
lines it's very beautiful but hey looks
are just one thing how does the system
perform well let's check it out
one thing kind of interesting you guys
will notice is that the cpu maximum
temperature was 71 Celsius and the video
card was 72 Celsius so there wasn't very
much of a difference between the AMD cpu
and the AMD GPU which is kind of pretty
interesting the rest the scores are
really nice you guys can see if you want
to install a better video card you want
to get your self of Vega thirty-six or
Vegas 64 obviously you could do that and
that's one of the nice things about this
system is that you can upgrade it and
change into whatever you want because
life is about options
alright tech fans so there you have it
our build inside of the Corsair obsidian
500 d case and you got to admit she sure
looks absolutely nice all of the scores
in this particular system are really
right on par what they should be like I
said earlier in the video you have the
options of changing out the video card
the CPU I don't really think there's any
reason to really upgrade the CPU right
now I mean 2700 X a little bit higher
but this is really really close and you
guys can see it runs really well so if
you're a streamer somebody who plays
games all that type of stuff obviously
this is gonna be a really nice system
and I have to say that even though the
system's air-cooled only getting 71
Celsius is the maximum temperature when
the system's under full load is still
pretty cool so the CPU cooler is working
really nice previously we'd used a
wraith core and believe me it was a
little bit hotter than this so paying
that extra 50 bucks I think in the end
is worth it to get that you know
aftermarket CPU cool that just works
that wee bit better and putting that
Center fan in between them gives you
just more airflow which helps dissipate
that heat helping to keep that CPU
running really cool video cards hey they
are what they are prices have been so
crazy lately
you never know where they're gonna be
really high or really low but if you
want to add just like another 150
dollars to this or $200 you can get all
the way up to a Vega 56 making the
system about sixteen hundred dollars
probably seven hundred dollars at the
max but then you get all this really
cool stuff like I said RGB fans are
really easily controlled inside by the
slink software the commander Pro it
makes hooking all this stuff up together
you guys saw the cable management how
that all went together using the right
parts even sometimes you know when the
parts
cost a few Duckett's more sometimes make
the difference between a system that's
totally cool and really awesome looking
or a system that has a bunch of cables
lagging around or just looking messy you
guys can see this bad boy does not have
any messy cables whatsoever on it
anywhere it runs nice it performs nice
it's quiet
if you like this particular build hey
you can do one for yourself or choose
whatever parts you want to exchange it
or not to make it your personal build
I'm Elric like usual
we will have a link below to all these
different parts if you're not sub to the
channel I ask hey please sub and if you
don't have notifications turned on hey
make sure you do that as well also if
you'd really like to support the channel
we have patreon going on as well you can
chip in a few bucks and just help techo
tomorrow keep Tekin beasts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
