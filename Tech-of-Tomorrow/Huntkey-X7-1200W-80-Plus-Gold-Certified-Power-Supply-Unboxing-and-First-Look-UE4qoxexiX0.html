you by the gaming deal of the week for
fans of Mass Effect if you like an RPG
that's the first-person shooter and
everything all mixed in one Mass Effect
just may be your cup of tea get mass
effects 2 for less than $8 this week on
Amazon check out the link in the
description below don't miss this one
Hey glad to see you back here once again
on tech of tomorrow you guys know who I
am and today we're going to show you a
product that hasn't quite hit the lovely
shores of the USA yet but it is for sale
in other parts of the world where a hunt
Kia actually it has a name they're
trying to make their break in to the
United States right now and so we're
gonna help them do that by introducing
one of their products today we're gonna
look at their 1200 watt power supply has
a five-year warranty and is 80 plus gold
now there is better there's 80 plus
platinum but this is a really good power
supply ring what this means is that it's
rated its efficiency is golden rated
there's a lot of charts out that I'll
show you all the differences in them but
basically what it means is that this
runs at a certain performance level for
a certain amount of time and it's
guaranteed to be doing that so 80 plus
gold is pretty cool
now hunt key they make all kinds of
weird stuff they make car chargers they
make laptop adapters they make power
supplies I mean these guys are kind of
really trippy they're kind of like the
Rosewill of Asia you know when they're
not owned by Newegg obviously have their
own going on so let's take a look
inside this box let's check out this
power supply see what it looks like and
folks I've never used this product
before many of you probably haven't
either currently like I said it's not
available in the USA but you people in
Europe you guys can readily buy this
power supply and if you use this before
I would really appreciate hearing your
comments because me i'ma hunt key virgin
that's right in fact they should just
change the H to a C and then it actually
be a really good key you know I'm saying
everybody can use one of those but all
right let's jump in let's check out the
box and I mean you know what I don't
have a knife hold you so on a second
I've got something though let's see you
guys might have seen this before
miles scimitar right here yes sir check
that out
so let's give you guys a little tour of
that first let's just have the camera
zoom up here take a look the handle
there you can see it's got the mighty
Marty dragon on top or c7 right a cumin
ketchup with two more heads down here
because three heads are better than one
so we get down to the blade let me go
for the cameraman chop
nice little thing right here knock off
you're getting too close man I got a
personal comfort zone you guys are right
inside of it right now so mellow ah all
right so here go hunt key power your
dream like we said five-year warranty
this is the ex 7 Series 1200 watt power
supply so the sportsman SLI and
crossfire no problem at all has a little
future mark thing on here future mark
corporation which is kind of weird cuz
future mark actually does bench testing
for your own video cards and stuff like
that in your PC so there's that Rob will
actually take a look at the box these
guys have some interesting features on
it so all right away take that once
again so the cameramen he loves that
sorta why we love you all right so here
we go from the box spin around near now
Cameron I want you to zoom in over here
because these are some of the very
important things about this power supply
now whether I've heard them or not it
does look like these people have a good
design going on we'll just start up
right here interleaved PFC improves the
efficiency and stability 105 C Japanese
capacitors special plus 12 volt 3 plus 6
output 4 PCIe which means you have a lot
of power for your video cards
phase-shifted full bridge compared with
the traditional circuit design the DC
output of the PS PSU is more stable so I
guess is phase-shifted something to do
with how the power is regulated it's
going to make it run better 12 volt
supply line copper plate design runs the
system well under high loading so that
means if here we've got the system being
you know pushed it'll actually go a
little bit farther than that once again
we see this 105 C Japanese capacitor and
secondary part DC DC converter solid
capacitor something called adopt the
large inlet the system with hunt key
power is good running even an
overloading current so it's saying that
even if you do overload this thing
passed the 1200 Watts it's still going
to be running glass epoxy circuit board
with two layer circuits good performance
and stability and reliability
the system with hunky power supply
performance well running in the extreme
condition so over and over then they're
just repeating they use a lot of good
parts and the things it's gonna run like
a truck that's what they're
saying so all this stuff over here I'm
not gonna bore y'all with it the camera
can zoom in there you guys can just see
it and they'll move on and actually take
a look at the unit like I said before
folks I'm totally new to this company so
I don't know much about them so I try to
give you as much information as possible
pop the box boom wait camerman zoom in
over here actually this thing looks
pretty damn cool let's go ahead and pop
it look at that
whoo-wee check that out a lot of good
information right here you guys can see
it's semi modular explains all the
routing the cables there go ahead and
set that back oh wow all right now you
guys love braided cables and you guys
said you didn't like the flat braided
cables whatsoever so you guys will
probably like these check these out
they're not exactly parachute braids but
they're really cool anyways lot of
different power connectors on here these
are all ones for your SATA I'll go ahead
and set that off to the side this is for
your molex floppy not many people use
the floppy anymore but there are some
people out there
once again more SATA
two sets of the PCIe so you can run two
video cards in SLI or crossfire mode
kubinka bang they got the six plus 8 and
the six right there and they're colored
blue then we have another molex pop that
other way set that over there over here
is the x7 user's manual just some stuff
in there about the usual manual I show
draw a little cartoon characters when I
spin it look like a little story that
would've been cooler I know but hey
hindsight's 2020 now the power supply
has a really unique look it's not
totally unique but also notice the slot
connection this is only for high end
power supplies let's pull this bad boy
out of here the color scheme is really
cool for fans of AMD this is probably
gonna get your wanky all wanking you
want to go fat in the corner right now
this thing's black and red you can see
the hunt key design single fan nice and
shiny fan spin on the side we got some
writing right here probably says x7 in
Chinese if I'm wrong you guys are
Chinese up there to speak Chinese you
can correct me thank you very much
playing ciao alright so here are some of
the specifications once again so it's a
switching power supply very very good
spin that around here's the back now and
they say switching power supply means
that if something the power supply is
going to fail it will switch off tune
the unit and keep the power supply going
that's like a redundant feature it's
really good the button on here actually
looks very industrial to the on and off
button inside you guys can see all the
high quality components and it's
actually pretty heavy for me just to try
to balance in my one hand right here
it's quite heavy so we'll flip it around
the back you guys can see here's where
all the modular stuff plugs in your PCIe
your SATA all the rest of it also here
go the final parts these are all your
power cables right here I'm not going to
unbundle them cuz every power supply has
these all the same they're all here your
22:24 pen eight six a lot of additional
power stuff here so this power supply it
looks like it's geared to run just about
anything has that nice new electronical
smell I like industry
so like I said I don't know much about
hunky guys I'm gonna go ahead hook up to
a system see how it runs I can't really
tell you about you know how long it's
got to run or anything like that it's my
first time seeing it but give me your
opinions I appreciate them and we'll see
you guys back here on tech Oh tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
