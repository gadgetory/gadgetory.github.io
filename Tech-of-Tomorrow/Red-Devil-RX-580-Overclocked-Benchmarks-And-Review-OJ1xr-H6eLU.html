morning and welcome back once again to
Tecna Mar we have a brand new video
launch from the people over at AMD I
know there's some people out there going
to be disappointed because this is in
Vega but Vega will be here it just will
be here on quarter 1 of 2018 this is
basically a Polaris refresh that's right
the technology behind it is the Polaris
20 so it's brand new in some ways but
brie fresh and others because a lot of
things in this card you're going to see
are kind of the same things that we saw
in the 470 and 480 now the 580 which I
have here in my hands this is the new
top-of-the-line dog from the people over
at AMD now like I said I know many
people out there or expecting Vega but
this just isn't Vega so please don't
beat me up for that
I'm not going to releasing the car but
first up we have a power color pretty
much the golden samples you guys can see
of the brand new RX 580 pretty nice card
going to come to market probably
anywhere between $229 and $259 depending
on where you get it I wasn't able to
actually find and nail down the exact
price in this particular card but what
that said here it is so let's jump in
real quick let's check out the card
itself the specs the scores and then
talk about this card and see at the end
of the day is it worth buying a brand
new card or keeping your old card let's
jump in alright folks so here we have it
the power color Red Devil RX 518 you
guys can see this thing permeates the
red and black theme which i think is
cool because those are themes that AMD
is known for so I think it's cool to
keep the card that color why make it
some other weird color just in my book
doesn't matter now the two fans on top
they may look like normal fans but they
actually have two ball bearings inside
of them to make them last longer and
actually has 20% more efficiency than
your standard fans the design also looks
pretty cool you guys can see all of the
heat fins underneath that all that
aluminum stuff keeping this card cool
and just all in all I think it looks
pretty doggone badass now take a look at
the rear of the card you guys can once
again see lots of those alumina heat
fans you can also see the power
connector for the fans there as well now
it's kind of hard to see since the card
hasn't shroud and everything on it but
underneath there there are five heat
pipes along with all those aluminum heat
fans to help dissipate all that heat
away from your card and keep it running
cool take a look at the bottom of the
card you guys can clearly see those heat
pipes I was talking about earlier now
taking a look at the top of the card I'm
the very far left on the top you guys
can see there's a bio switch this is a
switch between the dual bio so if you
burn one out when you're trying to
overclock you can switch back to the
other one keep up and going and then
flash the other once you can be up and
going with that one as well now if we
move over a little bit more to the right
there's also an RGB button this turns on
or turns off your RGB lighting next to
that are the two power connectors this
card requires a single six pin and a
single eight pin power connector and AMD
recommends that you use a minimum of the
600 watt power supply to power this
beast and last but not least let's check
out those outputs there's a single DVID
connection three display ports and a
single HDMI connection the DisplayPort
is 1.4 and the HDMI is 2.0 B now on the
back plate we once again see the Seal of
Solomon on here and it's very tough and
rugged to smack our hands on you know
it's not going to break it's durable it
could probably even kill a camera now we
won't go there all right so that's what
the card looks like now let's check out
the specs the RX 580 features 2300 for
stream processors 140 for TM news and 32
Rob's it has eight gigabytes of gddr5
memory and a 256-bit memory interface
and like I said before the chipset
behind this is the Polaris 20x TX and
just like the RX 480p rx 580 is made in
the 40 nanometer FinFET process now for
those wondering what is the size of this
card well in inches the card is 9.5
inches long and 5 inches high and
features a dual slot design the Red
Devil rx 580 comes overclocked right out
of the box for the base clock of 1340
megahertz and a boost clock of 1425 so
now that we've got past that let's talk
about the test system and the reason
that I use the test system that I did
now most of the time when I test video
cards I usually test on a high end Intel
system that's just the way we've always
been doing things around here but I
figure let's do something different this
time since this card is pretty much in
the budget range of less than $300 I'm
sure people are going to want to see it
tested with a $500 CPUs $600 CPU so why
not use something that's in that range
so we chose to use our
system with the 1600 exit do you guys
want more information about that system
we'll have a link down below but
basically it's a liquid-cooled system
features the h-11 zero cooler by Corsair
that's pretty much the system if you
guys want all more details of both I
want to ramble on about that in this
video you guys can check that out but I
pretty much thought that this system
being that you could put it on a be 350
and there's not too much differences
between the chipsets you could build
your own system around this very very
cheaply and then put this card in it and
be good to go and we've seen that if you
overclock the 16x you can almost get the
same performance that you're getting on
a 1700 X and an 1800 X so why buy those
expensive CPUs when you get the same
performance on the AMD platform with the
1600 X but what that said let's jump in
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
check out if this card does against the
competition
all right so there you have it the RX
580 and all of its glory so I'm kind of
a little bit kind of weird on this card
I mean yes it is faster than the 480 and
you guys can see it even beats in
overclock 1060 and a lot of tests but
the thing about this car that really
trips me out the most though is how much
power it takes to power this damn card I
mean it's got the same recommendation
for a power supply as a 1080i and that's
just really crazy like when I went to go
build my crossfire system and put this
stuff in I put the cards in it went holy

I'm have to get a whole new power supply
to put this in here requires a lot of
power and that to me is kind of the
downfall of the car but something that's
good about the card however it is you
guys can see out of all the tests that
we ran this card runs the coolest out of
them all so that means there's going to
be plenty of headroom in the future to
possibly do some great overclocking on a
release day with everything new the
drivers and all that stuff new I'm not
going to bring me overclock in the table
because you guys all know as the drivers
developed everything around this you
know just gets better the card is going
to get faster the overclocking is going
to get better so I'm going to wait at
least a week or two before I do my
overclocking but if you don't have a
video card out there whatsoever you're a
solid AMD fan this thing does come to
market at cheaper than the RX 480
RX 40 we're seeing it like 269 this card
sells for underneath that for damn sure
so if you're just jumping into the
market for a card I say this is an
excellent card now if you already own an
RX 480 will I go out and just dump that
card and jump into this card I really
don't think I would for one thing like I
said a second ago I'm really not too
happy with how much power this thing
needs taking almost as much power as a
1080i which is a card that's literally
like it's almost twice as fast that to
me is a little bit crazy you will need a
single pen for the 1060 you only need a
single pen for the 480 so that's my
opinion folks like usual we'll have all
the information about this card down
below that like button hopefully you
guys like this video
so all-in-all there it is folks at the
end of the day the Refresh is what it is
it's a refresh I know it's not what you
were looking for it's not really what I
was expecting either but hey AMD's got
to do something until Vega gets here
right so peace out my tech brothers and
sisters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
