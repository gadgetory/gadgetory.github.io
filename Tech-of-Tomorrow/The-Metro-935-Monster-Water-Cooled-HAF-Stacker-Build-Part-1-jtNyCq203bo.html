back once again the tickler wall we're
bringing you all the tech all the time
now for you folks who follow the channel
you guys know that we really like to
build custom systems last year we did
about five or six of them this year we
plan on doing more now the first one
that we're doing this year though is
based off of cooler masters see em
stacker I don't know if you guys know
about this but the CM stacker is
basically a series of cases from cooler
master that can actually be stacked on
top of each other kind of like a
Marshall stack but only for the PC now
you don't have to use all three pieces
we're actually going to we're gonna
split these three pieces into three
different parts of the build now the top
section up here we're gonna put all of
our water cooling solutions and all that
in here we're gonna put the main bulk of
the PC build in the center and on the
bottom we're gonna have all of our hard
drives and all that other stuff and the
name of this build is going to be the
Metro it's gonna be based off basically
Metro theme the yellow and black be the
biggest steam machine is the largest
HTPC you've ever seen in your life
because I'm gonna game on this thing I'm
gonna watch movies on this thing it's
gonna actually sit right next to my TV
in the living room and it's gonna match
up with my Marshall stats now we have a
lot of people involved in this MSI
coolermaster Corsair and the people over
at Swift tech obviously we do our water
cooling with them on our main sponsors
we do have some stuff from primo chill
from Lam Tech and a bunch of other
people but this is basically gonna be
assistant it's gonna be based off of the
i7 4770k it's gonna be based off the MSI
they're our top of the line empower
board it's going to have 16 gigabytes of
vengeance Corsair memory inside the
system it's pretty bad it's actually got
yellow writing on it so it's gonna match
up pretty good we also have a 480
gigabyte SSD from those folks so the
Saints gonna be really bulked out we
bought a Western Digital we have a 2
terabyte hard drive for the main bulk of
the information then now this thing is
also completely water cooled you guys
can see I have a GTX 780 over here this
is a reference model
thanks a lot Dell rizal for that car by
the way and we'll be water cooling that
and everything in the system I think
we're actually probably going to add
another video card as well we're just
kind of getting everything
prepped out right now but you guys can
see the ton of stuff down here now these
new jet flow coolers these are pretty
cool these are a brand new product and
people over at Coolermaster and our tech
anthea Myrtle did something really cool
so check this out you've already done
the first of the mods the fans come
there completely uncovered uncoloured
rather excuse me Anthony has taken these
covered them and painted them all yellow
and when the light actually hits and
goes through these things they look
really really incredible in fact we're
going to use we're gonna sit it out
we're gonna have it inched and on this
we're gonna have the Metro and we're
gonna have tech them tomorrow we're
gonna use a series of lights around the
edge of the case now I don't know if you
guys have seen my amplifiers I use I
have a hughes &amp;amp; kettner ramp and I
actually kind of got this idea from them
because the choosing Kettner's things in
the center and around the outside they
put lights and when you turn those
lights on the whole thing lights up
really really cool so this whole side
panel is gonna light up with a big old
yellow Metro with tech of tomorrow on it
that's gonna be another one of the mods
it's gonna be pretty cool now we've got
lots of stuff as far as the power spot
you see we got a v8 50 over there now if
we actually go ahead and we use another
video car we may change the power supply
up 850 is enough but we may just choose
a different one so some of these things
may change but I would say that pretty
much ninety eight point nine percent of
the stuff you guys all see on this table
is going to be used in the build you
guys see the board power supply video
card tons of Swift tech parts tons of
Swift tech coolers got two of their rads
got two of their pumps I mean we've got
all kinds of stuff here this is from ex
SPC this thing is incredible the
centerpiece lights up this is all made
of solid glass it's really really cool
got more modded parts right here this is
going to be very very nice inside this
system also got a nice thing from lamps
on as well this right here will control
the entire water cooling system I'll be
able to control how fast the pump is
going the fan speeds everything else all
through this little controller now all
of the parts like I said though for this
build will be listed down in the
description below so if some of you
people out there go wow man I really
want to match up that build you guys can
do that as well now we even got some
really cool custom cables these Cobra
cables these things are all custom
yellow and black to match the build so
basically everything in this system will
because
match for color it'll be yellow and
black through and through three separate
things we're gonna bring you the first
series of the build videos very very
soon right now we're just getting all
the parts which we now have and we're
getting ready to move forward on this so
why do you guys are always saying hey
we're looking for the next system
well 2014 is gonna bring a lot of
systems to techo tomorrow when the first
one is this right here this bad boy
metro three cases cooler master stacker
a shit ton of parts I'm just telling you
this is gonna be one badass build so
stay tuned to tech and Amara we've got
lots of more videos coming up for this
build including the final bill we show
