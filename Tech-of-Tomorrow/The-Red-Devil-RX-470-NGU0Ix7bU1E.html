waiting for it and now it has arrived
the brand new AMD RX 470 today we're
looking at the red devil version from
the people over at power color so this
card's coming into market at $199
so you AMD fans out there I think are
really going to love it and people out
there who just want to save some money I
think you'll love it as well so with
that said let's check out the card let's
check out those speeds and feeds and
then at the end of the day let's see if
it's worth your money to buy the RX 470
alright folks so first off let's check
out the card itself and let's just first
off talk about the size of the card so
it's 9.5 inches long by 4.5 inches high
and use the tool slot design just like
all of your video cards that we've seen
out there in the recent market also this
card's very very different than the
reference base cards because in the rear
I oh hey you get yourself a DVI port you
also get yourself three display ports in
a single HDMI port now on top you're
gonna see there are two fans right here
on the front have the Red Devil instinct
yeah Red Devil insignia rather excuse me
in my poor and proper English lair and
these fans are their brand-new blade 3
they offer four times the lifespan of
your normal fans a lot more air pressure
go against the card and there are also
eight heat pipes inside the car excuse
me for heat pipes inside the car to
learning at eight millimeter and to earn
a at six millimeter so you've got a lot
of cooling features underneath this
plastic shroud that you really can't see
along also with all those aluminum heat
fins and everything that help dissipate
the heat away from the card as we put
the card around the side it's kind of
hard to see but there is a dual BIOS on
this car so if you want to do
overclocking and stuff like that there's
a dual BIOS on there so if you happen to
fry one of your BIOS is doing
overclocking you can simply change it to
the other one reflash that BIOS back to
the original BIOS and you're up and
going with the standard BIOS once again
you can all see the red devil logo and
we also see an 8 pin power connector and
the powered ROM this is only a hundred
and twenty watts so that's pretty
amazing only 120 watts are drawn the
card a lot of people out there with low
end power supplies this will be a very
happy thing for them
now once again on the rear plate we see
that ultra-tough thing and once again we
see the Star of David or if you happen
to be Donald Trump you know we'll it's a
sheriff's badge but anyways a card with
Red Devil I think it should actually had
a real pentagram you guys communists let
me hear your comments again because well
it's just kind of strange to see the
Star of David Jewish religious symbol
red devil kind of a mixed bag of tricks
there but anyways now let's talk about
the speeds and feeds and then let's talk
about those benchmarks the RX 470 is
still based on the brand new 14
nanometer FinFET process this card
features 2048 stream processors it has a
base clock of 926 and a boost of 1207 I
think we were saying about 1206 but
we'll get into that later
it also features four gigabytes of gddr5
memory it also features a 256-bit memory
controller and the memory speed is 1750
okay like I told you folks the original
bios that we got from power color still
showed the same numbers as the new bios
they sent us the only thing is is that
everything was locked at 1206 now as
soon as we flashed to the new bios
everything changed as far as numbers
went you can see that everything's
reported correctly we see 1274 the boost
clock everything is correct now the only
real differences we saw between the two
biases were this with the original bios
since it was running at the default
clock speeds that you get an RX 470 at
we saw the temperatures at 69 degrees
hence because everything's cut back as
soon as we flash the bios to the new
bios the temperature actually went up to
79 Celsius and as you guys can see in
the heaven benchmark the gain
percentage-wise was only about 3% so it
really wasn't that big of a deal we'll
have more testing for you next week and
more overclocking with the new bios as
well so that's the card and those are
the specs pretty simple stuff now one
thing I want to mention right now before
we jump into the testing as soon as the
last state came around which was
yesterday my friend mark if we talked
about him before he's over at Babel tech
reviews the last second we got a brand
new BIOS and they said oh this is the
new BIOS so everything that we actually
filmed and tested was that the standard
BIOS that you'd see on a
French card so we'll jump back in again
will retest with the new buyouts which
makes this card a lot faster but the
reason that I read the speeds and feeds
up to you the way that they are is
because this card with the BIOS that's
in it now is actually running at those
speeds as you guys will see we will
retest it once again with the new BIOS
like I said but for now we wanted to
make launch date so we get to you like
it is we're still using the same i7 test
system that we had before we'll show you
guys that right here you guys can check
that out real quick and then after that
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
let's check out the RX 470 in action
all right Tech fans and bands around the
world there you have it I gotta say 199
bucks
competes really really close to the RX
480 and a lower price tag
I think people out there who don't have
a giant power supply they have an older
system where they just want to get some
that's gonna save them one ton of
money the RX 480 is the serious budget
King at this moment I would say that out
of all the cards we've tested lately I
would actually give this one an award
even though the BIOS is kind of messy
and we need to get the new BIOS even as
it is out of the box this card runs
pretty good the car didn't get
excessively hot but there is one thing I
want to mention though with this
particular BIOS overclocking was
completely at a standstill but
overclocking was Mill has been like
pretty much no overclocking but like
usual will be flashing the bios using
new drivers and going back to that and
trying to see if we can get overclocking
results in the future but really at a
hundred and ninety-nine dollars I don't
really think you're gonna expect some
it's gonna be an overclocking Beast this
card is meant to save you money and if
you guys get the Red Devil Edition like
this one it gets all those extra nice
features the better cooling and all that
stuff so hey at the end of the day I say
this is an editor's choice definitely
for the budget market
I'm Elric you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow down below like button which
hopefully will go Bruce Lee style on
we'll have all the information we can
purchase one of these bad boys for
yourself see you back here on the
channel
we've got more overclocking Titan X and
lots of stuff coming your way so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
