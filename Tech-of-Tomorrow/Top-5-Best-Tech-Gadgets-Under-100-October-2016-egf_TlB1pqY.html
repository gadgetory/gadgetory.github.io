me you're always looking for killer tech
of different varieties and we all want
something that's at a good price so
today we're gonna bring you the top 5
that I found that are under $100 well at
least most of them one of them is
actually 103 but don't tell anybody okay
so first up I have the arrow tech
projector spotlight now what this is is
this is a projector that sends a laser
out into your wall or a pretty much any
landscape they say it's for outdoors but
I gotta tell you this thing looks killer
indoors and if you're looking for
something to make your room look just
totally badass you're building that
killer gaming area having something like
this can just take it over the top you
know everybody has that cool desk
they're cool mice they're cool system
but what about cool badass laser lights
that are totally controllable by a
remote control all you got to do is plug
it in find the spot that you want to set
the projector at and you're up and going
now the shots you guys are seeing are
actually on my wall inside of the living
room and you guys can see this is pretty
badass now the only thing I don't like
about it is you only get a couple of
colors to choose from I wish it had more
colors and more things but for the price
that it is I gotta say it's really cool
these guys say it's for outdoors and
stuff but no way this thing can be used
anywhere and it's on a great price right
now for 65 bucks so if you're looking
for something that's over the top and
not only looks killer is something you
can definitely show off to your friends
check out the Aerotech
now this next product you guys really
gonna go hey wow that's really cool or
you're gonna throw rocks at me and say
Elric what in the hell are you thinking
but I'm talking about the Evelyn -
ergonomic wireless vertical mouse now
this is their C series it's made for the
right hand they don't have any lefty
versions right now and what it basically
is is a vertical Mouse it's very very
comfortable I have to say though even
though it doesn't have a whole lot of
button control and it's definitely not
made for gaming when you're using it it
doesn't feel like you're doing anything
at all it pretty much just feels like
you're setting your hand on a table and
basically just moving your hand back and
forth ever so slightly to make it work
so if you're looking for something
that's very comfortable you can work
with it trust me for hours and hours on
end and it will not give you any type of
fatigue in your wrists and your fingers
or anything else so for that type of
thing it's actually really killer and if
any of you people out there have ever
tried it I want to hear you guys
opinions because we actually have others
ranging in price but this one was pretty
much the highest priced out of the bunch
but it's also very very well made the
buttons are well placed like I said it's
very comfortable it slides very easily
and works on any type of surface you
don't even really need a mousepad you
can use what if you want obviously but
it works on every type of surface
including your desk and stuff like that
and the biggest thing of all like I have
to stress though is it is very very
comfortable and if you're gonna be
working for hours on end you want
something that's not gonna give you
discomfort I know that's how I feel I
know so many people out there might
throw rocks say dude what are you
thinking and that thing is completely
beat-up but hey I actually liked it for
workflow now as far as the design goes
on the right-hand side we see two
buttons for control we also see an
adjustable dpi button and then we see a
scroll button now the scroll button
doesn't click that's why I said it's not
really for gaming but it's still good
like I said for workflow and on the
other side we see a thumb rest and then
a button on the top and a button on the
bottom as we flip the mouse on to its
bottom we can see the on and off button
we can see the laser tracker and then we
can also see the signature of the mouse
now this thing comes with a battery but
the only caveat I can see beyond price
is that you definitely have to change
the batteries in this and it's not a
rechargeable unit we've done many videos
in the past featuring active
noise-cancelling headphones you know the
bluetooth
wireless type but the ones that we're
looking at today the ausdom AMC 7s these
are very very nice and they're actually
priced at exactly $100 and they're much
pricier than many of the ones we've
checked out but they're actually worth
it now I'd have to say though out of all
the ones that we've brought in house so
far for the price range these awesomes
are really really nice they're
comfortable they're very well-made they
fit on every head nicely and the comfort
level of them is so nice that you don't
even feel like you're wearing them at
all sound reproduction is very excellent
it's right down the middle and I have to
say that you know many people out there
love the bose type of sound these are
similar to that so if you're a person
who likes that same type of bose sound
it's very similar and the noise
cancellation it's very interesting as
well we were trying it in the house a
few minutes ago we had a gardener
outside and he was mowing the lawn and I
was kind of getting pissed off about it
I didn't want to hear it so Jesus of
well hey put on the headphones and let's
turn on and see what works so I put him
on I turn the noise cancellation on and
actually I could not hear the lawnmower
guy at all
if Jesus raised his voice I could hear
him standing next to me with the
longboard and that type of sound was
completely cut out so I was actually
impressed with that so it does work for
a noise cancellation so if you're on a
plane you got that engine noise that
buffeting of the plane all other kind of
crap going on these will definitely take
that out of the picture the Bluetooth
4.0 technology also allows you to stay
connected to your wireless device for up
to 33 feet the drivers inside the anc 70
feature 20 Hertz to 200 kilohertz
frequency range they also feature a
distinctive carbon fiber design comes in
black and red and also comes with its
own carrying case and accessories it'll
take two hours to charge up to 400
milliamp hour rechargeable battery but
you get to listen to music for over 18
hours of continuous time and you can
leave them sitting for 120 hours on
standby now if you use the anc 7s not
only to listen to your music but you
also use them to answer your phone the
built-in microphone is pretty cool
because it allows you to take your phone
calls and hear them clearly even in
windy or noisy environments and that's
pretty cool and can be necessary a lots
of times most of the controls for the
ANC 7s are located in the right hand
side we have a variety of multifunction
buttons first up we see the button which
is for play pause and answering your
phone then the next is for turning the
volume up or down or
previous song or next song and at the
bottom there's also an audio jack in
case you don't want to use these
headphones wirelessly and just want to
plug directly into your device on the
left hand side we see the microUSB
charging port and we also see the on and
off button for the noise cancellation if
you're in the market for a high-quality
set of headphones that won't break the
bank check out the awesome ANC 7s with
their noise canceling technology their
Bluetooth technology and the sound
altogether combined they're definitely
worth the hundred dollar price tag if
you guys follow the channel you guys
know that I have moved that I've been
searching for different type of things
to not only improve our filming area but
also the ambience of my house in
different areas now this next product
we're looking at is from series road
it's the halo FD a laser now this is
kind of like the product that we saw
before only this one is completely
static you get red and you get blue
colors and they don't move at all they
just show different things on your wall
but if you're having a party or
something like that or you just have
people over and you want to have
something that looks really cool it's
very nice especially like Christmas time
if you have the tree up and all that
stuff this type of product will be
really great
I plan to use as my mom comes over this
year for Christmas I'm gonna have it by
the Christmas tree so when I have all
that set up all of the static thing
going and with no lights on the house as
people all around it definitely sets a
mood now I know this isn't for everybody
but if you're looking for this type of
thing it's pretty cool it comes with its
own remote there are also four light
modes to choose from it's easy to
install you just plug it into power
source and you're up and going the
design features star patterns which can
be projected over a six hundred and
twenty-five square foot surface from
around ten feet away so this is really
really nifty you can also adjust the
light on duration from two four six or
eight hours via the remote control and
you don't have to worry about the lasers
hurting anyone's eyes because they're
completely FDA approved this product
might not be for everybody but if you're
looking to light up your life mmm
something to think about whether you're
looking for quality 7.1 surround sound
audio for your gaming environment or
just a quality DAC to power your
headphones the creative soundblaster XG
5 is an excellent product not only can
this product be taken anywhere that you
want to go on a work with any type of
device it offers very excellent sound
reproduction for even high quality
headphones at
dollar price in my book one of the
absolute best features of the g5 beyond
its native 7.1 surround sound support is
the size of the device the g5 is so
small and so light that you can take it
with you anywhere and it's not going to
bother you carrying it backpack around
for hours on end don't worry about it
it's so light you won't even notice it
and it works with any type of device
like I said before it doesn't matter
whether you have a Mac whether you have
a PC whether it's your portable device
no matter what you have the g5 it'll
power up and you'll get great audio and
you'll get it anywhere some of the other
cool features about the g5 arts built in
class console gaming audio it also
features the sound blaster acoustic
engine pro there's an audiophile grade
headphone amplifier to power any type of
headphones you get the built-in sound
blaster a xx1 audio processor and it has
a backlit volume control with
illuminated volume indicator you guys
can see that x marks the spot as far as
sound quality goes the g5 feature a 24
bit 192 kilohertz audio converter and
they also feature 120 decibel DAC as far
as the display scheme on the front we
see the headphone jack the middle button
is not only the volume control when you
press it it's also the mute button and
then next to that line in for a
microphone on the right hand side the
first button is the Scout mode and if
you're wondering what the Scout button
is basically its proprietary technology
that belongs to Sound Blaster that
allows you to hear your enemies
approaching much sooner than you
normally will so this way you can know
they're coming sooner so you can make
the kill the second button is the sound
blaster button and this also allows you
to have three different profiles for you
to choose from and you can see there's
also on the far right-hand side three
little lights these indicate which mode
you're in and then right next to that we
see the button for gain you have the low
gain and the high gain all the
connectivity for the g5 is located on
the back we see that connectors first
off for your optical luckily a complete
optical cable you also see the USB port
and then right next to that the micro
USB power cable now there is no on and
off button as soon as you plug into the
power you're automatically up and going
and since all the connections are
gold-plated you know that your entire
audio environment is going to be a very
quiet one as well and like I said at the
beginning of the video folks this eye
right now is 103 dollars but normally
it's a hundred and forty nine dollars
and it's simply amazing if you're
looking for this type of product so get
it while you can like usual all the
information for all these parts will be
down there below like button hopefully

damn thing and I'll see you guys back
