planets me elric Ferris here once again
the Tekken tomorrow youtube channel
bringing you guys a pretty cool video
what is that video this is a video of
playing battlefield 3 on entire AMD
based Scorpius system for those of you
who are in the know you know what this
is for those who don't a Scorpius system
is basically using an AMD completely
based platform system motherboard cpu
video card all AMD that said I built one
I'm using the ecs this is their new
990fx a motherboard i'm using the FX
8150 AMD processor 16 gigabytes of ddr3
memory from kingston and i'm also using
a sapphire HD 6970 video card inside the
build all in all pretty cool stuff
starting off you guys who saw the UGK
video that i did over motherboards that
or that's the ultimate gamers kit well
we're gonna start off by checking that
out I just need a big gnarly breed and
I've got the serious person I'm in
trouble not burping through the whole
video it's pretty funny so check it out
this is the thermaltake white keyboard
this is the black white mouse or the
Michael Jackson mouse and some people
called it out there this is it me so
don't get mad at me there's other people
who said that in comment section we've
got these two things there's also
headphones this is the white combat
edition but here's the case down here
you guys can see that it's all really
cool systems all inside and everything
I'll do another video and you show you
guys just a system but today I want to
talk to you guys about battlefield 3 so
that said let's jump in I just basically
just restarted the entire game for the
campaign mode from beginning of the game
because I'm really just trying to show
frame rates I'm not really trying to
show gameplay because overall I'm trying
to see if the Scorpius platform is
actually worth your money to jump into
as a gamer so let's jump in and let's
take a look at these two different
videos okay everybody so here we're
looking on the thing right now you guys
can see I'm change the screen to 1920 x
1080 60 Hertz full score
beams on vertical sync I've turned off
filled the view I've turned all the way
up to 90 it doesn't have it to 100 after
98 jumps back to 60 as far as the
graphics quality though you see I had
everything set on ultra totally set an
ultra and basically the big question now
is is a Scorpius system able to play
this game at full blast with good
resolutions so you guys can see we've
got it locked over here I'm going to go
back into the game and start playing the
game
okay so let's take a look up here in the
corner this it's important gig 35 brain
through second I suny schools even two
years and the deal
so I haven't really dropped I can't
believe you know pay attention totally
with what it's going on over there and
play the game otherwise you guys would
say something like oh you totally suck
so I'm trying my best to do PO but I
personally haven't seen the screens
really drop down be low 30 frames per
second yet it's been pretty much pretty
much steady above that some people claim
they can tell a difference in the game I
never have been able to do any or 30
frames per second you usually play the
game pretty good now get this crazy fool
right here
okay get a little crazy but you guys see
we're still in like 30 frames per second
everything looks really nice couple
my butt
alright still we're like 39 frames per
second so stop and drop below that
this is kind of running around to a
bullshit but we get out here this is
we're all really Canada as long as the
frame speed over 30 frames per second we
get out here into the actual battle then
I'll be pretty satisfied otherwise I'd
say fail you know but this isn't the
ultra old for settings you remember that
as well
alright so here we go I better take
myself some cover before I die
is really great here right now
tell me please
I'm seeing under 30 frames per second
but the gameplay still seems pretty
solid huge fucking guys don't we take
out there's lots of fucking guys around
here pick that guy Lyra well what do you
want that you want them dead just tell
me what you want dead and I kill him huh
he's fucked up friendlies
ok again
oh well anyways it did fall below it
kind of did fall below 30 seconds
sometimes but you know what I'm not
going to call it a fail i'm actually
going to call it a win because the game
still seemed like it was playable it did
slow down just a little bit i know guys
that they're gonna say just get 90
frames per second it to fail but it's
not but anyways me i'll see you fools
later i'm going to jump back in the game
and kill some motherfuckers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
