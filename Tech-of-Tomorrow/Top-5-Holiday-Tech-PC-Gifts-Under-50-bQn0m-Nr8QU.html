everybody's out there looking for that
awesome gift well these ones today are
actually pretty damn actually killer
deals this is the top 5 tech gifts for
under fifty dollars for the holiday
season in 2015 and you just got to see
it
okay so this first one is something that
I got to say I actually like I bought
this particular gift from my mom last
year now this is the 7-inch fire from
the people over at Amazon features eight
gigabytes internal storage it's Wi-Fi
and if you're looking for a tablet just
to like read books surf the internet and
not break the bank check this thing out
man it's only forty nine dollars that's
right under fifty bucks and the fire
tablets they not might be there you know
the most killer you know most powerful
tablets in the world but does everybody
out there actually need the most
powerful tablet think about that I mean
does your mom need a super powerful
tablet cuz your dad who's old they might
not like my mom she loves her fire she
does all of her Kindle books all that
stuff on it she shopped she doesn't
internet shopping she does it all from a
$49 fire what do you think I'm thinking
now this next item is something pretty
cool from the people over at Cindy this
is their Arctic series headphones and
these things are priced at about 27
bucks right now so they're on sale
they're very durable have nice soft cups
inside of them they connect via the old
USB and these things i gotta say are
actually really comfortable when you put
them on your head they don't cause a lot
of stress they're not waitful so they're
not going to like you know weight on
your head and give you a headache and if
you're looking for something that won't
break the bank still do your gaming
still sounds good you might want to
check these out the adjustable band is
pretty cool stuff there any size of head
and pretty much everybody out there as a
computer has a USB port want a no-brain
gift this is it folks I gotta say this
next one kind of confused me because
when I first looked at it and you guys
can see this thing it kind of reminds me
of like a you know like a phaser or
something from Star Trek but it's not
it's actually a product from Microsoft
that's totally geared for the person
who's on the go lightweight now this is
the Arc Touch bluetooth mouse haha gotta
say it's very light very ergonomic it
offers two buttons on top for
controlling and another two buttons in
the center for more control the big
things about this though are how
lightweight and how organ amok this
thing feels in your hand it just feels
good you guys can see there's a little
new sensor on the bottom that's beeping
that's how it tracks everything and I
have to say that this gift is one really
unique thing it actually Ben Folds out
completely straight or folds back has a
very unique thing now picture using a
mouse like that that's so weird it
reminds me kind of a diving board you
know he moves to dive oh but he smashes
in the pool I just kidding but check it
out folks I mean this thing is something
really cool the ark touch is a brand new
product and people over Microsoft and it
offers something that I have not really
seen out there yet and that's this
completely thin design that's totally
ergonomic and hey it's futuristic for
you guys on tech of tomorrow check this
thing out folks this thing is by the
people over an anchor and this is there
Lumos LED lamp now this thing also
doubles as a USB charger and is pretty
cool because it's totally adjustable it
looks really futuristic and it's easy to
turn on just simply hit a button and the
really cool thing is it actually offers
you four different type of lighting
situations you just go down and click
through them and yourself for different
types of light depending on what you're
doing like I said it's completely
adjustable it'll just in all kinds of
different ways it'll go flat you can
raise the bar all the way out it spins
around in a complete circle on the side
like I said it has a USB charger it
simply to use you just plug in this plug
right here and then plug in the wall
charger and you're up and going this
thing's under 50 bucks and if you're
looking for a unique gift that's really
cool I think this is the one and that's
a wrap now last but not least today
folks we have something from the people
over at kissan now this is their dark
night gaming combo and it's pretty cool
because it includes this fully
functional keyboard a mouse pad and a
fully functioning mouse all for under 50
bucks the only thing is though is this
thing is the dark night and that kind of
worries me because like the dark knight
and seem like it's gonna be a trademark
violation on this somewhere down the
road so this might not actually be
around that long but check it out the
keyboard is actually very durable it's
not the actually most highest quality
product in the world but it's not made
cheaply either it's pretty cool
now the mouse also itself is a pretty
cool mouse it offers great functionality
has a scroll wheel in the center cooking
buttons on the side another two buttons
on the left hand side nice and smooth on
the right hand side and once again we
see that the Dark Knight series uh and
honestly the mouse pad Shane so bad
either this is a pretty cool mouse pad
it's easy to roll up it's flat it's
ergonomic and once again it's got the
big old bat in the dark knight on there
so uh for fans out there who love Batman
who want a great product for their
friends or maybe this is one of those
gifts you want to ask your parents for
and say hey that's something I'd like
for Christmas mommy and daddy this might
be something you're going to want to
check out it's pretty durable for under
50 bucks you yourself everything you
need to get up and gaming on your
computer I'm elric you guys been
