the go your choices for superior
performance systems are very niche crowd
but a Zeus has you covered
however pricey they may be known for
overclocking in high-performance asus
has teamed up with nvidia to bring forth
the g series notebooks here to satisfy
the needs even the most demanding gamer
chock-full of features the Asus Republic
of gamers g7 51 jy is the latest in a
lineup of gaming notebooks bringing
g-sync technology into the portable
market
what's up fans i'm Elric welcome to tech
tomorrow and today we're taking a quick
preview of the brand new Asus
Republic of gamers g7 51 jy gaming
notebook let's check this out
those familiar with the red and black
theme of the Republic of gamers will
find that same thing permeating here and
the G 75 jy looks sleek and ready to
rumble the rock g7 51 retains the f-22
Raptor inspired lines found in the
previous generation G Series notebooks
and the air vents on the rear all look
like something found on a fighter jet on
one side of the G 751 jy you get a
blu-ray enabled DVD RW a two on one card
reader and a pair of USB 3.0 ports as
well as the Kensington lock the other
side has the power adapter port LAN port
VGA out HDMI Thunderbolt port another
set of USB 3.0 ports dual headphone
jacks and a mic in Jack with the
clamshell clothes the g7 51 is a
futuristic look sporting the a Zeus and
Rob Lowe goes both but when you open it
up you find a really nice backlit
keyboard that when powered on glows red
for easy reading the WASD Keys also
offer adjustable brightness controls the
g7 51 features quick access game keys
and additional program will macro keys
for easy access to steam game recordings
and your frequently used commands for
better control over your game zone the
rod key gives you quick access to the
gaming center dashboard where you can
access system settings and build your
own gamer profile and/or make use of the
four different gaming modes offered
natively on the g7 51 jy when looking at
the open clamshell the 17.3 inch screen
dominates the area and on top of the
screen there is an HD webcam to meet up
with your fellow gamers or
Emily online the screen features a 16.9
IPS fhd 1920 by 1080 anti-glare viewing
experience that also has 178 degree
viewing angle but that is just the specs
of the monitor itself powering that
monitor is a g-sync enabled 4 gigabyte
GTX 980 mobile chipset now this thing is
really cool because it has the G sync
technology which eliminates all screen
tearing now screen tearing happens in
gaming when the refresh rate of a video
card doesn't match that of your monitor
now with G sync technology that's a
completely eliminated problem making
gaming smooth and awesome there are a
few new models coming out on June 24 and
the 1i have features an Intel i7 4720
2.6 gigahertz CPU 24 gigs of ram which
is also gradable to 32 a one terabyte
hard drive for game storage and a 256
gigabyte SSD for your OS and quick
access applications gamers not only want
a great visual experience they also want
a great audio experience and a Zeus once
again brings that to the table featuring
great technology you can take advantage
of the raw audio wizard it's a utility
that allows you to easily select the
ideal audio settings to suit your needs
it also comes with a bunch of presets
for both the gaming and audio
environment
another really cool feature is that the
sub woofer is actually built into the
chassis of the notebook so you get the
stereo speakers and the subwoofer all
inside the notebook and it actually uses
the structure of the notebook itself to
bring that bass to the table so you get
awesome and clear rumbling when you're
playing those games if you're one of
those folks who want to take the gaming
experience beyond the monitor you could
support for 4k 2k via the HDMI output
with the ability to connect high
resolution screens that go far beyond
today's 1080p systems
hey Zeus has you covered and using the
Trinity display technology you can now
output graphics to 3 display
simultaneously via HDMI 1.4 or the main
DisplayPort 1.2 function I know the
gamers also tend to be overclockers you
guys know that ROG always brings that to
the table as well hey Zeus Toro masters
of
real-time GPU overclocking to give you a
performance boost of over 5% an upgraded
PCB design ensures a stable power supply
and features a dedicated three-phase GPU
power design along with updated candle
and capacitors to handle the heat dual
independent CPU and GPU fans adjust each
components needs and work with copper
heat sinks to provide maximum cooling
efficiency but a lot of the cooling is
actually due to the notebooks design
which is really a cool thing sorry the
pun another nifty feature is the g7 51
expels the heat out of the rear of the
laptop allowing the gamer to stay cool
in the heat of battle so what do you
