deals now some of these deals were
actually so hot they've already been
passed up now they have like a bunch of
items they say they're for the PC
builder but few electronics people out

stuff that's on sale I've got a list
over here and i'm going to start from
the second page many of you people out
there rebuilding computers you guys all
know about the antec 300 case this case
is on sale today for thirty-eight
dollars that's over a half price on the
normal case really good price on the

this everyday on all of our systems if
we're not gaming this is the mouse we're
using for gaming this mouth is kind of
crappy but for working and for getting
stuff done this mouse is incredible it's
normally like eighty nine nine nine
dollars $49 today now like I said they
have printers they have windows seven
hundred nine dollars I don't think these
are the real killer deals the real
killer deers are ones like this Kingston

just a little bit lower capacity than I
have in my red dawn system this thing is
an incredible hundred and fifty dollars
that's a really great deal we also have
a sandesh 30 gigabyte this is good for
SRT and for a boot drive this one's
coming to market at thirty nine dollars

guys say that really kicks butt in the
gtx 650ti 90 bucks how the you're gonna
beat that anyways 8 gigabytes kingston
