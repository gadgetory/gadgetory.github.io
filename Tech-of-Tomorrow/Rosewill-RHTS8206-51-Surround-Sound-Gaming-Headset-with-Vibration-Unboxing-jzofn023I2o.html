of tomorrow YouTube channel I know it
first your host and today we're gonna
show you something really cool now this
is kind of a trippy product cuz it's a
5.1 gaming vibration headset from the
people over at Rose well if you guys
aren't familiar with Rose well they're
basically the house brand for Newegg I
know you guys know they'll new a gizze
and this is their house brand what's
really funny though is that these
headphones don't have a name they say
that they're 5.1 they've got a
microphone they say they're gonna make
but no name so fear on tech of tomorrow
we're gonna give them a name these are
the 5.1 vibrator headphones that's right
vibrator so we're sticking with it so
anyways with that let's check out what's
inside this little box back behind me
and see if there's really good shizmik
inside of the box
so here we see the outside of the box
these are the rows well vibration
headset they'll actually have a specific
name it does actually have a little
nomenclature number on top up here we
can see this right here this is the RH
TS 8 to 0-6 5.1 sound gaming headset
with vibrations they point out our gonna
max adjustable headband foldable ear cup
detachable microphone surround sound
with vibration 6 precision speakers two
subwoofers digital USB sound with
virtual 7.1 channels unidirectional
microphone noise cancellation clear
voice communication volume control with
mic mute you guys needs this little
remote control right here
you can see the headphones actually in
here just flipping around there's
nothing much on the back of the box
nothing much really on the side of the
box nothing much on any sides of the box
like to spin that around they're gonna
go ahead and pop the cap here then we
shall begin pulling these things out
bada-bing bada-boom all right we see
right here we have the controller has
all the different things here marked out
plus and minus your volume your speakers
I mean excuse me this one's for your
microphone this one's for your speakers
and that one backwards your microphone
right here let's go ahead and remove
them out of the plastic cushioning they
actually feel pretty heavy these
headphones are also going to be you guys
always complain about things they're
gonna be about 89 dollars on the market
so here we go it's a little user's
manual show you different things how to
use it the software go through that so
here we see the the units themselves
flip it around guys and see the
microphone completely adjustable come on
and you're not all right maybe not but
anyways so here's the control unit once
again here's the plug in and we have the
cameron here's where it plugs in has a
very long cable by the way as well just
let you guys know that it's important
here's the controller here the
headphones they're fully adjustable like
they
said yeah you can see that to the
removable foam pad I don't really take
them off because I'm gonna wear them
they look cool inside now
nothing Cameron bring him over to me
they do feel pretty comfortable on my
head well how do you think they look mr.
cameraman what what I guess do you think
that the noise cancellation them now I'm
just messing with you I heard every word
you say I was just screwing around the
all of it
check out here they are these are the
new rows will a vibrator 5.1 headphones
so basically these things sit on your
head like this and you get shot up in a
game instead of feeling the force
feedback inside of your mouth or in your
joystick so to have like an xbox you're
gonna actually feel them inside your
headphones this could either be really
annoying a really cool depending on the
type of user you are so we'll see you
folks back here on TECA tomorrow later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
