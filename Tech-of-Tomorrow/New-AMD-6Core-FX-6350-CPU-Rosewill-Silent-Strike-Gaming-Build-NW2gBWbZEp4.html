once again to tech tomorrow I'm Eric
your host and we've got a lot of really
cool stuff on Sunday's plate first up in
the news 4 a.m. defense excellent news
going on right now now you guys all know
about the piledriver technology we'll
check it out the FX 6300 and the FX 4300
are being replaced that's right now
what's going on is you're getting more
clock speed but you're also getting a
little bit more in your TDP as well so
what's going on so check it out six core
release the new FX 6350 is hitting the
market at six core process from AMD
clocked at 3.9 gigahertz has a boost
speed of 4.3 gigahertz that's right then
they're also releasing a four core CPU
this is the new FX 4350 this one is also
clocked at 3.9 gigahertz and has 4.2 for
its boost speed respectively so check
that out that stuff coming at the market
and with the really cool thing about
this is is that even though these things
are getting replaced well actually
they're actually replacing the other
ones is what I mean even though these
ones are coming to market and they're
replacing the other CPUs the price isn't
going to change so currently right now
if you're out in the market you're
looking for something and you looked up
an FX 6300 it would be a hundred and
thirty-two dollars you can now get the
6350 for 132 dollars and the FX 4350 for
one hundred and twenty two dollars so
that's really cool news I know you Andy
fans out there going to be like going
hell yeah rock on now the only trade off
of that is you do get 30 more watts of
TDP which means the thing is going to
run a little bit hotter so you're going
to use some a little bit better cooling
but most people nowadays are going to
use water cooling and take care of their
syczyk anyways now for people out there
who like Intel stuff there's a whole new
thing going on there the Chromebook is
going to be released with the Haswell
chip inside of it that's right so you're
going to get better graphics because you
know the graphics on the new Haswell are
supposed to be a lot better than the
ones on has whoa at least 30 to 40%
better from what rumors have stated and
you're also going to get extended
battery life so you get better graphics
extended battery life better performance
and obviously if you get a Chromebook
and it's going to have that
awesome pixel density screen you're
going to get the most amazing screen
plus all the hassle goodies all-in-one
okay so that's the news stories now
check it out folks you guys all know
that we had the 100k contest and we have
a winner and that system is the new
