who the hell am I kidding all right
residents of planet Earth good morning
it is now June 25th launch day of the
brand-new NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 and we
happen to get our hands on one here over
on tech of tomorrow so now let's take a
look at the reference card and let's
bring you guys the full review
benchmarks and just see what this new
card is all about alright folks so now
let's take a closer look at the GTX 760
which I don't know if when you guys know
it is now replacing the gtx 660ti but
it's coming into the market around $50
cheaper and starting with an MSRP of
around 249 dollars now the card is
geared for 1080p and 1200 P gaming with
graphics and a a turned up now the
reference gtx 760 that we're looking at
today it features a dual slot design it
measures in at 9.5 inches in length and
includes two dual link DVI one HDMI and
one DisplayPort connection as far as its
power connectors it requires two 6-pin
power connectors and as a total TDP of
170 watts as far as the speeds and feeds
the GTX 760 features six SMX units 96
texture units and eleven hundred and 52
CUDA cords the reference card comes
clocked at 900 a megahertz and has a
typical boost clock speed of a thousand
33 megahertz the card also has a 256-bit
memory interface with two gigabytes of
gddr5 memory 192 point 2 6 gigabytes a
second total memory bandwidth and a
memory clock speed of 1500 and 2
megahertz just like the gtx 770 780 and
Titan the GTX 760 also features GPU
boost 2.0 which is based off the GPU
temperature and not on the power target
like the original GPU boost 1.0 the
benefit of the boost clock speed based
on the GPU temperature is that with
particular partner cards like msi EVGA
gigabyte and a zeus they offer a better
cooling solution which results in even
higher boost clock speeds and better
performance now while we're on the
subject of those partner cards and those
cards that are made in a non reference
design if you guys would like to check
out any of the pricing and available
makes you guys check out the links down
in the description below we'll have all
that information and with that said
let's jump in and rock out with our
spock out and check out the benchmarks
alright so there you guys go rocking out
to the new benchmark song the humans ooh
we're down there below the like button
in the description you guys can see the
link to where to pick up that song as
you guys always ask about it so now
we've seen it all the specs all the
features and the performance of the new
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 now this thing's
basically replacing the 62 ti boost card
own it's going to be coming to market at
about fifty to sixty dollars less and
bring you better performance all the way
across the board now being that this is
the reference card we didn't obtain any
great overclocking results using the GPU
boost 2.0 because it's set at 80 Celsius
and you're kind of stuck with that
because of the cooling on it it's not
really going to allow you to do much
pass that but it's not really geared for
that either
usually when Nvidia makes a reference
design card it's just built pretty much
to stick in the computer and go and then
all the aftermarket cards which we're
going to talk about a second have all
that extensive cooling you also get the
new 1.5 geforce experience which is
really great stuff it actually allows
your card to keep everything up to date
running smooth that also sets it for its
most optimized settings so you get the
absolute most out of your gaming
experience and your card all pretty cool
stuff like I said a second ago partner
cards now a lot of these cards are going
to be based on a non reference design
the card that we took a look at in
today's review this is based off
invidious reference base design it's
basically a suggestion to companies on
how to build the card many cards like
MSI it's card their new Twin Frozr
gaming edition which we took a look at
is actually really really extremely
running cooler than the reference design
like I said a second ago the reference
design is set at about 80 81 Celsius we
were seeing 60 61 Celsius on the MSI
twin frozer so there's you know almost
eighteen to twenty percent better
cooling right off the bat on that card
and if you guys would like to see the
full review of that where you're
watching this video you guys can click
on the link down the description below
we have the full-blown review all the
benchmarks pictures even comparisons
against the reference
guard against that card over our site
wwth of tomorrow so hope you appreciate
us getting up early in the morning and
doing this so if so make sure you guys
hit that like button down below show us
you love us because we love you here at
Tech Oh tomorrow we'll see you guys here
