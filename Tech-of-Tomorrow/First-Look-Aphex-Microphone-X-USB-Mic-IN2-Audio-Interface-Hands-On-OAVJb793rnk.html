Elric now here I'm at the FX booth and
earlier I talked to a guy named Jim
about two of their latest products this
is the into and the microphone X now
let's jump over and talk to Jim and see
what these products are all about okay
so the end two as a desktop recording
interface 4x4 interface two analog
channels two digital channels via s/pdif
the analogue side has two Class A
microphone preamps to optical
compressors phantom power instrument
inputs and XLR inputs for your
microphones on the back so when you
combine the class-a Mike grease the
optical compression the head pod for
class headphone amplification
you're really getting three or four
products in one so what class a slider
class a Mike breeze head pod for
headphone amplifier head five bars up
for a deck award tonight know who's
going to be average street price for
these things for music about 500 bucks
monitor bucks yeah
that's pretty nifty now this pot it can
hook up by what different ways here on
the back here connects to your computer
via a USB there's MIDI ports on the back
for your legacy keyboards or whatnot
analog outputs to your monitors s/pdif
digital i/o and they'll say your
microphone inputs now this will work
with any type of audio interface as well
I think if you like going and you're
trying to use like any of the Apple
software is to be seamlessly integrated
into using it yeah absolutely Mac
Windows Pro Tools logic performer or
whatever anything just yeah on the go
yeah and then we got another product up
here this is the microphone X microphone
X you guys to the side here so Jim
what's the big thing about the
microphone X is it but you know it
friends with Wolverine from x-men or
what it could be but I can't talk about
that good secret this is a USB
microphone with Apex analog processing
up front so before you even get to the
conversion you've got an apex optical
compressor and an apex big bottom and an
apex exciter so you get an optimal
signal compressed totally enhanced
before you even get to the conversion
and then the conversion is 20 up to 24
96 yes it's pretty much like a
microphone only high res totally effects
already built in yes a wide and high-end
south near both exactly exactly and
right the end to works with whatever
software you you have Mac or PC doesn't
matter
all these products currently available
on the market as we speak are they
coming out the mic will be coming out in
May the into will be coming out in June
and what will be the price in the
microphone next when it comes up about
