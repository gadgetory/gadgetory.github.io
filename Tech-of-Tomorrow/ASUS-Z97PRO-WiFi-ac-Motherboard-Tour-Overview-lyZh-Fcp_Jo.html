back once again to TECA tomorrow we're
bringing you all the tech all the time
and what tech is on the table today will
you guys all know intel is releasing
their new z97 chipset and JJ from a Zeus
is here to talk about one of their
latest boards now this is their Pro
Series board we're going to be seeing
right here it is one of your mainstream
products but a lot of the features on
this board actually go all the way
across your entire series of mainstream
products correct correct we're pretty
much going to be talking and
highlighting the z97 Pro as far as the
specifics where we're going to talk
about you know i/o connectivity features
and functionality but a lot of the
features and functions that we're pretty
much talking about are going to be
consistent on our z97 - a so it's our
entry level performance cue the Pro of
course as well as our z97 deluxe and
even to the majority of degree the z97 -
i+ which is the mini ITX mainstream
board as well so there's pretty much be
consistent and also while we're also
going to be doing other videos here on
the channel you guys want to make sure
to check out for tough for rog and for
ws series you're going to see a lot of
continuity in the core consistency in
those features as well on those series
of boards as well so let's go ahead and
jump straight into it so first off you
guys can see right here we've got the
brand new Asus C 97 pro board and one of
the first things that just right off the
bat you can see is it got an entirely
different aesthetic so we've got a big
old yeah it's actually they're anodized
as opposed to being a pure brush process
but what we did from the previous
generation is we maintained that gold
feel but we've gone ahead and gone for a
little bit more aggressive and I think
cleaner look and feel to the board
overall and the big changes is we've
gone with a softer gold accenting we've
introduced what's called our concentric
circle design so this is actually the
similar type of design that we actually
had implemented on our spun metal finish
books like our ultra books and other
products that have kind of been very
famous from the Asus product family that
featured kind of metal type of designs
and in addition to that we've gone with
of course a definitely we've gone with a
more monochromatic almost looking feel
not completely more chromatic but we
have secondary accents of dark gray and
black for the PCIe for the SATA and then
for the DRAM so overall I think it's got
a
a great look and feel - it feels clean
modern a little bit aggressive and it's
going to really complement just about
any type of system that you want to be
able to throw it I like it because the
goal before the pre generation board I
thought that goes a little bit too much
in your face and a lot of users agree
they're like what's what that crazy go
but this gold is more subdued so it kind
of looks a little bit more classy and
not so much in your face of golden I
like that and I think a lot of users not
they're gonna like that as well yeah I
actually I'm the opposite I actually
liked our previous gold even more that's
how Anthony is Anthony likes it all
buggy and blingy and go but I like this
much better I don't know that it was
necessarily blingy but I think what most
people have to remember too is that we
had blue for such a long time that any
color change was going to seem dramatic
because we're going to such a different
color plus you're also had a much larger
color change because the accent colors
were also brown and yellow so there was
a lot more visually to look at than
necessarily here where regardless that
color is going to be a little bit more
subdued this looks almost a little bit
like the tough series colors you know
because it's a little bit more subdued
kind of reminds me of somewhere in
between now interesting well let's go
ahead and just jump straight into the
hardware design so first and foremost of
course if we take a look at the primary
top of the board so we've got the arm
heatsink of course all the boards are
always going to have great quality vrm
heat sinks and along with the PWM and
the v arm components are going to be
great so if we just tackle overclocking
you regardless of whether going to be
doing manual overclocking or using our
five way optimization technology which
you guys should check out the video that
we did on that you're going to have an
outstanding overclocking experience so
you can feel confident whether it's the
a the probe deluxe it doesn't matter any
board they're all going to be able to do
4.6 4.7 4.8 gigahertz it doesn't matter
so don't worry about overclocking he's
trying to save basically focus your
overclocking experience regardless the
boards you buy you're going to get a
great overclocking experience you'd have
to buy a higher-end board to get better
overclock Gangstar yes you're definitely
going to want to buy the board based on
the feature set that you're going to
have in terms of the components though
the pro for this generation is going to
head and been improved previous
generation we had 5k rated capacitors
here we've gone ahead and introduced the
10k rated capacitors that we previously
only had on the ROG and the Tough Series
motherboards so that's a twice as long
in terms of the overall lifespan these
caps also have significantly higher
temperature and significantly lower
temperature tolerances as well as very
high ESR performance which is going to
be superior than PA's caps which are
used on some other boards that are out
there in addition that we continue use
very good quality MOSFET and driver
solutions and digital power delivery and
control not only for the CPU but of
course even more importantly for the
DRAM whereas the fiber which is built
into the CPU that now handles a lot of
power and Dillian control doesn't do
power delivery control for the CP excuse
me for the DRAM so still having that
digital controller there gives us more
tweaking and tuning options as well as
the digital controller on the board
still gives us the ability to manage a
lot of BRM operations such as phase
loading phase response
OCP a lot of other parameters for you
guys that want to be able to tweak and
tune for either efficiency or for
maximum performance so that's going to
cover us there in terms of this section
of the board now if we talk about
connectivity from fans asus has really
always led the industry there and the
pro is going to give you six four pin
fan headers throughout the board just
like previous generations though every
single one of these headers that's on
the board supports both three pin and
four pin control but for this generation
we've gone ahead and done some really
cool stuff so outside of having every
single header be fully adjustable in the
operating system as well as in the UEFI
we've gone ahead and giving you the
ability to have pure output control for
the signal so you can either set this
header as this fan header DC and if you
want to set a different fan header so
this fan header to PWM you can do that
so you can assign whether you want it to
be DC or PWM individually to each one
correct and then in addition to that the
benefit of setting it to PWM is what we
were talking about earlier which is
really cool is the header yeah is that
you're going to be able to go ahead and
put Ana PWM fan splitter and then be
able to run that out to additional fans
so even though the board only has six
fan headers you could control you know
six seven eight nine ten fans right in
total in your system and still have
those be controlled by either the UEFI
or by the operating system in AI suite 3
with fanox 4 3 so some really awesome
control functionality it's going to
really bring unmatched control now in
addition we've also introduced fan
calibration not only within the
operating system but within the UEFI as
you saw you're able to go into you if I
click a button and over on full fan
calibration for every single one those
fan headers plus we added grammar that's
totally what you're going to hear is it
going to hear your system ramping up and
then ramp it down it's it's really
killer
the other option too that we've gone
ahead and integrated for fan controls is
we have temperature input mapping for
every sin for every single header to do
front locations so instead of
traditionally what would happen is let's
say you know if we had this chassis fan
header connected it would always respond
to the CPU temperature but that's not
something that we always want to have
happen in some situations you may
actually want it to ramp to a different
temperature so we've leveraged some of
the technology we had on tough
motherboards which had multiple sensors
on the motherboard and we've gone ahead
and mapped different sensors so we have
the ability to either map to the VRM to
the PCH to the motherboard temperature
as well as an optional temp header
that's on the board itself where you can
go ahead and put that type header
wherever you want maybe on the back of a
graphics card maybe you want to put it
on top of your SSD maybe you want to put
it in a certain part of your chassis but
you have a huge degree of flexibility
when you take a look at that total set
of fan control span x / 3 is
unquestionably going to be the absolute
best fan controls that are out there
really awesome stuff and free but you
don't get that clear what that means
basis if you want to increase the
cooling in one of those areas you can
actually increase your fan speed in that
area and cool that certain area off more
yeah it's a really just awesome level
control flexibility that I think is
going to be just awesome for you guys
once you begin to take advantage of it
especially with so many chassis x' that
you know at a minimum have usually five
to six fans in them you know this is
just helping to make sure you can keep
everything quiet cool and laid out and
configure the way that you want it to be
so in addition to that of course we've
got the four DDR banks there for ddr3
boards been validated in excess of DDR
3000 so definitely D Ram overclocking is
not an issue we keep the cue dim which
means that it's easy single latch design
so you can just go ahead and pop in the
memory even if you have the graphics
card installed it's a very simple
process to either insert or remove
memory no issues there we've got that of
course the memo K button which is a
great one touch feature to either be
able to go ahead and troubleshoot memory
compatibility or failing memory or it
can even be used like a clear CMOS
button for users that want to be able to
go ahead and revert the board back to a
safe parameter of operation but without
clearing out all their settings like
their fan settings their SATA operation
and any other parameters and sometimes
that's good too because sometimes you if
you have some memory you change that to
some higher and overclocking memory on
the initial boot sometimes it won't
recognize yet the mem ok button they
usually will make the memory work and
they'll post your board for you yeah
correct so it's just a really nice
option now getting back to memory and
something that we've talked a lot about
is you get a lot of uses that sometimes
don't realize that they need to enable a
XMP profile right well guess what we've
made it simple we have an XMP switch
that we've built on
the motherboard so now all the user
needs to do is install the memory flip
the switch into the on position and will
automatically enable XMP for you how
come they just don't might make that
just took features so the XMP memory
just automatic then you can't because
XMP is a profile based standard and it's
technically an overclock profile and by
compliance the memory has to follow
what's called J deck policies so the
memory can only initialize the J deck
profile and outside of that any other
profile has to be manually induced the
reality is because there's also the
possibility that for certain memory
dividers they may not be supported by
the CPU such as high speed memory
dividers like 2666 2800 DDR 3000 even if
it enabled with XMP your CPU may not be
able to run that speed so it's always
just ensuring essentially that they can
make sure that you're going to get the
best experience in terms of initial
compatibility versus defaulting it to be
turned on and not having to be
functional but of course for ease of use
we've also talked about that we have an
easy XMP option in the UEFI single touch
option or if they run auto-tuning it'll
course automatically enable XMP for them
as well so we're moving down from here
of course we've got a front USB 3 header
where we actually have one right here
and we have another down here so we have
dual front USB 3 headers on the board
which is fantastic a course for front
USB 3 we have the USB 3 boost to be able
to prove the performance of USB flash
drives or high seed external assess
these that are coming out nowadays AB
check external USB threes yeah so that's
a pretty awesome feature and of course
for some of the corresponding ports we
also have USB charger plus which allow
you to do quick charging for let's say
your mobile device like a smartphone or
tablet even though if your systems off
down here in the storage it gets really
interesting we've got tons of storage
connectivity where we have sat Express
which is the newer standard replacing
the SATA previous protocol but keep in
mind set is not going to be going
anywhere because it's default part of
the chipset this is just the next
evolution in terms of offering faster
performance now for SATA Express because
there's not any defaults at Express
devices available on the market ACS will
be releasing a device like this guy
right here which is called the hyper duo
Express excuse me the hyper Express
which will essentially allow you to take
either 2m SATA or 2 m2 based SSDs put
them in their will to create a hardware
raid for you and once you go ahead and
do that you can then connect that
directly to the SATA Express port to get
fast
than single SSD based performance so
it's a really awesome just conveniently
feature as well yeah yeah and in
addition that we've also worked very
extensively to be able to incorporate
advanced testing and validation and SR
is which is a special type of protocol
transmission standard in the cabling and
clock signaling to be able to ensure the
best SATA Express performance this is
extremely important because even if you
look at other solutions in the
marketplace that may have SATA Express
you may not necessarily always get the
best SATA Express performance so from
there of course you've got your standard
PCH SATA 6g ports we then have two more
ports that are provided by the a s media
1061 and then right next to that we've
also got another set of standard which
can be MDOT 2 with this MDOT to base
connection it will support either MDOT 2
PCI Express or MDOT 2 SATA so up to you
the board will actually support both but
keep in mind that if you do MDOT 2 SATA
it's essentially the same performance as
a SATA 6g SSD and it also is kool-aid
with that port meaning that if you use
the MDOT 2 SATA you'll lose a set of
port on the board so if you use of
course the PCIe PCI you can potentially
be faster up to a by 2 pcie-based SSD
offering even faster performance and
faster throughput now when you use the
PCA does it have any impedance up on the
lanes at all or no of course because
everything's being leveraged from
different Lane allocation and definitely
depending on the board that you look at
there's going to be slightly different
effects to the PCIe configuration so you
want to make sure to check out the
manual for how that board may be figured
out ok now moving on from there we've
got the TPU and epu switches that's
great for single touch hardware based on
overclocking so TPU switch you can just
flip it in the on position it enables a
quick overclock like a 4.3 gigahertz
along with enabling your XMP profile if
you don't want to be able to run an
overclocking you want to run stock but
you want to have lower power consumption
lower temperatures flip the EPU switch
won't affect performance
is just going to provide an under bolt
giving you lower temperatures and lower
power consumption moving on from there
we've got our scott right over here we
have the USB BIOS flash back button and
so that's going to course give you that
advanced feature that if we take a flash
drive and we plug it into a
corresponding port here we have the
ability to directly update and recover
the actual chip that's on the board even
if there's no CPU no memory no graphics
card all you need is just
power connection for the board plugged
in and you can go ahead and update the
BIOS update the UEFI as simply and as
effectively as that this is also a great
recovery feature where if you get things
like a surge spike sag or brown out
guess what and your system fails to post
on you can also attempt to manually
recover it and it's a very awesome
feature that we've had now for multiple
generations but one that still is very
critical and lastly rounding that out a
lot of vendors also have a difference in
terms of even the BIOS implementation
this is a non soldered based solution so
even in worst case scenario if you had a
Fae there you could contact our service
department have a new one shipped out
replace it as opposed to where if it's
soldered then you have to send the board
in so moving from there of course we've
got the power button pretty
straightforward here this is a special
connector this is going to be our
Thunderbolt header with the Thunderbolt
header guess what we can go ahead and
utilize this really cool card which is
the Thunderbolt II x2 card so for users
that want to be able to the absolute
fastest io standard you know maybe
you're doing content creation
audio/video image editing maybe doing
high high grade large volume backups
whatever it might be and you want to be
able to take advantage of Thunderbolt
any one of the pretty much a CC 97
series you can add in that Thunderbolt
II X card to this bottom PCH excuse me
to this bottom PCIe slot and you're good
to go
so in addition to that if we take a look
here in the audio we've made big
improvements we've leveraged the audio
design that we had on our og
we brought it over to the mainstream
series so we have the full audio
isolation path that we've gone ahead and
implemented we're on our G it's called
supreme effects for our mainstream
series we're calling it crystal sound -
now we still maintain the full isolated
audio design we have an operational
amplifier built on full shielding for
the audio codec and we have niche akan
audio grade capacitors that are on the
board so is the sound crystal it is
quite nice and definitely for you guys
you know the biggest things you're going
to see is an improvement in the overall
gain so the volume as well as in the
noise floor for the actual crystal sound
to implementation now one thing that
we've done that's also really cool for
this generation is we have specially set
profiles for in air monitors over their
headphones and desktop speakers and what
we've done is we've actually worked with
the DTS sound group to be able to create
customized sound profiles for games
music or movies and what's
happen is when you plug in your
headphone are your speakers to either
the front of the front headphone
connection or the line level out you'll
actually see three icons that will come
up on the screen a picture of either an
in-ear monitor over their headphones or
desktop speakers pick the one that you
want and when you select that it will
automatically set the customized profile
and preset for that different type of
playback device so you're saying there's
already basically an EQ setting that's
already in there for these different
types of things correct because as you
know there's different types of overall
sound experience that you would have for
each one of those different types of
devices so we've worked very closely
with the DTS group and I've been really
impressed by this actually autumn eyes
the setup that we have as part of the
crystal sound to package what does the
crystal sound to what what chipset it
today it's the same chipset that we use
on the supreme effects so this is the
realtek ALC 1150 audio codec okay so
from there we got tons of PCI
connectivity a course for the z97 a pro
deluxe they all support SLI or crossfire
and you can see that you've got tons of
connectivity there and you're good to go
moving over into the back i/o if we just
take a look here in terms of what we've
got for i/o connectivity you've got a
lot going on we've pretty much got
everything could ask for USB 3 you've
got integrated attitude 11ac Wireless
with Bluetooth 4.0 you know and you've
got USB 2 ports and tons of digital
outputs for all the connections you
could ask for now in terms of the
Ethernet we're still using Intel and
where we feel that that's the absolute
best performance best compatibility and
lowest CP utilization plus we have our
new turbo land packet priority software
so turbo lends an awesome piece of
software as you can tweak and tune it to
be able to get the best gaming
performance streaming performance
downloading performance and it doesn't
care whether you use the Intel
integrated controller or the wireless
controller or even if you want to
upgrade to a USB wireless adapter or an
adding PCI solution you can map game for
X you can map key turbo Lance software
to work with any network controller in
addition like we also talked about we
maintain the functionality have USB
three boost and USB charger for the back
ports and that rounds that out now for
the Wi-Fi go package though there's a
lot more that we're doing for this
generation to be able to even give you
more functionality and versatility
one of the biggest functions that we're
integrating that will work through the
ethernet as well as through this guy
will be media streamer media streamer is
an awesome new application that we have
that's going to allow you to stream your
music movies or images not only in your
intranet
but even in an extranet so you can go
ahead and take it smartphone have the
app on there once you go ahead open up
the app as long as you got a cellular
Wi-Fi connection you can go ahead and
stream all your content straight from
your PC no issue that's using these
things right here
no we haven't even got to that yet
that's independent of even those guys
all you independent the breakouts yes
independent of that in addition that we
also have a new home cloud application
which will light amount your C Drive in
the cloud directly you don't need to
upload anything to any drives or any
host you'd have direct access to your C
volume you can manage it you can share
files and you can also stream content
directly from that there's any array
never come from those clouds as of right
now we've actually advanced integrated
weather control in there so we don't
worry about that now outside of that one
other really cool feature that we've
introduced as part of AI suite 3 but
definitely not covering all the features
is we have push notice push notice is an
awesome new function that's going to
allow you to receive remote notification
on your mobile device if your system has
an issue with the temperature the
voltages or the fan speeds such as let's
say your fan stops spinning you can
receive an actual text message to your
phone to let you know that your so
you're saying I could be I could be at
the gym yep working out also going to
get an interruption of my music and
it'll tell me that something's wrong
with my PC at home and what it is is
wrong with my PC at home any one of
those three options either the fan the
voltage or the temperature and when that
occurs you can all excuse me you can oh
if somebody it spills the Pepsi your
systems alert me about that sadly we
haven't gotten to that stage yet but you
know what you never know you know who
you are
but the cool part is our remote desktop
application we've also enabled full
extranet and internet-based capability
so let's say your system alerts you to
the fact that hey that band's not
spinning guess what you can remote back
into your desktop shut it down and
you're good to go so some really awesome
and advanced functionality and rounding
things out we've gone ahead and
integrated to great hardware accessories
that we have with qi wireless charging
so for the qi wireless charging all the
users needing to do is just go ahead and
put their smartphone onto the wireless
charging device i think they can
actually see it through that i usually
pick they like to really see everything
like
completely out so that just did not
complete shot let you to show at least
one of them off nice and gently there so
they can go ahead and just sup you know
place that on there and they can do
wireless charging if they want so it's
very simple and then of course we've got
the NFC Express box for the NFC Express
box they can go ahead and use an NFC
enabled device like a smartphone or
tablet they can go ahead and pass it
over and they can do things like
automatically log into their system they
can do transferring of photos they can
also go ahead and do things like quick
launching of applications and lastly
we've gone ahead and even incorporated
video streaming where you can stream
from your device videos to your desktop
as well as Bluetooth audio streaming or
you can stream any audio that's playing
back from your device to your set-top as
well so overall a huge amount of
functionality versatility and we've also
made new updates to the UEFI and we've
done even a lot more so just within this
basic overreacting
you can unquestionably see that the pro
and our mainstream series are great for
gamers content creators productivity
multimedia users pretty much anybody and
everybody when it comes to if you're
going to be building a new system or
upgrading it says great plan one
question up these items particularly
these come with the pro though or no
these eight though they don't come with
the deluxe though like I have what you
said what to versions also the deluxe as
well one that comes of the moment
doesn't correct so the deluxe will
actually come with the Thunderbolt the
NFC box and the Qi wireless charging
station but like I noted with the
Thunderbolt card those are all going to
be offered as compatible accessories for
our entire range of z97 motherboards
okay so that pretty much gives you guys
some perspective on what we're doing for
the mainstream series of motherboards
alright folks so there you guys have it
the new z97 Pro from the people who've
read a Zeus broken down by mr. JJ
himself but hey don't go away we've got
more coming for you ROG baby let's game
see you later
and be with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
