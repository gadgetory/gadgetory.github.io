of tomorrow today we're gonna be taking
a look at a product from the people over
at Patriot this is their new supersonic
magnum 256 gigabyte flash drive
featuring eight channel technology now
you guys know that portable storage is a
big big market this particular one is
coming into market at about $299 but you
have to think it's USB 3.0 it's supposed
to be very very fast just a couple of
things to take note of as well the unit
will work with Mac or PC with no
problems at all and it does have a
five-year warranty now we have it in the
package here and I'm gonna go ahead and
start taking another package this thing
size in at 79 millimeters by 27
millimeters it's definitely probably one
of the biggest ones that you guys are
ever going to see that said it's pretty
good it's thick you know I mean so if
you try to like stick inside the back of
the computer it may run into something
else or you know in a laptop that you'd
be just fine
now as far as what the inside of this
thing contains it contains the facin
controller
it also contains two 64 gigabyte NAND
flash packages on one side and then the
other side it also contains two
additional 64 gigabyte nan packages
which gives us our total of 256
gigabytes it also features Toshiba
memory the Toshiba memory is the tu8 9g
to la ka or the Tugg 89 g2 la caja now
if we take a look we can see that the
Phi son is labeled the ps2 - 5 1 - 0 1
this is the big brother of the ps2 250
103 that was on the rage XT like I said
previously this features 8 channel
technology along with we're leveling now
a lot of people don't know this but the
Windows 8 operating system has the
native capability of USB Attached scuzzy
or you ASP as you can see from inside
the package all you really do is get the
drive itself there's no drivers or
anything else that comes in it and
that's pretty much what you get now for
you folks out there who'd like some more
in-depth
the information about this I've actually
written a full-length review along with
testing it against a few other drive so
if you folks are interested in seeing
that please click on the link in the
description below where you guys can
check out the full written review and
see how fast this drive is I will say
it's not the fastest of all the drives
that I've seen but it is very very fast
for what it is like usual if you liked
this video go ahead and hit that like
button and if you're not subscribed
please do so so you don't miss out on
any of the tech gunas here on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
