today's video is made possible by a data
their new premier Pro SP 920 SSDs
feature blazing fast speeds and sizes up
to one terabyte for more information
check out the link below what's going on
my tech family welcome back once again a
tech of tomorrow where big things are
going on in the Nvidia world that's
right today the brand new 330 7.50
drivers have been released and they
bring quite a bit of performance to the
table so with that said we're going to
be comparing them to the previous driver
which is the 335 point 2 3
now another thing that Nvidia is pushing
with this is they're trying to say that
a lot of their GPUs are right now going
to be ready for DirectX 12 whatever it
hits the market if that's 2015 that's
where it's at but they're trying to say
that even the cards they have now are
ready for it and that AMD cards using
mantle at this time are only 40% ready
where they're going to be a hundred
percent ready now what this is going to
mean in real time I don't know watch
this new in DirectX 12 actually gator
who has what on the table at that time
but with that said now let's jump in and
let's check out the brand new driver
from Nvidia and would it bring
performance wise to you the Nvidia fan
alright folks so for my test today I'm
using Intel Core i7 CPU it's the x9 90
I'm earning a three point four seven
gigahertz I've got 12 gigabytes of RAM
the resolution I'm running is 2560 by
1600 and 1920 by 1080 depending on what
we're doing the driver version you guys
can see is 330 7.50 now I've already
done the update for this system I'm
using Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate
alright folks so there you guys see my
test system it's basically this green
system back behind me called the Green
Hornet a lot of people ask about the
system a long time ago a friend of mine
Jerry won this thing at Nvidia invent of
it that big old giant boat and we did
some trading and I ended up with the
system
I've liked have been using it ever since
it works really really well now I've
tested with five different things
I tested Batman which is obviously a
game that's done by Nvidia
I tested another game which is strictly
an AMD game as you guys know and that is
dirt 3 and even then I saw significant
improvements with the new driver for
3dmark I used the fire strike
I used the full test on this in 1920 by
1080 and also at 2560 by 1600 I also
used Heaven 4.0 the DirectX 11 benchmark
then I use a game that everybody knows
battlefield 4 you guys all know this and
I want to say on three 35.2 three inside
of the GeForce experience it did not
give me anything to really optimize the
game as soon as I install the new driver
for me personally it all sudden gave me
a chance to optimize the game which I
did as you guys saw in this screen right
here so let's go ahead let's jump in and
let's talk about the testing and the
results let's start off with Batman
Arkham origins at 2560 by 1600 with the
three 35.2 three drivers the average
frame rate per second was 108 as soon as
I switched the driver to 330 7.50 the
average frame rate per second jumped up
to 153 at a 1920 by 1080 resolution
I saw 111 with the 33 5.23 and 160 with
the 337 500 quite an improvement
next up dirt3 obviously an AMD game but
there was still some improvements 2560
by 1600 with the 330 5.23 driver I saw
150 1.90 with the 330 7.50 I saw 160
6.77 at 1920 by 1080 with the 330 5.23 I
saw 150 3.8 III and with the 330 7.50
I saw 160 6.21 also a good improvement
next up is heaven 4.0 which is a DirectX
11 benchmark at 2560 by 1600 the three
35.2 three drivers showed 62 average
frames per second as soon as I install
the new driver
I got 76 average frames per second at
the 1920 by 1080 resolution the average
frames per second were 93 with the three
three 5.23
and with the three three 7.50 we saw a
jump to a hundred
and twelve next up is 3dmark fire strike
which we all know is a synthetic
benchmark it's not an exact game but
it's still a cool thing just for some
comparisons so let's go in and let's
talk about those scores at 2560 by 1600
we saw a graphic score with a 335 point
2/3 of 75 31 with the 330 7.50 however
we saw 77304 Minh Stu few hundred with
just a change of a driver with the 1920
by 1080 we didn't see as much as a
performance boost but we did see some at
3 3 5 point 2 3
we saw 1 2 607 and with a 3-3-7 point
500 we see 130 201 not a great
improvement but still an improvement
overall next up the game everybody's
been waiting for Battlefield Forbes I
know a lot of you people are out there
playing this game my son plays the crap
out of it you ask me ready to play it
I'm too busy working I want to play it
to be honest though I actually liked
playing battlefield 3 so much I find
that I get a lot more kills in it so I
still haven't grasped on to the total
thing of Battlefield 4 but with the new
naval upgrades that have come out my
thing I'm going to have to jump in also
folks just a quick note for testing
across the board I had vsync disabled in
battlefield 4 I had it set for its ultra
when I ran the heaven 4.0 I had
tessellation on I had a 2.0 on the
anti-aliasing on all the other things I
had them just left at their default
settings at what they were just I'll let
you guys know that now let's jump in and
let's check out battlefield 4 at 2560 by
1600 with the 3/3 5.23 driver I was
seeing 88 average frames per second I
installed the 330 7.50 driver and I saw
120 average frames per second which is
really an amazing and substantial
difference at the resolution of 1920 by
1080 with the 3/3 5.23 driver
I saw 111 average frames per second as
soon as I installed the 330 7.50 driver
I saw 136 frames per second which was
strictly amazing alright folks so you
guys can see between 335 point 2 3 &amp;amp; 3 3
7.50 there's quite a big difference now
directx12 games haven't quite all got
out in the market yet but as soon as
they do and video wants you to know that
this driver fully supports DirectX 12 as
will all their drivers going out into
the future as far as mantle goes you
know that mantle showed a lot of
superior performance and lower end type
of stuff I think that Nvidia is also
going to show the same type of stuff
since we've seen so much talked-about
about the notebook environment so I'm
sure that all these notebooks that they
have out you're going to see much
substantiated performance on those
because I noticed across all the slides
that we saw during the presentation all
we're showing mantle versus this new
driver and it really showed this new
driver 3/3 7.50 just really just you
know kicking some serious butt across
the board as far as drivers go so
basically you guys seen it folks a lot
of advancement as far as frame rates
going on at stuff you get better
performance and I'm using a 690 which is
the duel cards is kind of like SLI
performance but I know there's going to
be a lot of testing out there we'll test
it out with other stuff as well but this
is just launch day so we just had to get
it together and get it to you so that's
it folks DirectX 12 lots of performance
there hope you guys like it 3-3 7.50 is
out today install it and hey let us know
your results
i'm eric kieron techo tomorrow thanks
for watching this morning for watching
this video as well hey all the
information will be down below make sure
you guys check that up what like
fitments under you guys are going to hit
and tell me thank you and we'll see you
guys back then check in tomorrow for
more tech tennis
with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
