jump in today's video
let's hear a real quick word from
today's sponsor AMD and asrock let's go
the X 470 Taichi motherboard from asrock
supports the am 4 socket for AMD rides
in series CPUs the Tai Chi motherboard
also supports as Roxas hyper BC LK
engine 2 which provides a wider range of
frequencies and more precise clock
waveforms allowing you to get a more
precise and stable overclocking
experience this motherboard also
supports Nvidia Quad SLI and AMD quad
crossfire X and in the box
you get an SLI HP bridge that supports
GTX 1080s and 1070 s you also get a ton
of other features like RGB Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth support dual m2 slots plus an
m2 heatsink it even comes with an extra
large aluminum alloy heatsink which
takes away heat from the MOSFET and the
chipset this motherboard also has many
more features and with the black and
grey color scheme this motherboard will
look good in any build this motherboard
also features store mi technology get
the speed of an SSD with the capacity of
an HDD the PCIe slots are even made of
steel on our pack with solid covers that
prevent any signal interference with
graphic cards this feature is also great
for those really heavy GPUs you also get
7 USB type-a ports as well as a single
type C port and a single type C header
and you even get a ps2 port for you old
schoolers out there so check out the x4
70 taichi motherboard for under 200
bucks today so check this out Tech fans
do you miss the days when you actually
got free cable and can see all your
channels on your TV without an expensive
box or without paying a cable company or
really without paying anybody at all and
still be able to get a lot of TV
channels in we'll check this out I
bought this thing on Instagram the other
day and it's called live wave and this
live wave antenna is like one of the
most simplest things that I've ever seen
to use as long as you have a coaxial
connection or an adapter that goes to a
coaxial to your TV you can use this
device and honestly it couldn't be
simpler because it uses
the electricity in your house to bring
in the signal now a lot of people don't
seem to realize this but as of 2019
there was a new law that passed it says
that everything out there has to be
broadcast out on a digital frequency and
it has to be done for free the problem
is though is that a lot of times these
signals are scrambled forcing you to go
out and pay these cable companies to buy
this box or buy a subscription which a
lot of people let's just face it they
don't have a lot of money and they don't
want to do that so if you're somebody
who really just wants the basic channels
of TV you do get a few more than that or
you're a person who really likes a lot
of foreign language stuff this product
might really be up your alley and it is
honestly almost dumb simple to use
all you need to do is remove the product
from its box you plug one in into an
open wall socket put on the coaxial
cable hook the other end up to your TV
turn your TV on to the proper thing and
then all of a sudden you'll be able to
scan for different TV programs now in my
area I was able to get eighty nine
different programs they also sell this
little box that's an adapter that you
can get even more challenged because it
actually searches out for farther
distances but for most people just this
alone will probably be pretty good now
you guys can see scanning for the
channels is a very simple thing and once
it goes through and scans all the
channels you just start watching TV it's
honestly that simple and you guys can
see this is not just BS TV this in most
cases is full HD television that's right
I said it full HD television 1080p all
the way across the board
now when you're watching stuff that's
like years old like programs from the
60s or the 70s and they don't have high
resolution obviously these programs
aren't going to be looking you know all
SuperDuper nice and your brand new TV
but the news and lots of the other
programs you guys can see they look
absolutely amazing just as good as
anything that I'm watching through my
paid subscriptions the only thing is
there is a slight limitation to what you
can view but like I
said if you want something just to bring
in a lot of bakes at cable channels
looks absolutely great won't cost you
another penny for the rest of your life
then this product is something very
interesting and you can get one right
now for 3995 when i started making this
video i was like ok is this product
really going to be something that my
fans would want to check out and buy or
is it gonna be something that I'm gonna
be completely debunking um truthfully I
thought I was gonna be debunking this
product talking a bunch of mad smack
about and going yeah this doesn't work
it's just a total theft of your money
but if I would have went that route I
would have had to eat my words because
this product actually does work pretty
doggone good I wasn't paid any money for
this video whatsoever I bought this out
of my own pocket just so I could bring
it to you folks out there so you guys
could see whether it actually works or
whether it does not and as you guys can
see the product works really well so
what do you get for 39 bucks well you
get all those basic cable channels you
get the antenna itself which like you
saw is very easy to set up install so
this is a product that you think might
interest you we'll have a link down
below where you can buy one of these for
yourself and jump in and start watching
free TV right away I'm Miller you've
been watching teka tomorrow thanks for
viewing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
