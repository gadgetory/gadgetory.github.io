shelf so far though people out there who
have been waiting for this game to
arrive well guess what your day is here
and the game looks really great now we
brought you guys a previous video we
showed you guys all of the latest Nvidia
cards of the art CX series and we showed
you all those cards with r-tx on our
ticks off and with DL SS enabled now
today we're gonna bring you a video card
shootout of eight different cards
we're gonna be shooting all of the
latest AMD cards all the latest Nvidia
cards so it's proven to be the 580 the
590 the 56 and the 64 of the Vegas
series then on the Nvidia side of things
it's going to be the 2060 the 2070 2080
and 2080 ti all the way up the ramp now
the AMD scores look pretty doggone
decent I will say this now the only real
difference that I saw in the gameplay
whatsoever was during the benchmark
during the benchmark the AMD looked
quite choppy but in regular gameplay it
really wasn't that noticeable I will say
this though the Nvidia card with the RT
X and the deal SS on though did make the
game look more realistic and more
natural than the AMD card this is just
simply because the technology isn't
being loaned over to the AMD side of
things right now so just take that in
consideration obviously this game Metro
Exodus right from the get-go it's
working with the people at Nvidia you
know hand in hand with this game so it's
going to be using their features but
what that said though let's really
quickly check out our test system now
we've built an entirely new test system
and we decided some things when we did
this I was gonna go with an i-9 CPU and
just go with all the latest greatest
stuff but then I kind of thought there's
so many people out there that I have an
i7 8700 K that I might as well go ahead
and build a system around that CPU
because more people out there actually
have that CPU probably than any other
gaming CPU other than some of the i5 s
in their system so I decided to stick
with that CPU we have the same asus
motherboard that we were using previous
is a really nice motherboard we have 32
gigabytes of ddr4 memory
we have a nice SSD for the boot drive
and a 2 terabyte Seagate drive for all
of our storage this system runs really
nice all of the games look absolutely
great as of the time of this video we're
using all the latest drivers AMD side of
things all the latest drivers from the
Nvidia side of things and for Windows 10
it has all the latest updates in fact
everything in the computer is pretty
much just updated to as much as it can
be so with that said though let's let
the battle begin
AMD vs. NVIDIA Metro Exodus oh my
alright so there are the numbers now
here's the thing right now pretty much
the 64 unless you're gonna go on to the
Radeon 7 is the top of the line card
right now from the people over at AMD
and we can see that it does beat the
2060 and competes slightly with the 2070
depending on what's going on so in some
cases it's up there some cases not but
overall the Nvidia cards I kind of think
that you guys kind of expecting our
winning but then you know you really
have taken consideration a twenty atti
is what $1300 you can get a Vegas 64 for
about 359 now it's seen them online for
that low of Christ so you really have to
take that consideration so the 2060 the
card comes to market at about almost the
exact same price so the 2060 is about
349 you can get almost the same thing
for Vegas 64 I would probably choose the
r-tx 2060 over the Vegas 64 simply for
the fact of the r-tx and the DL SX
extensions because you're not going to
get those with the AMD cards that's the
only thing I'm and now that you know any
Nvidia card is supporting freesync you
don't have to worry about what monitor
you're getting you can use any monitor
that was a caveat for a long time but
the game looks great gameplay is really
cool there was really no lag like I said
during the benchmark we saw a little bit
of choppiness with the AMD cards but in
game we really didn't see that
choppiness but overall the Nvidia cards
with their new technology just does make
the game just that wee bit better for
those people who are looking for the
most hyper realistic gaming experience
that they can get so I mark you guys
