Plus what's up Tech fans Kevin here on
techy tomorrow now I've done a lot of
collector's editions unboxings in the
past but they've all been on my other
home channel TLD today because it's been
all console stuff and we thought we'd go
ahead and change that starting now and
what better way to do it then to unbox
the collector's edition of one of the
most anticipated PC games of the year
titanfall we're gonna unbox it review it
and touch a little bit on the gameplay
so that wasting any more of your time
let's rip this thing wide open and see
what it has to offer
so here we have it the titanfall
collector's edition now as I said
earlier I've been boxed a lot of
collector's editions in the past both
off and on camera and I have to say that
this is easily the largest one I've ever
gotten my hands on I'm sure there's some
specific older game that might rival it
but this thing is absolutely massive the
box itself shows several of the promo
images we've seen before such as showing
a Titan and a pilot and as per usual the
back side lists and shows all of its
contents after cutting off some tape on
the top of the box we can lift off the
cover and see a simpler black design
with the front rolling a simple icon of
a pilot in his Titan and the sides
bearing the game's title now this
collector's edition opens up a little
differently than most usually you open
the top of the box to pull stuff out
this one has a little more style we just
have to undo this latch on the front and
right away we can see all of the boxes
contents displayed including a handy
little instruction manual taped to the
opening flap to help us know just how to
safely remove all of this stuff so to
begin with we of course have our PC copy
of the game there's no end game bonuses
for this edition so all we're getting
inside are numerous installation discs
and the usual couple pieces of paper
next to that we have the poster which is
designed to look like a simple blueprint
of the Atlas type Titan which is the
design we've seen in most of the videos
and the beta it's basically the
well-balanced starter Titan right next
to that we have the game's art book as
opposed to most art books these days
which are these odd little half-size
things there's only 20 or 30 pages the
titanfall art book is a proper full-size
coffee table book with just under 200
pages of art with chapters dedicated to
the designs of titans and pilots
vehicles and weapons locations in the
game and some of the final actual
physical models of titans this is
definitely one of the better art books
I've seen in more recent collector's
editions probably the best one
since Skyrim's now that we've got those
out of the way let's go ahead and slide
this whole thing out and get a better
look at the Statue bringing it out
reveals a few more items on the top of
the package first up you've got the
certificate of authenticity which shows
that we got number 26,000 and 23 out of
the 35,000 of these that they made we
also have a pair of soldier figures that
we're just not safe enough to travel all
it's one with the Statue so we'll put
that all together in a bit so now we can
start carefully removing all of the
styrofoam and different little supports
and have the statue itself in its full
glory this is the largest statue I've
ever gotten in a collector's edition
standing at 19 and a half inches tall
and has a lot of great detail depicting
an Atlas type Titan with the enemy
trying to board it all we have to do now
is add our two soldiers from earlier one
taking point and the other one trying to
take out the enemy pilot and we have a
complete gigantic statue which also
happens to light up when you push this
little button disguised as a rock so all
in all this is a very traditional
straightforward collector's edition that
just did everything it could bigger a
great art book good full-size poster and
a fantastic nearly 20 inch tall statue
now is it worth 250 bucks well just like
how big it is this thing is just as
easily one of the most expensive
editions we've ever purchased
weighing in at the same price of some
game systems with the tile or two to
start now given you always kind of have
to take a collector's edition pricing
with a grain of salt because they're all
overpriced relative to what you get and
while this one has few items what you do
get is substantial and none of them feel
like a waste I'm gonna have to say
surprising even myself that I feel like
this one is kind of worth what you pay
for
given purchasing a giant statue and art
book aren't exactly a necessity but if
you've got the money to shell out and
you're already a huge fan of the game
either because you played the beta or
you just know you're gonna get it one
way or the other I feel like you get
what you pay for as far as collector's
editions go especially with this statue
now while we were throwing this together
I took the time to install the full
version of the game and spend a little
time with it and from what little I've
played so far it's very similar to what
we experienced in the beta but just with
more things to do to begin with one of
the really nice things is that right off
the bat you have different Titans to use
as loadouts
but the tank loadout now you see the
ogor instead of the Atlas which is just
way more tanky the game's campaign mode
is played out simply by joining specific
multiplayer matches using a certain map
and game mode with a few spoken lines
before and during the match to fill out
its plot otherwise it's just like
hopping onto multi players same
experience which in my opinion is really
a good thing I've grown really tired of
tacked on single-player campaigns out of
a sense of tradition also while I
haven't run super thorough benchmarks
just yet I did go ahead and checked out
my average frame rate right now running
on 2560 by 1440 with all settings set to
max on our system which includes an msi
gtx 780 twin frozer and an i7 4770k
processor i was getting an average of 57
frames per second during matches just
barely under 60 and keeping consistently
smooth throughout the match which is a
good thing
now before I let you guys go I want to
take a moment to think Hulu Plus for
helping make today's video possible
most of you have probably gone to Hulu
at least once to catch a show that
recently aired or find something to kill
time on but Hulu Plus just gives you so
many more benefits grabbing it lets you
watch your favorite currently airing
shows as well as catch full seasons of
classics and even exclusive hulu
originals like the wrong mans and if you
don't feel like watching stuff on your
computer then great because with hulu
plus you can also watch it on your
tablet smartphone or a number of
streaming devices that you can hook up
to your TV so you can relax on the couch
if you get to try it out for yourself
who is awesome enough to supply our fans
with a way to get a special extended
14-day free trial all you have to do is
go to Hulu Plus comm slash T ot make
sure you sign up through there so that
way you get the extra seven days and at
the same time show us some support well
that's all for today's video I'm gonna
go ahead and lose myself in titanfall in

full thoughts as soon as possible if you

and while you're down there we've also
got some links posted so you can grab
