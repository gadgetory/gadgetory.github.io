back once again to another edition of
tech o tomorrow I mark your host and
today we're looking at a couple of
awesome card from people over at EVGA
now it's a lot of gtx 960 is out in the
market but these things are the SSC
which is super super clocked edition
which means these things have awesome
awesome overclocking right out of the
box also comes with a CX 2.0 cooling it
for you people who happen to miss it we
did the full review on a single guard
which you guys can check out right over
here now we've got two of them though so
let's slap these things in sli and see
how they do and at the end of the day
with our sli is worth your money in the
gtx 960 division let's go
and for those of you who are wondering
our test system is a pretty much
mid-level system it's nothing too
outstanding it's nothing too crappy it's
right there in the middle alright so
there you guys have it folks the EVGA
super super clocked edition gtx 960 in
sli now four four and twenty dollars to
get a pair of these things I don't think
it's too high of a price do you guys
think so leave your comments down below
like them which hope you guys will go
Chuck Norris style also few people out
there we're interesting getting one of
these cards we're getting a pair of
these cards all the information will be
down there as well I think that actually
for the price though this is a pretty
solid deal 1080p gaming a lot of things
over a hundred frames per second you
guys can see in Far Cry 4 this thing's
just like chopping that up
it's really awesome I know a lot of
people out there like that I don't like
10 and 20 but memory interface it's
screwing everything up but you guys can
see a pair of these cards really does
well 90s to me they're really nice cars
but between a 9 79 80 just for the money
I'd say the 970 is a better card but a
pair of these four four and twenty bucks
I have to say isn't it chase I think so
I know like I thought there were AMD
fans are gonna go on screw Nvidia but
hey you got actually just look at the
performance of the cards in the games I
don't care who makes the card I look at
the numbers we look at how hot the cards
cards run these cards run pretty cool
they run solid you guys saw the numbers
the price is right I'm out of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
