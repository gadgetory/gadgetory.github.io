there that watch this channel are pc
elitist and the PC master-race guys they
don't like consoles they don't like
really low-end pcs everything is
high-end gaming and as cheap as you can
get it but what if you're a person who
just needs a really small footprint
computer for surfing the net checking
your mail and all that kind of great
stuff
well the byte three that fills that
little niche now today's video is
brought to you by Corsair so real quick
let's check them out Before we jump into
the video having a pair of headphones is
crucial to that all night gaming sesh
and of course there're HS fifty stereo
gaming headset has a comfort sound
quality and durability that you'll need
to game all night with adjustable ear
cups and plush memory foam for
exceptional comfort the HS 50 s also
include the legendary Corsair build
quality featuring rugged metal
structural components to ensure
long-term durability they also include
specially tuned 50 millimeter neodymium
speaker drivers to bring you superior
sound quality with a wide range and
accuracy
the only directional microphone is
easily detachable and is also optimized
to reduce ambient noise for enhanced
voice quality VHS 50s are also Dischord
certified so you know your mic and audio
drivers have been tested and evaluated
for crystal clear communication and
outstanding sound the volume a mute
controls can be easily accessed on the
right side of the ear cup for easy
adjustment on the fly so if you're
looking for affordable high quality pair
of headphones give the Corsair HS 50
stereo gaming headsets a try you won't
regret it
okay thanks Corsair now check this out
like I said if you're a person out there
and you're looking for a PC not to play
game but just to surf the Internet check
your email do business and stuff like
that there is a large audience for this
and probably a lot of people in your
family are people like this who don't
play games and they don't need a
super-duper
high-end computer whatsoever and what's
really great about the bite through from
azul' really is it's extremely small
footprint I mean let's just face it this
thing is small it's light it can travel
easy in a backpack or inside of pretty
much anything even inside your purse if
you're a woman because it's such a small
device now externally taking a look at
the front you guys can see there's an a
right there that's the power button
standing for as Zul and
to the right of that down below it's the
bike 3 nomenclature of the device on the
right-hand side of the bike 3 we see an
SD card reader a single USB 3.0 port and
then another USB 2.0 port now in the
back on the top left hand side we see
the headphone jack below that the
Kensington lock
next up 2 more USB 3.0 ports the LAN
port HDMI port and finally a VGA port
why is that there I don't know and then
right next to that is the power port
where you plug in your power adaptor and
then last but not least on the top right
hand side is a USB C port and then you
see obviously the antenna for your Wi-Fi
and on the right hand side there's just
a grill allowing the heat to dissipate
away from the unit there's actually no
fan this unit whatsoever so it's
completely silent and on the bottom you
guys can see that the Azul bi can be
mounted to your TV simply by the vase
amounts now internally although the
specs are kind of light they're still up
to par for doing the things that I said
earlier the CPU inside is an Intel quad
core Apollo Lake now this CPU has a base
clock of 1.1 gigahertz but it actually
has a boost speed up to 2.2 gigahertz
there is 4 gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of internal storage and the
graphics processor is the Intel HD 500
which actually shares part of that 4
gigabyte memory if you want to add more
storage you can do that one of two ways
on the board there's actually an m2 slot
or you can add external memory via the
SD card slot and another cool thing
about the bite is it comes pre-loaded
with Windows 10 Pro so you don't have to
worry about any updating or anything
like that it's already done all you do
is plug in and go now as far as what
comes in the box I'm not gonna really do
a traditional unboxing because there's
just not that much there's the unit
itself the remote control the power cord
the Quick Start Guide and it also does
come with a cool coupon that you can use
to get 73 percent off another product ok
so you guys can see that the bike 3 is a
very small unit now internally like I
said it's not really powerful enough to
play any of the mainstream games but
there are a lot of mobile games you guys
be able to play if you want to candy
crush cards any of that kind of stuff
you'll be able to do but if you try to
play any actual real games the frame
rates get kind of
because honestly this isn't meant for
gaming it's meant for the person who's
looking for a PC to do their business so
ho that kind of stuff
surf the net and have a small imprint on
their life or to actually put in the
back of their TB and use as a streaming
device this wouldn't work very well for
building your own streaming device so if
you want to build one of those hack
devices that you can go out and watch
all those free movies that they have out
there this is the perfect device for
doing that now with that said though
let's rock out and let's check out the
benchmarks that we did do on the bite
three
so the bottom line here folks is if you
have $200 you're looking to buy yourself
a mini PC that can put anywhere and take
up no space with such a small footprint
then the bite 3 might be perfect for you
this model comes into the locket like I
said at about 200 dollars they have
varying models but if you do buy this
model it has that coupon so you can get
something else if you wanted to get
multiples of these it would actually be
worth your time really even more with
the coupon but at the end of the day hey
it's a nice little unit I want to hear
what you guys have to say I know that
$200 some of you might say oh I can
build another computer and all that but
nothing this small we actually try we
started thinking okay what will our
audience say will they be like this or
that and yeah you can build a system
that's probably a little bit more
high-end than this for $200 but you're
not going to get anything that's this
small and it'll mount in the back your
TV and can be used for so many different
situations that aren't for gaming so I'm
Elric like usual down below like button
we'll have more information about this
and thanks to Coursera for bringing the
video to the table so peace out we'll
see you guys back here on Tiger tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
