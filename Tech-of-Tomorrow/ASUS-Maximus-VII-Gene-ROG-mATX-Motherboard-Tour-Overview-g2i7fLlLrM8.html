care once again on tech Eduardo we once
again have a special guest mr. Asus
himself JJ who's gonna be going over one
of their brand new boards for the z97
chipset now this is the ROG gene board
now the gene board has been actually one
of the most popular series of
motherboards that these guys have ever
made the last generation when a lot of
my friends came to me for a board when
looking at what they had to be offered
they said wow that gene works for me so
now we've got a new gene and let's hear
JJ talk about why you're gonna want to
take a look at this yeah definitely I
mean first and foremost it's an rog
board and like we've talked about with
our mainstream series overview a lot of
what we're gonna be talking about in
terms of the features and functionality
are gonna be not only on this Maximus 6
gene but also what apply to our Maximus
6 hero
so the ATX version of this board and of
course you know with ROG the focus is
really for gamers enthusiasts tweakers
tuners overclockers you know if you're
somebody that has a passion for tweaking
tuning and really looking for that next
level experience in gaming and
enthusiast class motherboards then our
G's gonna do it for you and we've spent
a huge amount of time and effort to I
think really bring an awesome level of
functionality and feature set to the
board so if we take a look here at our
Maximus 6 gene one of the first things
you're gonna see is the new ID that we
have in terms of the overall design so
I'm just going to go ahead and pop this
little heatsink back on here just to
give you guys some some little bit
visual it looks a little bit bigger than
the previous version gene 2 is a little
bit bigger a little bigger nope
so one of the biggest things you'll see
is that we've gone for a matte black PCB
finish on the board so that looks really
clean really stylized we've gone ahead
and pulled back the actual white accents
that we've historically had an ro G and
gone for just red and black as far as
being the primary color set and we've
also and we've also gone with chrome
nickel plating on the actual CPU socket
as well as the supreme effect shielding
so the supreme effect shielding right
here is the actual cover for the ALC
1150 audio codec so overall it's got a
really premium look and feel and so let
me just under the quick J so you're
saying that the audio chip is actually
in this particular piece it's not on the
board at all it's actually in
and in this piece right here correct and
we'll go ahead and we'll remove that
we'll talk a little bit more when we get
to the audio section but for this
generation for the actual supreme
effects designed for the gene series
instead of having that isolated audio
design we trait we bring that over to
this discreet daughter card just like we
had actually with the Maximus 6 impact
board where it had this isolated supreme
effects daughter board card the Maximus
6 excuse me the Maximus 7 hero though
will still feature the isolated audio
design physically on the motherboard not
having this actual discrete card now one
of the big things that we did though
outside of kind of really bringing this
clean modern aggressive look to the RG
boards is we wanted to take it even
further and so we implemented a really
advanced new type of color technology
onto our PCB boards with this dual color
PCB so let's go ahead and pull off this
really nice high-performance heatsink
that we have here and we can take a look
at the overall vrm I just watch out
there be careful we don't want to touch
this thermal quite a bit of weight on to
folks now actually quite heavy can
double as a gun I definitely don't
advocate that so if you take a look here
a nice full gun a God of love all right
gun Oh gaming so if you take a look here
at the PCB you're gonna see that we have
this dual color PCB it looks really cool
it's subtle but it adds a whole nother
kind of premium look and feel to the
board that once you put that heatsink on
there you just see that soft red
accenting on there and this was actually
a really complicated process to be able
to achieve because when you actually put
the board through the high temperature
SMT process it changes the acro color
that's been pre applied so it took us
quite a bit of trial and error to be
able to hit the color consistency and
the color expectation that we wanted for
the RG series of motherboards here we
talked about her like one of my mom's so
we started baking the color the color
started changing we're like ah what's
going on so baking stuff had change in
temperature really can change the hue of
a matte color yeah and so it was a very
difficult process but one that we wanted
to have to really assert why we feel rog
is the absolute best of the best when it
comes to gaming and enthusiast class
motherboards even the process of the
thickness was complicated because having
it to be too thick could impact our
ability to mount the actual on board
components and affect their performance
and functionality but moving past that
let's actually talk about those
components one of the things that ROG
always prides itself
is the quality and the performance of
the VM components so this board
maintains a Terra tidge of having
class-leading components where we have
very high performance parts so we have
those niche econ 10k rated GT capacitors
so they have ultra long lifespan and
they have extremely high temperature and
extremely low temperature tolerances
along with very impressive SR
performance that's much higher than that
of Paz caps so what you're saying these
things aren't made us recycling beer
cans I told a fella they're the
antithesis of recycled beer cans we've
got these a really high-performance
International rectifier on single mosfet
driver packages which have very high
thermal efficiency they have extremely
high voltage threshold and they pair
really perfectly with these ultra-high
performance inductors which are fully
molded giving us a huge degree of power
output capability what that ultimately
dispels down to is it just means that
whether your stock whether you're
overclocked you can hammer on this board
and you have extremely stable stable
stable great power delivery and overall
can feel confident in the board design
and of course that pairs up perfectly
with this high performance sintered base
heat pipe design that helps to keep
everything cool and effectively
regulated now from there we course still
keep our dil a dual digital power design
not only for the CPU but also for the
DRAM so that gives us a whole bunch of
advanced features and functions within
the UEFI and the software to be able to
manage the board for efficiency or for
performance for however you want to
tweak in tune the board so moving from
there of course you're gonna see that
there's a huge number of fan
connectivity and for both the here and
gene they're gonna have tons of fan
headers that are all supportive of three
pin or four pin fans on top of that for
this generation we're giving you the
ability to output the control signal for
DC or PWM operation
so with PWM operations support that
means that we can go ahead and put on a
fan splitter and be able to run
additional fans that are controlled
directly by the motherboard now on all
of these new series that are coming out
now as all this technology pretty much
translating them across to the ROG
through the main stream through every
segment is this technology pretty much
across the board all those board for fan
expert 3 it's pretty much unilateral so
there are going to be some of course
features and functions that are
exclusive to certain segmentations such
as other features are going to talk
about whether it's going to be supreme
effects or key bought or things that we
haven't yet touched on but something
like fan expert 3 we consider an on
so everything from our z87 - a to our
saber-tooth z97
to our z97 WS to the z97 Pro they all
feature that so moving on from there in
terms of the fan controls we've talked
about all of them supporting three pin
four pin DC and PWM but you're also
going to have the ability to map
temperature input control so that means
that you can pick more than just the CPU
as being the source that that actual fan
header responds to so there's gonna be
different options available to you the
UEFI that you can set it such as being
able to respond to the PCH temperature
giving you more flexibility to go ahead
and define how you want that actual fan
an actual cool more per area
yeah and ultimately just gives you a
flexibility make sure that the area's
you want cooled can be effectively
cooled as easily as possible
so beyond that if you want I'm gonna go
ahead and do it just set that guy down
there but I want it JJ's I want to JJ it
is pretty awesome moving on from the fan
header support we've got Scott voltage
Reed points we've got debug LED we
course have this little guy with the
memo K button for a single touch over
excuse me single touch troubleshooting
for memory related issues whether it's
mix and match dims memory may be failing
or you want to use it like a semi clear
CMOS where you can just go ahead and
reset the board for my frequency voltage
and timing standpoint believe all your
other let's see I thought that was what
I couldn't remember anything I hit that
button in my memory would become okay
you know maybe for the next generation
mm okay we're not there yet but we're
working on it because sometimes you know
I'm I know you're totally especially
with art with our boards right we've got
so many functions and features so moving
down from there and it's Christmas list
moving down from there we've course got
your power connectivity we got front USB
three for the front USB three of course
just like the back USB three we're
supporting our USB three boost to be
able to improve performance
for storage devices such as USB flash
drives external high speed SSDs the back
USB ports of course we also give you USB
charger plus so you can quick charge
your devices like smartphones or tablets
even when your system is turned off let
me ask a question JJ one thing to be up
asking me for like two ROG series
motherboard support higher in memory
than say the mainstream boards or is
that pretty much a feature like if
you're like you're like we're summer one
of the other boards or the mainstream
that supports like you know 3,000 memory
is that possible than ROG boards
or even higher than that or is that
other feature that's unknowable uh it's
well for us it's kind of non-negotiable
every single board we're gonna have
enhanced DRAM topology layouts to be
able to optimize and have great DRAM
overclocking
so really it's gonna go from outstanding
to just insane on ROG ROG boards like
this gene has already been validated for
over ddr3 3200 the hero has actually
been validated for ddr3 3300 so beasley
memory speeds and realistically probably
none of you guys are ever gonna run d
around that fast but the boards are
validated to do it we can just you know
take the ddr4 and just tape it in there
you can definitely do that going down to
the serial ata both the here on gene
they're gonna have tons of serial ata
connectivity with the PCH as well as add
on a s media 1061 we then move over into
secondary storage both to here and the
gene are gonna have MDOT to support but
it's only gonna support pure PCIe they
will not support m dot 2 SATA so just
keep that in mind we're only gonna
support the fastest MT based solutions
with pci based devices on this
particular board on all of the rog
series board as i noted for both the
hero and for the gene okay they will
only support pure PCIe the advantage of
that though is that since we're not
going to run the legacy are essentially
the slower serial ATA which would be the
same speed as a normal system on the
side of sixty port is that you don't
lose any ports when you use this slot in
conjunction with other pieces yeah
mancom will compare to m2 base SSD
performance right so we're focused on
performance and connectivity here for
the RG series so of course you've got
tons of PCI connectivity both boards
will be SLI and crossfire of course you
got the socketable chip which is great
in terms of being able to use the USB
bios flashback technology you can plug
in a fast drive no CPU no memory no
graphics card just power you can update
and recover your UEFI ROM chip or you
can go ahead and use it to easily update
the board either which way that one's
also removed was well correct correct
and like you noted it being removable
and worst-case scenario if you can't use
USB BIOS flash back to recovery
you could contact everyone get a new one
pop it in there as opposed to
competitors which are using soldered
based designs so moving past that we go
into some really cool functions on sound
so 4-seamer pre supreme effects we've
really focused on always giving you guys
the absolute best quality sound as i'm
possible
and for this generation we're definitely
maturing that and extend the uneven
further actually yes and you definitely
guys want to check out is some demos of
actually showing you what we're talking
about do we're located right here we're
going to show you guys can check out a
video we actually did some testing and
showing you some of this great stuff for
supreme FX for 2014 first suit so for
2014
while the gene has this now on an
isolated dot aboard the hero will still
have the isolate audio design so you
still get the Elna audio grade capacitor
is the operational amplifier the
shielding to the audio codec the
improvement to the gain the noise floor
isolation but we've got ahead and done a
couple of other really cool things so
one is we have sonic soundstage so
that's going to be a button that you can
go ahead and press on the board that it
Just's the actual operational amplifiers
hardware register to one of four
different presets the great thing is
this is on a pure Hardware scale and
it's essentially the same as if you were
to physically change the op-amp but
without having to do so exactly and
there and actually folks there's only
really about seven total options out
there that you can get which different
sound ranges so having four is almost
having the full gamut of everything ya
know it's a great deal of flexibility
and actually well there's actually a lot
of op amps that you can get out in the
marketplace the problem is that the
audio circuitry is generally only
designed for a very specific type of op
amp so that's why I'm saying there's a
lot different makers but as I've been
like doing them there's usually it seems
like about seven different like what I
would call like tonality what I mean
there's a kazillion coming but there's
only about seven different tonality
between the hard and soft which you can
change out and get our sure and you
really have to have it really specific
here to listen to some we're so close
that unless you're like a high-end
golden ear person you're not gonna
notice it anyway you're 100% right so
with this we've also gone with a
hardware out because it's going to give
you the flexibility to have this also
supported in things like steamos
but of course for users once you get
this all installed in the chassis you
can entirely make these adjustments real
time in the operating system so you can
either adjust it via the button here or
you can do it in the OS now in addition
to that we've also incorporated another
entire software suite that's going to be
accessible in the operating system
called Sonic soundstage
sonic soundstage make sure to guys check
out that overview video because it's
going to go into depth a very
interesting all the new options that we
have such as Virtual Surround
base adjustments support voice clarity
support impedance control all kinds of
really awesome functions but talking
about impedance that's another new
feature so we've got the sonic sound
sage we have Sonic studio but we now
also have a sonic sense amp the sonic
scent amp is gonna allow you to go ahead
and plug in your headphones into the
front headphone connection and
automatically detect your headphone
impedance so whether it's 32 ohms 64 150
50 ohm it'll automatically set it to the
correct it and this actually is folks
something that nobody else is doing so
so many other company you see comes down
the line and says oh were the originator
this you're gonna how about full of crap
there because this actually really is
and totally ASIS original I have not
seen anybody use anything like that and
I think it's something that honestly has
just gone right are the top people's
heads but it's actually really something
damn cool yeah so overall I think that
we're giving you guys the absolute best
sound experience for you know for
whether it's gonna be music movies or
games you guys are gonna have an
outstanding experience on our G Series
motherboards and of course for you guys
that are really that discerning and want
the absolute best sound solutions then
of course we have an entire range in our
products for users that even want to go
to higher higher degrees so moving them
around beyond from that we've got ki
baat ki baat is a really awesome new
function so a lot of you guys out there
love your mechanical keyboards or love
your keyboards well we want to be able
to even give you more functionality from
your keyboards so what we did is we
developed an entirely new
microcontroller that we have here on the
back of the motherboard called the ki
baat microcontroller so what happens is
this little microcontroller well.when
and in conjunction with a specific USB
port you plug in your keyboard you'll
press this button and it will activate
the key bought microcontroller so
this'll allow us to go ahead and do
advanced functions such as be able to
hit the delete key and boot straight
into your UEFI or you could single touch
enable XMP or a single touch enable CPU
level up for one touch okay with power
without power so even if your system was
entirely turned off you could hit the
Delete key would turn on your system and
jump straight into the UEFI mitzva s5
mode yes s5 correct in addition to that
we're also gonna give you the ability to
fully customize macros shortcuts and
function keys and you're also even going
to have the ability to do exporting and
importing so as we get feedback from you
guys on even new functions and features
you want for keyboard you're going to be
able to program this to your liking and
the
to share profiles amongst each other to
be able to have the absolute best and
flexible keyboard experiences keep off
focus days gonna be really interesting
especially for you guys out there were
like me do a lot of testing you guys can
set up a bunch of different things
directly in the keyboard and then have
your system booting to that so if you
have a like four or five different
overclocking profiles or different
things you want to use the memory
testing you can set it all up to keep up
when you hit that kid automatically
boots to it
so no more action to go back in the BIOS
make those changes resave it right from
the get-go you just hit your key in away
you go yeah we're really excited about
key BOTS and definitely we're really
looking forward to feedback from you
guys as well as you know you guys that
are testing it to be able to incorporate
the types of features that you're
talking about now but we've got a great
set of functionality right off the bat
that you guys can begin using with key
BOTS and it's going to be on all these
our G Series boards so that's another
new rog innovation that we have so
moving on from there if we just go over
to the rest of the connectivity you've
got tons of connectivity in terms of the
back i/o where you can see a course
you've got your USB 3 and you got your
USB 2 connections and we've got also of
course the Intel Gigabit Ethernet jack
now of course with this Intel Gigabit
Ethernet we've done a huge amount of
testing to be able to ensure that it is
absolutely the best network controller
for gaming performance as well as
general performance and as we showed you
with some of our testing results that
we've done with a chariot we're getting
absolutely outstanding UDP performance
that is much better than competing
solution yeah a lot of people they rave
on about the killer Nick but overall
from my testing what I've seen the Intel
solution works better overall a lot
better packet control and a lot less
loss and actually for us we've seen that
the community you guys love the Intel
based solution its maturity and its
performance in its consistency as well
as the Intel processor management class
functionality is really unmatched but
for this generation we've taken even
further and we've gone ahead and
incorporate in game first three so game
4 as 3 has been entirely redesigned from
the ground up internally by our
networking team along with our ROG
development team to be able to make a
program that has far more flexibility
and customization for tweaking and
tuning your packet priority for whether
it's games music browsing downloading
whatever might be and it's also agnostic
it doesn't care if you want to use it
with the Intel NIC port you can use it
if you want to add in a PCIe wireless
solution in the M combo card that's on
the gene or USB or PCIe solution on the
hero
guess what it doesn't matter you can get
that game first Packer priority control
any which way you want just don't want
those people at Westboro Baptist Church
hey you say that son outside of that
we've also physically improved the land
Jack remember when I showed you the
actual network controller the old
generation rises totally revamped out
you guys I don't know if you guys done
this but you plug in all of a sudden you
lose that connectivity
I don't just happened you has happened
to me we're all of a sudden I plug
something in Jack looks like it's
working fine I'll send you're getting a
yellow signal well this new jack actual
eliminates some of those problems yeah
so what we've done here is we've
actually gone from the handmade base
Jack that previously is this and we've
gone to a new one that has surface
mounted design and it also has been
designed to be able to enhance surge
protection as well as ESD protection
so we've rhetorically had ESD and surge
protection mounted onto things for like
your USB ports but not for your Ethernet
port so now we're giving you the
absolute best quality connection for
your Ethernet port as well so overall
when we look at all the ways that we can
improve your experience from the
hardware based design to the audio
experience to the networking to the UEFI
to you know your keyboard and so much
more you're really getting an amazing
experience with rog series motherboards
and we've also course integrated new
functions and features as well in the
UEFI that we haven't even talked about
as well as also keep in mind that all
rog series motherboards all come
included with a full one-year license
version of Kaspersky antivirus as well
as they also come with a full licence
for daemon tools pro standard so
wrapping things up if we also take a
look some of these little cool Hardware
accessories that we've I got here
remember you can easily and effectively
add Thunderbolt support to an orangey
board by just dropping in the
Thunderbolt exe to card so if you want
to be able to have high performance you
know uh external high-speed storage then
BAM you're good to go with that if you
want to be able to add in qi wireless
charging support for your smartphone or
your tablet you can go ahead and pick
one of those guys up and you can rock
that if you guys want to be able to take
advantage of NFC we also have the NFC
breakout box and this is gonna allow you
to take your smartphone your tablet pass
it over and do things like quickly log
into your system quick launch
applications you can transfer over
photos wirelessly you can even do
Bluetooth and video streaming straight
from your desktop with your device by
just holding it over and then streaming
over that video or stream
/ that audio and lastly I know you've
been digging it out but we also have
awesome accessories like The OC panel
which previously used to come available
with our extreme series board which is
compatible with both the gene and the
hero and our new ROG front base that
thing is amazing looking yeah the RG
front base has a dedicated shielded
stereo signal cable to give you the
absolute best experience for your front
headphone and microphones that also can
be paired up with any Rd series
motherboard so so if you guys never see
JJ again this is his last video you
noticed because we kidnapped him to keep
that front panel I'm just saying let his
mom know he's safe though locked in our
basement well I love you mom I think
