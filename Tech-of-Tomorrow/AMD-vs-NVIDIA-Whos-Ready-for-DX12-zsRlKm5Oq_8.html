know that Windows 10 just got released
and along with that rolled out DirectX
12 now a lot of people are asking all
around the world hey is there a big
improvement or any improvement at all
between dx11 and dx12
well obviously there are some things
going on a lot of controversies going on
stones are being thrown I want to say a
special thanks to hot Hardware I
actually caught this story over on their
website where I got the idea from so
thanks a lot to you guys appreciate that
we'll have a link back to that full
article down below but the big news is
is that basically there's controversy
lots of controversy and is it a level
playing field right now well it really
doesn't seem so so DirectX 12 is here
but what is everybody using to test
DirectX 12 I mean there hasn't actually
been anything that's been out yet that
truly does it other than synthetic tests
such as you know things like from future
mark in that but if you want real gaming
stuff well ashes of the singularity is
the only thing out that actually tested
all of the functions of the DirectX 12
API and it's actually a benchmark that's
cut from their upcoming game so this
thing's gonna be based on a real game
that's coming out - it's real solid
gaming test now here's where all the
controversy starts coming out everybody
right now is currently testing with a
high end Intel CPU they're all using the
i7 59 60 you guys all know that that's
all the high-end stuff that's not like
the lower end stuff that's the super
high-end stuff so that right off the bat
means ok we're using the best of the
best right there but when you're testing
with an AMD card between DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 you're seeing an 80%
performance jump that's right 80%
performance but when use a 980 on those
same tests on the low setting you're
getting about 8% of a performance boost
but when you put it up to the high
setting you're actually getting a
decrease of 12% now obviously now by the
way in video if you're watching this
door is oh I'm just giving the news out
don't be pissed at me personally for
just being the delivery boy on this now
NVIDIA is really pissed off about this
they've already said
to all the people I guess including a
hot hardware to they sent them an email
and said hey that's completely BS their
test is BS well the people who made the
game said hey no it's not BS not
whatsoever
like we've already showed you guys the
code they laid out all this stuff and
said hey no way man you had your
opportunity you guys know the code and
video fired back with hey you know just
like when DirectX 11 came out in the
beginning
hey this isn't going to be that way
we're going to have all of our shit and
it's going to work it's on you it just
seems like all the controversy is coming
around MSAA
and the way that it's used because I
guess by some ways it's on by default
and that's causing some problems now
obviously we know that regardless of
what's going on Nvidia is going to fix
this problem so even if it is true that
right now that Nvidia isn't completely
DirectX 12 ready how many people have
actually jumped over to Windows 10 I
know there's some people but a lot of
people I know I've already said look
this and I've already switched back to
8.1 or seven depending what their
preference was so huh it's just really
crazy stuff so you guys heard it here
I mean DirectX 12 is here but if you're
playing an upgrading right now you want
that performance you might want to be
taking a look at this and watching news
as this unfolds because obviously this
is going to be a very heated debate the
people in vidi are gonna be very pissed
off but hey this game ashes the
singularity just for the simple fact
that it pissed in video office is gonna
propel it into the limelight because
Nvidia fans AMD fence everybody is gonna
be jumping on this bandwagon and be
going hey man what the fuck's going on
here so either way hey those guys are
gonna be popular what do you guys think
I want to see your guys's comments down
below is it really a big deal do you
guys think that Nvidia is actually
screwing you guys or do you guys think
it's just probably some coding issue
that somewhere somehow is just not right
let me hear what you guys have to say
down below in fact let maybe your
comment you'd be really cool so what do
you guys think is it ashes of the
singularity is that their fault
are they the guys who are making the
problems or is it and videos fault for
not having their shit together and
the drivers and everything ready on
their end let me know down below but
there you guys have it right now you
could probably start on a whole talk
show thing we could do like a Jerry
Springer Show on this entire thing at
people throwing chairs going crazy
though real oh I'd really like to see
you getting there pairing with Roy
Taylor you guys throw some blows I'm
just kidding there but that wouldn't be
fun yet the fans would love it even for
the joke matter so i'm mowarin
thanks for watching Tech tomorrow thanks
very much the people over at hot
hardware I will have a link down below
to the original story
hope you guys like this news but that's
what it is man directx12
is out is nvidia really ready I don't
know time will tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
