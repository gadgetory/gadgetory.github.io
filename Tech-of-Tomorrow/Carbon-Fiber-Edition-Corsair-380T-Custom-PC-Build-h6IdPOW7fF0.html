the tech verse of tech of tomorrow and
this week we've got something really
cool for you guys the very last of the
hydro dip case builds that's right and
if you guys have followed the channel
you guys know that we had a series of
cases that we got from our friends over
at Corsair and we've basically been
taking these things and getting them
hydro dip so you guys are probably going
what the hell is hydro dipping look for
you guys who missed the hydro dipping
we'll have links up here where you guys
can check it out and go check out those
previous videos where we show you the
whole process of hydro dipping as well
as some other earlier series of videos
now the particular one we're looking at
today is based off the corsair 380 t now
there wasn't really a whole lot of space
to be hydro dipped but the tricky thing
about this particular system was we had
to completely disassemble it then dip it
and then put the whole thing back
together again but you guys can see it
does look really really cool it goes
really well with the mesh on the side of
the case and the color combination just
overall on the outside just looks really
awesome I like it I think you guys will
as well if you guys do hey hit that like
button and let it snow that's really the
only way we know other than your
comments and you're welcome to leave
those as well now this thing was so
small that we had to find a certain
motherboard to fit inside of it cuz we
could just go out and just randomly pick
we had to get a really small motherboard
so we got the azuz z 9 71 plus really
small motherboard and powering that
motherboard is the Intel i7 4770k
now you guys are gonna see the entire
liquid cooling system on this thing was
kind of crazy we were like building the
system and then me and they were like oh
we don't really have something like
right here in house that we can use so
we had to actually custom build one so
anthe totally took the parts from an
Intel one and of course there one and he
bastardize it and that's the cooler that
you guys see here and it worked out
pretty well also able to fit inside this
very easily a GPX 980 this is the
reference model I don't know if the amp
Edition one that I have the
got from ZOTAC will actually fit in here
it's a little bit thicker but I'm
thinking it might but for now you guys
can see we put a reference Edition IAT
in there no problem at all for our
gaming storage on this we're using a
Corsair Neutron XT 480 gigabyte SSD and
for the memory we've got 16 gigabytes
now this is Kingston's white HyperX
this stuff's running at 1866 megahertz
not for the power we've got something
from the people over at silverstone this
is there strider gold 750 watt series
power supply and the cool thing is
though is that all these parts actually
fit inside this small case I mean let's
just face it the 380 t is not a giant
sized you can take this thing with you
anywhere you want to go and from the
outside it looks really cool through the
mesh you can actually see the video card
and you can see some of the cable
management inside another thing is cable
management on this was a little bit kind
of you know Hankey cuz there really is
nowhere you can hide the cables in such
a small case if we would have spent a
really long long time trying to probably
get the cables hid we probably could
have done it but with this series of
videos we're more showing off the hydro
dippin and what it's about and the parts
and stuff that are put inside of it they
can be interchanged anything that you
guys want but I think this case actually
is really cool for small bills
it looks great hydro dipped it's clean
right looks really nice the only
drawbacks I really see it all to the
build personally is that cable
management like I said is a little bit
difficult here hiding all the cables and
stuff is going to be you know a little
bit hard to you folks out there though
you guys get the same case you guys can
do whatever you want with it as well and
choose the component so though we're
showing off the 380 showing off the
system it looks pretty cool I know is
kind of a short and quick video saw like
a super long like we're doing but we
still want to show you guys this build
and this case so thanks for watching
teka tomorrow I'm Ehlert we'll see you
guys back here for more stuff this week
including dual tight neck scores a 980ti
overclocked amp edition for the people
over at so tech so stay tuned we've got
a lot more coming in fact I even think
we have a system that we're giving away
so like usual though
however if you like this build and you
think that you like the parts in it you
like to build one yourself and even try
to top it make it better than ours down
below that like button they'll have to
show me more click down there we'll have
all the information and links to where
you guys can buy these parts for
yourself please leave a comment down
below we'd love to see your guys's
comments we love to interact with you
guys if you're not sub and you like what
you see hey what's up and I'll see you
guys back in your sub box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
