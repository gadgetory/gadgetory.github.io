you win so obviously I won that battle
right oh come on I seriously I won that
piece Kagami robot things we came across
our freakin awesome they're really
interesting gift idea thing because
they're so cool if you like RC cars
remote-control stuff
drones you're gonna love the kamigami
robots and these things are cool because
they can do all a whole lot of different
things and they can be operated off your
iPhone or off your Android whatever you
got whatever has smart device you're
working on these things can be operated
remotely from them and they're really
cool and what's even better about these
things is that you can totally put them
together with your family and with your
kids and let's real quick let's show you
how to put together a kamigami robot
before it kick some ass unless you have
a problem with a lot of small parts and
working with them assembling the
kamigami is pretty easy it comes with
all the instructions the only thing is
that you do have to go online to check
them out but once you do if you have any
type of brand in your shoulder and
you're even a little bit mechanically
inclined you can put this together and
like I said what I really think is nice
though is that a father and son or a
mother and daughter or any family
members can get together and they can do
this project together and that's one
great thing about it it's the holidays
the holiday means spending time with
your loved ones and opening this up on
Christmas Day and being able to
dissemble with your child and watching
their eyes light up as you start to play
with it is an awesome thing and one of
the best things I think about this
product
so now that you got the kamigami
assembled what do you do well it's
simple you simply download the app
install it you're up and going and then
if you have either one or two or
multiples of these different robots you
can connect to them you'll see a screen
comes up and it'll let you choose
between the different robots you have
and then once you're in there you can
simply control it and what's cool is you
can change the different colors there's
three different color variations that
you can do but you do have total
movement control over the robots and
there are even some things in there
which you guys will see where you can
actually fight and have fun with the
thing there's a few different modes that
they offer for having fun and actually a
challenge mode but I think the biggest
challenge in the fun step is just to go
free-for-all and have fun like we did
because obviously this shit's hours and
hours of fun and if you want to pull a
prank and scare the crap out of somebody
oh they have afraid of the dark mud what
was afraid of the dark mode well when
you turn out the light so the little
robot goes crazy I guarantee you got
some sleeping kidding you put that up by
his bed and run that thing he'll be
jumping and screaming and praying for
safety the monster under bed
and the sample pack offers three
different modes dance spinning in a
circle and zig zags like drunken boxer
knee you guys can see buddy the dog our
co-host he loves a little kamigami robot
at first he's like what the frak is this
thing and what's it doing here what do
you play with a little bit now Roxie the
cat though as soon as she saw that
her ass took off and went into hiding so
we had to trap her with a dual robot
attack these little guys wanted to grab
himself some alright guys so I
don't know about you but this to me this
just farts fun everywhere because it is
a lot of fun works great on carpet
pretty much on any surface except for
like dirt and rocks we tried that don't
work on that at all and don't even waste
your time it's not really good for that
but any type of thing like that even on
your grass it works okay but you guys
can see this thing's just totally fun
and you can do it with a friend you get
two of them you can do battle modes all
kinds of fun stuff now I'll be up mid
I'll be admit I'll admit two battle
modes and stuff they have the zooming
bullet nut stuff it's kind of not really
that much of a thing operating and
controlling and having fun with it using
light mode where it you know does weird
stuff that's I think is a cool or thing
but you know the sumo thing in the
fighting thing it's more fun to me if
you learn how to control it better and
if you had a joystick
would it be much easier to control is is
right now trying to learn the phone is
kind of tricky but you know I'm sure
there's some people out that will be
really good at it because when you take
these things from across the room and
just Ram them straight at each other man
and that's just fun stuff so at the end
of the day folks we have information
about these down below like button hope
you guys like this stuff but if you're
looking for an interesting gift
especially for a kid these things are
cool I wouldn't say that for a little
tiny kids you know I mean but a kid who
has a you know smart thinking brain who
can understand this is gonna love the
crap out of it you can chase your pets
with it you can use it in the night time
to play around and joke around with your
family all in all I just think it's a
lot
fun I know you've been watching ticker
tomorrow time to go kick Jesus's ass
