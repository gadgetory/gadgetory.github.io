it's just the nature of the beach anyway
say we're going to be looking at ghost
recon future soldier so the future is
here and i'm about to go kick some ass

1440 and 1920 x 1080 let's go do some

hey everybody so you guys can see that
even though we changed the resolutions
on there the frame rate pretty much
stayed the same I mean you didn't seem
to lose very much in this game at all by
going from 1082 1440 it just seemed
pretty natural on that game I thought
