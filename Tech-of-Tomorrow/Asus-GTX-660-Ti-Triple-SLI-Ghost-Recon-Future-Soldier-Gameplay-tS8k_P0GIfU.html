Elric fares here once again the ticket
amaro youtube channel
continuing our line of videos based on
three that's right
triple SLI gtx 660ti s we happen to be
using the asus cards all the way across
the board you guys can see them back
here behind me in the test station now
today's video a lot of people talk a lot
of crap about this coming about their
games but this game is actually still
pretty fun even though I'm sure you guys
are gonna make some hateful comments
it's just the nature of the beat
anyway say we're gonna be looking at
Ghost Recon Future Soldier so the future
is here and I'm about to go kick some
ass so let's go check out gameplay at
2560 by 1440 and 1920 by 1080 let's go
what happened near the well there
I spotted two more
for the park
there's another one where is he another
right
I'm locking your way watching
we need to get eyes on their cameras see
what we're dealing with on me
watch your left he's gone
that's a lot
all right folks so now we saw the gaming
at 1080p
now we're gonna jump in and raise the
stakes it's 2560 by 1440 level 2 let's
jump in
it's got an assault rifle
what
that's about a two more over in that
building do you want
holding for your son
working for do it
hold up that in Dao
move it covered
he's got the soul back
nine o'clock that tree
what's the status
go
firefire your work
hey everybody so you guys can see that
even though we changed the resolutions
on there the frame rate pretty much
stayed the same I mean you didn't seem
to lose very much in this game at all by
going from 1080 to 1440 it just seemed
pretty natural on that game
I thought gameplay was pretty cool this
game is pretty fun I know a lot of
people out there have caved this company
for saying they take things and pour
them crapoly and just between me and you
folks yes all right there were a couple
in that really sucked balls but this
one's still pretty fun hope you guys
enjoy it leave your comments below we'll
see you guys here on techo tomorrow
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
