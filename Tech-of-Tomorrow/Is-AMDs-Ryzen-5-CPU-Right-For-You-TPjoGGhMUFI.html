again detective tomorrow so we've all
seen AMD's rise in seven CPUs and they
were pretty badass
especially for those people who did
content creation first and gaming second
now for those people out there who beret
no really super duper picky and they
care for those view frames per second
more well then obviously in AI 77 and a
few i5s actually did beat it in just raw
gaming performance now the thing about
the entire r7 series though is that a
lot of AMD fans are fans of let's just
face it they're fans of budget they like
being like the underdog isn't a fighting
thing to do but they still like that
great price point now with B CPUs they
came into the market starting at $300
all the way up to $500 making them more
expensive than a lot of the other you
know Intel CPUs out there so for raw
gaming stuff and just gaming obviously
the Intel CPUs were just a wee bit
better you know straight out of the box
now you could overclock the out of
your risen and still you know start
getting those scores but that's
overclocking your thing taking your risk
of it breaking changing voltages all
that kind of crap with some people out
there let's just face it they just want
to hop on their computer and they want
to play they don't want to around
with anything they just want to play
their games in the simple and best
environment that they can do right out
of the box now risen 5 is right around
the corner and this is where I feel AMD
is really probably going to shine and
kick ass and until it's probably going
to go what are we going to do about
this because think about it with the r5
they're going to cut away all that super
fancy stuff that they had you know on
the 1800 X and they're going to make
this CPU much lower in price now gaming
performance we all know you can have
80,000 cores it's not going to really
matter because most games are single
thread very few of them take advantage
of multi threads the ones that do
obviously the higher you know core is
going to matter but for the most part
having an eight core CPU versus a 12
core CPU versus a six core CPU when it
comes to sheer gaming you're not going
to see that much of a difference
whatsoever so if AMD can get the r5 out
to the market and get it at a price that
so just unbelievably cheap that people
are just going
look I want that I mean let's think
about it most people out there are very
budget-conscious some people just have
all the money in the world they'll pay
for whatever they want because that's
just the way they are but I really think
that most people especially in countries
that are you know I know trying to
insult anybody but saying third-world
countries or places where it's hard to
get stuff especially like places like
Jamaica I have some friends they're
super freaking hard to get technology in
Jamaica
I even think Africa is the same way so
if you're one of those places where just
money is not prominent you want the best
price to performance difference in
honestly I don't really think that if
you're only going to see like four or
five frames per second unless you have a
monitor or something that this really
matters why would you buy anything else
so if risen five hits the market and
it's got a great price I think it's
going to be the cpu for you I know I'm
definitely going to be trying it out I
should be saving should be receiving my
test sample kits here very soon so we
will have all those scores for you this
time on time for launch data
everything's fixed today MD but I want
to know what you guys think do you think
that AMD's risen 5 cpu is going to be
the cpu for you I know a lot of people
out there are highly anticipating this I
am as well so I'm with you so let me
hear what you guys have to say do you
guys feel that AMD's rise in five is
going to be the sweet spot especially
for the gaming market I mean obviously
unless you're a super smooth and you
those few frames per second matters to
you I think most people are going to
jump on the AMD bag and wagon and get
their selves into some cheap gaming I
mean if you can get a PC for almost the
price of a console I mean come on now I
admit lately I started playing console
gaming again it's pretty cool but every
time I tried to play a first-person
shooter game I just got frustrated is
frickin help oh my god I can't control
this plus I'm old my fingers are
kind of up from playing guitar
for years so it's a bitch so a mouse and
keyboard thing for me is cool so if you
can basically pay for a mouse and
keyboard setup which obviously you can
hook up any of those controllers to and
still play your games I think that's a
much better solution than a console I
would probably never actually really buy
a console anymore except for Rocksmith
because I love that what days
I'm Network anyway anyways I'm Network
you guys are watching Tekken amaro I
want to hear what you guys have to say I
think AMD's risen 5 is going to be a
freaking huge success if the price of
right on it and they can match up
motherboards it will still match that
price they're going to have a
solution on their hands it's going to
really kick ass and remember Vegas come
in as well so more stuff for Randi
coming here on TECA tomorrow peace out
we'll see you guys back to more tech
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
