new plus for a free extended two-week
trial period Hetal de Hulu Plus com
fuller slash Quixote Baca fans welcome
to the arena now who's fighting today
well I've got two cards in my hands one
from the nvidia camp which is red and
one from the AMD camp which is black
what are these cards well this is the
MSI Twin Frozr gaming edition in this
hand this is the GTX 780 Ti the cream of
the crop card pretty much from people
over at Nvidia for the gaming enthusiast
now some of the cool things about it are
is twin filter technology featuring
these two fans and the card actually
does change clocks we just will talk a
little bit about later now in this hand
I've got the wind force r9 290x the bad
boy of the AMD cam this is the wind
forced overclocked edition and this one
actually has a switch for silent or
turbo mode now as far as the power goes
both the cards require a single six pin
and a single eight pin power connector
the really difference between the cards
as far as size go is well obviously the
AMD card is a little bit longer so with
that said let's jump in to the battle so
the battle begins and it starts with
pricing now the Nvidia version of the
car right now is costing seven hundred
and sixty dollars so you can get the
Twin Frozr gaming edition you can get
that bad boy for seven hundred and sixty
dollars now the wind force overclocked
edition of the r9 290x is an amazing
eight hundred and twenty-five dollars
that's right eight hundred and
twenty-five dollars why is this well all
the Bitcoin technology and all that
stuff's coming out has inflated the
price of these cards just outrageously
this card should come in to market about
$600 so there's quite a bit of
difference right there between the two
cards now obviously this may change the
people who are viewing this video down
the road so make sure you always check
the link down the description we have
all the current pricing and listing
both guards next up let's talk specs
first up we have the msi gtx 780 Ti twin
frozer now this card can be clocked in
three different modes via their software
we have the silent mode which is 876
megahertz
the gaming mode which is 980 megahertz
and then we have the overclock mode
which goes all the way up to a thousand
eighty five megahertz this card also has
three gigabytes of gddr5 memory clocked
at 7000 megahertz and it's a 384 bit
memory interface now in the AMD side of
the fence we see the gigabyte r9 290x
1-4 specs as this a thousand 40
megahertz on the core clock which is
overclocked it also has 4 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory running at 5,000 megahertz
but unlike the nvidia card the r9 290x
is a 512 bit memory interface now for
our testing purposes we did things a
little bit different because obviously
these cards are supposed to be the
badasses of the badass so you know why
take a sports car and drive around a
parking lot right so wait as we test it
everything in ultra 4k glory that's
right know 1080p no 1440p no 1600 p
we're talking total 4k baby first up we
see Crysis 3 which is on its high
settings of 3840 by 2160 now the msi gtx
780 Ti had a score of 33 point 3 Everage
frames per second the gigabyte r9 290x
on the other hand had 31 point 22
average frames per second giving the
lead to the msi card just a slight lead
but still only one quick note about our
testings in case you guys were wondering
both these cards will ran at their
overclocked mode so that means Bolton
were set at the very highest settings
for when they're doing the testing at
the highest resolutions
next up battlefield 4 on its ultra
settings on the msi gtx 780 Ti we see 31
point 7 6 average frames per second on
the gigabyte r9 290x we see 28 point 3 7
average frames per second once again
giving a slight lead to
the nvidia card now this next fact is
going to be some that's actually going
to blow a lot of your guys's minds when
we used mantle on the AMD card we got 15
frames per second so obviously does not
seem like nano is up to the old 4k next
up we see witcher 2 at its ultra
settings the msi gtx 780 i had seventeen
point nine one average frames per second
the gigabyte r9 290x whoever had sixteen
point eight eight average frames per
second
next up BioShock Infinite on its ultra
dx11 settings the msi gtx 780 Ti comes
out with forty nine point six for
average frames per second the gigabyte
r9 280x had 44 point seven nine average
frames per second
next Tomb Raider with its ultra setting
see Laura Croft in her underwear at 3840
by 2160 oh yeah msi gtx 780 Ti scores 33
average frames per second r9 290x by
gigabyte 29 average frame per second I
think we're starting to see a trend here
folks
next up mutagen heaven it's extreme
settings that's right now the Nvidia
card got a score of 444 the AMD card 379
let's keep going
stalker Sun shafts scary and it's ultra
settings msi gtx 780 Ti it's 70.8
average frames per second gigabyte r9
290x at 60 4.7 average frames per second
next up Metro last light on its high
settings msi gtx 780 Ti at 32 average
frames per second the gigabyte r9 290x
at 28 average frames per second next up
let's talk about temperatures of the
cars because this is something that's a
very very important factor I mean let's
just face it unless you're an Eskimo
who's living up in the Arctic you really
don't need a card to keep you warm you
want your card to be really really cool
now something I say right off the bat is
aftermarket cooling is really paying off
a lot more for the r9 290x way more than
the 780ti disseminates the iCard ran a
reference pretty damn good now with
these two cards we see the Nvidia
card running at 74 and the AMD card
running at 73 so hey
here we see AMD taking the lead and you
guys all know that the r9 290x was one
hot mother so in this category it's a
really totally thumbs up for the wind
force cooling now let's talk about
something that really doesn't get
discussed too often the loudness or the
decibel level of the cards now the
gigabyte card does however have three
fans and it's running its supreme
overclock mode you can run it in silent
mode but it would change the entire
parameter the situation the msi card
however is running at 52 decibels not
too bad the AMD cards running at 62 and
a half so it's a little bit louder on
the AMD side of things but remember the
r9 290x was a very very hard card to
cool we even thought it would need a
water cooler but the wind force is doing
a pretty damn good job on this card of
keeping it both quiet and cool alright
folks there you have it I really hope
that you guys enjoy this content and the
way that we're bringing it forth to you
but one thing I have to mention is this
video would not even be able to be
brought possible to you folks without
the help of Hulu Plus so I just want to
send a shout out right now to Hulu Plus
and thank them for making this video
possible for you so I know many of you
piece of users out there know what Hulu
is but do you guys really know what Hulu
Plus is because Hulu Plus is like a
whole different level
Hulu Plus is like taking that standard
video card slap on the watercooler on it
and getting the absolute most bang for
your buck just all kinds of content now
with the standard Hulu you can only
watch it on your PC but with Hulu Plus
baby you can take that on the go on your
tablet on your phone with Hulu Plus you
can catch up on current shows binge on
old favorites or watch a great movie
stream as many TV shows and movies as
you want anytime anywhere you can also
check out exclusive content including
whoo
originals like the wrong mans and behind
the mask best of all you can watch all
of this content and HD now I know a lot
of people always ask how can you guys
support the site well at this time you
can support the site and get your guys a
free extended trial period just by going
to Google Plus calm for / - you
ot where you can enjoy a plea plus for
two weeks so let's wrap this up folks
you guys can see in most instances in 4k
the Nvidia card is coming slightly ahead
of the AMD card now one thing that's
gonna seriously change the dynamic
though totally is the price 760 versus
825 I know it's not really that much of
a price but to some people that might be
all the difference in the world now I
have to say this if the r9 card was the
$600 price love that it was supposed to
be it would be the serious ass kicker
across the board now in a perfect world
yeah things would roll that way but
we're seeing the price and these things
really really expensive right now and in
a perfect world you're actually gonna
probably need two of these cards running
an SLI or crossfire mode to push that 4k
properly our testers a single card
showed it being pretty good you know
those frames per second 33 is not you
know - I stretching but you're gonna
want something that's gonna pump a lot
more pixels across the board also the
AMD card is a little bit louder like I
said before that one's coming in and a
little bit higher at 61 and a half
versus 52 so there is a little bit of a
sound difference there and the AMD card
was as I said slightly cooler though
than the Nvidia card so you guys make
the decision at the end I want to see
you guys's comments down below let me
hear what you guys had to say and also
if you guys want to see all this stuff
in 1080p 1440 leave a comment down below
like the video and tell us hey we want
to see those scores we'll make sure that
we bring them to you so I'm Elric thanks
for watching Tector tomorrow
we'll see you here for more videos soon
