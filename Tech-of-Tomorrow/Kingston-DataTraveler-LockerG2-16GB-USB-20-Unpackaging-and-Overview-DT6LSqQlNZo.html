friends it's me eric and buddy the dog
from a tech of tomorrow youtube channel
bringing you guys the basically
unpackaging and the overview of a brand
new product from the people over at
kingston this is a new data plus locker
and g2 the one I got in my hand is 16
gigabytes they come in 4 8 16 and 32
gigabyte models the big thing about this
one is is basically its security
features so now let's go ahead let's
take it out of its package and let's
talk about all the features that you can
do with this new kingston little drive
alright so as we take this thing out of
the package let's talk about something
basically this thing has hardware
encryption it says the best and personal
security to keep your data safe superior
password protection user sets a password
to prevent unauthorized access I think
that's like most things that have that
it says its first of all works
interchange between mac OS x and windows
systems flawlessly secure drive locks
down and reformats after 10 invalid
login attempts which means it basically
some fool tries to take your drive 10
failed login attempt to just format to
drive your informations been saved it's
also easy to use no application
installation required now this thing's
stylish has a durable metal casing with
a built-in key loop and it's
customizable which means if you have a
company if you'd like to make this look
like your company they have a co logo
program available in lots of 1,000 or
more supports windows 7 vista XP mac OS
x it's also got a five year warranty
with free technical support now like I
said before these come in 4 gigabyte 8
gigabyte 16 gigabyte and 32 gigabyte
models now as far as speed goes it has
10 megabytes read and 5 megabytes right
no admin rights are required now this
little data traveler is based off the
USB 2.0 design it'll work in three point
0 obviously and it's backwards
compatible and at one point it will just
be slower now as far as the dimensions
it's 228 by 0.7 3 x 38 or 58.00
millimeters x 18 point 6 millimeters by
nine point seven five millimeters there
are operating temperatures is between 32
f + 140 f so pretty much work in any
type of environment so that's it folks i
mean basically this thing's 50 bucks
that's very portable it has data
encryption which means you had some
information on there you don't want to
share with anybody else if somebody
tries access it a bunch of times they
will be at so well because all the
information will be wiped out and also
if your company out there and you'd like
say this honor I've honestly thought
about doing this from music just getting
one with a bunch of elric Ferris on it
putting my music on that I give them
away you can do this for your company
it's something I'm going to actually
look into not a price per tick Uhler
drive because this is probably too
expensive but on a lower
one but if you want portability you want
data protection and you want your
information to be solid and not be lost
taking a look at this new kingston 16
gigabyte data Locker plus g2 might be
something you'll be interested in see
you guys back here on TECA tomorrow
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
