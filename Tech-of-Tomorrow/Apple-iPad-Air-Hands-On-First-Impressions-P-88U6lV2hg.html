here on TECA tomorrow we're bringing you
all the tech all the time now today
we're going to bring you guys some
technology that I know that my pc fans
are gonna go uh her and that's this new
iPad air now the reason I got this thing
is my buddy over at TLD got ahold of
this thing and I was like man that seems
pretty cool and after looking at the new
note 10.1 from Samsung I really like
that tablet quite a bit it's cool has a
lot of the same type of features but I
really rely on stuff that does music
stuff you guys all know we're always
doing music stuff and with that
particular unit I couldn't do music now
with this one I can use GarageBand and
me and Jesse the guitar play or me and
Jonathan we can exchange all of our
ideas back and forth so that's why I
went with this one now this thing only
weighs a pound it comes in the market at
about four to nine dollars and they go
up you know in price as you're going
along this one right here has an a7
processor which is a dual-core processor
which actually kicks ass on a lot of the
quad core processors that's right just
like you know the eight core AMD wasn't
meeting the intel quad core welp this is
the same type of deal with optimization
all that this thing's apparently kicking
ass in all kinds of programs now I just
borrowed the thing I thought you guys
might want to see it because some people
out there are going to be saying hey I'd
like a tablet I'm musician I want to do
that 9.7 inch screen the resolution this
bad boy is 2048 x 1536 now that's
nothing really new they've had the
retina technology and all that around
for a long time but this thing's like
really really thin up on top you have
the power button you also have the
headphone jack over on the side you have
the mute button and you have the volume
controls on the bottom we also have a
lightning connector which is not new but
something that is new are the dual
speakers that are located on the bottom
now as far as camera goes there's a
rear-mounted 5 megapixel camera that
actually shoots at 1080p and a front
camera that shoots at 720p now if you
have to be curious about how that 1080p
camera look
in video format here it is right here
here's me and the buddy the dog in the
backyard he's chillin like a little
villain and this is what it looks like
so you guys tell me good bad or
otherwise let's jump back to the video
now this thing is also very very thin
7.5 millimeters the a7 processor that's
in this they only uses processor in the
iphone 5s and this one's even
overclocked a little bit above that one
hence why it's supposed to be so very
very powerful like I said before if
somebody out there is looking for a pad
and your musician and you want to be
able to share your ideas around with
everybody else there's so many things
out there that you can go by and just
stick on a table plug in and plug
directly into this order your iphone now
like i said i don't have an iphone at
all i have my new note 3 and i love that
I'm not switching that at all but as far
as my pad goes I'm really leaning
towards this one it's ergonomic it's
light weight the screen is very very
beautiful now one thing missing there is
no fingerprint reader on this and I
could rightly give a about that
because it means nothing to me a finger
perimeter in fact you guys saw the video
we were joking around about of people
went crazy they thought we were actually
showing people how to hack the damn
thing but no we weren't doing that we
were joking around by cutting you know
kevy stomach that's what it's about but
you know I like this thing and something
new the color I know you guys are going
to totally make fun of this believe me
me and Anthony totally mock Jonathan on
this one they call this one space gray
yeah well someone was smoking something
they were out of space when they were
naming it cuz to me you know looks kind
of silver but hey it's not it's new you
know space grey now last but not least
before i bounce out of here or I asked
those guys like how long their battery
life was and they said this thing's
lasting about 10 hours so if you're
actually know up and working more than
10 hours in one space hey thumbs up for
you had her but me I'm momentum maybe
seven eight hours at the most so in my
normal work day this would work for me
all day long I could charge till the
next date and be up and going like usual
I want to hear you guys's comments on
this down below personally I'm looking
forward to trying this thing out and
exchanging my songs with other people
out there like i said if you're somebody
who just totally hates on apple products
you just want to hate on them too
you can go ahead and leave your comments
below but they're too crazy we'll
probably just get rid of them because we
like a nice family fun clean site well
somewhere right in between I guess
anyways I'm Alaric peace out if you like
this video and you guys would like to
see more on this let me know I would
just bring you guys my first looks an
impression on it and that's about it
also if you're not subscribed and you
want to do so well then hey hit that sub
button down there there's also a like
button you guys know what to do hell I'm
out of here
can be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
