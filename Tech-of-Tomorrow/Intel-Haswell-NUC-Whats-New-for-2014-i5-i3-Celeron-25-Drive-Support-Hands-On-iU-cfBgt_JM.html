with TECA tomorrow I'm with two
gentlemen from in town they're gonna be
telling us some brand-new stuff about
the nuk so gentlemen introduce
yourselves to my fancy new who you guys
are yeah so I'm joined efforts the
director of marketing for the Intel nuk
team I'm Alan clamping on the technical
marketing engineer for not right on you
guys have some cool stuff to show right
that's right we hope so you know so you
get to know so tell MA yeah so we got
three new skus that we're launching here
at CES we've been shipping this newer
has well knock here in core i5 and core
i3 flavors here for about a quarter and
we're getting a lot of feedback from
people that they would like to see the
nuk with it two and a half inch drive
support ah and as you notice when you
open up this box you see the set a
header on here and you say well we're
not making very good you so that's add a
header and this one here and our
response to that is SSDs find technology
for performance and reliability but
we've also acknowledged that maybe we
need to bring some skews to market from
Intel that support this to an F inch
drive so that's what we're announcing
here at CES blink and so this is an
empty shell of the chassis I just wanted
to open an up real quick and kind of
show you what it looks like inside if
stripped threads there oh hey well I'm
trying to unlock stuff sometime you
should see it doesn't want to cooperate
cut it I'll be like trying to get it out
like what's going on yeah so this is
really similar to this as you can see
from the outside it's pretty much you
know the same it's just a little bit
taller and that tallness really gives
you that room for
half-inch drive back home awesome okay
and so you can put an HDD spinning drive
there after two terabytes or you can put
an SSD in there as well and maybe have
that SSD in addition to the msata SSD
you can raid the two you could
potentially do MST you know rst caching
between an HDD and SSD down on the board
any plans on using ngff it all down the
line with this yeah so we'll get there
in just a minute so this has been a big
question of prison yeah so next
generation of product will be m dot 2 so
current generation will continue to use
mini PCI but you'll see I've got two
coming from us down the roads and it's
like it's up for one terabyte right now
it's you can get those right through Sam
Sam sons a new try little cash yes yeah
exactly technology drawing all yeah it
sure is so the free skews you can get
from Intel now they're all shipping you
have two core i5 high-end quad 3 and
then we've also got this cool new
celeron ski of coming out here based on
selling out like a POW sure yeah and the
reason this we think this is cool
because it's going to last they hit a
price point that was previously
unattainable with the nuk we've gotten
some feedback from the press and various
customers that say we love the NOC but
we'd sure like a more affordable version
well with this one you can populate it
with your HDD and get a you know similar
configuration to the SSD one but hit
system price points fully configured
without the OS but everything else less
than two hundred US dollars Wow and then
how about for the how about for the
top-of-the-line model what without me
coming to market depending on how you
load it right you're probably system
price point once again in the six
hundred plus range and probably in the
it for the core i3 maybe in the 450 +
rain no do you guys I know you guys have
like like didn't really dabbling a lot
like and doing like video technology do
you guys have plans all of your own bike
till I even do more high-end video stuff
and implement in these types of machines
in the future
you're talking graphics here yes
graphics so the so this version hero of
HD 5000 graphics which is just one stage
short of hitting iris drive an iris and
iris pro are the premium graphics for
mental you can get versions of this type
of form factor from gigabyte today that
do support iris pro and we've actually
been showing that off here at CES as
well so some your third-party vendors
actually have these days well I would
call them more of a ecosystem you know
partner okay and so so gigabyte has
their product line called the bricks
which is very similar to the next same
type of technologies and category of
product and isn't pretty much all the
stuff that's inside of the brick so
pretty much this your technology just
inside of their box well i would i would
say the board technology is very similar
i would also say that cake based on a
fine job with the innovating around the
chassis xand at their system expertise
is brought a lot of value to the table
that's really how the ecosystem works
right we make each other better maybe we
can find some things feeds and they
provide some things we help each other
along and the end result is a better
product for our customers alright and so
these are the three new products coming
from coming from us now and other cuz
what's the maximum memory that person
can update these two sixteen cases and
everyone's okay add 810 3 1600 yeah yep
and so um and i believe this one has
once long it has one game / you get
update get gigs on the on the entry
level 16 gigs on the on the to premium
web and prada what you got back here
back here well this is something for you
to actually play with it is actually
that what you see there populated with
exception of memories so you get to make
your own memory so what you actually see
in this it's a nun bagging but i will i
will do it a deep boxing and opening
that all right check this out you can
actually know in what we actually put in
there for your treat just bagging
disassembly yeah make sure there's
there's actually a way you have to do
once you actually get the cables
connected to actually easily remove
the hard drive gray and we'll actually
get this all shown here what a lot of
tulle all right well it's a kitten
hyperx Oh David me I'm looking David
they love you you know that matter of
fact one of the his guys Louis k &amp;amp;
oshiro I don't know you know I'm all I
have so there you go that is the actual
intel SSD it is the 530 model and it is
the 240 gig gigabyte in size now you can
actually see we actually have a daughter
card here which is actually slides into
I don't know if you can catch that and
then the other thing is right there yeah
and then you have one screw there and
one screw there to actually retain the
actual hard drive or SSD then to
actually to get below this with the
cables like this this when if you try to
pull it out this Cable will actually
kind of latch onto here and and stop it
bring it out because you can just
basically no you just pop it up like
that and then will relieve you I usually
drive actually pulls out completely
before you got even trying to remove
yeah SSD Drive oh that's perfect and
then we also put in the air there a one
of our top end Wi-Fi cards is the 7260
AC module and so just put the memories
in and away you go that's right so if
you if I gotta walk around the show and
buxom reefers me right now hey that's
right yeah right exactly Kingston will
be the guy who visit we've told the
other press that you hate just to go do
that yeah so we're gonna go do this so
we'll go around with our little mini box
if we get so far that's an order tonight
there you go it's what we'll do yep yep
so another thing to mention with in
previous generations of north we have
ship with power cords and people got a
little delayed by that so all production
versions of the nut today now have with
power cords big smiles everybody
multiple countries are supported so like
smiling Bob any other thing to make note
of that so you just have that we use the
standard power problem we've done you
know since we started so now we have the
different power cords with the different
connectors on the end right for
different gos well with this one right
here we're going to start up the wall
board the solar our model seller models
going to have a wall wart it's only 35
watt because it's the basically lower
lower power right so we don't have to do
this is by what we have this one but it
actually has all the different Gio's
connectors so you basically slide off a
cover slide on whichever connector you
actually need for us EU UK whatever and
even the cell on version though I mean
folks did email it's a really low in
tomorrow it's fine for people who are
like checking their email just doing
words to your perfect Roger will 1080p
video and as well yeah entry-level home
theater PC you were so yeah so basically
you have a whole solution that's
basically you know no bigger than your
hand and that's what really the big
thing about nuk is that you can take it
pretty much anywhere put on your desk
but taking it any real estate and get
high power in a little box absolutely
yep very well said your heart alright
thank you thanks folks we'll see you
guys back here for more videos at CES
2014 see ya somebody's really calling
the end the same time
and be
with me
