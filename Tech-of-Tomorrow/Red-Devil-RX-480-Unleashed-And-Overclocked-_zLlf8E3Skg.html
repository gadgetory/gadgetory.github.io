welcome back once again to Tekken
tomorrow Elric here so check it out we
brought you the full review of the
powered color Red Devil RX 40 and the
car did pretty damn well
so the first BIOS that came out it
wasn't doing all that hot but now we
have a completely unleashed BIOS that
allows us to overclock this card and you
will be very surprised at the results at
the end of the day we got this thing to
overclock insanely and for once using
the trick software now at the new bios
we were able actually to increase the
memory speeds which really made this
card super duper fast so without any
further ado let's jump in let's check
out our test system how we did this and
the results and see how badass and how
fuckin amazing this card really
overclocks
at the end of the day our test system
consists of the following parts the cpu
we're using is an intel i7 6700 that we
keep at turbo mode at 4.4 gigahertz for
the motherboard we're using asrock z170
overclocked motherboard and for the
memory we have 16 gigabytes of G skills
rip JA memory and for every test we use
the latest drivers available at the time
that we did the testing if you buy
yourself a reference our X 480 its clock
speeds are gonna be at twelve hundred
and sixty-six megahertz
this card had thirteen thirty megahertz
for its normal clock speeds but we were
able to get this clock up to 1400
megahertz and we were able to overclock
the memory up to eighty-five hundred
megahertz which is simply incredible at
twenty one twenty five you see a big
difference so that's really incredible
speeds for the first time ever we're
able to see some memory increase which
we haven't seen before and that equaled
in great amazing overclocking everything
actually works really good the
temperature was only at about 68 to 69
Celsius so that's actually quite amazing
for the overclock on this card so with
that said though let's jump in and let's
actually see how the performance changed
between the overclocked version and the
standard version and sandwich of a big
deal is so with that said let's rock out
to the benchmark song and let's check
out the scores with the overclocked
scores and the standard scores and we
can even see it against the ten sixty
which i think is the standard card goes
you'll be pretty surprised let's
okay so you guys can see the power color
Red Devil rx forty especially one that I
have here in this little box it is an
overclocking fork in beast up to
fourteen hundred megahertz even able to
overclock that memory we're seeing two
to three frames per second better and a
lot of games and as you guys can see
it's actually beating a reference ten
sixty pounds edition now if we take it
and we test it against some of the super
clock cards that are out there like the
EVGA oh and maybe the scores will be a
little different maybe look into their
video to the future but for now you guys
can see this card overclock is extremely
rocking sixty nine Celsius the
temperature not bad at all great speeds
great performance those two to three
frames per second push it just slightly
ahead of a founders edition 1060 so if
you're an AMD fan hey today is a day to
celebrate
I'm millwork you've been watching ticker
tomorrow like usual all the information
about this video will be down there
below that like button
hopefully you AMD fans out there really
dig this video because it shows your
buddy the RX 480 is an ass-kickin maniac
especially when it comes in the Red
Devil format</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
