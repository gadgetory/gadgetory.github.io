here on TECA tomorrow I'm an orca what's
going on today well today we've got
something that's pretty damn awesome in
fact I think this is gonna be the
fastest card that we've seen in house so
far the things extremely fast this right
here is the app extreme edition gtx
980ti amp extreme epic string so it's
not like somebody like you know your
crazy psycho drug but even more so well
anyways that's name the card it's
supposedly like I said super duper fast
unbelievably fast I think you guys are
gonna really jump into this thing and
this card's made of actually a four
separate pieces which is kind of cool
it's got the back plate got your PCB got
all of your aluminum heat fans and your
heat pipes and then you've got the fan
slapped on top and that makes this card
so the label you guys have been saying
Hale right show us more that unboxing
stuff you used to do in the old day so
I'm gonna go ahead and do a little bit
of that for you so I'm just gonna go to
the top cap here pull out the box for
you guys out there who wanted this then
you've got it I'll be gentle with the
cabmen hand it over to him you know nice
and gently unlike the old days I thought
right
yeah so giant size box ZOTAC logo being
on top it's right I open with my teeth
we gotta say like that
so inside we've got more stuff so
adapter VGA DVI VGA for all you guys out
there who are using a VGA adapter on the
980ti with 4k resolution got to be chit
connector for yet yeah
cables we're gonna show these probably a
little b-roll later anyways but - check
it out - eight pin cables come with this
as well that's right there move their
card and man oh man oh man this is a
frickin Beast beast right yeah it's a
beast no other way around it and okay
that pretty much sums up the part
Cameron you're not getting out of it
that curtain easy pal anyways alright
with that said though let's actually
move on talk about the card see the
scores and pay the price on this bad boy
let's move forward before we take an
in-depth look at the card let's talk
about some of the specific features that
ZOTAC cavs one of them is their eco BAM
which basically dual blade fan systems
this card has three of them on it that's
actually helping keep the car cool it
blows away the heat helping it to spin
out of your system they also have their
power boost power boosts for stability
and then last but not least they have
their ice storm which is based either
beyond thermal design these are all the
technologies designed to keep that card
cool and running good while you're doing
the overclocking and while we're on the
overclocking they also have their
firestorm technology this allows you to
do all your work locking in real time if
you're into that type of stuff so ok
folks those are the special features now
let's actually take an in-depth look at
this car first of all it's big it's
black how big and black is it well let's
get the measuring tape in let's take a
look here so we're going to be doing
this and our little thing that we doing
in America I know the rest of the world
uses metrics will translate into metrics
for the rest of the world we know that
you think we're all fucked in the head
and we do this but a sorry that's just
how it is we use inches so holy shit
12 inch car I think it's a lady pleaser
so just leave that at that
now some of the really cool things about
this cargo are definitely its cooling
system all along the side of the card
you guys can see their aluminum heat
fins as well as those copper heat pipes
allowing all the heat to be sucked in
and out away from your car then those
three fans will blow it out in your
system and hopefully your cake pans will
suck that heat away from your car now
the only thing that could be better is
that this thing was water cool but as
far as air cooling goes I think that so
techs been a damn fine job here and
regardless of what side of the card
you're looking at other than the rear
i/o the cooling system is definitely
prevalent you can see it and it looks
cool so obviously on the top there are
those three fans with the dual blade
technology we talked about before
underneath that we can't really actually
show you the coin system it's like
disassemble the entire card but it still
it looks absolutely cool we flipped the
card around at the back side there is
nothing there you can't see any
components or anything it's completely
covered and as we flip and spin the car
go to the other side we see now the
zotac logo the two 8-pin power
connectors the two sli fingers and once
again like I said we can see the cooling
system now as far as your i/o goes it
offers something unique as well a single
DVI d3 display ports and a single HDMI
port which is great for multi monitor
connectivity now in the back of the card
that's where things get even more
interesting in shape it's real I mean
these guys obviously want you to be in
the overclocking world hence why this
thing comes overclocked out-of-the-box
we'll talk about that we get to those
few things with them right in the back
you get this gold thing that says power
boosts and then look at this man
unbelievable
push though right pushed it
so that's they're wanting you to do so
on the bottom you get the single PCI
finger
so pretty much folks this card is
totally decked out it looks awesome it's
very very ginormous pull the card
oh I guess probably I should probably do
some of the other measurements just in
case anybody cares what the clearance
it's five inches high and about two and
a quarter inches wide so those are all
the dimensions now at that said let's
jump in let's talk about the
overclocking features then let's see
those benchmarks and I think you guys
are gonna be really impressed if for
some reason you're a person out there
who has no idea what the gtx 980ti is
please make sure you guys go check out
our other video which came out a launch
date where we reviewed the reference gtx
980ti it's awesome and we'll have that
right here on the screen up by my head
you guys can click on that video and go
check it out so if you didn't do that go
to that first then come back the real
things that separate the zotac amp
Extreme Edition are its overclocking
basically out of the box it has a base
clock of twelve hundred and fifty three
megahertz and a boost clock of 1355 the
memory is also boosted by a thousand
megahertz so you're getting overclocking
right out of the box now how well this
is gonna translate when you start trying
to use their software overclock it I
don't know because you pay a supreme
price to get this stuff out of the box I
think it's kind of like pushing those
limits and that's what you're paying for
but what that said now let's jump in
let's check out the benchmarks and those
scores and I think you're going to be
surprised on how fast
not all cards really deserve but totally
like metal doubt song going with them
but you guys can see that in the
proverbial words of Samuel Jackson this
card is just one fast motherfucker I
mean let's face it
it's the fastest card that we have
tested yet it gets a little bit hot I
admit at 71 Celsius is a bit hot but hey
under full load card ran fine
never crashed never had any kind of
errors whatsoever so it's rockin it's
got a neutral color to it it'll go in
any system if you're a fan of Nvidia
cards and you want the best of the best
this card is definitely one of them like
I said out of the box it's overclocked
1253 that's much higher than the
standard base clock which is that 1050
so incredibly overclocked card the
drawbacks to it obvious they're going to
be the price at $700 because it's very
expensive but if you want the best of
the best you're gonna have to deal with
that caveat and dish that cash out baby
like usual all the information about
this car will be down the blood like
button hope you like this style of video
if you do you know what to do so if you
want to buy one Hey there'll be a link
down there for you to get one for
yourself and if you're not soap and
you're like what you see the name say
subscribe and for those asking its I
know you are next Friday
LG we're actually this Friday since I
film this video there but look for it
this Friday we'll see you on Tekken
tomorrow I know it
