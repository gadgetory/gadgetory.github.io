back to another edition here on TECA
tomorrow this time we're featuring
something that's pretty pricey but damn
does it look awesome I'm talking about
Corsairs brand new Vengeance RGB memory
kit now this kit that we got it's a 32
gigabyte kit 3000 megahertz it even
features an XMP profile which we'll show
you in just a second here and I think
all in all it's pretty cool the only
carry I gotta say up front is this
memory is a little bit over three
hundred dollars so it is go and show all
at the same time real quick let's jump
in and let's take a look at our BIOS and
here you guys can see that now this
memory offers an XMP profile that's
right an XMP profile just like you saw
on previous intel boards and you guys
can see that I set the XMP profile to
profile 1 this set the memory at close
to 3,000 as I could get because there's
still some issues with am for memory
this is being resolved but so far there
are still some boards that just don't
quite recognize the exact speeds of some
memory one quick thing I want you folks
to take notice of during our testing we
use the RGB fusion software from
gigabyte we weren't able to actually get
Corsair software to work with this
particular motherboard because like I
said a m4 is still new and a lot of the
drivers are still being caught up as far
as memory control and all that stuff I'm
sure it'll all resolve itself in a
little while but right now we're using
the gigabyte software on this demo now
as far as colors go obviously you're
gonna be able to get every single
solitary color that your eyes can see
and you'll be able to control that via
the software that comes with it or the
software that comes with your
motherboard either way you'll be able to
change all the lighting the gigabyte RGB
fusion software it's still pretty cool
though in the basic mode you get 8
different types of things but
unfortunately one of these 8 which is
called wave didn't work first whatsoever
now you can change all the colors
altogether with this software program in
basic mode you have pulse mode you have
music mode and all that type of stuff
now it's really cool about the advanced
mode however though is that you can
control every individual LED in the
entire system whether it's on your
motherboard your peripheral or the
this is really cool because you get so
many different colors that you can make
this thing just look like a glowing
rainbow or if you're a mad at simplicity
you can just change it to one color and
just look clean and cool the advance
mood is something that's really neat
though because if you want to change a
bunch of colors and you want something
that's only stated to you you can do it
in advance mode you guys can see an hour
build however how cool these lights
really look the RGB effect isn't for
some people but for those people who
really like it it really adds another
dimension to your build the ability to
change all those colors to set things
like pulse music gaming any of those
type of things that control your
lighting is also really cool so if
you're a person who likes to have their
music and your lights blaring like a
disco you can do it if you like your
lights pulsing like you're breathing
like Darth Vader you can do that as well
actually it's pretty much endless the
combination of things that you can do
using the right software I'm not exactly
sure how well the Coursera software
works compared to the RGB fusion from
gigabyte but I'm sure that they're
pretty much similar software they're
both used to control lighting aspects of
your system and I don't really think
it's gonna matter where you use the
software that's for your motherboard or
the software that comes from Coursera to
control your memory now how exactly
different the Corsair software is we'll
bring you another dedicated video to
that and show that in the future but for
right now this is the system bill that
we're gonna be bringing to the table
like I said before this is the producer
system I think you guys are really going
to like it so I'm Mel are you guys been
watching Tekken tomorrow like usual down
below we'll have a link to this memory
so if you're into this type of thing and
you want some killer looking memory this
may be your a ticket I know you've been
watching techy tomorrow we'll be back
for more tech this week guess what
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
