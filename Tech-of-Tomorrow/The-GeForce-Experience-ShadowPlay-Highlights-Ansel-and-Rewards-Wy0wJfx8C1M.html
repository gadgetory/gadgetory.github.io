back here once again on the channel so
what are we gonna be doing today well
we're gonna be talking about all the
great things about being on Team Green
owning an Nvidia video card and getting
all the great support from them which
makes being a gamer a great experience I
mean there are all kinds of cool things
that I know many of you folks out there
are hardcore gamers you're gonna say hey
I know the seller but hey there's always
a new gamer everyday and for those
people I want to bring this information
and video has asked me to talk to you
guys about which is really cool things
like shadow play shadow play highlights
ansel and more so let's just check out
this information and see why you guys
get a lot more than just a video card
when you're on Team Green having more
games that are optimized to play better
on the Nvidia platform and having the
latest drivers are very cool aspects of
the Nvidia experience but in today's
gaming market many players like to share
their experience online whether they're
broadcasting it or they're capturing the
game footage or just doing anything that
has to do with sharing your gaming
experience online and video makes this
as easy as possible and they do this
with shadow play there are a lot of
different features to using shadow play
but the three main components you're
gonna find yourself using our instant
replay manual recording and broadcasting
accessing shadow play is very easy all
you do is hit the alt Z Keys and then
the window will come on screen so you
can access the different features to use
the instant replay feature you simply
hit the instant replay button now you
can change the settings from this to
record the last 30 seconds or all the
way up to 5 minutes of your game so once
you have instant replay selected and
you've set the settings to the amount of
time you want to record once you're in
game all you have to do is hit a certain
set of key combinations and then will
automatically save for the amount of
time that you specified and if instant
replay isn't your bag baby you can set
up hotkeys to manually record your
gameplay you can start and end
recordings when you want and for however
long you want as well
alright so check this out you're a gamer
and you want to share your live gaming
experience but you don't want any
hassles doing it let's just face it you
want to get in and
shadow plays broadcasting features are
meant for you you can share your gaming
experience by just two clicks of a
button and you can do this either on
Twitch YouTube live or Facebook live and
the shadow play also offers custom
camera and graphic overlay so you get
the best experience you can get another
emerging technology on shadow play is
shadow play highlights now shadow play
highlights is for the gamer who wants to
do nothing but concentrate on playing
their game and making their kills
and what shadow play highlights does it
automatically captures your killing
spree and death so you don't have to
worry about hitting any hotkeys to
capture your kills now currently it's
only on a couple of games but there'll
be more coming out as time goes on Ansel
is another aspect of nvidia x' gaming
platform and it's something that's very
new and it's actually an artistic
movement that is really coming into
light right now because what it does is
it allows you to go inside of a game and
take different pictures of the landscape
and stuff and then take those pictures
and actually adjust them just like a
mini version of Photoshop and honestly a
lot of people are doing this for a
living nowadays it's emerging and
becoming a technology that people are
using more and more as the days go by I
mean in the old days you could use as a
standard like screen capture thing and
capture something and yeah that was okay
but Ansel is really a lot more than that
it allows you to change the camera angle
that's right you can actually change the
camera angle change things around to
custom take a photo just like you would
in real life so instead of just
capturing the screenshot which is just
basically a 2d representation of what
you're looking at with Ansel you can
actually change things around and take
the picture from any angle and any
direction that you want and then after
you take that picture you can take it
into the software and totally edit it to
make it custom and totally awesome to
share to your audience
okay so like I said at the very
beginning of the video if you're a gamer
in the know and you're already on Team
green you know all the benefits of the
Nvidia platform it's much more than the
latest drivers and most games that are
optimized it has lots of features for
sharing your gaming experience online
and with the world and invidious goal is
to make this as easy as possible for you
nothing fancy all just a couple of
clicks a button and everything that
you're doing can be shared with the
world and it can be done without a
hassle and let's just face it folks a
brand new Star Wars game is coming out
Star Wars Battlefront 2 and guess what
it's optimized for NVIDIA that's right
NVIDIA is always giving away free stuff
to their GeForce experience members this
month its players unknown battlegrounds
so make sure you have GeForce experience
installed in your computer to make sure
all your games are maximized and a
chance to win which will be announced on
November 21st get your game on
with pub G like usual folks download
like button will have more information
so if you guys want to go over and troll
the NVIDIA site and check out what it's
all about even more you can do so once
again peace out we'll see you guys here
on Tekken tomorrow for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
