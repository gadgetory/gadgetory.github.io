gadget hounds welcome back to another
edition of tech of tomorrow we're
bringing you guys all the tech all the
time so what's going on today well just
to let you folks know that we do listen
to you in our last video where we
brought you battlefield 3 at 2560 by
1440 what's new HD 7990 a lot of you
guys complain and say you really didn't
like watching the whole three minute
video so for you folks we're doing
things a little bit differently today
we'll have a link down the description
below to the full video but we'll have
some shots of it in this video that
we're bringing you today now today we're
bringing you guys Crysis 3 gameplay on
the MD HD 7990 and this stuff is a 2560
by 1440 s now what's really weird though
is the level that we're playing was very
very demanding the level were playing we
can only set the settings up too high
not to the ultra settings only to the
high settings the reason being for at
the ultra settings things were starting
to lag out just a little bit now as we
jump in here and we're seeing the
gameplay you guys can see that frame
rates are totally consistent at this
setting everything's running fine but
this is a very very demanding level now
I see you guys out there leaving all
your comments going oh man my computer
is sixteen hundred by nine here to get
these radical frame rates we'll check it
out 1600 by 900 is a far cry from 2560
by 1440 so go cry to your mommy with
those comments they're just not relevant
so they're folks that's just a snippet
of the gameplay if you guys want to see
the full-blown video make sure you guys
check out the link in the description
below that light fighter so next up
Google now has been released for i/os
now previous this has only been
available for Android users and do you
guys think that Siri is now dead for you
users of iOS out there tell me what you
think about this also we have a
full-blown article about this over on
wwq tomorrow if you want to get all the
details about this new thing called now
from Google alright guys now next up in
the news you guys have all heard about
the Samsung Galaxy Tab their Galaxy
Tablet now it seems like Samsung's
trying to release a version of every
different size shape and color that
there is now we see their third
iteration coming out and this is the new
seven inch model now this thing has a
seven inch screen but the resolution is
1024 by 600 it's not even Full HD but
the reason that Samsung has done this is
they wanted to keep the price very very
competitive so basically what you get is
a seven-inch tablet that's able to make
phone calls so let me just ask you folks
a question do you see yourself taking a
giant 7 inch tablet sticking it up to
your ear and making phone calls I just
really don't see that as being a
feasible thing and right now there's no
scheduled release of an LTE version at
all there's a 3G version that's supposed
to be coming out later what showmen you
obviously make the phone calls but LTE
is not even on the books so what do you
guys think out there do you guys think
this is just a ridiculous product do you
think it has its place would you be
interested in it let me see your guys
opinions and your comments down below in
the comment section and let me know what
you guys think alright folks so that
pretty much wraps up today's video I
know a lot of you people out there have
been whined to see the 7990 versus the
690 we have that video coming up very
very soon but for you people that are
impatient we actually have the scores
over on our website
