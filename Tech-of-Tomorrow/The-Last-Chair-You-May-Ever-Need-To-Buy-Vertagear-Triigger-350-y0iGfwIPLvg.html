everybody it's going pretty good here
and in fact we're gonna be taking a look
at probably one of the nicest chairs
I've ever had the pleasure of placing my
butt in now if you guys watch the
previous video we brought you guys five
chairs they ended at about 399 dollars
and I told you guys I got in a chair
that was like eight hundred ninety nine
dollars while I was actually wrong this
chairs only $6.99 and it's really not
touted as a gaming chair now it is part
of their gaming series the trigger 350
but the PL 6000 series is actually more
in their gaming line of chairs this is
more of an ergonomic office chair and it
has features that are just pretty much
very hard to beat across the board this
chair is very very comfortable it comes
to the market about $6.99 I can tell you
guys are not the bad that that's really
the only caveat about it but this chair
is very comparable to other really
expensive models the Herman Miller a non
series or I'm not exactly sure if I'm
pronouncing that right I'll have a link
down below his particular models for
which their be model which is a right in
the middle model is about nine hundred
dollars and this chair has a lot of
those same features it's very very well
made as an aluminum frame it's made of a
very very nice mesh it has real leather
all the way around the wheels everything
about this chair its ergonomic to use I
mean honestly beyond the price this
thing just totally kicks ass so let's
just jump in and let's check it out
so let's start from the ground up even
the wheels themselves scream hey were
high quality these are Holston hubless
casters they feature roller bearings for
a really nice look and intensely smooth
operation the wheels themselves are also
very very expensive if you were to buy
them on their own next up is the 5 star
steel base now this base is really
incredibly tough and the entire chair
comes with a 10 year warranty which
means that it's going to last a long
time
Plus anybody up to 350 pounds can
seriously sit in this chair and cause it
no damage whatsoever now right
underneath the seat is the dual spring
hub now this dual spring hub contains 80
individual components
including gears linkages shafts blocks
shields brackets fastening hardware and
so on
now this dual spring hub is incredibly
well made it features a specially
formulated mixture of steel with silicon
and manganese and is the key to the dual
spring design sticking out of the
right-hand side of the dual spring hub
is the tilt tension adjustment the tilt
tension the trigger can be adjusted with
a simple crank of the lever which means
that you can make it very easy to slide
back or very hard depending on your
preference one thing that's really cool
is the adjustable seat depth there's a
little button which allows you to move
the seat back and forth so depending on
your comfort level you can set it
exactly to be perfect for you the
armrests themselves on the trigger 350
are also pretty well adjustable now I
think this could be a little bit better
since the left and right adjustment is
kind of minimalistic but as far as the
hypo justement goes it's very very easy
you simply just pull up on the armrests
let it go and it locks in place and the
armrests themselves are actually forward
enough that my elbows fit perfectly
uncomfortably on them what's also nice
is that actually all the rest of the
controls are located right underneath
the armrest on the right hand side you
have the adjustment for raising your
chair up and down and this makes it
really easy to do and underneath the
left armrest is the tilt trigger this is
very very ergonomic and easy to access
and like I said earlier if the seat
moves back too easy for you all you need
to do is adjust the tension on the right
hand side and you can make it to suit
whatever you like I don't know how you
feel but for me if I'm gonna be sitting
a chair for hours and hours on end I
want my back to be very comfortable and
having really good lumbar support to me
is a very important feature
now the trigger 350 it features
multi-directional lumbar support it can
be moved forward or backwards or up and
down to fit your back totally
comfortably so matter where you're
sitting or how you sit in the chair you
can adjust it and fine-tune it to be
perfect for your back and comfort level
all of the materials covering the
trigger 350 are very high quality
material you get absolutely pure cast
and leather and you also get reinforced
dupont teepee mesh now
this mesh is made to last forever it's
also made to be very neutral to heat and
sweat so that no matter how long you're
sitting in the chair you're not going to
get uncomfortable and start sweating on
your back or feeling it need that
uncomforta so you get from other
materials this material is also very
expensive and probably one of the
reasons why this chair costs the price
that it does last but not least is the
headrest now many headrests that you've
seen on previous chairs are just kind of
like a pillow that you hang over the top
of the chair it's not very adjustable
with the trigger 350 you can move the
headrest up or down or back and forth
which means you don't have to sit all
the way back in the chair to get that
great support on your neck and this is
something I find very appealing and also
the screws they use at 12.9 screw and
this is pretty much one of the strongest
screws in its class so you know it's
going to last almost forever I've been
using this chair for about a week now
and honestly I didn't think really any
chair could be more comfortable than the
corsair one that i've been using but
this chair is truly truly incredibly
comfortable the lumbar support I find to
be extremely great especially if you're
gonna be sitting in your computer for
hours and hours on end
now just because this chair says that
it's for an office doesn't mean that you
can't use it for gaming as well and
actually really high-end office chairs
are usually more expensive than even
gaming chairs because they're built for
an office environment where you're
literally going to be sitting your chair
for hours and hours on end most people
don't sit in their chair for eight hours
gaming some people do mind you I'm sure
that they do but most people when
they're sitting in their chair they're
usually in a working environment they're
stuck at their desk they've got to sit
there and being in that chair all day
long can really mess up your back or
your posture if the chair is not made
correctly the lumbar support on this
chair is strictly incredible having the
ability to move it back and forth or up
and down means that you can set it
perfect for your back so that you're
completely comfortable all day long
without getting a backache and having a
headrest that you can move forward is
awesome because a lot of chairs I had to
lean all the way back into the chair
ticket the headrest to work with this
one if I want it forward I just pull it
forward and then boom total comfort
level
honestly I've sat in this chair for like
sick
seven hours sitting there working on
music on my computer and it never gets
uncomfortable the wheels are also
something that's really cool since they
feature you know stuff that most other
wheels don't have they're very ergonomic
to use they're also very tough any
surface jet you're on whether it be
thick carpet a solid floor you'll find
yourself able to move that chair around
with absolutely no problem whatsoever
and really having the controls just
right at your fingertips underneath the
armrest makes it very very easy with a
single click on the left-hand side you
can bring the chair back with another
click you can bring it forward and
having the ability to adjust the tension
of the tilt mechanism is also very very
nice like I said the very beginning the
video the only cavity about this chair
at all is that it's 699 dollars but if
you take a look at the Herman Miller
chairs they're actually a lot more money
and have pretty much all the basic
features that these chairs do so let me
know what you guys think would you
actually spend $6.99 a chair if it was
gonna make you comfortable and last for
years on end like I said this chair has
a 10 year warranty can fit up to people
to 350 pounds and even if you're kind of
a heavy guy you'll still fit pretty
nicely in here to me comfort level is
the most important thing at the end of
the day if you want to be comfortable
and you want something that's gonna last
a long time you guys may want to check
out the trigger 350 I gotta say he gets
an editor's choice here on TECA tomorrow
because it's just seriously one awesome
chair like usual if you guys want more
information about this we'll have links
down below I'll also include a link to
the Herman Miller chair this is a
comparable so you guys can check it out
for yourself I'm Elric you've been
watching techy tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
