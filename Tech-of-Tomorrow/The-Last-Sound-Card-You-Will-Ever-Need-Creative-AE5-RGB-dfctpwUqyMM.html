by Vikings War of clans in the north
they know no rest and no mercy hey
what's going on tech fans welcome back
once again to the channel now you guys
might think that sound cards are dead
right do you really go out and buy a
sound card anymore since motherboard
companies got smart and put really good
audio on motherboards it seems like the
sound card has just slowly fallen off
the map but creative wants to change
that they've just released their brand
new AE v sound card this thing is
actually quite incredible
122 DB 32 bit 384 kilohertz this is off
the EE SS DAC which means it's really
supremely high quality they use German
capacitors and tone cats the Lima
approved ones these are absolutely
incredible and you also get a 600 ohm
headphone amp that's right and the
headphone app features the xamp
technology which means each side of your
headphone has its own discreet engine to
bring you that sound quality and it's
just incredible and this is also the
very first sound car that you're ever
going to see that features Aurora
lighting on the sound card that's right
that's pretty incredible so not only do
you get a sound card you get a sound
card that gets all these crazy RGB
features and we all know that
everything's going RGB pretty soon
they're going to RGB underwear because
everything's going RGB but will it
actually in the long run provide much
better sound than other motherboards I
believably but it will because at the
rate of the sound card is going you
actually get 30% more clarity than you
get off a normal sound card most sound
cards and most motherboards sound is
between 90 and 98 dB
but with the 85 or at 122 DB so this is
just incredible stuff and there's all
kinds of features about this card they
make it very interesting
we've both out there who strictly listen
to headphones you're going to be very
impressed with exams technology for one
thing it brings an ultra low output
impedance of 1 ohm and you can also hook
up headphones that are high-end from 16
ohms all the way up to 600 ohms so
whether using low end headphones or all
the way up to high-end audio headphones
the X app engine is going to produce you
the absolute best and cleanest sound
that you can get and few gamers out
there were wondering hey man
we'll just sound card power my 7.1
headphones will you get three
four notches per sound you get true
stereo sound you get discrete 5.1 and
then virtual 7.1 audio and why we're
talking about audio in games let's check
out a word from today's sponsor Vikings
war of clans I guarantee you'll have
lots of fun playing Viking war of clans
because it feels like the top strategy
games of the past but instead of have to
use your PC you can now play them in
mobile and in 3d one of the things that
makes this game famous is its massive
online battles between clans and even
countries with over three million
players attending the events play this
game for five minutes and see why
everyone is addicted download the game
from the links in the description below
and get 200 gold for a fast and
successful start get your game on one
thing you guys are going to notice is
that the 85 is a very small sound card
and it doesn't matter which PCIe you put
it into it will work in anyone with the
16 8 4 it doesn't matter which slot that
you use it will work in all those slides
now usually when you install a sound
card you have to go into the BIOS and
you have to disable the onboard sound
but with this sound card it didn't have
to do that whatsoever
we just install the sound card install
the driver and everything's working just
fine now your results on your in may be
different but I would honestly advise
just going in and disabling the sound
and your BIOS just to be on the safe
side because I don't know what every
single motherboard out there is going to
work like that now as far as the inputs
and outputs go on the card the very top
connection in the back is to line in mic
in below that is the headphone then we
have the front left and right speakers
below that the rear left and right
speakers then the center subwoofer
connection the optical out and one thing
different about this sound cards and
other sound cards it actually does
require power so you might have to hook
up when those connectors from your power
supply and plug that bad boy in you'll
also notice that up above the power
connector is the front panel HD audio
header this is broken out to your case
and the very top of the card you'll see
there's an RGB header this is where you
hook up the LED strip that comes with
the sound card and the RGB header also
supports up to 4 LED strips alright so
those are all the features of the sound
card itself and you can tell that
they're really really advanced the a5
uses the absolute best in technology all
the way across the board so if you're
looking for a sound card they
the absolute best sound options you can
get it's the AE five because at this
point in time I believe it is the
absolute top-of-the-line sound card that
you can get on the market and I don't
believe it any motherboard out there
even has this type of quality on it with
the two discreet xampp engines for your
headphones to all those quality movement
capacitors that are and they're made by
Germany just everything is made
top-of-the-line but those are only some
of the really cool features yeah the a5
is amazing an awesome sound solution but
there's also all kinds of things beyond
that the RGB lighting is really killer
you get a strip that comes with this
magnetic you can place it anywhere in
your system and like I said before you
can use up to four these with the
connection the sound card so that's
really killer everything that you do to
enhance and tweak your auditory
experience is done to the Sound Blaster
ex acoustic engine once you install the
software there's a dashboard and on this
dashboard are just all kinds of crazy
features all kinds of things for
changing the way your room sounds the
way your voice sounds all kinds of crazy
stuff just picture that you go into a
room and you hook up your sound con your
speakers and you really don't like the
way that it sounds well they have an EQ
on board that will actually help you
change the shape of the sound so it
sounds absolutely perfect
inside the room that you're in now
that's really a really cool thing not
many companies do that whatsoever so
let's just face it that takes an extra
lot of effort to bring that thing to the
table and what's really crazy as well is
they have morphing features for your
voice where you could be talking in-game
and make your voice sound like someone
else and the technology actually inside
the card provides actually the cleanest
and those sound watts which you're going
to get especially when you're talking
in-game the sound card actually helps to
bring that quality to that you know to
that place as well so you're talking
in-game and playing in your game
sometimes a lot of sound cards you're
talking to they have clipping sounds
they have weird stopping sounds with the
85 you don't get any of that
now another than they have that's what's
called crystallisation sound or Crystal
sound now if you guys don't know my
history I used to work for a company
called Sonic focus now sonic focus
provided all the sound solutions for the
Intel Azealia chipset and on that
chipset I wrote all of the programming
for it so any one of those presets
anything that you heard in the EQ I
wrote all those per sonic focus well
Sonic focus what they also did and was
an idea that we all can
up with me and Tom paddock in the group
was we said hey man mp3s really have
shitty sound quality why can't we do
something that actually puts the stuff
back in when you're listening to an mp3
and make it sound good
well obviously creatives got their own
version of this but let me just explain
something that stuff that we invented
first one on HP and then finally became
beats by dre so all the technology that
you're hearing inside of beats by dre
actually start up the sonic focus level
with me and the team that we work in
there so that's pretty cool but all
these different options make it so you
can have probably the most incredible
audio experience that you ever have
especially if you like paying attention
to detail you like going in and
customizing making everything look
perfect this dashboard is actually just
incredible I like it a lot now I know a
lot of people out there going to
probably say wow man $150 for a sound
card I could buy a motherboard for that
but here's the whole thing if you're a
person who just plays games and you
don't really care about the sound you
don't do any audio then you know maybe
the sound cards not for you but if
you're a person like me who really loves
lossless audio and likes having all the
power they'll be taken from your
processor and your motherboard all taken
off there and all just done to the sound
card this may just be the perfect
solution for you it's easy to install
the software is easy to go through you
get so many different options on this
card it's just amazing now there's one
more feature about the 85 that I want to
talk to you guys about and this is
something that it to me I kind of
personally a little bit scoff at it's
the thing called Scout mode now what
Scout mode allows you to do is if you're
inside of a first-person shooter game
Scott will actually show you where your
opponent is but it does it on your
mobile device
now here's my thing about that you're
staring at a screen you're in-game
you're trying to kill your opponent do
you really have time to frickin look at
your mobile phone while you're playing
the game like let's just picture I'm
playing the game I'm in-game we're
shooting the guys coming what I'm going
to stop and look at mess up in my mobile
device I don't know this particular
feature may sound good on paper but how
well it actually translates into the
real world then I got it MIT I'm a bit
skeptical about because when I'm in game
I'm immersed in that game and especially
if I got my headphones on I can usually
hear worth
are coming from so having an app on my
phone that I actually got you know
taking look at to see things I don't
know about that now maybe if you're like
not in the middle of fight mode and
you're just like you know looking around
maybe it'll be a good thing because you
can see that you know see the person on
the app but I'm going to have to
actually use that a little bit more
before I can actually give it elements
rubber-stamp beyond that as far as the
sound quality goes on this cart it is
the best that you can get I can't
emphasize that enough at 150 dollars it
will take your board and the sound on
your board to such a different level
that you will actually blown away trust
me on this I haven't used a sound card
in years I always buy motherboards that
are super high and you guys know that
you follow the channel I always buy
stuff it's excessive you guys are always
like we can build a cheaper system not
that's just me man I like to build the
most high-end stuff I can because why
not we get a lot of company to support
us here and do that stuff so I like the
absolute best and if you want the
absolute best then you should check out
the a a 5 by creative like user will
have all the information about this card
down below you can pick one up for
yourself or just find out more
information dig more in-depth and see if
it's for you
I'm Ella you've been watching taken
tomorrow peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
