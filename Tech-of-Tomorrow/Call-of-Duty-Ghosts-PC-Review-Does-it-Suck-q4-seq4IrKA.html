of tomorrow we've been covering all the
biggest PC games to come out this
holiday season and today we finally have
our full review in the latest entry of
one of the biggest selling franchises
around Call of Duty ghosts now ghost is
from the same guys that did modern
warfare 3 and it's supposed to bring a
brand new plotline and style to the Call
of Duty Universe is it enough to bring a
breath of fresh air into a series whose
formula is beginning to grow stale let's
find out
so kick things off let's talk about how
the game looks Before we jump into
gameplay and the short of it is not very
good during development was said that
this game emphasized achieving 60 frames
per second across all systems it was
playable on rather than try to focus on
making the settings or textures more
detailed and it shows running in our
system which includes a GTX 780 and an
i7 4770k processor during this scene on
2560 by 1440 with all the settings but
to their highest we got an average
frames per second at 50 6.9 and we put
it down to 1920 by 1080 it shot up to 75
point 1 so it runs smooth but the frame
rates really aren't all that high
considering how bland everything looks
and the game clearly wasn't optimized
for PC in mind now on to actual gameplay
and when it comes to a brand new Call of
Duty game one of the biggest questions
is how many changes have they actually
implemented because often times there
really aren't that many well as far as
core gameplay goes the trend does not
change with this one there are some new
features like scopes now showing your
peripheral vision as well as some maps
now featuring a degree of destructible
environments there is of course the
usual package as well of various tweaks
to weapon balance what perks there are
what killstreak Ward's are available and
so on so forth now this one is part of
the Infinity Ward's series of Call of
Duty games so it has a lot more in
common with modern warfare 3 than it
does with black ops 2 so all the bigger
changes black ops 2 brought like the
pick 10 character set up or gone and in
place are basically all the things we
saw back in modern warfare 3 more
restrictive equipment loadouts with so
many perk points and using one of three
different styles of killstreak wards
focused on offensive or support packages
or just gaining additional perks as you
get kills what is different about the
character setup is now you customize a
whole squad of playable loadouts
giving you more option to choose from
them before a match and this also plays
into the game's new squads mode now
before we start talking about all the
different multiplayer modes let's take a
quick look at the games campaign which
simply put is one of the weakest in the
overall franchise while all of the past
games stories have been more or less the
equivalent to a crazy action movie
enjoyable less for their plot more for
just watching cool explosions and doing
crazy things ghost has taken this
dynamic a tad too far in one direction
riddled with press button now to do cool
things moments and a storyline that is
more or less thrown together a
combination of gigantic cliches it's
just gotten to the point where it
doesn't do much to stand out amongst its
own library the only thing it did do
that was pretty entertaining was the
demonic mutant killing machine that
people in game refer to as a dog
monster capable of wiping whole squads
of armed enemies by himself and is even
immune to tear gas for some reason sadly
he only really hangs out during the
game's opening missions and promptly
disappears from use after now as for
multiplayer this particular game comes
with in three different flavors there's
the traditional competitive multiplayer
mode the new cooperative extinction mode
and the marais I focused squad mode
starting with the newest we have
extinction more or less the Infinity
Ward answer to Trey arks popular zombies
mode players work together to destroy
alien items by protecting a drill and in
doing so shoot a ton of alien monsters
players start out with basic equipment
and as the game goes on they can
purchase new guns make use of special
perks like summoning turrets or ammo
boxes and there's even a pseudo class
system that allows each player to get
more specialized as the match goes on
like being better with guns or able to
revive allies faster as a co-op mode
it's a fun distraction but it does
little to compete with actual co-op
focused games of the same genre alone it
isn't enough to justify buying ghosts
but if you already plan to then this is
a fun little side game to kill time with
every now and then next up we have the
squad's mode which mixes actual players
with AI controlled opponents making it a
much more lenient and controlled
environment for players that want to try
and learn the game rather than jumping
online right away and die for five
seconds without understanding why modes
include competitive options like
assaulting an enemy players HQ customize
by picking a map and match type of their
choice or just pitting two players in
their respective squads against each
other in traditional team multiplayer
modes there's also cooperative options
akin to modern warfare 3 survival mode
pitting players and their squads or
actually human teammates against waves
of AI soldiers this is actually the one
new feature I really like because it
walks a good line between being a
tutorial and actual multiplayer so
playing it doesn't set you up with
entirely unreal expectations of how
online competitive modes go now last but
not least we have the traditional online
multiplayer modes which at its core is
very much the same as previous games
returning modes include free-for-all
team deathmatch
Kill Confirmed infected
search-and-destroy and domination
there's also four new modes for public
play search and rescue which is a
variant of Kill Confirmed blitz which is
more focused on getting to a specific
point alive without dying cranked which
words kills with more power making it
very momentum based and hunted in which
players start with basic equipment and
have to pick up new guns from air drums
aside from these new modes a little can
honestly be said about what ghosts does
differently from its predecessors the
core experience especially when playing
free-for-all or team
deathmatch is very much the same game
with a few new little tweaks like what
killstreak packages are available and
gun balance as a result this sends up
more or less to finding the whole ghost
experience and whether or not you should
purchase it it does little that actually
changes the direction series as a whole
has been going especially in comparison
to black ops 2 which at least tried to
do new things to the core game long time
series fans will find this just to be
another yearly addition of their
favorite franchise with new modes and
new maps to play in on the other hand
people that have never been a fan of the
series or outright despise it will find
little here to sway their opinion if
you've always been on the fence about
the series and actually want to give it
a try honestly I would rank this one as
being not one of the strongest by any
means and there are better older Call of
Duty games to play first if you really
want to try it out especially the
original model warfare and that being
said if you're a fan of Call of Duty and
you want to grab ghosts for yourself
