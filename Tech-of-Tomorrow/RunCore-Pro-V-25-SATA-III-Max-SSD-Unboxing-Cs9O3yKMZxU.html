Ferris here in the tech of tomorrow
youtube channel bringing you tomorrow's
technology today and what are we
bringing to the table today well today
we're bringing something really unique
to the table a lot of people don't know
about this company called runcore but
these guys are a very very strong
company and the reason that you really
don't hear about these guys much these
guys mainly focus on doing enterprise
government sales NASA you know Navy all
that kind of stuff their retail stuff
they're really not that into but they're
starting to change their ways a little
bit and with that said I've got their
latest SSD in my hand now this
particular drive is Sam force driven it
features say 23 or say 26 gigabit a
second connectivity this one comes in at
480 gigabytes I know there's some otha
that are 512 but this one's a 40
gigabyte model and it's actually a
little bit pricey but I just want to
clarify right off the bat before you
guys freak out about the price you have
to take something in mind this is an
enterprise-class drive now to do between
desktop and enterprise is quite
significant if you go out you look at a
western digital drive for your desktop
and then you go look at one for
enterprise the price difference is three
or four hundred dollars that said this
is about six hundred dollars but let's
do the unboxing and let's just check out
what comes in here you've got the box
here's the back of the box I'll just set
this right peers you guys and see it for
an 80 gigabytes you guys can see say 23
this drive also claims to be one of the
fastest that there's ever been I'm
looking forward to seeing that gonna go
ahead now and I'll go ahead just do a
little bit the unboxing go ahead and
take this tape off just doing this in
the air folks I didn't figure there's
gonna be too much to us you guys know
SSDs there's not really a lot to them
but I don't think very many people have
actually seen that uh cameramen
schmitter on the floor please I lose it
at the other cameraman earlier was still
on the floor so I guess I'll use it so
here we go make a nice quick incision
with the Schmidt tar isn't this like the
totally like overkill psychotic boxing I
know I'm famous for that there we
go made an incision going to pop the cap
now this dr says that it has the
external transfer Bay there it is so
we'll get that set that off the side so
here's the inside box
to start off here you can see it's got
all the stuff right here going to go
ahead and pop the cap here is the drive
now you guys can see you're off the bat
this drive looks different than other
drives it's all chrome reminds me of
kind of like a car park let's go ahead
and remove it get all close-ups of it
here's your connectivity here's a part
of the drive it's basically a 2.5 inch
drive like all of them are nothing
different they're basically just in the
looks looks pretty cool I like it set it
down got some stickers and stuff in here
voila voila Welling got the SATA cable
now this is going to be interesting
watch this folks this all comes out the
packaging blah blah blah blah here the
screws they're all right here on the
side so you pop those off your own
installation screws and then finally
here is the bay so you need to you can
take this drive install it onto here it
mounts to these four screws right here
do these four screws right here place
the drive in screw it in and then put it
inside your Bay and away you go so
that's it folks this has been the
unboxing and first look of the new
runcore 480 gigabyte SSD I'll see you
guys back here with the test results
next week see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
