Braintree payments hey everybody out
there in YouTube land Tech fans welcome
back once again to the channel I'm Alec
your host and today we're gonna be
taking a look at the world's very first
Google smartphone that's right and
that's the Google pixel now a few folks
out there who live in the Google world
like me most of us PC fans do then
you're gonna find this phone very very
easy to use and simply probably one of
the nicest phones you're ever gonna get
your hands on this year so with that
said though let's jump in let's do the
unboxing check out what comes in the box
talk about those specs go over the
features check out some awesome camera
stuff and then they did a talk about how
my first 48 hours were with the brand
new Google pixel so let's go so
obviously there's the Box not too much
of quite exception going on here but we
do have a box inside of the box then
right up front we have the phone and NEX
accessory so we'll go ahead and we'll
flip the phone around just take it and
set it off to the side inside we've got
all kinds of instructions and stuff like
that so if you all your QuickStart guide
and all that stuff that all comes inside
of here I'm not gonna make you guys read
it all you'll be bored to death first up
the USB see the standard adapter cable
then after that the USB C to standard
adapter plug then both of your USB C on
both ends this is gonna actually work
with the including charger plug what's
great about this other cable though too
is that in case you lose this or you
gotta hook up to your PC you have both
types of cables so you're covered all
the way around with the cable and since
USB C it's going to be going much faster
then we have the phone itself I'm not
even gonna bother with anything here I'm
just gonna go ahead just rip this
plastic sleeve off here take the phone
out and you guys can see the phone and
all of its lovely glory now the design
of the new pixel
it features an aerospace grade aluminum
unibody and the color on its white
silver and then on the very back you
guys can see it has kind of a glass
thing here which is kind of cool then we
have silver down here
with the Google logo you guys can see
the Wi-Fi bands going right across here
the pixel features a five inch AMOLED
screen that features Full HD viewing so
you get 1920 by 1080 at 441 pixels per
inch so you know everything's gonna look
sharp and clean
the pixel sizes in at five point six by
two point seven by 0.2 inches and it's
also about 0.3 inches thick depending on
where you're holding the phone in your
hand now as you guys can see the screen
on here is actually pretty awesome it
features a 100% NTSC rating which means
that pretty much all the television
programs and all those things that are
made are gonna work perfectly and show
up exactly as they are on the phone you
also get a hundred thousand one super
contrast ratio that's just incredible
and you also get true black which means
that all your colors in the background
are gonna be really vibrant against that
black background
it also features sixteen point seventy
seven million colors and a really good
thing about it as well is that even when
you turn the phone thirty degrees you
only lose about 40 percent of the
brightness of the phone so you can
pretty much view it at any angle without
losing the image and while we're still
on the front of the pixel let's talk a
little bit about that selfie cam now for
you narcissus out there this is a fully
eight megapixel camera that features
1080p stuff so if you're not taking
pictures of yourself hey smile you're on
candid camera a really cool feature
though about the pixel is the way that
the camera can be changed so if you turn
the camera on and it's facing the
direction that you don't want you want
to take that selfie picture all you need
to do is just go like this
with the camera and it switches it to
the selfie camera it may look a little
bit awkward and public like you're
playing with yourself for something but
hey if you're not doing that now let's
flip the pixel around let's take a look
at the back side we see the fingerprint
reader now this is pretty cool because
not only is it a fingerprint reader it
also doubles as a notification thing so
all you need to do is slide your finger
across it and all of your notifications
stuff comes down and then you can close
it back out to your liking and last but
not least in the very top we see the
main cameron there are a lot of features
here that I like about this especially
for those people who aren't totally into
like doing everything manually for those
automatic people I like this twelve
point three megapixels and aperture of
f28 oh and just a lot of other things
that we'll talk about a little bit more
than make this camera I think one of the
absolute best things about the pixel on
the side of the camera we see the
control buttons obviously the one in the
bottom is your volume up and down
toggling for your song and stuff like
that
above that we see the power button but
the power button is pretty cool does
like I showed you earlier all you have
to do
is double tap that button and you're
into the camera on the bottom we see the
USB type-c charging port and we also see
dual stereo speakers and yes of course
there's an audio jack before we see even
more features let's check out our

slash t OT another feature that I really
like about the pixel is most of time to
put in your SIM card you have to
actually remove the entire back of your
phone that could be a pain in the butt
some people break stuff really if you're
not really mechanically inclined
everything you can make a mistake and
screw it up
but the pixel it's very simple to insert
your SIM card you simply just push this
little button on the side it pops open
you insert your SIM card and you're up
and going it's very simple and very very
user in tune for the RAM inside the
pixel it features four gigabytes of
lpddr4 the storage options are 32
gigabytes or 128 gigabytes the device
that I'm holding in my hand is actually
one hundred twenty eight gigabyte
version and that's pretty cool that's a
lot of space but what's actually even
totally better and I'll just talk about
that right now before I talk about the
processor is the availability to have
unlimited storage for your photos and
videos that's right I said it folks
unlimited storage for all your photos
all your videos so never have to worry
about ever coming up with a thing it
says memory full we all know that sucks
if you're out in public or somewhere you
don't want to run out of stuff if a
transfer you can
or pictures of your family that plainly
sucks though with the pixel you never
have to worry about that ever again take
as many photos stupid or otherwise of
you and your family and you can all load
them up forever with the pixel under the
hood empowering the pixel is the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor now
this is actually two processors in one
you feature a single 2.1 5 gigahertz
processor and another 1.6 gigahertz
processor and this is fully quad-core
64-bit technology and few folks out
there who are thinking about doing some
video with the pixel you will be very
happy you can actually get up to 120
frames per second at 1080 and 30 frames
with 4k so it's totally covering you for
filming video the video stabilization
features the pixel are very nice here
you can see it was stabilization on and
then here's another example of with it
off and you guys can pretty much see the
difference obviously it's working well
so now let's just check out the camera
like I said before folks if you're one
of those people who knows how to totally
manually adjust your camera and get the
absolute most out of it there's probably
a smartphone out there that may give you
more options but if you're a person out
there who likes simplicity you just want
to click shoot or make a video this
phone is amazing and I love the camera
options on it me myself I'm not that
kind of person that knows all those
camera features there's people out there
that do but me myself hey I'll admit it
when it comes to camera stuff I'm a
rookie but you guys can see all the
options work really well you get great
stabilization you get great auto focus
and even in the low-light the camera
takes great pics you guys can see me and
buddy we were almost in a dark room when
this picture was taken the camera also
features pixel lens blur and what this
does this helps with your field of depth
which means that you see me nice and
sharp but the objects behind me are a
little bit blurry now this feature
usually only comes on more expensive
cameras so it's definitely a great
feature of the pixel the pixel features
a 2770 milliamp hour battery now this
offers a lot of things your standby time
is up to 19 days which is pretty
incredible
your talktime up to 26 hours your
internet use time up to 13 hours
video playback up to 13 hours audio
playback with a headset up to
110 hours that's a lot of damn music
listening and best of all you get up to
seven hours of usage from a mere 15
minute charging period I like that vos
on the pixel is Android 7.1 nougat and
this is very very easy to use like I
said if you're a person who's a PC
enthusiast you've probably been using
Google stuff for a long time and what I
feel is best of all is that when you buy
a new phone there's usually a lot of a
pain in the ass with getting all of your
information over onto your new phone and
with this it's very simple to use you
can either transfer all the information
from your Android phone or if you're
turning to the light side of the force
and coming from an Apple over to an
Android device it'll do that as well
another thing I find very useful about
nougat 7.1 is in the old days you
actually had to click on an apps tab to
get into your apps those days are long
gone the 7.1 you simply slide it up and
you get access to all your apps and
what's even better is you can simply
hold your finger on the button and it
gives you options for that app which is
really cool the pixel even features a
little Google tab all you get is hit
with your finger and then BAM you're
automatically into Google if you're like
me and you don't like doing a bunch of
typing that means that you talk and
dictate into your phone now for you
Apple guys you guys use Siri but for us
Google guys we get Google assistant and
it works absolutely great all you do is
simply say what you want to say and
it'll take you to where you want to go
the bottom line folks is that nougat 7.1
is more user friendly than any other
version I've seen out it makes accessing
everything on your phone so much simpler
and easy to do although it's kind of
hard to tell just watching a video I got
to tell you guys that the screen is
really awesome all the colors are really
well represented when you're watching
movies and all that stuff you guys can
see that they're very vibrant and the
sounds not all that bad either me
personally though I wish kind of the
location of the stereo speakers was on
the top instead of being on the very
bottom because then when you were
listening to it you'd actually get a
true stereo representation as it is when
you turn the phone sideways the
speaker's are both to either your left
side or your right side that's just a
little bit weird
so we've seen that the Google pixel
takes great pictures especially for
those people who really don't know what
they're doing in photography you just
want something simple it works great but
what if you're out and you record a lot
of stuff that has to with like live
music and live events let's see how it
does with my very powerful ignaty rant
so let's hear some guitar and some
rockin that's in the high a volume
quick how does it sound alright folks so
there you guys have it I've only had
this phone for a couple of days but so
far I have to say I'm so impressed that
I'm gonna switch over to this phone you
guys saw before I was debating about
maybe even switching off to some other
crazy phone by Apple but after having
that I was very disappointed I gotta say
but this phone is really cool
the nougat 7.1 actually meets my
expectations it goes a little bit
farther I mean I was expecting some
small little changes but the changes in
7.1 nougat are actually astronomical now
you guys saw when I had the LGV 20 phone
that it wasn't running very well on that
phone at all obviously LG recalled all
those phones and seven different ones
out but on this phone there's no recall
everything is running perfectly I like
it a lot and like I said if you're a
person out there you just click and
shoot and that's how you like to do
stuff you don't want to worry about all
those manual things and trying to figure
out how to do like your a camera faites
know the pixel rocks I gotta say that I
don't know if it's the absolute best
freaking camera that's out there right
now
but I gotta say it's definitely one of
the best like I said before also if you
like all those manual adjustments there
may be something out there better for
you but if you're a person who likes
simplicity it's just like that on this
videos they're good camera options are
good stereo sounds pretty good like I
said before it's a little bit weird I
don't know why they really put the
stereo speakers down here because
whenever you're watching a movie or
anything you're watching your you know
smart device like this so why not put
the speakers up here so if you need to
Cummings out there watching this video
move the frickin speakers man because I
want full stereo you know what I mean I
want full stereo I don't want stereo on
the bottom all to my left and if you're
gonna have stereo speakers on a phone
why not give them true stereo separation
as you all know we don't watch movies
like this we don't hardly listen to
music like this everything is like this
so I don't know one little small little
caveat at the end of the day though if
you want the 32 gigabyte model there's
$649 if you want the hundred
twenty-eight gigabyte model like I got
here in my hand
this one's $749 is aus pricing obviously
you know around the world price is going
to be different the version I have is
also completely unlocks of the work with
any of the carriers out there me myself
I'm a Verizon guy so
slap my sim card in there and be up and
going but at the end of the day I gotta
say just for the short time that I've
had the Google pixel it's a kick-ass
smartphone all the information about
this you want to read more and all that
stuff leather information down below we
have more stuff coming up speed tests
water tests even more stuff on camera in
a full video we're gonna film on the
Google pixel and bring it to you guys so
we'll see you guys back in the channel
for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
