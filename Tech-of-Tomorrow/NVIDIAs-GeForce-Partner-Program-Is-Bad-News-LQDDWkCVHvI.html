like once again there's some more bad
dirt coming out and this time it's on
the nvidia side of things and it's
called the geforce partner program and
now i'll jump into all that just a
second now everybody kind of thinks that
this is totally brand new news now maybe
the geforce partner program itself in
the way that it's being you know shown
now might be new but the meat and the
facts of the stuff that's going on has
actually been going on for quite a while
now i'm gonna just gonna bring something
up XFX you guys know those guys a long
time ago they made nvidia cards they
made AMD card tore ATI cards whatever
was at the time but then they weren't
allowed to make Nvidia cards anymore so
they only made AMD cards and there are
actually a few companies out there and
this is kind of to me what the GeForce
Partner Program is all about so Kyle
from Hard OCP ah the link down below to
his site he actually broke this story he
spent a lot of time doing research a few
weeks and things like that now me and
Kyle have kind of a rough history me and
him banged heads back in the old days
what kind of old men now so it's oh we
get along fine but back in the day we
actually but it heads quite a bit now on
the nvidia side of things i have to say
that as a reviewer most of the time
nvidia has treated me better than AMD
brian dale Rizzo brian burke these guys
have been friends and brothers of mine
since forever and the day back from
almost the very beginning of time so
i've been working with these guys a long
time now is it all cookies and roses no
absolutely not there's been twice in my
life where I've been completely banned
from the Nvidia camp the first time is
when at one of their meetings up north I
got into a big argument with Kyle
Bennett from our low CP and they didn't
like it so they banned me from going to
the meetings for a few years another
time I was going into the hospital is
one of the times I was really sick and I
released a video and it was like five
minutes earlier and I got banned from
review samples for a couple of years so
that's just kind of crazy stuff now in
the am decided thing it's a lot
different they try to actually tell me
what to say in my reviews how to do my
testing what I even title my video on
and I
tickley don't like that and AMD that's
why you don't see me requesting any
samples from you I know that you guys
make a product and you compete on the
lower end for pricing and all that stuff
but when you treat reviewers like I'm
just basically your prostitute a prior
to say what you want to say screw that
you're not gonna be playing ball with me
in my court that's just bull crap all
the way around and Vidya has never done
that now the GeForce Partner Program the
bottom line is this and this pretty much
just cuts through all the chase all the
stuff it's basically this if you want to
be part of the GeForce Partner Program
that means that you will only be making
GPUs made by Nvidia now like I said
earlier this is already affected a whole
bunch of companies back in the day who
since they didn't get the support from
Nvidia they wanted you know they had to
quit making their cars and only stick
with the AMD side of things well now
with this GeForce Partner Program this
is gonna affect a lot more people it's
gonna affect builders it's gonna affect
integrators it's even going to affect
the big companies so just put it this
way
gigabyte MSI and a Zeus right now are
the big three and both of them excuse me
and all three of those companies all
make both brands of cards right you can
get an AMD card or you can get an Nvidia
card from either one of those companies
what the GeForce Partner Program is
trying to do is it's basically trying to
tell these companies that hey if you
want to make a GPU by AMD then we're not
gonna play ball with you and honestly if
that's really the facts of what's going
on it's very immature I mean I can see
from a business standpoint how Nvidia
would try to do that but it's totally
messed up for me you for all the
companies involved it limits our choice
it raises prices up and all in all it's
just a bad idea now I'll admit I have
not read the exact fine print of
everything that's in this GeForce
Partner Program I don't have access it
you don't have access to it I don't even
think Kyle had access to it but the
bottom line is the people that he talked
to all are very scared of really even
say anything because they're afraid they
lose their jobs they'll get cut off from
from Nvidia not be able to make their
cards and you know and videos a giant
company billions of dollars and stuff
they work with all kinds of companies
from the PC industry to the auto
industry just a big giant company with a
big
swinging mill you know what I mean these
guys got a lot of money and a lot of
power so obviously making them mad isn't
a smart choice but the thing is if the G
Force partner program really and
honestly is trying to force all these
companies to just basically make a
choice
I think that's crappy it's like going to
a restaurant and the restaurant says hey
we're only gonna serve one type of
burger that's it and if you serve a
cheeseburger or a bacon burger you serve
anything else it's normal in this burger
then you know what we're not gonna do
business with you and Vidia like i said
i don't know if this is true but my
message to you if this is true that's
bad businessman bad mojo you should let
your video cards and the quality of
video cards your drivers your platform
the whole and video experience should be
the reason that people buy your cards
and being the best you guys have been
the fastest most of the time so being
the best should honestly be what
Nvidia's goal is being trying to shut
people out of being able to make money
telling companies oh you know what you
can't make any other gpus other than
ours or we're not gonna play ball with
you I just don't I don't agree with that
whatsoever and I'm sure you guys don't
as well I like the very fact that I can
give an ASIS Rock card and I can get it
made for whatever company I want if I
want to get killer fans for my antique
art I can get it if I want to get nice
fans for my Nvidia card I can get it if
I want to get aftermarket models with
better cooling overclocked all that
stuff comes from these board partners so
if you're gonna cut all these board
partners off what are we going to just
have sapphire and power color and XFX
that's pretty much the three companies
that are making AMD cards right now and
so those guys would pretty much be the
only game in town now would that be a
really good thing for them let's talk
about another side of the coin if a sous
MSI asrock and these big companies that
are out there if they stopped making AMD
cards will that actually increase the
market for the other companies that are
making it could it actually end up
helping them in the long run this I
don't know I don't claim to be the
greatest business strategist in the
world because I'm just not I'm just a
youtuber but I'm sure in the big
ballpark of things that doing that's
gonna have effects and ripples in ways
that we're not even thinking about
because if you can't get those
cards from those companies you will be
forced to get those cards from the other
companies correct so if you can no
longer buy an A Zeus MSI all you've
heard all before you're going to go to
those companies to buy your cards and
maybe maybe just maybe that might work
out better for them but the whole thing
is video cards right now the prices are
just outrageous because of stock and
I've heard rumors that these companies
are really just doing this on purpose
they could make the amount of cards out
there but they just like this big drop
because it makes it all their car just
look so more appealing if that's true
it's really really pathetic I've already
talked in videos how this is the saddest
time to be a gamer how the only way you
can actually beat the high-end video
card cost is to bribe pilled pre-built
PC and this has honestly been proven to
me time and time again over the last
week I've had so many people email me
and say hey Elric man here's this
pre-built system should I buy it and I'm
talking about systems with a nice rx 580
nice specs and everything in it for
under seven and eight hundred dollars so
these systems I can't beat those prices
and pretty much nobody who's building
computers at this point at their home is
going to be able to beat that because
you're gonna be paying for an RX 580
right now about 500 bucks or more
depending on who's selling it and that's
just ridiculous
so at the end of the day the GeForce
Partner Program it could literally end
up screwing us all it can obscure in the
market and changing things to an even
worse dynamic than they are now or it
could just make things with the other
AMD partners actually make more money at
the end of the day I don't know exactly
what's going to happen only the future
will dictate that but if you guys want
to check out Kyle's article like I said
I'll have a link down below you guys can
check out the original article but it
pretty much states just all the things
that I said here and video wants to
force companies who work in their
partner program to only deal with them
and make nobody else's cards I think
it's BS I think you think it's BS let me
know what you guys think
hi miller q guys been watching teching
tomorrow like I said man it is the worst
time ever in history to build a PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
