I jest today we're looking at this power
supply it's from n when it's 650 watt
it's agree me which means it's basically
geared to all environmental standards it
comes in a recycled cardboard box all
the metal inside is made from Japanese
recycled beer cans that's a lot of
drunken Japanese people out there I'm
telling you but no I'm just kidding
folks let's look at the box so we see
the front of the box right here you guys
can see it's the green me flip it around

box you guys can just check out some of
the nomenclature spinning around but the
cameramen zoom in the box you guys get
their features in the back of the box

thing about it though is you know the
recyclable 100% recyclable packaging

closed with once again you're not going
to believe this no you're not a green
little sticky that's right it's not red

take a knife here once again kiddies

professionally giving these incisions
I'm gonna flip it through here make an
incision going to go ahead and pop the
cap so here we see inside the box you
can see there's a bunch of component its
components galore totally alright so

this because anything comes in why he
wants it if it's a white this white that
white case he's all on it he's on it
like a hawk like a white Hawk like white
on rice should you guys the back to be
truth with you vote so this thing being
white like this it looks in some ways
really cheesy hex tile app because your
mind is like a white box product you
went to the market you want a white box
power supply I'm not trying to diss on
the people over there I didn't win but
this is pretty funny but I'm should be
lots of people like it in their case

going to take a look at the nomenclature

it around you guys can see the on/off
switch here the power here this is a non
modular power supply I'm going to go
ahead and just unclip this little bad
boy right here though if I can and get
it off of here there we go now we'll
take a look at all the cables first one
