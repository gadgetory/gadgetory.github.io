you guys back here once again on TECA
d'Ivoire where there's all kinds of
exciting stuff going on in the tech
world especially for gamers a lot of
stuff going on including e3 and our man
captain Kevin is over at e3 right now
repping the company and checking all
that fun stuff which he really loves so
much now me myself I've been doing
something to now battlefield has a brand
new bait out called hardline and I've
been playing this thing and it's pretty
cool right now there's only like a
single map that's going on but it's kind
of a little bit I don't know
capture the flag ish to me so basically
you go to one area and you collect money
and then you take money to another place
and then you gather points now with
these points you can buy stuff and you
can customize your character there are
four character classes available just
like battlefield 4 the rest of the
series and you can choose between the
different ones and modify them up now
one thing really cool is using the
grappling line and the zipline but these
things you can climb up buildings you
can scurry across windows and do all
kinds of fun stuff I really had a fun
time playing with the helicopter flying
over the place getting crazy
crashing landing on top of buildings
doing crazy stuff
now there's two missions that are
available right now the high-tension and
there's another one I've just mainly
stuck to the high tension one because it
ones like this heist thing and I really
didn't quite fared exactly what was
going on in that one quite yet but for
those interested you guys can check this
out as we're going along here and you
guys want to do that you guys can join
the beta and hop in and play this thing
now personally right now from what I'm
seeing I can't see myself paying $60
just for a version of battlefield 4
that's just basically multiplayer so
it's just basically like hey here's some
different multiplayer things I think
this is kind of capture the flag
capsule flag you grab the enemy flag
huge drag it back somewhere this way you
grab money you drag the money back
basically the same
thing now as far as III goes there's a
brand new release for the PlayStation 4
that's going to be bundled with the new
game destiny Sony announced that a
special white PlayStation 4 bundle with
destiny will be launching at September
9th 2014 this news came during the
opening the company's III 2014 press
conference another cool thing for
PlayStation 4 users you guys will be
able to jump into the beta on July 17th
Bungie used to work with Microsoft and
they were on the Halo project and now
they've bailed on that and this is like
their first big thing and they're trying
to really go at this in a huge way
Destin's gonna offer three different
classes for players to choose from
Hunter Titan and warlock with a large
focus on cooperative multiplayer with so
much riding on online bunging is hosting
a beta for destiny next month ahead of
the game scheduled release of September
9th
this white PlayStation 4 bundle is
actually available for pre-order on
Amazon right now so people are
interested in that you're gonna want to
check that out a lot of people out there
have the Xbox one from Microsoft and
many of those people always want to be
able to use that controller like they
use the Xbox controller on their PC well
now drivers have finally come out
allowing those PC users use their Xbox
one on their PC and this has been big
news a lot of people been talking about
it all over the place so for those folks
out there who have an Xbox one and you
want to use it with your PC brothers and
sisters your day
half the right for those people looking
for that driver and want to do that with
their system we'll have all the
information down the bullet like button
in the show me more description I know a
lot of my viewers out there aren't
totally into Mac stuff but I know that
some of them are I like to respect
everybody because technology is
technology and I'm not a hater and with
that said if you're tired of your old
iMac and you're looking to upgrade it
that's right Apple is now having a
refresh on their iMacs there'll be a
brand new 27 inch along with others and
let's talk about some of the specs and
what's coming to the table
the refreshed IMAX will get slightly
faster processors and could include
Thunderbolt 2 ports like Apple's MacBook
line
as such the 27-inch iMac will now be
offering a 3.3 gigahertz core i5 4690k
Hertz Core i5 4690k Hertz core i7 4790
processor for those of you who like the
21.5 inch model there's also some news
on that front as well the new 21.5 inch
models will feature 3.0 gigahertz core
i5 45 90s and 3.2 gigahertz core i5 47
90s processors like usual whenever Apple
releases new products the old ones get a
slash in price meaning that for those
people looking to save money on an older
iMac you can jump on that and for those
people who are looking to upgrade their
older iMac and looking to buy the new
ones now is the time for that as well so
if you're looking down by older ones
save some money or jump into the new one
and spend some money
hey the time might be right for you if
you're into that kind of shiz Nick now
last but not least Intel finally got the
new i7 4790 chips to the market even me
as a reviewer the NDA date passed and my
CPU actually came in after the NDA date
Danny my boy what's up with that kind of
the weirdest thing ever that I've ever
seen in the history of Intel doing stuff
we actually got our CPUs after the NDA
day I guess that's one way of making
sure India isn't getting broke just send
them afterwards but with that said how
many of you people out there are
actually going to jump in and use this
CPU now we've heard rumors that a lot of
people are going to support these on
older motherboards but some people are
gonna get stuck in that niche and
they're not going to have that forcing
you into this new z97 chipset so over
our forums we have a poll going on right
now we want to check out what you guys
have to say about that and see what's
going on so how many of you guys out
there right now plan on actually
upgrading to this new 47 90 you're like
forget that I'm sticking with my 4770k
and it's all good inquiring minds like
ours want to know so hey make sure you
guys jump over to our forums and check
that out so like usual all the
information about all these stories will
be down there below like button which I
hope that you'll hit and
