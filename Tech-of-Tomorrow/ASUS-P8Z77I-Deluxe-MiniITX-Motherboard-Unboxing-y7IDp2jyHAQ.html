your host Elric here once again on
Tekken tomorrow bringing you guys
another unboxing for the new z77 launch
today I'm looking at the p8z 77 - 1 now
this is for those people who like to
have a PC like the size of a lunch box
or smaller as you can see this is very
small
this is actually their mini max series
of motherboards and this thing's
actually gonna be about the size of my
hand very small stuff so bring it to the
camera man but you guys see the front of
the box here let you guys see the back
of the box now even though this thing is
very small it has lots and lots of
features on it a lot of them I can't
talk about but I'm sure they're not
gonna get mad if I talk to you about the
great wireless stuff there that you're
gonna get for your land stuff so for
those of you guys who like a wireless
system this is gonna be one of those
great for HTC PS and that type of thing
so the Box the table go ahead just put
the top right here now the Box not
inside the box but there we go the way
okay folks this morning is really small
blue by the way though let's just see
what comes inside it's like accessories
packs go let me get through that first
very gently set the step address we can
go through this stuff together so let's
begin we're gonna start off with a
extraordinarily well-designed driver CD
check out that artwork you know I'm sure
that's all like really pre-release stuff
lucky to be able to get this stuff at
all thanks to my supporters and Asus
totally appreciate you guys cables
cables more cables see the Santa Sega
rear i/o so here we see the rear i/o you
guys can clearly see that it's well
labeled so that everybody can tell what
they're connecting to what very good
stuff all your wireless antennas
they're pretty cool you get two of them
matchy matchy matchy set those down a
little pack of screws here what exactly
they're for I don't quite know yet
let's cover together set that down have
nice quick wiring you can see right here
this will probably plug into the
motherboard and then these will probably
plug it into the case or it's gonna be
vice versa it's hard to see I'll try to
get for the Karen but you can see all of
these things are labeled HDD all that
stuff go ahead and pop this out of the
way then last we have the manual the p8z
77 - I deluxe the user's guide make sure
you read that thoroughly before you
install on the motherboard
let's go on to the brother board itself
my anti-static wrap right here gonna go
ahead and pull this out interesting
stuff here zip stock it not a lot of
room around it for using too many things
you're gonna want to get something very
low to the sticking way up here it's not
gonna be able to install you do have one
slot if you want to use a video card
your memory passive cooling solution
SATA more USB connectors USB 3.0 header
now check this out right here this is
the digi vrm what base of the digi+ BRM
is 12 phased power conditioning and
actually helps the motherboard run for
longer cooler keeps all the power
running really clean through the
motherboard extends a lot quite a bit
really interesting the way they had this
in the solution pipe it around and pick
up the UI Oh guys that lots of solutions
for video audio wireless LAN lots of USB
3.0 eSATA you even got reset and restart
switches right here turned with a
vehemence you guys can see that pretty
good stuff hey guys thanks for watching
the unboxing of the new p8 z77 - one
