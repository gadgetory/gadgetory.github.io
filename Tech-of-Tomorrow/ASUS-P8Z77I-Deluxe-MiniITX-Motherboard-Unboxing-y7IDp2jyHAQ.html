your host elric here once again I'm tech
of tomorrow bringing you guys another
unboxing for the new ah z77 launch today
I'm looking at the PA z77 now this is
for those people who like to have a PC
like the size of a lunch box or smaller
as you can see this is very small this
is actually their mini max series and
motherboards and this thing's actually
gonna be about the size of my hand very
small stuff so bring it to the cameramen
but you guys see the front of the box
here let you guys see the back of the
box now even though this thing is very
small it has lots and lots of features
on it a lot of my can't talk about but
I'm sure they're not going to get mad if
I talk to you about the great wireless
stuff there that you're going to get for
your land stuff so for those of you guys
who like a wireless system this is going
to be one of those great for HTC PS and
that type of thing so I've got the Box
in table go ahead just put the top right
here now the box not inside the box with
every go get the other way okay said
folks this morning is really very small
blue by the way though let's just see
what comes inside is flowing accessories
packs go let me get to that first I'm
going very gently set this up address we
can go through the stuff together so
let's begin we're going to start off
with a extraordinarily well designed
driver CD check out that artwork you
know I'm sure that's all like really
pre-release stuff lucky to be able get
this stuff at all thanks to my
supporters at Asus totally appreciate
you guys cables cables more cables say
to Santa Zeta rear I oh so here we see
the rear i owe you guys can clearly see
that it's well labeled so that everybody
can tell what they're connecting to what
very good stuff all your wireless
antennas
they're pretty cool you can get two of
them matchy-matchy matching set those
down a little pack of screws here put
exactly therefore I don't quite know yet
but we're so let's come up together set
that down have nice quick wiring you can
see right here this will probably plug
into the motherboard and then these will
probably plug into the case or it's
going to be vice versa it's hard to see
i'll try to get for the cameron but you
can see all of these things are labeled
HDD all that stuff go ahead and pop this
out of the way then last we have the
manual the p8z77-i deluxe the users
guide make sure you read that thoroughly
for you installing the motherboard let's
go on to the brother board itself nice
any static rep right here go ahead and
pull this out interesting stuff here zip
stock it not a lot of room around it for
using too many things you're going to
want to get something very low that's
sticking way up here it's not gonna be
able to install you do have one slot if
you want to use a video card your memory
passive cooling solution Sega more USB
connectors USB 3.0 header now check this
out right here this is the digi vrm what
base of the digi+ vrm is 12 phase power
conditioning it actually helps the
motherboard run for longer cooler keeps
all the power running really clean
through the motherboard extends a lot
quite a bit really interesting the way
they had this in the solution hook it
around and pick up the new Rio guys got
lots of solutions for video audio
wireless LAN lots of USB 3.0 esata you
even got reset and restart switches
