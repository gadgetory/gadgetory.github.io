know about you but I own a cell phone
and pretty much everybody I know owns a
cell phone as well so today's video is
brought to you and paid for by doctor
phone from wondershare let's just face
it folks in today's modern age everybody
lives on their phone and when your phone
is on the fritz what is better than
having a tool kit to fix that problem
now doctor phone is an all-in-one data
management solution that can cure all of
your problems and it works for both iOS
and Android and what's even better it
doesn't matter if you have a Windows
computer and an iPhone or an Apple
computer and an Android phone it works
flawlessly either way now all in all the
doctor phone toolkit contains eight
different modules now these modules can
either be bought together they can be
bought separately you can license them
for a year or some of them even have
lifetime licenses now the first tool and
the tool kit is a recovery tool now what
this does is it allows you to recover
data that you accidentally deleted or
delete it and want back on to your phone
so if you have data on your phone that
you really want back with this
particular tool you can get it back
without an issue there is also a
transfer module now this will also work
with iOS and Android in both computers
but one thing that you need to pay
attention to is you need to have USB
debugging enabled to allow it to work
after that and everything is connected
and ready to go navigating through the
transfer module is easy as a PI you can
transfer your contacts music photos
video and more between your devices and
computers you can also transfer media to
and from your iTunes with a click of a
button there's also the switch module
which is like the transfer module except
you can switch all data with a click of
just one button for you iPhone owners
out there there's even a dedicated
module to repair your iOS device this
device fixes various iOS issues such as
stuck Apple logos recovery mode looping
and more another tool in the toolkit by
dr. phone is a backup and restore module
this module lets you backup date on your
phone easily as well as restore backed
up files selectively to any device in
case you want to sell your phone or give
your phone away to somebody you don't
want
all of your information is still be on
that phone so doctor phone also has an
erase module which permanently deletes
all the information off your phone I
don't know about you but sometimes I
simply forget my PIN or my unlock code
and this can be a real pain for you to
deal with but luckily dr. phone has an
unlock module which can solve that
problem for you
this module removes the lock screen to
your device and in the process it's
super easy just connect your device to a
computer and confirm what kind of device
you have next just follow some simple
on-screen instructions and let doctor
phone do the rest
once dr. phone is done you'll be up and
using your device again in no time
many Android users out there love to
super modify their phone and doctor
phone also has you covered because they
have a root module now if you guys know
sometimes you're gonna get phone can be
a little bit of a pain but with this
it's very simple to do Rudy your phone
allows you access to more apps you can
install custom roms and uninstall that
pre-installed bloated software by
rooting your Android device and then
unlock its full potential the bottom
line here folks is this if you're a
person who works on a lot of different
phones or you simply upgrade your phone
quite a bit or you just have phone
problems doctor phone can probably solve
all your problems and make your life a
lot easier now right now they're gonna
