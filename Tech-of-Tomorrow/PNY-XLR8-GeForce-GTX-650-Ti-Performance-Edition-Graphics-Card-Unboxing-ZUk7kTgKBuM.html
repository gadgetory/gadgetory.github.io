it's me el Ark here in the tectum our
youtube channel bringing you guys yet
another unboxing what are we taking out
of the box today well today we'll be
taking a look at the P&amp;amp;Y
GTX 650 T I now this is pretty much an
entry-level video card for gamers from
the people over at Nvidia it's
well-priced it's been pretty well
received by all the market and the one I
have today just happens to be from PNY
now back in the day PNY used to be one
of the absolute biggest memory companies
around if anybody went back in the day
to Circuit City or any of these other
old computer coming used to be around
these guys were the main brand well now
like anybody else they have treaded the
river of change and they've moved into
graphics cards and so we've got one of
those and let's pop this bad boy open
I've got the trusty knife right here you
guys can see that this thing's
completely in its sealed package and so
here I'll just show you guys the back of
the box and now let's just transition
over the table and let's open this bad
boy up alright folks so here we got it
I'm gonna go ahead and take the trusty
knife make a slit across the top there
I'll be like a Christmas kid and open
this up have its packaging get out of
the way okay up here on top though they
do have some things called their added
value they have movie night you can
choose from a bunch of different titles
you get a free Pandaren monk pet coupon
inside which is the world of warcraft
thing that's pretty cool because a lot
of people like that shit
you get three three month subscription
to ESEA that's all pretty good stuff so
beyond that way way out for their cards
are a little bit different these guys
are always based on the reference design
but that can be a good thing for many
reasons so the pop here now for one
thing people talk a lot of shit about
reference designs many times but with
the reference design card if you're
going to be doing any modifications
going out and getting a water cooler
usually the easiest way to get that done
is
a reference face card now if you don't
want to screw with it at all then you
want to look for something with some
extremely crazy cooling you know like
something by you know MSI is ZOTAC or a
soos but you know these guys do a really
good job and those ones I named off with
the guys who do you know in video cards
there other companies out there not
trying to diss on those guys so here's
this now can't show you guys the number
but there's a number under here and it
says you have the weapon now get your
free Panther and monk what so here we go
DVI to VGA connector out of the way
molex to 6-pin out of the way mini HDMI
to standard HDMI out of the way now it
says it comes with a couple different
brackets I don't happen to see those in
there but put this thing around here you
guys can see it says supposed to come
with a bunch of different little
brackets so maybe you use it for like a
low profile but I don't think so the car
looks too big so now let's go to the
card now this card is very very small so
let me bring it up here here's the hand
of me here's the card ten car yeah car
single fan
flipped around rear i/o QD VI I'm in the
HDMI very simple flip it around the back
you guys to see this card's about apply
bite an inch inch and a quarter wide
it's probably about almost 5 inches long
I don't know what that guy deal with my
damn measuring thing today now
underneath here we see the single 6 pin
power connector right here flip it
around back of the card PCIe interface
right there it's on a black PCB a lot of
people for that in their systems and
that's pretty much it so that's it folks
I hope you guys liked this video
PNY is a very well-priced card this
thing's probably going to run very quiet
and very cool since it's one of the
entry-level cards it's not gonna have
too much bump to make it run hot but
it'll still probably perform very well
I'm now gonna go take it the one in my
test system want a bunch of benchmarks
and then we'll bring you the full review
also I know a lot of you guys in the
past said well the other challenge I was
doing that we did a lot of unboxings not
as reviews we're going to try to and
pick that up
I may even hire another guy to actually
work with me on the channel and do it
and bring you guys more videos so we're
gonna try to pick up the speed around
here do you guys like the video please
hit that like button always makes my
heart appreciate it also we have lots of
giveaways and stuff going on so make
sure you hit the sub button so you don't
miss out on anything like usual if
you're interested in purchasing this
card or anything else please take a look
