YouTube land Elric Ferriss
editor-in-chief here today on the tech
of tomorrow YouTube channel
well thermaltake was kind of provided
with this little black bag no I'm just
joking this little black bag actually
came in a box and today we're taking a
look at the Thermaltake Shock one gaming
headset these are a set of USB gaming
headset that actually has some removal
pads and a pretty cool mouthpiece for
talking into so first of all take it out
the back here so you guys take a look at
it there was actually drivers
installation disc in there somewhere
along the line I lost that sucker but
one of the first thing we talked about
is there - such a headphones that you
can remove for your ear pads to set
there's these pads which are made of
like foam and these kind of suck I don't
really like these they're not very good
then they come with a traditional title
that are made of kind of a leather type
these are better much better he's come
on they're very comfortable put on your
head you've also got a flip around
microphone that you can talk directly
into for gaming so that's you know
talking to your gaming headset comes
with a little USB plug in or standard
USB 1.0 or 2.0 and actually I'll get
said before it comes with the driver
yeah if you're just a gamer and you're
playing games these headphones work
really good they have really nice bass
response but when it comes to the high
end of things they kind of lose their
their stability and stuff the cat she
sounds pretty good most the time either
say hello or get out of my camera range
you glory hog alright now there she goes
the camera out of there but bigsley the
shocked one headphones they're like $70
you can find online and if you're
strictly a gamer and you're looking for
a solid set of headphones that will play
all your games let you interact with
other gamers these are good buy if
you're listening to like really like
classical music or your real high-end
audio file you might want to search
somewhere else these things like they
say they are the shock one gaming
headset they're geared for gamers
they're good for gamers strong points
are they are pretty noise cancellation
they're very soft and comfortable have
great risk use me have great bass
response and once again are good for the
gaming environment so for 70 bucks you
make your decision but I think there are
pretty nice set of headphones they have
some pretty good features and not too
many drawbacks so thanks for watching
Tecna tomorrow and we'll see you here
once again
