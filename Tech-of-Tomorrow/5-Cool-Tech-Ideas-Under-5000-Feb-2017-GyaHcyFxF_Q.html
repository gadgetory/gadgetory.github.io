see you guys back here once again on
TECA tomorrow so once again we're going
to bring you guys the top 5 cool gadgets
for under $50 now two of the items in
this list were provided the FM
transmitter and the indoor those are
both provided by sponsors everything
else we bought ourselves off of Amazon
to bring you guys this video so what
that said though let's jump in and let's
check out the top cool 5 devices for
your tech needs for under 50 bucks
alright folks so first off we have a
little gadget that's coming in the
market at under 30 bucks now this is the
newest the FM transmitter bluetooth
thing all that good stuff in this little
device now if you have an older car
chances are that you don't need
Bluetooth connectivity you have all that
stuff built into your car but if you
have an older car and you want to get
that technology inside your car without
a bunch of hassle this works very simply
the design is really neat on the top you
have a screen you have different buttons
for changing the options on it
you have changing your channels the mode
fast Bors next song and play as well as
a button to answer your phone and in
addition to that you also get to
different places to charge your USB
devices you have one of them unit itself
and then one of the dog lowdown bullets
you plug into your lighter now to get
started with this it's very simple you
can be a no-brainer and install this
device you simply plug the device into
your lighter port connect any of your
smart devices that work by bluetooth and
you're up and going and like I said both
this items come in the market right now
for under $30 so if you're interested in
something like this I think it's pretty
cool what about you and while we're
talking about Bluetooth devices let's
check out another one this is the D 900
mini by syllable now these are a
completely different breed of Bluetooth
headphones that I've ever seen now most
headphones out there they have cables
going all over the place well that is
not the case with the syllable 900 minis
these things are really neat there's no
cable involved whatsoever and what's
actually even cooler is the box that
comes in doubles as a charging station
so not only does it look cool to carry
them around so they don't get damaged
when you want to charge them you simply
place them back into the charger I think
this is a pretty neat option having
nothing hanging around my neck is
perfect for the gym you don't want to
get your hands
anything when you're out working out or
anything and I feel for gym stuff this
is one of the best ones that I've seen
yet the d900 mini also features
easy-to-use buttons which allow you to
skip play pause and all your music track
as well as your phone without ever
reaching for your phone you can be at
the 30 feet away and these bluetooth
headphones will still work in open space
they also offer super quick pairing with
all Android and iOS devices so no matter
what you have you can stay connected not
only is that little charging box cool
it's also very portable and you can
charge your headphones up to six times
without having to replug in the box and
the syllables also offer two hours of
listening time before they need
recharging the syllable 900 minis are
not only small they're also very
lightweight coming into market at 0.1 7
ounces they're perfect like I said
before for the gym running jogging all
that kind of stuff we don't want any
messy cables in the way whatsoever this
product is currently on sale for under
$50 let me know what you think wow I
didn't realize I had so many Bluetooth
technology products on the table today
but I do now this product right here
this is from ICI technologies now this
is a completely portable keyboard that
you can stick in your pocket that works
off bluetooth it's very small it folds
out to a fully functioning keyboard and
it's pretty nifty you guys can see that
the ICI technology foldable Bluetooth
keyboard offers an ultra slim portable
design it features a built-in
rechargeable life polymer battery and it
works with iOS Android and Windows and
for me the ability to hook this keyboard
up to my phone is really cool the easy
keyboard is very very light it comes to
marketed 6.4 ounces
it's made of aircraft-grade aluminum so
you know it'll last a long time and the
built-in live polymer battery provides
more than 60 hours of effective usage
time that's pretty damn cool as well 60
hours is quite a bit of time gives you
lots of time in between charges inside
the package you get the ICI technologies
portable bluetooth keyboard a u.s.
charging cable and the user's manual
although the keyboards not the size of a
full-sized keyboard when you're running
around using our phone or some smaller
device that only has one of those
digital keyboards you'll be very happy
that you have this in your
and because it's very easy to use like I
said it's not quite as big as a regular
keyboard but it's definitely big enough
to make things more ergonomic when
you're on the go I don't know what you
guys think but for 35 bucks I think this
is the coolest technology of the day
what do you think next up the Zender a
series what is the a series let's find
out the center a series of 40 watt max 4
port high speed USB charger
it features travel adapters for around
the world and if you own an iPhone it
also features cusing 2.0 technology but
the charger can be used with any other
device that offers a USB connection
the high speed 4 port charger features 2
different types of technologies the
first connection is the qualcomm 2.0
port this is perfect for all of your
phones the other three features then
technology which automatically adjusts
to the type of current that it needs and
charge your device as fast as possible
although this device may seem a little
mundane to some if you travel around a
lot you have a lot of device that may be
charged very quickly this may come in
very handy in that critical moment
alright folks last but not least -
Lucero smart bulb now one thing I like
about this smart bulb better than the
Phillips is that the Phillips requires a
lot of equipment and a lot of investment
to get going
this particular bulb does pretty much
all the same things but works right off
your phone so you cut out all that BS
and operate it strictly from your phone
now this is a 7 one light bulb that
changes colors to pretty much anything
that you can think of and it's very
simple to use you simply plug it in
download the app and from there you can
change all the colors brightness and
everything you need to change the mood
of your room to exactly what you like
now the bulb features 16 million colors
it has scheduled actions and you can
also put a bunch of them together to
create the ultimate atmosphere
it also features 20 pre-programmed modes
40,000 hours of life time 550 lumens and
7.5 watt which is equivalent to a
standard 60 watt light bulb this bulb is
currently on sale for $30 which is about
$30 cheaper than one by Philips but the
absolute best thing I feel about it is
that it's easily operated through any of
you
smart devices that's what I think is
really the coolest you just install the
app plug the bulb in and voila you're up
and going and you can create any type of
different atmosphere or mood that your
mind can think of all right fans so
there you have it the top 5 tech gadgets
for under $50 for February 2017 I'm
Miller you've been watching tech of
tomorrow download Lightfoot and web
links for all these products so if you
want to get more information or buy one
