what all right man I guess this mouse is
so hot the cameramen can't even hold on
to it hey what's going on gang I'm Eric
and you guys are once again back on the
tech homeworld tech of tomorrow we bring
you all the tech all the time today
we're bringing you the blazing red
theron programmable gaming mouse it's
actually used by a guy over in Taiwan
we'll just shorten his name real quick
night now to Apollo but bases thing is
from the Theron series from thermaltake
this is more they're really cool gaming
mice in these things actually come right
now in about I think six different
colors and it actually changes to a
bunch of different colors as well but
they right now have yellow green blue
red just all kinds of so with that said
let's do the unboxing and overview and
see what this is nicks all about alright
folks now let's check out the front of
the box now you guys can see they got
this thing all red and it's all flying
on fire we got the t's ports on the left
that will end them on the right like a
dragon you can see it's the Theron
gaming mouse blazing red it's got a
function lock button says battle mode
RTS game battle it's got onboard memory
and seven individual colors now let's go
ahead let's pop box open where you guys
can see it says on the fly sensitivity
adjustment levels from 100 to 50 600 DPI
beneath side light change by clicking
frequently during battle mo which means
if you're clicking a bunch of times the
light and the bottom is actually going
to change colors it also is a pause
break lighting system on the logo to
engage gaming atmosphere so basically is
going to light up different colors
making it look just coolest when
you're gaming you've also got different
weight adjustments you can do five
different weight adjustments and you
guys can see the polling rate there is
from 125 500 or 1000 different cycles
also has a custom I'll graphic user
interface GUI for personalized macro
keys advanced performance and light
options you guys can all see that and
then on the right we actually see the
mouse in the box flip it around real
quick on the back of the box you guys
either got the Theron logo we got the TT
Apollo's softball Taiwan it's a
professional starcraft 2 player from the
Taiwan eSports leagues got his little
signature there once again it just says
five way adjustments and the omron
button switching provides light to touch
click activation while staying durable
for a life span of 5 million
so basically this thing's going to last
next to forever with that said let's get
it out of the box and take a close-up
alright folks and now you guys can see
we've got this thing all outside of the
box here you got a carrying case all
your drivers and everything or inside
this packaging right here now let's get
this stuff out of the way here and let's
actually start talking a lot about the
mouse itself so we'll just start over
here now this thing has a dpi like i
said before from 100 DPI to 50 600 DPI
sensor type is laser there are eight
buttons it's an RTS type mouse it has
128 kilobytes of memory it has 40 macro
keys and five gaming profiles along with
seven lighting color options the
dimensions are 123 point 65 by 73.8 by
40 point 2 millimeters we give two
millimeters and this thing's coming to
market at about 60 bucks so with that
said on the right hand side you see the
first two of the buttons right here over
here we see additional buttons on top we
also have the scroller right here in the
center on the other another button right
here and here's one of the lights right
here now they say that when you're on
this you can actually change the
different lights but is your cliq
including game mode I guess it
automatically changes to a bunch of
different lights as well um now the DPI
can be switched and you can see it right
here on the mouse it will tell you what
exactly is going on why your gaming so
let's start off folks I turn it over
take a look at the bottom thing we can
see that I took a little cover off right
here to show you guys the weight you
have five different weight categories I
prefer to keep all five min I like my
mouth to be as heavy as possible we have
a lock unlock button and above that we
have the laser alright folks now let's
just count out the eight keys you're
going to have right here right buttons
rather so you have one two three four
five six seven and button aight located
on the right hand side this thing's not
ambidextrous it's definitely meant for a
right-handed gamer pop that down last
but not least gold plated connection
and if you're going to be off and on the
go you just a zip feel bag up throw the
old mouse in the bag and voila hasta
LaVista baby all right folks so there
you guys have it man the Theron blazing
red gaming mouse all kinds of
programmability eight buttons very very
accurate in the DPI since it goes from
150 600 it's gonna have a lot of space
for you me personally if its a 50 600
DPI that things going so fast across the
screen I don't know what the frak to do
if anything over 2,000 for my old button
it's just moving too fast but that's
just me personally other people have it
and that's why they have the
availability from 102 5600 because
obviously different people have
different likings now like I said this
thing is coming to market at about sixty
dollars sort of you're near a fire
engine red or Ferrari red type mouse you
want to match your bad asses that you've
custom-made this may just be the mouse
that you want to get in your arsenal
