back once again today we have something
very interesting to talk about now
yesterday the lovely DHL man showed up
these are the guys who deliver stuff
from around the world and we've got
something delivered to us from the
people over at Gemini actually two
different things a case and a completely
AAA io liquid cooler now this is pretty
cool stuff for one thing the case yeah I
think it dip uted it the last CES they
kind of showed this case off but it
wasn't in production yet
well the final version is here it's
called the Gemini acts and the reason
it's called the Gemini X as well if you
guys know anything about Gemini's
Gemini's are supposed to have two
separate personalities so hence this
particular system the Gemini acts has
two different chambers to it that's
right so you can put two different
systems actually inside of one case hmm
man I don't know what's going on today
feel like I have a frog stuck in my
throat here on its they're kind of hot
but anyways this case is really nifty
now I have to say though I was kind of a
little bit we disappointed that you
couldn't build to complete full-blown
like gaming systems in it that's what I
was really hoping for you can do two
systems B there's two chambers now the
first chamber however it you inside of
that particular chamber you can build a
full-sized build on that side but on the
other side you can only build a mini ITX
build now as far as the dimensions of
this case it's actually pretty big its
sizes in at four twenty six by six
thirty five by five hundred twenty five
millimeters all in all a giant case now
what's also really unique about this
case is that on most cases the side
paneling is only usually one millimeter
thick they used three millimeter siding
so it's a really strong really durable
which you know hence adds on a little
bit of weight to the case and the glass
instead of being your standard four
millimeter glass it's five millimeter
glass obviously it traveled all the way
from Taiwan all the way over to here and
there was absolutely no damage we've had
some other cases come in
especially when from Leon Lee that came
in that was just completely crushed all
the glass broke everything and it
destroyed this however handled the
journey no problem so if you're
wondering if you're gonna you know buy
it somewhere it's gonna get broken
shipping most likely not ours came
inside of the box that it came in and
really the only reason that I didn't
bring a full unboxing is look this thing
weighs almost 40 pounds it's 39 pounds
that's a lot of weight it's a heavy duty
case but it's made to be heavy-duty plus
it weighs a lot now as far as the
outside design goes you guys will see
that on both sides of the case there are
glass panels on both sides so if you
undo an RGB build you could have it
completely open so people could see it
getting inside the system to do your
build is also very easy you guys can see
on each window on the right side and the
left side that there are these huge
giant thumb screws that you use to
remove the glass panels they're very
easy to use you just simply turn them
and the windows pop off plus you can
actually take this case and do it one of
two ways you can either build it sitting
upright like you see it behind me right
now or it can be turned on its side for
a vertical build so whichever way you're
looking to make the case and do your
build to show off your stuff you can do
it these are actually some of the really
fun and nice things about this case that
I like I mean so so far we've seen it
looks cool it's got a really nice design
it's got two cool windows expandability
in the first system you have eight
expansion slots inside of there you can
fit two 240 millimeter radiators inside
of there you can get to put put them on
the side you can put one in the back
that's quite a bit of room you can also
do five fans so it's got room for 520
millimeter fans dependants aims if I'm
going too fast v 122 millimeter fan
sorry I'm I'm trying to keep up with
myself and keep all thoughts going in my
head without without without stumbling
you can use any type of motherboard on
the primary side as well it'll take all
the way up to CEB size motherboard so if
you want to use the mini ITX motherboard
it'll take it why would you want to do
that when you got all this giant room in
there I don't know but hey some people
might now the maximum blame for a
graphics card inside the primary side is
350 millimeters or thirteen point seven
seven inches
the maximum CPU cooler height which is
basically the distance from your CPU
cooler to the glass window is 140
millimeters or 5.51 inches just a little
bit under six inches on the primary side
you can also use a standard ATX power
supply now one thing you're gonna
definitely notice however though is that
on the primary side there is nothing in
there for any of your hard drives or
storage or anything like that because
all of that is actually in the secondary
side of the system
now this complete system is designed
though to have really nice airflow the
way that's designed with all the fans
the air actually goes all the way up
through the center of the system taking
all of that air and pushing it away and
taking all that hot stuff away from your
system it's actually quite a nice design
in that particular aspect as a lot of
people are going okay well how does it
cool how do the fans work well this
system was completely designed to make
sure that the air goes up through those
panels and keeps everything running nice
and cool now the only caveat to this
particular thing is this system didn't
come with any fans whatsoever that's
right I'm not even joking not even one
single fan it's a fan 'la system so it's
either gonna be really quiet and run a
little hot or you're going to go out and
buy yourself some fans now like I said
the secondary side of this particular
system it only will take a mini ITX
motherboard so I guess that they're
thinking that you know one system will
be your primary gaming system and then
the other system would be there like a
streaming system or a media system or
something like that I would have
preferred to be able to a be really
high-end AMD gaming system and a really
high and Intel system and have them both
right there it would be great for
testing you know we could just sit right
there you want to go to the system okay
just switch it over the other system and
you're good to go
but unfortunately no that's not
happening
like I said previously all of your drive
bays are located in the secondary system
you have 43.5 drive bays and 42.5 drive
bays now the expansion slots in the
secondary system are only two since it's
you know a mini ITX motherboard this
side can also take five fans as well 220
millimeters to the left two on the right
and one on the rear
now the graphics card linked on the
secondary system is 330 millimeters or
twelve point nine nine inches and the
maximum CPU cooler right is identical to
the primary side at one hundred and
forty millimeters or 5.5 one inches now
the PSU you can only use an SFX power
supply on the secondary system so you're
not gonna be able to look you know put a
big ol large power supply in that side
of the system another cool thing about
the Gemini X's it has rubber feet on
both sides of the case so where they're
gonna put the case you know facing
upward or horizontally it has rubber
feet to make sure it's not gonna go
sliding around and scratching and hang
up when you're using it now I have to
say this for originality this is a
really cool idea I like the design of
the case a lot I think it's beautiful
it's a little bit heavy but oh well who
cares you're gonna have two systems in
there so for people out there who are
looking to like have two systems in the
you know in their house especially I
guess where the people are doing
streaming and stuff like that you could
have your primary gaming system and your
streaming system or your media system
all in the same case it's just gonna
take up a lot of area as you saw and
since the case already weighs 40 pounds
when you load it up with two systems
you're probably looking at a 60 or 70
pound computer you know especially if
you go with you know for standard hard
drive so go with SSDs yeah it might be a
little lighter and depending on your
video card you know if you put 220 80
eyes in this bad boy you know in SLI
you're gonna be talking about some
weight you know I'm saying so overall
it's a great idea I really like this
design now we're gonna have to put our
two systems didn't put our heads
together and just figure out exactly how
we want to do this because like I said I
really would have preferred if I could
have built two systems of equality but I
guess there's only enough room to
continue to do so much having all of
your drives and everything and the
secondary thing excuse me on the
secondary side is kind of cool if you
don't want to show the secondary side
whatsoever you can make it so it's on
the bottom and you can put all your
color for lights your RGB stuff all on
the top showing that stuff off you don't
even have to show up that other system
whatsoever but if you're going to be
using it in an upright position
obviously you guys will see it's gonna
take up a lot of room now one thing I
didn't talk about is you know on the
for the IO control panels well you've
got a single USB type-c two USB 3.0
ports you have your standard input jack
for a mic and your standard audio port
pretty simple stuff as far as that goes
and that's pretty much everything and
there is about this brand-new Gemini X
case and the people over at Gemini like
usual aha the link down below we'll also
be doing a build and bringing you the
build video on this and the reason I
really didn't unbox this per se is
because it was so heavy and I'm still
like in my wheelchair I just kind of
climbed over the chair so it wouldn't
look as funny today but I still really
can't walk yet so I couldn't really get
the Box up but inside of the box it's
real quick before I bounced out of here
it does come with all the stuff that you
need to get up and going so all your
screws and everything you need to mount
your motherboard your fans and all that
kind of stuff that comes in a bag you
get all that kind of stuff inside of it
with the case itself so I'm Mellor
you've been watching Tekken more if
you're not sub please do so check out
the links below to get more information
and hey if you don't have notifications
turned on and you're going to get
notified brother</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
