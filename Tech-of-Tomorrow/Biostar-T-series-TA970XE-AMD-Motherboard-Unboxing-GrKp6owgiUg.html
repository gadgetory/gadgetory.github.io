boys doesn't support any of the FX
processors being the ap use but this is
a pretty good board focus points are
sports all the new processors it'll
support crossfire no SLI but it's $89 so
that means you can go out to one of
those AMD processors about 129 dollars
and for $200 you've got yourself a
really solid set up that said let's jump
in and see what comes inside the box of
this new product from Biostar
so hey folks I'm gonna do this
differently here's the Box today now I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys the
back of the motherboard you can see that
it says t overclocker a lot of people
don't know about biostar they think that
all they make is low-end products I'm
actually going to be working with them
this year I will actually have my own
motherboard with these folks that's
right you guys will see the doc
overclocked motherboard from Biostar we
want to make sure you guys know there's
different products from biostar Biostar
has a high-end product line they have
their entry-level product line the
t-series is their overclocking line so
not you guys seen the box let's put the
top here's the contents right here so
today we're gonna do something
instrument interesting it's going to be
throw the shit at the cameramen so no
here we go here's the Biostar this is
the CD at the kamemon I even hit his ass
next we have up the manual the T a 970
XC next part
once again the cameramen but you can
hear ricocheting off them so you have
the rear i/o pretty simple where IO
it does say what's on up that's not very
color coded it's again oh I missed the
camera in that time motherfuckers learn
in the Dodge that's right last but not
least we have looks like one two three
four of the SATA cables these are the
new SATA 3 cables last but not least
we're gonna be checking these at the
crown oh it's got him right in the eye
that time I'm having fun here so that
was basically the content you'd see that
as the bundles page fort motherboards a
torque little sound effect as I check
the box over that way
but spare the Cameron that one but hey
he is learning to duck alright so let's
move on now now we're gonna get rid of
the box
lots of banging smacking anti-static bag
they all come in that and let's pop the
motherboard out now so let's check it
out let me get it out here and lay it
out here
Cameron can you refocus down here onto
the motherboard so now let's take a look
at the motherboard itself
we can see we got the am3 ZIF socket
right here this is more like I said
before all of the latest CPUs that are
by AMD 32 gigabytes of ddr3 memory we
have a single power fan connector up
here the top one of you guys can see
that rig at the camera
don't you guys couldn't see that now
even though they don't talk a lot about
it they do use pretty good quality
components you can see that everything
is covered all the MOSFETs or anything
are being cooled by these two coolers
right here
they're both passive they have no active
cooling on them whatsoever we have
another one of those down here right
here we have the 24 pin power connector
we have the additional power up here the
four pin over on this corner right here
will move down the board start up at the
PCI we have 1/2 of the PCI 1x lanes then
we have 1/2 of the PCIe lanes now these
run in 16 and 4 they do not run an 8 and
8 but you can use crossfire in it we
also have 2 standard PCI slots down here
in the bottom we have 7.1 HD audio
gigabyte land we can see all that's
right here on the motherboard as far as
SATA
SATA 6 gigabit all the way around you
can see we have one two connectors right
here we have our reset and start switch
right here you can see those as well
along with another fan header right here
then we have one two three additional of
the USB headers flip it around show you
guys right here this is where all the
case wiring comes in to your case and
hooks up to your motherboard all your
start and all that good stuff
flip it around let's take a look at the
rear i/o wery it was pretty good and
fleshed out we have two four six of the
standard USB ports we have two of the
USB 3.0 ports for your audio we have
both coaxial and spdif we also have a
standard keyboard port so you get ps2
stuff that old-school stuff you'll know
that connection as well we have external
eSATA then we also have the rj45 LAN and
then all of ours normal analog audio
they're so pretty fleshed out rear i/o
and that's pretty much it folks
