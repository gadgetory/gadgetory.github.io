once again on Tekken tomorrow with buddy
the dog in G behind the camera today
we're gonna be taking a look at a pretty
killer gaming monitor from the people
over at ESO now this is their force FS 2
7 3 5 and it has a lot of features that
I think you're gonna like so that me
more let's check this out so fans I know
that usually monitors aren't the most
new exciting technology in the world but
let's just face it if you want a game
you want to have a really good monitor
now ezal is pretty new to the game but
they have a lot of different models to
choose from and the one that we're
checking out today
is a forest fs2 735 now the 2 7 3 5
features a 27 inch backlit LED IPS panel
and it's almost bezel as you guys can
see the bezel on the front is very very
small the native resolution of the two
735 is 2560 by 1440 and it features a 16
to 9 aspect ratio which is widescreen
which is really great for gaming and
watching a lot of movies for those folks
who really care about all the details
the pixel pitch is 0.23 three times 0.23
3 millimeters it features a greyscale
tone of 256 tones and it also features
sixteen point seven seven million
display colors the typical brightness of
this monitor is 350 CD with blue
reduction off there's also feature in
the menu where you can turn this feature
on or off now the contrast ratio is a
thousand to one and the typical response
time is four milliseconds and 178 degree
viewing angle means that no matter where
you look at this monitor no matter where
you're positioned dad it's gonna be
pretty much looking just like you're
sitting in front of it okay so those the
technical specs but what about the
ergonomic specs the things that make the
monitor be able to be adjusted to your
perfection well this monitor offers -
tilt and pivot so no matter how you want
your monitor set in front of you you'll
be able to set it up so it's just
perfect for you
now the force FS - 735 like all monitors
has an OSD menu but the weird thing
about this one is that all the controls
are located on the back to shuffle
between the different ones you simply
put your hand back behind the monitor do
all your adjustments and you're good to
go
but what this monitor offers that no
other monitor I've yet to see offers is
you can actually adjust the menu through
your phone or what's even cooler
your in-game there's an application that
you can download and use where you can
be notified on screen of someone calling
you why you're in a game so instead of
your phone ringing and disturbing you or
whatever
there'll be an on stream menu that comes
on and says hey somebody's calling you
now this probably won't work with the
old landlines but if you've got a cell
phone be it with our Android or iOS you
can use this feature and it's pretty
cool as you guys can see here when
someone calls you hey there's a reminder
on the screen that says hey so-and-so is
calling you and I like that feature so
if you've got your headphones on you
can't hear anything going in live
anyways you can just see it right there
on your screen and Noah hey Bob called
call Bob back and what's really cool is
they even have custom notifications
including things like pac-man which you
guys can see here another feature about
this monitor is their G ignition
software app now this app can control
everything inside of your windows
environments you can change every kind
of aspect that you want to do color
brightness etc it's all there inside of
the ignition app and just like the pop
up app you can download this app for
your phone whether it be for the Android
or the iOS environment and not only can
you control these things from your phone
you can actually import other people's
settings like the top gamers around the
world and use them on your system
another cool thing about the forest FS
two three five depending on how you look
at it is that it has built-in speakers
there are actually two built in one watt
speakers who have stereo sound built
into the monitor now if you don't have
any speakers or don't want any speakers
on your desktop this can actually be a
pretty cool feature I know there's some
people out there if killer surround
sound but if you want something that's
gonna offer no clutter no mess these are
nice as we take a look at the back of
the forest this is where all the
controls are located you have your power
you have two HDMI is a single
DisplayPort and a single DVI port
connection and if you like the option of
hooking up USB devices to your monitor
the FS to 7:35 also has two USB 3.0
ports located on the rear alright so
there you pretty much have it the
aesthetics the whitepaper but the big
question of the day is how does it game
damn it
well let's check out a couple games and
see
if you're a gamer obviously you've heard
of doom and we got to play the latest
doom on the FS to 735 and you guys can
see that it looks absolutely beautiful I
really truly believe that 2160 by 1440
is the really sweet spot for playing
games for K you have a lot more space on
the monitor but if you want a lot of
pixel pumping action your video car can
definitely handle this resolution much
easier than trying to pump 4k and then
after we were doomed we went and checked
out GTA 5 one of my favorites actually
it's one of my family's favorites and
G's favorites too so here you can see we
do some shoot it up inside of here as
well and once again you guys can see the
colors look absolutely brilliant there's
no tearing whatsoever and for you AMD
fans out there one of the great features
about this monitor is it features
freesync technology which means that you
can get a maximum refresh rate of 144
Hertz which is awesome if you're a gamer
because you want that perfect flicker
free non tearing gaming environment but
one thing you need to take note of with
freesync technology it only works
through the display port so if you're
kind of a DVI connection hdmi and you're
going to yourself why can i get my fries
thing to work well the reason is you're
not using the right cable alright folks
so there you guys have it the Forrest FS
273 5 from ezel now I know you guys are
wondering through the whole game who's
doing the gameplay you guys don't know
it's buddy the dog come on I thought you
guys knew this but he's doing all that
gameplay footage he's pretty awesome
right I mean I think he is anyways so
like you guys can see this monitor has a
whole lot of Technology and a whole lot
of features that are built inside of it
vom deep fans out there I know you guys
like that freesync technology it's
something really cool and it makes your
gaming experience just the absolute best
flicker free no in-game screen tearing
done on that stuff just smooth awesome
gameplay it doesn't hurt your eyes at
144 Hertz and for some reason if you
don't know what this is free sync is
just like Nvidia g-sync it's just you
know one's free and on the md side and
one is g sync and cost you a free few
bucks but that's pretty much it but all
those features make for really great
monitor now I might have to duck here
because I know you guys are gonna like
freak out and this is there is a caveat
this monitor yes there is folks and that
thing is that it's very expensive it's
like $1,200 may cover buddy's ears I
don't want to make it mad it's $1,200 no
you guys start trying to throw stuff at
me and I think they missed the money so
anyways what's that are you going to
kiss all right well that's the nice
thing that's not a candy it's sisters up
with a puppy but anyways this monitor
has a lot of great features but like I
said the price is pretty high but
there's no other monitor out there that
I've seen that has these same
applications on it like no other I've
seen has the things where you can go on
your phone do all these adjustments
import gaming profiles for all your
lights and all that stuff and then
nobody else offers that and that pop-up
that you get when you're playing games
you're on your headphones it tells you
who's calling and stuff that's pretty
cool and if you're pac-man fan won't hey
no I know you're old-school anyways
that's for damn sure if you're back man
anyways
hey I'm Miller buddy the dog TV on the
camera all this information will be
located down below that like button so
you guys know what to do if that like
button and check out all those features
also if for some reason you want to
monitor everything inside your computer
and you don't have money for any
software there's this stop first stuff
called NZXT scam it's completely free
and what's really cool about it is it
just does a whole lot of different stuff
and they're in the stages of building
this so give it a try if there's
something wrong that it doesn't work for
you just let them know because this
actually helps them obviously not every
system out there is going to be able to
use it but a lot of systems do you've
seen demos on our channel if you fall as
it works pretty good doesn't you know
take up a lot of your system space or
anything like that so peace out that'll
be down there below as well and we'll
see you guys back in the channel for
more tech bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
