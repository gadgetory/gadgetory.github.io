Vance - a lot of cool programmable
buttons lots of features on this thing

impatient so I think without like

oh there he goes he's a love dog he
loves to love and I guess we should just
probably get into the unboxing before he
goes crazy
alright you want to go what do you want
hmm
all right so first we're gonna take a
look and we'll see the outside of the
box we can see it's a CM storm Sentinel
advanced two and then we'll jump around
and take a look at the specification in
the back of the box right hand
ergonomic design vago a b NS 9800 laser
sensor 202 8200 dpi tracking resolution
on the fly DPI tuning as little as one
point five millimeter liftoff up to a
hundred and fifty IPS a hundred and
twenty five Hertz to a thousand hertz
USB rate fine tuning which is called
poling 128 kilobytes sentinel x memory
for profiles and macros nine virtual
buttons via the button combinations what
things where you wouldn't add the
seventeen because nine and eight equals
seventeen we're talking about that a
minute ago the customizable oh le d--
logo customizable multicolored LED light
system it also comes with five four
point five gram weight fine-tuning
system now let's open up and see the
inside of the box so starting off look
at the top of the box
we see it says it has a superior gaming
grade sensor now i don't know if this is
a mistake or that's actually what's
supposed to be it may be supposed to be
superior but maybe they really do mean
superior next up we see the customizable
profile light effects this means you can
change the color at the top of the mouse
from red to blue yellow to green that's
pretty cool to the right of that we also
have a 128 kilobytes sentinel x memory
for profiles and macros on the fly DPI
fine tuning to the left of that this is
something that's actually quite cool you
can add your clan or your community logo
right to your mouse this mouse also
comes with an advanced driver panel has
its own GUI for customizing and working
with this mouse that's pretty cool
too also we have the storm tactics
multiplier key next up we have the
weight fine-tuning system which is a
bunch of different wave little pieces of
metal that will actually allow you to
make your mouse lighter or heavier
depending on your needs all this real
quick glance at the bottom of the box
you guys can see all these things ok we
can also see the mouse inside of is
plastics clamshell cover there then i'm
going to break out my trusty knife right
here you guys can see that nice click of
the click go ahead make an insertion
down here in the bottom
cut that pop the caps put and pull
everything slightly out so what's that
some sound effects as I toss it
cameraman oh alright so here's the
clamshell we're going to go ahead and
remove the clamshell we'll see the mouse
itself real quick I'll pull that let's
just take a look at the accessory
packages basically this just has their
website and all that stuff on there then
we've got some custom little plastic
pieces to put on the mouse don't know
exactly what they are but I'm sure we'll
figure it out then we've got the user's
manual warranty information tells all
their product warranties and all that
stuff in here for actually all their
products so if there are any question
about any warranties they're all in here
no matter what the product is then let's
take a look at the mouse itself you can
see the right side of it we have this
and we have that Excel button that we
talked about earlier which allows do you
have 17 buttons so the nine and eight
buttons together create 17 just spin
around let you guys see the sleek look
right there take a side look take a top
look so here we are have one two three
four five buttons on top your center
button there are no buttons on this side
at all so you guys the front kind of
under view then the total bottom view
here's the sensor Sentinel advanced two
also as we see at the bottom of the
mouse you guys can see it says right
here it's made in China
oh yes and then earlier we talked also
about the weights they're located inside
of here so let me turn this thing around
right here and pop this thing off so
here are the weights I guess they just
actually pull out one by one actually
let the camera shoot a nice shot of
those I'm actually gonna pull any of
these out right now you need to see them
but each one them is weighed at 4.55 you
can see that if you want to make them
the mouse lighter though you just
casually pull them out
and then put them back in to your liking
the back plate it pops on nice and
neatly and by the way all the drivers
everything for this are available on
their website I don't know why it isn't
come to the drivers CD but all the
drivers are available on their website
and everything and I usually get samples
sometimes sooner so maybe just for some
reason mine just didn't come with it but
I know they will have it probably in the
box and you see it here's also the
gold-plated connector so I mean that's
it folks
you guys saw it here this is the new
cooler master CM storm Sentinel advanced
2 highly programmable high DPI mouse
I'll see you guys in frag land</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
