products less real quick here word from

clans today so do you feel like a Viking
if so get your game on we'll have a link
down below now first off on today's
products is the chair that I'm sitting
in now this is a very nice chair for the
people over at auto-fill it's a gaming
chair it's made of PU leather it's
completely adjustable you can pretty
much get completely vertical in the
chair it's also pretty doggone
comfortable the stitching is actually
very nice in this particular chair and
it comes in a bunch of different colors
the one that we're looking at today is
actually nice and red and black so if
you know that AMD red and black Ferrari
themed this might just be the chair that
you're looking for now it has lumbar
support it has a headrest support it has
a five star base with Racing wheels all
in all a pretty nicely made chair the
comfort level on it is very well you can
adjust the tilt you can adjust the
height you can adjust the armrests up
and down to whatever your comfort level
is so all in all there's a lot of nice
adjustments that you can do on this
chair but the best thing of all about
this particular gaming chair is it will
not break the
that's right this particular chair is
only $199 you know there's a lot of
gaming chairs out there that go from
like 607 or dollars all the way up to
thirteen to fourteen or dollars all for
a chair that you're gonna just sit your
button and play a lot of games in for
gaming this chair is pretty cool because
it does have the lumbar support at the
bottom of your back so if you're
uncomfortable that you can also remove
it very easily the headrest is nice as
well so if you're just sitting in the
chair relaxing watching movies or
watching whatever you'll be very
comfortable in this chair so a lot of
features it's nicely built the
stitching's really well for a chair
that's a hundred and ninety-nine bucks I
think you'll be hard-pressed to find a
better gaming chair at this price level
now this next particular product if
you're a youtuber you're a photographer
you're a person who could probably use a
product like this now this is a green
screen by the people at algata if you
guys aren't familiar with them they've
recently been bought up by Corsair and
this particular product thing that I
like about it is actually big enough to
film a video in and it's very portable
and best of all you don't have to worry
about setting it up and nailing it to a
wall or doing anything crazy like that
because it has its own base that's right
it has a completely portable base you
just set the base up you pull the green
screen up and then voila you're set up
and ready to go so if you guys actually
want to see this product check out our
holiday giveaway video where we actually
use this video and showed you guys the
Christmas thing that was in the back and
it looks really really nice so now the
size this green screen is basically 58
inches by 7 inches well the exact
dimensions in both metrics and inches on
the screen so you guys can check it out
but like I said it's big enough to film
videos in so like I said if you're a
photographer your YouTube guy your guy
who makes videos this is definitely a
product that you should check out I'm
very happy with it like I said the
portability about it is what I like best
the fact that you can just pull out a
base and set up a green screen no matter
where you're at is actually awesome
because let's just face it sometimes you
go somewhere to film and it just doesn't
look right and hey when you can use a
green screen just pop something back
there even though sometimes it may not
be the most you know best thing to do it
actually works a lot of times in a pinch
next up we have the BSS AR 133 and this
is an active direct box for a lot of
people out there probably going Elric
what the heck is this particular product
what are you showing us but for musician
this is a very very nice product I have
to say that doing recordings with this
we've noticed a big difference in the
line signal going in now what is this
particular product do well a direct
inbox is a box that you basically plug
your guitar or your microphone in and
what it does it actually levels the line
to a line signal mean that you're not
going to have too hot of a signal going
in and the best thing about this
particular product is it actually works
in three different ways
it works in zero DB which is for
standard guitars it has a minus 20 DB
pad this is for people out there we have
EMGs and hot pickups that are all you
know done with electronics which they
call active pickups and then last but
not least you have a setting for using
on speaker so if even if you want to
have loud speakers and make them to line
level you can use this product now most
of the DI box is out there usually only
do one thing
they're usually passive or they're
usually active and they're not an
all-around great product for using this
particular product the reason I like it
the best out of all the ones I saw out
there is it's very easy to use and plus
it can use the phantom power of your
interface to power the product so all
you do is hook up your mic cable into it
unable the phantom power and the box is
completely up and going so let me just
tell you just a little bit deeper about
this product so say you're a bass player
and you have a bass and you're trying to
just go directly into your into your
mixing board or whatever and the line
student can either be too hot or not
enough so when you're running into the
mixing board it doesn't quite sound
right so when you use this particular
product and you bring it down to a line
level it makes the signal so it all
comes out perfectly even you won't get
any weird punching this you won't get
anything - out of your signal all you'll
get is that pure direct signal they sell
these all around the world you can
probably get one online for around 169
but overall I have to say if you're a
musician out there and you're looking
for something just to make your guitar
or your bass sound just a little bit
better even your keyboard or whatever
this particular product is well worth
looking into on one side of the air 133
you'll see that there's a power on
button a lift and earth button now what
this does is if you're getting some kind
of noise you can actually use this
button and change the polarity to make
sure that the signal is completely
silent you also have your output and
then
a compartment you can actually use this
product with the battery on the other
side we see the zero DB pad the 20 DB
pad and the 40 DB pad like we talked
about earlier you see the input here for
a guitar you also see an input for an
XLR microphone and then last but not
least we see the link connection now
this is to run into your amplifier or to
run to another signal so you can
actually have two signals running out of
this particular product next up are you
a person out there who you already have
a smart home and you've got some
products from Amazon like the Alexa echo
dot in those type of products well this
product we're showing right here the
euphy is actually perfect for that
environment because it works wirelessly
and seamlessly into that environment
it's basically a Bluetooth speaker which
has pretty decent sound on it and what's
actually best of all about this product
is it comes to market at only $18 take a
look at the yuffie on the bottom you can
see there's a rubberized base then above
that you see all the little holes for
the sound to come out of up above that
you can see there are two connections a
microUSB for powering up the unit and
next to that a headphone jack on the top
of the UV there are some very simple
controls there's controls for the volume
and there's also a mute for the
microphone
all in all seriously the euphy is a very
very budget product like I said it comes
to market at about $18 it has decent
sound it's not gonna like fill an
auditorium or a giant room but if you
had it in a small room or definitely for
those people who travel around a lot and
like our hotel and just want something
small they can listen to without you
know bothering other people this might
be the perfect product for you next up
we have the Austin anca headphones I
always want to say awesome but awesome
is the name of these particular products
now the real big thing about these
particular headphones is that they're
active noise-cancelling headphones so
say you're a person who background noise
like really bothers you like you're on a
plane or something like that and you
can't stand the sound or there's some
kind of like you know low hum that
irritates you when you put these
particular headphones on it completely
eliminates that background noise and it
actually does it pretty well everybody
really loves the Bose ones that they're
out there these are very similar to
those particular products they do keep a
lot of the noise in the background out
like if you were sitting in your house
and the lawnmowers in your front yard
you would barely hear that guy
at all these noise-canceling headphones
are compatible with most bluetooth
devices like tablets and smartphones one
thing I do like about these particular
headphones is they are very comfortable
you can wear them for hours in your head
and your ears they won't be sore
afterwards the leather pads and the
adjustable headband make it so that you
can get the perfect fit on your head
every time the a nc8 headphones feature
a built-in 400 milliamp rechargeable
battery
now this battery needs to be charged for
about two hours but once you charge it
you can actually use them for about 30
hours before needing to charge them up
again all the controls for these
headphones are located on the outside of
the cup you have your volume and your
toggle control on one side and then you
have the noise cancellation on the other
now I know the big question is okay are
we talked about all this good features
but how do they sound these headphones
actually sound pretty decent they come
to market at 60 dollars they have a year
warranty and being able to charge the
headphone up for two hours and use it
for 30 hours without if you don't have
to recharge that's actually pretty nice
the comfort level is nice the headband
adjustment is nice all and all for the
price these are a solid set of
headphones and best of all you guys know
that noise cancellation headphones that
have active noise canceling are usually
very expensive so having that feature
along with all of the sound is very nice
that these particular headphones I would
say they really do not color the sound
very much there's no solid bass on them
there's no really SuperDuper you know
high treble II stuff it's really right
down the middle so if you really wanted
to compare these to anything I would say
they kind of compared to the Bose
products I don't know if they're exactly
as great as those ones but they're
definitely in that same market and
they're a much lower price so you can
get them into your hot hands and on your
head for a lot cheaper and while we're
talking about Bose let's check out the
Soundlink micro for those of you out
there who are very familiar with Bose
products you know that Bose has their
own way they sound you either like it or
you love it myself particularly I think
that this has very nice sound and a lot
of bass especially first speaker that's
this particular size plus it's an Amazon
choice product which means a lot of
people out there are actually buying
this it has almost 1300 customer reviews
which means that 1300 customers have
actually liked this product and said
hey this is great and right now it's on
sale for $79 it's also waterproof it has
an IP x7 rating it also has a soft
rugged exterior which resists dents
cracks and scratches it's also very
easily portable it has a tear resistant
strap to bring it wherever you go strap
it to your backpack cooler or handlebars
of your bike if you want to
it also features up to six hours of
playtime from the rechargeable battery
and a wireless bluetooth pairing with a
wireless range up to thirty feet one
thing that many users may find nice
about this product it has a built-in
speakerphone for taking calls out loud
and voice access to your phone Siri or
Google assistant now as far as the
controls go for the Soundlink micro you
have your volume control on the front or
what you call the side and on the top is
your power on and your Bluetooth
connectivity button like I said before
if you know the way Bose products sound
and you're a fan of them then you're
going to like this product just as well
because it has that same sound as all
their features product except for one
exception I feel that this product
actually has a lot more bass than many
of the other Bose products that I've
tried out there a lot of times I hear
their headphones and their speakers I
think hey wow these things sound really
you know nice and clarity but there's no
bass I've always felt that bose lacks
bass clarity but these particular
products these little micro speakers
they have a lot of nice bass currently
it's on sale for $79 a lot of people on
Amazon might like it so if you're
looking for a portable speaker that has
nice sound it also is waterproof easy to
carry around the name check this bad boy
out
now this next particular product it is
very very new to the market it is called
the bump out speaker they're going okay
a little cool why do they call it the
bump out well they called the bump out
because the speaker itself actually
bumps out yeah just like it says once
you get this speaker hooked up and
everything the speaker itself actually
comes out of its compartment making it
bump out hence the name the bump out
speaker and now the first thing I want
to do is turn on the power button and
then once the power is engaged you
simply bump out the speaker like it says
boom it bumps out and you guys can see
it's very very small very very nice you
have a USB connection that's located
right here this
charging it up and inside of the box you
actually get three coins and you get the
little charging cable now we'll get to
the coins in just a minute now as far as
the controls go on one side you see the
volume up and down as well as the power
button and also the pop out button on
the other side you see the button for
the coin what this does this ejects the
coin in and out now you're asking the
lrk you keep talking about a coin is
this something you buy or something no
in the box you get three coins and these
coins actually stick to various devices
so you can stick one to your phone stick
one to your tablet pretty much stick one
wherever you want in your bathroom and
that's what's really nice about it now
for such a small speak you'd be going
okay well can this thing actually
produce any decent sound and yeah the
sound coming out of something this small
is actually really cool so if you're
somebody who's just out on their bike or
whatever or you're going on a camping
trip and you don't want something it's
gonna be you know too big and weighing
you down the bump-out is gonna be
perfect for that type of adventure now
currently the bump-out is about $99 it's
very easy to use once you want to quit
using it you just put the speaker back
in turn off the power button place it in
your backpack or wherever you want to
have it and you're on your way next up
we have the scythe SCCT 1000 tuff CPU
cooler now this particular product is
very new to the market it's gonna be
selling at about fifty to eighty dollars
depending on where you buy it at but it
does have some really nice features that
are also features RGB which will work
within the aura environment so if your
personality of a motherboard and has
that aura technology on board the RGB
light this particular product will work
within that environment this particular
product they call the Cho tan and it's
part of their tough gaming alliance it
features a top-down flow design which
means that the air is not only blowing
down against your CPU it's also blowing
into the other components on your
motherboard
it also features their new HP ms
mounting kit which delivers sufficient
pressure and protection to your CPU and
guarantees a better cooling performance
all around one of the main problems with
many of the really tall air CPU coolers
out there is that they're so tall they
can't fit inside your case but this but
ticular product is only 122 millimeters
in height so to fit in a lot more cases
out there one of the other things about
this particular product is it features
an a symmetrical design which means that
you can use all different types of
memory even memory that has really high
heat sinks the way this particular CPU
cooler is designed is it's not going to
be interfering with your memory
whatsoever like I said though this
particular product is very new to the
market even though it has a really nice
heat pipe design the fan on top is very
decent it's not very loud we're gonna be
hooking up to motherboard and using it
in a full build very soon so you guys
can actually see the results of how it
works but from the products that we've
used in the past from this company
they've all worked very nicely however
trying to find one of these right now is
a little bit hard we'll have some links
down below to frozen CPU and some to end
to some other places but if you're
looking for a CPU cooler that won't
break the bank looks really cool has RGB
lighting then hey check this product out
for those of you folks who follow the
channel a few weeks back we did another
review on a cougar case that features
actually two different compartments for
putting two pcs in one case they also
sent along this very nice hell or 240
cooler now this is a complete AIO liquid
cooler it features two fans and a 240
millimeter radiator which means it will
fit in pretty much almost any system
that is out there and it also features
RGB lighting so if there's somebody out
there you want to light your whole case
up do the RGB thing and guess what you
can do that with the hell or 240 the
hell or 240 features performance first
incredible fans now these fan blades are
16 percent longer than those of a normal
RGB fan and they feature an ultra-thin
600 to 1800 rpms
one of the nice things about the heller
240 is that it comes with sleeved and
extended cabling this means that the
cabling is gonna last a long time
because of sleep so it's not going to be
subjected to the elements and another
nice thing is it comes with the remote
control that's rice you can control all
the RGB lighting to whatever you want it
to be Plus this particular product will
work on any of the motherboards that are
out there be it be the AMD latest
motherboard or the latest Intel mother
and best of all this product is under a
hundred and sixty dollars right now so
if you're looking to get yourself a nice
240 you know radiator a nice all-in-one
cooler the cooler itself is actually
very easy to connect as well it has a
nice copper base on it so when you go
and hook it up to your motherboard all
the connections and everything are
pretty simple to do so you don't have to
be a rocket science to hook it up to
your motherboard as well so if anybody's
out there I was looking for a really
nice cooler they like Cougar products
then hey check out the hell our 240 like
usual have a link down below where you
can check this product out get more
specs and all that stuff and maybe if
you like it put it inside your PC now
last but not least in today's top ten
are the NuForce be free eight wireless
headphones now the unique thing about
these particular headphones is they have
absolutely no wires whatsoever they
feature two ear cups that stick inside
your ears all the controls are
conveniently located on the outside of
the cups so whether you want to answer
the phone or adjust your music all those
type of controls are easily located like
I said right on the outside of the cups
of these particular devices now the
sound on the beef rates are also very
nice if you turn these suckers up to
full blast they'll probably be too loud
for you to listen to on your head
the bfree eight earbuds feature dynamic
drivers with NuForce proprietary sonic
coating are compatible with both AAC and
aptX
ll to provide high fidelity audio to any
device including your iPhones Androids
as well as your PC or your Mac now in
order to charge the headphones you
simply hook up the box and then you
place the headphones inside the box now
with a partial charge you can get four
hours of listening type but with a full
charge you can get 16 hours of
uninterrupted music with the b38 product
you don't have to worry about any more
spotty connections because they feature
NMMI technology which is near-field
magnetic induction to maintain a
reliable connection between the two
earpieces a carefully engineered antenna
placement enables a reliable Bluetooth
range of 33 feet or more the be 3/8 are
also very durable made and they're also
sweat proof with an IP x5 rating the
beef creates are also water and
weather-resistant ensuring protection
from rain and sweat ideal for a person
with an active lifestyle the NuForce
beef creates are actually about $90 but
honestly they are some of the best
wireless headphones I have ever had the
pleasure of sticking inside my ear they
have great clarity plenty of baits like
I said before if you turn these suckers
up to full blast it might be too loud
for your ears they're very easy to
charge like I said you get like 16 hours
of continuous you know listening to your
music or whatever just by a simple
charge in the box and what's kind of
unusual is you know a lot of times you
like plug the headphones themselves
directly into a plug but these
particular ones you just put inside that
little box and when they're ready to
charge up and go you just take them out
stick them in your ears turn them on and
you're good to go
the controls are all very easy to use to
adjust your music level and all that
kind of stuff so if you're looking for a
really nice nice set of really good
listening headphones it'll be great for
the gym and that kind of stuff the only
bad thing is they're not like completely
waterproof they are water and your
weather resistant but they don't really
have a great rating so if you drop them
into a pool or something like that
there's no real guarantee that they're
going to work so all right there you
have it my friends 10 products all from
a bunch of different companies that gave
me their products here at the end of the
year I didn't get to do all these videos
so we thought we'd just make this video
right here into the year to show all you
guys all of these great products so if
you're looking for a unique gift you
didn't really get what you liked for
Christmas and you might want something
different than hey there's probably a
product in there that'll suit your need

nice you know place in the marketplace

be down there below including the link
