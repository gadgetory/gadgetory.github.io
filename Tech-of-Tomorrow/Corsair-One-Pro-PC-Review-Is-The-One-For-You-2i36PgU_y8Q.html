back here once again on the channel now
I know that all my viewers out there
pretty much 1% the PC master-race
packages who want nothing but the best
to play their games on now seems to me
though these days the best the best you
know go two ways you can go home grown
where you build your own system you do
it or you can get these SuperDuper your
fancy-ass systems like the one that
we're going to be checking out today for
the people over at Corsair now this is
the Corsair one pro now is this the one
for you well you'll have to make your
decision at the end of the day but I
gotta say this right off the bat if
you're looking for a computer that
doesn't take up a lot of space has a lot
of power in it looks cool you can pretty
much do anything you want it to do this
series of computers just might be for
you now if you're one of those people
it's on a cash diet up be prepared
because it's things a bit pricey but
with that said let's check out the model
that we've got to review here from
people over Corsair so I want to thank
them Rob the bat for saying the system
to us this video is not sponsored in any
way we were just sent to system to check
it out so we're going to check it out
and I'll give you my honest opinion at
the end of the day but right up front to
be honest with you let's check out the
system now the first thing you guys are
going to notice is that this thing's
really really tripping it's design it's
not a tube it's not a box design it's
kind of a weird rectangle and it's very
very small I mean the dimensions of this
thing are pretty incredible the one size
in it 200 millimeters 576 millimeters by
380 millimeters and as far as the weight
factor goes and if you're asking hey man
can I carry this thing around and not
feel like I'm carrying a brick this
actually 7.2 kilograms because the
entire case is made of steel I mean
really guys have you ever seen a
computer that really just looked like
this I mean check it it's crazy right
let's dig in deeper now looking at the
front you guys are going to notice right
off the bat that this PC is B already
you got an HDMI port right in the front
along with the USB port so you can be up
and going without to mess with anything
in the back took up your VR glasses now
that in itself if your V
you're going to say hey cool and
above those obviously you guys can see
the power button and the entire unit
lights up and looks really cool almost
Tron like if I want to be honest I was
one of they were cupping our old front
system because it looks a lot like our
old Tron system with that lighting it's
also another thing that's pretty cool
or would you rather play the badass
drinking game another nice thing about
the one pro is that you can completely
disassemble the system everything comes
apart so you can see it internally when
you guys look internally at this you're
going to like kind of go wow that's
really unusual because the video cards
facing straight up and cables are used
to link that so you can put all the or
you know all your inputs and outputs
into the back of the thing so I mean
that's kind of nifty in itself I haven't
actually seen any other design that uses
this exact type of spec and that's
probably a good thing if you want to be
in the unique category one thing you
guys really need to take note of is this
thing only has a 400 what 80 plus gold
power supply that's right and that power
supply is very very small but yet this
systems still able to power a GeForce
GTX 1080 and best of all the card comes
liquid cooled the CPU is the same way
it's liquid cooled keeping the Intel
Core i7 7700 running cool and quiet
throughout your usage and for those of
you out there and overclocking it is the
K model and the motherboard inside the
one pro is a Z 270 Mini ITX motherboard
now whoever actually makes this
motherboard I'm not quite sure but it is
quite likely that it's made by Asus and
as far as the memory sticks go there are
two eight gigabyte sticks of twenty-four
hundred megahertz ddr4 and this memory
is very easy to access you just go right
to the side port and it's actually one
of the things you can upgrade in this
system and as far as storage goes
there's an ultra-fast 960 gigabyte SSD
to store all your games on the system
comes pre-installed with Windows 10 Home
Edition and as far as your networking
goes take a look at the back of the unit
you guys can clearly see that this thing
is totally set up for Wi-Fi right out of
the box there's also a standard Gigabit
Ethernet port as well and as far as the
rest of the connections go you get a
single USB 3.1 type C port three USB 3.1
ports two USB 2.0 ports ps2 port
single HDMI 2.0 port to DisplayPort and
obviously your audio which comes through
a spit us so I have to admit to you if I
was just going to buy a PC for design
and looks alone I got to tell you though
man the one pro is one seriously badass
kick ass killed whatever you want to
call it system as far as aesthetics
going everything it's cool you guys can
see that you can easily take the entire
thing apart now one of the cabinets I
got to mention though is that with the
power supply in this you won't be able
to buy and stick in later down the road
a 1080i that's one thing so just take
that and Hart they do have a model
that's a little bit higher than this
level link to that down below where it
actually comes with that it's a few
hundred dollars more and honestly in my
opinion if you're going to go for this
why not just spend that few hundred
dollars more and get one actually has a
500 watt power spot I can take a t√≠
because then you're pretty much getting
the absolute absolute best out of
something at such a small size but
that's the system now let's jump in and
let's check out the benchmarks and let's
see how the system does in gaming let's
rock
and
all right folks will someone want to
show their face in the video and say
hello and that's mr. buddy the dog but
that's not why we're here we're here for
the one pro so you guys see all the
scoring and everything the system
doesn't run too hot it's entirely
liquid-cooled only thing about it is
some of the upgradability about is going
to be you know modest there's a nice way
to put it without being seen it's modest
you're not going to be able to do too
many crazy upgrades I don't know you
know how many other power supplies
you're going to be able to find that
will actually fitness if you want to
keep going on to the future because the
case you know is kind of unique in its
size in the way that it is remember you
can upgrade obviously CPU you'll be
absolutely fine there like I said before
I think that the one pro is a really
nice system but the one above it that we
have to get our hands on that has the
1080i even though it's a few hundred
dollars more I think that me personally
I'd rather recommend that system to you
and it's not really about the money it's
just a matter of you know your upgrade
path I mean @na is cool but at this
point you know it's the cards that's
like almost 2 years old so why not get
something with it has a TI in it because
you know right now the ti is there until
Nvidia comes out with something else
well it's there plus I mean if Vega does
come out and for some reason AMD Vega
becomes the most you know kick-ass card
in the universe I doubt it but we'll see
but if it does not do that you could
obviously change out the TI since the
power requirements should be low enough
where you know you could actually put in
the new Vega car when it comes up from
AMD but me personally if I was going to
go out and buy this out of pocket right
now I would rather just save a couple
hundred dollars and buy the bigger
system that's just me personally one
thing I think that I wasn't really too
happy but I just thought it should have
them there may not mean jack to
many people out there but I like having
external ports for a little mini SD
cards not stuff I mean obviously you
guys know we film videos or cameras all
the place phones doing this so to
me having that stuff meal to access and
putting it it's cool you know I like
having that it's not the end of the deal
it's not a deal breaker but just for me
personally I wish that had actually had
it on there so systems coming to market
it's about 2200 bucks a little bit
pricey like I said in the beginning of
the video but you want the absolute best
and you want something that's not only
cool it's aesthetically pleasing and
kind of an art piece in itself then you
start paying bigger money and that's
kind of what this system is now on their
personal website
all these things are pretty much
completely sold out like they're gone so
that just tells you they're obviously
not shitty systems because why would
everybody just buy the out of them
and they weren't good and I watched you
know some of the reviews out there and
everybody seems to be happy with them I
don't really see any complaints
whatsoever but we complain about I mean
this thing's water-cooled and only 400
watt power supply Porter what powering
this entire system it's just
amazing so I got to say you know hats
off to those guys for that it's pretty
cool at the other day it's a matter of
choice but if you've got the money you
want something unique and you want
something probably not the guy down the
streets going to have this might just be
the one for you I'm electing and
watching technical monitors by our dog
our mascot he's getting old on me poor
guy like me we're all getting old let's
G behind the camera like usual links to
this down below we'll have some Amazon
links so you can actually purchase what
is in stock right at the moment so if
you're interested in that type of thing
and you've got the cash to buy bad that
stuff now's your chance
peace out my tech brothers and sisters
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
