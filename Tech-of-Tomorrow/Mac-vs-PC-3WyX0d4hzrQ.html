affair is here once again on the YouTube
channel here for tech of tomorrow now
it's been a couple of days into released
a video but we're back today talked to
you guys about the everything battle
between the Mac and PC crowd always a
big argument here is one of the most
heated things that I ever get on my
channel lots of hate comes from both
crowds PC guys tell me I post Mac stuff
they're not coming back Mac guys are
like show me BC stuff and all your
channel either kind of crazy so we're
going to start today saying why would
you want to buy a PC or a Mac will be
the reason for your purchase to buying
one of these or buying one of these this
is a PC laptop this is a Mac backed up
all the records today though will be
regarding though not just laptops but
desktops as well so let's just start off
with price even entry-level Mac is about
$1000 so that means you need any kind of
laptop or anything you want to get is
going to be a thousand dollars for the
Mac world now pcs you can get into a PC
between five and six hundred dollars
that will do most of the same things now
people are going to say well why would I
want to buy a PC or a Mac or a Mac over
a PC well there are a few reasons a for
gamers if you have a desktop machine in
your gamer you're going to want a PC yes
you can play games on a Mac computer no
problem through boot camp you can do
that but the Mac's not really geared for
gaming PC has much more options in more
games definitely across the board that
are going to play on a PC so for gaming
alone you're going to want to say hey I
want a B C that's it
say you're somebody who just like checks
their email you're a college student
you're out there you're at college
you're going to get the money from your
parents Mac or PC well really a PC will
do anything that your Mac will do if
you're just doing just your homework
checking your email and all that kind of
stuff I know that's all trendy right now
and everybody who wants to own a Mac you
know because the trendy thing to do sure
if you've got money sitting around and
you just want to
you know tell yourself to back and say
hey I got something cool math is what
you want to buy you can get into a
laptop like I said at $1,000 but you can
also get that said PC that will do the
same things probably in about four
hundred fifty to five hundred dollar
range not the comparable thing regarding
media though this is where things really
change if your person who uses programs
like Final Cut Photoshop logic in these
type of things that are media geared
then you're going to want to be thinking
not strictly with using a Mac now PC
uses mica monitor and throw their hated
comments you can throw all the hate
comments out there that you want all day
long but if you walk into any
professional level recording studio or
video editing studio you're going to
find sitting by the desk in Mac that's
just how it is I'm sorry I didn't you
didn't make the noise way this is just
how it is now same token said more
people's house the United States if you
walk into probably 90% of the people in
United States will probably have a PC in
their home they're cheaper and if you
walk into a business
as soon as you walk into a business you
see all those computers across the floor
that are all going to be ap C a PC is a
very general usage low-cost thing that
gamers excel on it's good for
overclocking if you're the type of guy
who likes to tinker with stuff tear
stuff apart and just basically you wanna
be hands-on then a PC is the route you
want to go now if you want something
that you never want to have mess with
it's just like almost like completely
dummy proof then yeah a Mac may be the
better choice for you
Mac's are simpler pcs have a lot more
options and flexibility though why do
you think Mac's cost more than a very
limited number of machines the people of
Macintosh take their time to give their
machine to be as close to perfect as
they can get it and they're going to
charge you the pretty price tag for that
but not everybody really needs a Mac
most users will get by will be able to
just buy themselves a PC and will do all
the things that they need to do but if
you're running something that has to do
with anything that's really media vetted
then you're going to want to be going
towards a Mac so really for me my
verdict about Mac and PC
is if a if you don't have a high budget
and you're not really doing anything
with your PC but checking your mail
going online those type of things I
would say that your best bet is to jump
into a PC it's going to be cheaper it's
going to be efficient and it's going to
do all the things that you want to do
now a lot of people talk about viruses
PCs get viruses max don't get viruses
that's not true
there's just not as many viruses written
for a Mac that's all there is to it now
people keep buying max max keep getting
more popular you think there's not going
to be viruses for max think again the
more popular that Mac becomes the more
viruses that are going to be written for
the Mac so that being said they make
virus control for both of them basically
the joke excuse me basically the golden
rule there is don't open something from
anybody in the internet or go to a
website that you don't know what it is
if it's something wacky don't go to it
you're going to a business and stuff
that's usually going to be a website
it's going to be secure and safe for you
so it should really have to be a concern
of yours so that said if you're also up
student though and you're in school and
you're doing media stuff and you're
using Photoshop and a lot of stuff like
that you might want to save up a little
bit more money and buy yourself a Mac
laptop because because for you this
might be better also I've heard that a
lot of guys who do HTML really prefer
just using the Mac now I know a lot of
PC guys use their PC to be webmasters
but a lot of code guys just tell me I
like using my Mac better so there are
some of the things price options usage I
feel it in PC for the general gentleman
everyday usage PCs are perfect if you're
a person though who is in any kind of
feel that has to do with media and that
kind of stuff and you're putting on
making money off that you want to have
yourself a Mac type computer I hope this
Clues learnt for a lot of people I don't
want to see any hate on here any reason
that you have invalidate that you want
to put on here that are solids and
Stachel I'm going to listen to saying
the same thing of going old Mac's Costas
and
that in the other we already went this
in this videos your comments just
repeating what we've already talked
about so wish you guys the best of luck
hope this cleared things up and I know
the valve between Mac and PC is going on
but I do got to tell you that guys
something
if you think that pcs aren't going to
totally catch up with what all the stuff
you guys have think again because all of
your Mac computers are made by Intel and
it's also home budget by Microsoft
another PC company so you might want to
think about that Mac your own by PC
world we don't have chunky you you're
just like our little high-end then
you're like a sports car
anyways hope to see you guys back here
in contacting tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
