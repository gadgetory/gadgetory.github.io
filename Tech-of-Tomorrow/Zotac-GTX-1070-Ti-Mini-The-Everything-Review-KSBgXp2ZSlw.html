guys back here on the channel exciting
stuff going on now you guys all know
that the 1070 TI cards they're a really
nice card heavily overclockable great
for gaming now previously we brought you
guys the unboxing of the zotac edition
now this is their mini card ins otech
claims it'll fit at 99% of the systems
out there deal with size so that's
pretty cool so if you want to see the
unboxing we'll have a link down below
but for those of you who have never seen
the card before I will go over some of
the specs so right off the bat you guys
can see the card has a two fan design on
the front very simple on the back we
have a very nice backplate knock on that
bad boy I love back plates you know so
some of the basic features though this
card has 2432 cuda cores inside of it it
features eight gigabytes of gddr5 memory
running at 8 gigahertz this card has a
base clock speed of 1607 and a boost
clock speed of 1600 and 83 so all in all
it's a really nice card meant for gaming
some of the other features of this card
are just the basic stuff that NVIDIA has
you guys all know that Invidia is their
g-sync and for the fans out that I don't
know bore you guys to that I know that
you guys know all the stuff on the side
of team green now another cool thing
about this card it only requires a
single 8 pin power connector this card
can also be SL ID there are two sli
fingers right here on the top of the
card right here so if you're looking to
do in that cell light system this will
do it without problems at all so that's
pretty much the card for those who
wanted to see the rear i/o here it is
it's the same pretty much i/o that every
card has out there now only a few cards
are very different they're all pretty
much standard now so real quick let's
check out our test system and then let's
check out all the scoring we do 10.1%
lows and 1080 we have overclocking
everything that you guys have asked for
including actual filming of the in-game
testing along with a feud benchmarks but
pretty much everything that you guys
have asked for in a card we're gonna
have a heat when overclocked mode and in
standard mode and pretty much everything
you've been looking for so let's check
out our test system and then let's check
out all the different scores for those
of you who want to see the whole build
on our test system we'll have a link
down below to that
as well now for the motherboard we're
using the EVGA z 370 FTW for the cpu
we're using an Intel i7 8700 K we're
also using 16 gigabytes of Patriot VIPRE
elite memory set at 3200 megahertz
our boot drive is the corsair 480
gigabyte Neutron and for the hard drive
we're using a 2 terabyte Seagate Fire
CUDA and powering up this system is the
EVGA supernova at 750 watts we're also
using the latest edition of Windows 10
with the anniversary edition and all the
latest drivers available at the time of
testing the card size is in at 8.3
inches by 4 point 9 inches by 1.4 inches
which is basically just saying it's a 2
slot design another thing to take note
this card only requires a 180 watts of
power to power the card now real quick
before we get into all the testing all
that stuff you folks asked in the past
that we actually film the screen footage
of the testing so for all of the 4k
footage we did that we did 10 games and
the 1080p scores will be embedded in
that film so you can see them as well
then after that we're going to jump into
the overclocking scores and then the
1.1% lows and what the 1.1% lows are
they're pretty much showing where the
card drops out and is not giving you its
full performance so let's jump in let's
check it out
now you guys know that a 1080i card it
runs games most games anyways at 4k at
about sixty frames per second you can
see that this 1070 TI card is really
just below that not much of a difference
most of the games are running right at
that level some games run it a little
bit less but most games are still
hitting that mark and overall you guys
can see even with the standard clocks
out of the box that this car performs
very very well okay so those are the
standard scores you can see this card
does very well like I said we were
showing that now next up is the
overclocking we used MSI's afterburner
obviously these guys have their own
firestorm we're just more used to using
the afterburner software I think that
most of the gamers out there actually
prefer that sorry if I stepped on any
toes there but we just all prefer it now
like we said the base clock speed in
this car was a certain thing we were
seeing about 1911 as the average clock
that we were seeing in the boost but
with our overclocking results we were
able to boost this all the way up to 20
88 that's right 2000 88 megahertz above
1911 so that's a pretty damn incredible
overclock now as far as the memory
overclocking goes we were also very
successful
4011 is the standard memory clock but we
were able to add four hundred and
seventy-five megahertz for a memory
clock speed of four thousand four
hundred eighty-two which is just really
nice so as far as the overclocking goes
honestly this car is pretty much it
seems like right out of the box built
for overclocking because these are some
really nice scores another thing is that
the card under normal load was getting
about 67 degrees Celsius as far as the
heat goes and about 71 when overclocked
but this is completely with the fan on
auto mode if we turn the fans on to full
blast those numbers drop significant
down to about 59 that's right 59 from 71
just with the fans and full blast it's
just it's just so loud I was like okay
turn the fans downs but if you're
who wears headphones this isn't going to
matter to you one bit you can overclock
the crap out of this card and be in your
headphones own and just totally ignore
it but now let's check out the
difference in scoring between the
standard clock and overclocked scores
and I think that you're going to be
pretty amazed so let's jump in
now obviously not every game takes two
overclocking and you can see that from
the scores but the minimum that we were
seeing was four to ten frames per second
and on some games even 20 frames per
second could be seen you know and that's
an incredible overclock farcry is one of
these games it actually gained 20 frames
per second just from being overclocked
so that's a really good thing now as
well as these overclocked scores you
guys can see that we've also included
the 1.1% lows and honestly this card
does very well it was pretty much
consistent overclocked as a standard
card and that's really good a lot of
cards you see in the market drop out a
lot giving you guys poor performance in
a lot of areas but this card pretty much
across the board stayed solid alright
folks so here's my conclusion honestly I
want you guys to just take this with
kind of a grain of salt right now video
card prices are just a ripoff across the
board I was kind of even hesitant to
bring a video card you know review to
the table cuz I was like oh man people
are gonna just be pissed off because the
cheapest that we could find this card
was like 800 dollars and this card's
just not an $800 card me let's just face
it at natt I even if had a rocket engine
attached and was made with plated gold
wouldn't really be worth $800 so all the
cards out there are overpriced now is
that a direct result of anything to do
with ZOTAC scarred absolutely not at the
end of the day this card kicks ass
that's all there is to it
I really can't find anything to go oh my
god I want to just punch this so people
would be like oh there's something to
say but honestly the card is well made
it has an excellent backplate all the
cooling apparatus that you guys have
seen the card does an excellent job of
keeping this card cool obviously if you
turn the fans on the full blast it's
going to be loud and lawnmowers let's
just face it I mean if some obviously
there's going to be some sound involved
now maybe in the future they can get
some really expensive fans like you know
some of those Corsair fans they
on the l-series that are SuperDuper
quiet and it would change things but for
now when you turn up full blast it's a
little bit loud the card overclocks
absolutely great you guys saw those
numbers in the 1.1% lows of card hounds
itself very well so at the end of the
day beyond all the price increasing and
all that crap that's going on this is a
definitely an editor's choice card and
worth having if you could get one if
prices were normal on the market right
now I could wholeheartedly say go out
and buy this card and you won't be
disappointed with it and eight hundred
bucks I'm looking at an onliner shaking
my head no frakkin way but like I said
before man that's not the fault of ZOTAC
so Tech has made a good product the
market supply and demand and all that
crap not their responsibility we know
who's responsible for that
miners I mamas anything you know like
more than that but honestly it's not
only their fault
somewhere along the line somehow though
they need to start making more cards so
that these cards get back to a standard
price level because the way things are
right now cards are just overpriced but
at the end of the day if they were
normal priced I would definitely advise
buying a card recommend this card and
even buy it for myself so I'm Network
you guys been watching Tekken tomorrow
if for some reason you have to have a
video card right now we'll have a link
down below where you guys can check some
out I believe this card goes all the way
up to like 1,100 freaking dollars $1,100
for 1070</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
