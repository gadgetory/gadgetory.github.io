Jerry it's cuz it is Jerry but he came
by and he was like saying hey there's
this new poll that came out like
basically showed you know wages of
everybody and like basically they're the
agents they were on the top bracket they
were making 60,000 then there was this
wide gap pool that no as the white
people you know remember all that was a
Latin people then you know Bowl that was
like you know the African American
people you know I'm saying and so like I
thought I bet for the second I was like
wow I but you know check it out though
if we flip it and just do the Buddhist
chart you can see African American
people have now tuck the top of the
chart and voila there's a large gap
between everybody else in the Asians
once again cuz I point that out that's
funnier than no Rachel intense
there are men out there so anybody
leaving racial comments is it just funny
 Jerry was saying hey on this chart
you know we're the richest so we just
flip the char the penis chart so hey
there you go it's pretty damn funny
let's jump in let's do the unboxing of
this new zbox from the people in zotac
anyways today we're gonna do an unboxing
is something that I think is actually a
really cool product a lot of people look
for computers these days to put in weird
places so that's it if you're looking
for computer to put in your kitchen your
bathroom or anywhere where really space
matters you'd like to have something
small today we're going to take a look
at something from zotac this is pretty
cool this is their zbox nano now what is
the cbox nano zbox nano is an all-in-one
computer it contains the AMD dual core
1.6 gigahertz processor on there this is
part of their APU line it's the smallest
one they have it also has 6310 graphics
on it and supports full 1080p graphics
now is it a gaming platform no it's not
really a gaming platform but it will do
all your things like surf the internet
check your email you know all the basic
like things that you could use in your
household beyond gaming which are
actually many lots of uses for one of
these things all right so like every
unboxing want to start out we're going
to say the outside of the box is the
front you can see it's the zotac zbox
plus nano your palm sized mini pc am
division series features you can see 2
gigabytes of memory 320 gigabyte hard
drive will actually open the thing up
later and let you check it out to go
ahead and flip it around real quick just
to show you guys the back of the box you
guys there's all kinds of connections
everything you want displayport hdmi
everything with your old-school DDI
which probably raise your move past that
anyway the big mini size that's a really
good thing let's flip it around more
time right here here we're going to show
you what comes inside the box so this is
basically the zotac zbox nano this is
the ad 10 plus and these are all the
specifications the CPU is the AMD ii 350
this is there a pu platforming
all-in-one technology it has a dual core
1.6 processor the chipset is the AMD m1
and we can see the graphics are the HD
6310 here talked about the expansion
right here not a lot of expansion but
basically you can change the memory and
you can change the hard drive out that's
pretty flexible have gigabyte lan
including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
connectivity all good comes the remotes
you can click the thing from wherever
you're at and do it comes the card
reader so if you have your camera all
that type of stuff you just
your carburetor plug it in there and get
all your stuff off there and work on it
audio is actually on board eight channel
so you have digital audio on board this
will be provided to the hdmi link as
well as your monitor so all-in-one
connectivity there for that which also
goes to the display port here at the
bottom it tells you all the connectivity
hdmi displayport my headphones two USBs
two USB 3.0 to a USB 2.0 rj45 and eSATA
are all there so I'm going to pop the
cap right here go ahead and open this up
right here take the little bit up throw
the box off to the side seams just pops
open right at the back we can see
there's the zotac remote control see the
Windows Media button there and all that
so this will operate a ring on it pretty
cool I like having a remote let's see
here I'm going to go into the unit off
to the side real quick and go ahead and
see the rest of stuff that comes in here
to basically the bundles page so let's
go ahead and look at all the stuff that
actually going to be the bundle and
that's not it that's just box but what
do we got here okay here we've got a
mounting plate yep I'm trouble getting I
are stuck to the cardboard some town
there we go all right this is your basal
wall plate so if you want to mount this
on to a wall or anything else you just
put this on their thing sticks onto it
if you have some other base a wall mount
it'll do that as well here's all the
power cable stuff little power brick
your plugin that goes into wall all that
kind of stuff including a little thing
here this will be for your Wi-Fi so this
will help you get stronger Wi-Fi
connectivity I'm not going to bunt all
these cables set of all out there it's
too much stuff to do shut that off the
side here goes the zbox nano your palm
size mini PC this is your manual and all
that stuff here's little zbox nano this
is the CD for putting all the drivers in
and all that good stuff and then we get
to the heart of the matter the first
time that I saw this thing I took it out
I said wow that thing's barely bigger
than an apple TV and let's check this
thing out we'll start up here at the top
it's got my fingerprints all over it I
apologize that I've been
on this thing quite a bit you can check
that looks pretty cool here's the front
so here we see the front and we see
here's the on button right here we have
the infrared remote control you can see
everything your card reader and both
your headphones and your microphone
connections all here in the front very
easy to get to very small thin unit on
the back you can see there's all the
latest connectors esata you got your
Wi-Fi connectivity your land both
bluetooth USB and HDMI all are here on
the back so lots of the connections that
a little thing that's basically the size
of my palm actually it's even smaller
than my bomb look here's my palm there's
unit can almost hide it now to work on
the unit there's for little screws here
so I'm going to go ahead and start
removing these folks you guys can see
what they are so it says right here to
pull so basically I'm going to pull this
and this opens a tab make it a little
thing out of here it's actually really
easy if you do it right the first time
so here you guys can see hard drive 320
gigabyte inside you can see we use s10
membrane sodimm laptop memory stuff so
it's only upgradable via the one slot so
you could probably get a 4 gigabyte one
in there in fact I'm a call over to King
soon and say hey brother give me some
memory so easy to take apart easy to
upgrade the size of your palm I haven't
actually got a price on this thing yet I
will try to get it and put it in the
bottom of the video hey check it out
we'll leave you guys at the end of the
video just showing you guys a bunch of
pics or the product how cool looks
