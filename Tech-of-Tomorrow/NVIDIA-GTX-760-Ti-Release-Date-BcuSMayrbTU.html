their tech served up hot welcome to tech
of tomorrow I'm Eric Faris your host we
bring you all the tech all the time now
my inbox has been filling up with a lot
of questions lately and the question is
is hey man where is the 760 Ti is it
coming will it be released will I see it
is it a dark cloud in space well check
it out folks
gotta let you know right now and that's
all speculation now we all know that
last week the GTX 760 hit the market now
that card replaces the gtx 660ti that
was previously released from Nvidia last
year and according to the roadmap that
we're seeing right now there are no
plans at all right now for a 760 Ti
version at all so for those people out
there her wondering check it out I don't
think it's coming unless all of a sudden
they changed their plans now in the last
week though we've had a lot of coverage
on the brand-new gtx 760 though we've
had cards from asus cards from EVGA
cards from gigabyte and even the
reference card full blown review now a
few folks happen to miss any of that
type of stuff check out the link down in
the description button down below that
like button and you guys will get all
this information where you guys can
check out all those reviews all the pics
and all the really cool stuff that has
to do with the new 760 so that's it
folks hate to pop anybody's bubble out
there who's really looking forward to it
but right now it looks like there will
be no 760 Ti it's not on the roadmap and
alissa Nvidia changes their plans I
don't think we're gonna be seeing that
card anytime soon
I'm Elric thanks for watching techy
tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
