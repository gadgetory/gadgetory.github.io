for the mobile platform which means
guess what it'll work on your phone and
with awesome graphics you can build your
team of champions and take down your
enemies and the choice of the champions
that you can choose is really cool
there's a lot of detail in these
characters with hundreds of champions
that choose from forming your ultimate
team shouldn't be a problem you can
equip your champion with artifacts and
rank them up to unlock special skills
and attacks this way you can defeat your
enemies in a multitude of ways you can
battle bosses and AI opponents or take
down real players in the PvP arena it's
all up to you how you want to play and I
have to say the graphics look absolutely
great for a game that you play on your
phone this game is actually pretty cool
and it's absolutely free to play so if
you want to get your game on check out
the links down below where right now you
can actually get 50,000 in free silver
yeah and you also get a free epic
champion all courtesy of the dev team so
thank you dev team see you there
okay so you fans out there who love AMD
and you love them being the underdog and
you've been following them forever I've
been saying hey AMD they're one they're
going to rule the world we'll check it
out since the announcement of stadia and
if you guys don't know what state he is
it's a brand new platform that's coming
out it's where you can play games on any
device doesn't take it really any
hardware whatsoever because all the
hardware is on AMD servers over on
Google side you hear this over on Google
side AMD servers don't hear about any
nvidia cards don't hear about any intel
it's all AMD so let's just start right
there okay AMD forever has been the
underdog to both Nvidia and Intel for
years it's been the back and forth
battle we've got the guys with the high
prizes with the faster crap and then
we've got AMD with the lower prices with
a little bit slower stuff but
I think that AMD has just done probably
the most game-changing doggone thing
that they have ever done in their entire
business since they've been doing it
partnering up with Google to do this
entire new gaming platform is simply
incredible so check this out
AMD doesn't have to worry about if you
buy their CPU or their GPU anymore they
really don't because with stadia your
Hardware really doesn't matter you're
gonna have low end hardware and you know
as long as you got a multi GPU and over
the guard so it's a phone or a tablet or
anything else AMD is going to be
powering this stuff on their servers so
all these high price video cards all of
these high priced computer systems all
of this stuff that's out on the market
could very possibly become very
irrelevant and it could be very relevant
very fast depending on how things go
because if you can play all of your
games from a cloud you can play them at
4k at 60 frames per second and we're
talking about with surround sound
HDR all this good crap why are you going
to want to go out and buy an expensive
intel cpu an expensive nvidia video card
and expensive anything you're just not
going to need it and console gaming
because of their controller is going to
get really squeezed so if you love
having a controller and love playing
games of the controller and dungeon
throwing all that well guess what you're
gonna be in like Flynn this decision of
AMD to jump on board and partner with
these guys
I honestly think is going to be the
final move and I think that AMD has
finally checkmated their motherfucking
opponents straight up because Google is
pretty much the biggest company on the
internet period they own the Internet
they own pretty much all online
marketing they own it all it's a Google
world so unless these other companies
can get inside of there and get some of
this business
I see them getting squeezed out of the
market in the next year now are people
still gonna want to buy high-end pcs and
stuff like that I mean I think for other
things for content creation for doing
music and stuff like that people might
be still buying high-end computers but
the fact is though is that if you're
able to take your gaming play it on any
device that there is as long as it can
run you know Google Chrome and AMD
has all the hardware backing this up
let's just face it these things grow
they're gonna have to get more servers
more servers more servers you hear me
right like this is going to keep growing
exponentially and as it keeps growing
AMD's already in bed with these folks so
that means they're gonna get all of that
money and at the PC market and the
console market just hits the skids
guess what AMD will be in the best
position they have ever been
ever no longer will AMD be playing
backseat really to anybody
it just won't matter it won't matter if
NVIDIA has a faster video card it may
matter to a couple people out there but
for most people who just want to play
games and have fun they're not gonna
want to spend that money let's just face
it and we all know when you have to
spend a lot of money to get your gaming
system it honestly it does take a little
bit of fun out of a gaming experience
now building a custom gaming PC from the
ground up making it look all cool and
all this kind of stuff that's really
cool stuff and that will probably always
remain there but AMD now has positioned
themselves with a company that is going
to lead I really don't see how this new
gaming platform could fail it just has
too much cool stuff on it it's going to
be really easy
Nvidia with their GeForce now is
definitely going to be feeling the
squeeze you have to have their account
you got to have this you got to have
that all you're going to have to have
with this is just the ability to have
your Google Chrome account let's just
face that a lot of us have you know a
gmail account and all this other stuff I
do a lot of you probably do as well it's
a simple thing to do it's free so I
think it's really going to come in
and just blow the market completely away
I think that AMD has finally once and
for all
checkmated their opponents what do you
guys think I want to hear your guys
opinions down below I know there are a
lot of people out there who follow AMD
and for you folks this is absolutely
great news it's really good news for AMD
it's going to be the first time ever
that they position themselves to the
market that's pretty much unchallenged
i'm norick you guys been watching Tech
tomorrow if you like what you see hey
police of the channel I'd love to see
you guys back here again make sure you
have notifications on sometimes I'll
even tell you that I have a new video
that comes out we'll have some more
links down below if you want to check
out that palm-sized computer that we put
it up against the next box we'll have a
link down there and we'll have more
information about stadia down below
