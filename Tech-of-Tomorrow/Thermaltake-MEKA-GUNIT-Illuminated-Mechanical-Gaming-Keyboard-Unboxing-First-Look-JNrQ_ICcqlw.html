back to tech of tomorrow where we've got
all the tech all the time
today's cool Tech is something from the
people at thermaltake this is their
completely mechanical keyboard it's the
mecca g-unit illuminated version that's
right all the keys on this are
completely illuminated so you can see
them this thing has cherry black MX keys
it features a thousand Hertz polling
rate also features 60 programmable macro
keys and their new ISS system what does
the is system was to do with all the
stuff inside of it keeping all the
programs running and everything now
a lot of people don't know this but to
actually get all the macro keys and
everything into a keyboard is very
expensive I just had a meeting at one
state talking to a guy about making a
change in a keyboard he was like oh it's
not a simple thing like that you're
talking about five hundred thousand
dollars to make a change so very
expensive and a lot of technology goes
into making these things I don't even
know these people make their money back
but with that said let's check out this
thing and see how cool it looks
especially compared to the previous
alright folks so let's start out with
the Box like usual over here we can see
the TT eSports label by thermal take a
nice picture of the keyboard they're
lovely logo the mecca g-unit illuminated
like I said before 1000
pulling rate 60 programmable macro keys
gaming LED backlit keyboard pens all the
lights and the ISS instant shift system
will flip around the back not much to
the back it just explains little things
right here so we'll start off right here
you have normal mode game mode its
switchable you also have instant profile
switches so you can create profiles and
then hit them on the fly and change them
around you also have available of USB
ports and audio jacks right on the top
of the keyboard you also have seven
media hotkeys and all the other keys are
actually a little bit different color
now it's really weird though is that a
lot of times in some of these things the
macro keys themselves the ones that are
designated won't program different but
all the other ones will we'll have to
see that as we get
there anyway it's got a touchable palm
rest of the 20 macro keys to fix and
unfixed to individual white illuminated
sections for four levels and pause break
lighting design which probably means
we're going to be able to sense of
lighting so for now let's get into it
and let's check it out
now usually I like to keyboards the
Coolermaster trigger and the mecca
g-unit those are actually my two
favorite keyboards now my son disagrees
he's a razor kid but for me these are it
so here we go let's pop open the top
right here
so moving on the inside the box we can
see right here this is probably going to
be all of the drivers and everything now
the keyboard will probably work when we
plug it in but all the lights everything
might require drivers so here's this
right here we'll pop this open try to
wreck it too much but obviously I guess
there's no way to open it without
getting it since it's stuck so there we
go
to pull all this stuff out of here we've
got the warranty policy drivers
installation CD quick manual all kinds
of stuff the way get to the heart of the
matter let's get down in here now
usually these things have completely
separated cables and everything let's
see if this one is the same we have a
bag right here it usually as the cable
you can see these are gold-plated on
each end I prefer these like this it
actually makes it really easy to hook up
and use your keyboard so let's set that
off to the side here take the palm rest
and by the way guys this is just the
unboxing I will be doing a full review
on this you guys know how I'll do it all
the video with a link to the full
written review but today we're just
doing the unboxing and showing you guys
what comes in it so there's the palm
rest
and then to the heart of the matter the
beasts this thing I have this little
plastic bag here alright folks so now
let me just get this out of the way make
sure there's nothing else in the box
there's not but man the box still weighs
a ton oh wait there is more
sorry there is a keyboard case so if you
want to take your keyboard on the road
or travel you can use this
let me always know by the way for you
folks bear with me one second all right
chairman can you bang in here and get a
little crazy here I'm gonna set this
thing up folks for you and go over it so
I guess we'll go over the back side
first so here's the back of the keyboard
you can see you have two little toddlers
here for raising your keyboard up
everything right there whip it around
see the top so you can see here is where
your USB cable plugs in so you're gonna
be plugging this bad boy right here and
do this and then this in your system
which I'll actually do at the end and
show you the illumination two USB ports
headphones microphone all on the
keyboard flip it around you can see you
have all of your stuff like they said
before all your audio Multimedia up here
so you can operate your you know your
discs or whatever you got inside there
you've got more keys over here on the
top this Thermaltake right here is going
to light up like we said before it as
Cherry MX Black Keys now I don't think
I've actually had to me cherry MX black
keys in here before and so that should
be pretty interesting unless the other
one had it which I'm not quite sure up
but now we've got that there let's just
go ahead and let me turn my computer on
and plug in at least what you guys see
what it looks like lit shall we so I'll
plug this little thing over here hit the
red dawn and let's see what we got to do
here all right so let's start over here
on the left hand side of the keyboard
you can see you've got plenty of the
macros right here all nice and lit up
cruising across you can see the
Thermaltake logo up here on top it does
a
type of thing in the program you'll
probably be able to change that and
modify it but everything is lit up you
can actually change also how many keys
are lit up you're gonna have just a
wasds you can have just these you'll be
able do lots of adjustments inside of
that but I'll get that when I do the
review so anyways folks this is it the
new thermaltake mecca g-unit illuminated
keyboard I think it looks pretty cool
it's supposed to be coming to a market
at about a hundred and thirty nine
dollars as far as how this thing plays
games everything else I'll get to that
when I do my full review like usual I
hope you guys did liked this video if so
hit that light key and show me some love
and if you're not subscribed please make
sure you do so we'll see you guys back
here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
