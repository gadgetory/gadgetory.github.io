tomorrow we bring you all the tech all
the time and today we've got some pretty
hot news but the thing is is this news
actually real it's been rumored that AMD
is gonna have a 16 core processor
they're coming out called the Zen that's
right but is the Zen actually real I
don't know but let's check out the room
bird specs and let's hear what you guys
have to say at the end if this is
actually true AMD will make quite a
comeback
AMD Zen core APU in Greenland HBM memory
power graphics arrives courtesy of
bugzilla via this screen now this slide
is for a chip that would contain up to
16 Zen x86 cores with support for up to
32 threads which is nothing new intel
has actually been doing this for years
each core will have access to 512
kilobytes of level 2 cache and each
cluster which is a group of four will
have eight megabytes of level 3 cache in
this particular instance was a 16 core
chip
we're looking at 8 megabytes of level 2
cache and a whopping 32 megabytes of
level 3 cache which is actually simply
amazing and will come into play when
doing things like rendering and
transferring and doing just all kinds of
things that take huge amounts of cores
and being that these things are gonna be
able to run together kind of like hyper
threading and should be interesting as
far as RAM goes this new platform looks
like it's going to support ddr4 with ECC
it up to 3 200 megahertz it's also going
to support a whopping 256 gigabytes of
memory per channel can you even imagine
that all in all that's a whole lot of
stuff on the table the Zen sounds
magical I know it does but is it real
and is it coming to the market let's
hear your comments down below
next up AMD is coming to Hollywood baby
that's right
these guys have made a deal now with the
people over at avid I know if you guys
know avenues but avid they like kind of
like kind of fuel the whole industry
they're in Hollywood the movies and all
the other stuff and now these guys are
gonna be working hand in hand with these
guys to be bringing a lot better stuff
to the table
this will allow successful workflows and
both the HD and 4k marketplace via the
fire pro graphics cards avid media
composer is recognized as a leading
non-linear video editing soft
application use extensively by
professional editors in moviemaking
television broadcast and streaming media
so the bottom line is this AMD has now
entered Hollywood because now their fire
pro graphics cards will fully support
and accelerate avid media composer 8.4
so hey welcome to Hollywood Andy so you
think you're a cool kid right you think
your phone has badass graphics well
guess again sharp is now gonna be
bringing a phone to the market it's kind
of a 5.5 inch screen and have amazing 4k
graphics that's right 4k and a 5.5 inch
screen this is 806 pixels per inch
people I'm talking about megapack pixels
and a small little diameter thing when
you look at movies they're gonna be so
real you're gonna think you're not real
am i real you tell me the resolution is
an amazing 38 60 by 2160 and once again
that little 5.5 inch frame and it is
packin more pixels per inch than even
the Galaxy x6 so when it hits the market
it will be the pixel pumping giant now
details are still a bit sketchy on this
they've got a little bit of explain to
do on that it's su panel because you
know people are saying hey is this thing
actually gonna work now obviously this
thing is fueled by all the VR headsets
and all those type of products out there
and it should hit the market sometime in
2016 but all in all think about this
this thing is gonna be a 5.5 inch
display with amazing graphics 38 60 by
2160 and a little small area it's gonna
be just amazingly clear I'm sure
everybody out there is wanting to have
the most pixels per inch on their phone
I'm gonna be out to buy this new product
and last up in today's news deal alert
what is it check it out the Moto 360 has
been slashed to 179 dollars that's right
now this thing's been in the market for
a while it's very very popular it's
totally a cool watch man if you guys out
there looking for a SmartWatch and
something cool you guys should seriously
check this thing out no longer is it
$249 it's now 179 and something that's
really cool look on your wrist I know
some people just you know do their time
by their phone but hey there's some
people who still like to have a
SmartWatch take it to the gym do all
kinds of stuff if you're one of those
people then you might want to check out
the Moto 360 which has been slashed to
one hundred and seventy nine dollars on
Amazon and shush shut so that's it folks
man lots of stories in the news if this
new Zen processor comes out obviously
this will be one badass thing because
look at it man
16 cores all that support for level 2
and level 3 cache it'll just be like the
bad boy of the market Greenland graphics
come on 16 gigabytes with high bandwidth
memory stuff in there come on fast fast
fast if it's true we don't know if it's
true but if it is true it's going to be
kick-ass and now that AMD is joined
force with avid they're going to be able
to take all their products and use avid
media composer 8.4 and bring all this
stuff to the market being able to
accelerate that stuff completely through
their fire pro graphics gives them a
very competitive edge with Nvidia AMD
does great things with OpenCL and hey
