good weekend so far mine's been in
pretty chill so check this out there has
just been so many good bad otherwise
things about Nvidia about r-tx about
what it does all the cards are blowing
up all this crazy stuff um I've just
really recently have just seriously seen
a trend that I'm not really liking and I
it just it kind of just kind of makes me
kind of ashamed to be a person when I
see that they're really the biggest tech
and things that people watch our tech
bashing that's what really has become
now he who can bash the best tech has
the biggest channel you know let's bash
some tech let's say some bad stuff that
has honestly never been my style ever
been my style and it's funny because a
lot of people say oh you know Elric
you're shilling for this company you're
shilling for that company do you even
know what the frickin word shill means
do you because it doesn't seem like you
really do a shill is a person who's
working inside of a store when someone
is like selling items and the shills
inside of the store promoting you to buy
the items in the store when if I ever
once in any video said hey you have to
go out and buy this name one show me a
video it's never happened I always leave
it up to you I might say I like
something or I dislike something but
that is way different than being a shill
person trying to push you to buy
something and if I say anything positive
about Nvidia in a video all of a sudden
like I've been paid by Nvidia to do this
and it's just like totally insane insane
insane insane I don't know about other
reviewers I don't see their paychecks
and what they do but I've never ever
received a penny I keep saying this over
and over again from any of these
companies at all they're not giving me
any money I base all my reviews on my
own opinions on how I feel about stuff
now you think Nvidia it's like all
loving me and they're like oh yeah you
know you're our sweet boy Elric I just
want a custom right now but then the
video get rated I won't get any money so
I'm not gonna do that but it's just
total total totally completely untrue
they were very unhappy about my
Battlefield video I tell you right now
because I tested an ultra even though we
did go from low to high and like
everything was just fine
they didn't they didn't like the video
they're not very happy with me right now
you know in their opinion they feel that
RTX is you know pretty much completely
misunderstood by all this reviewers out
here you know and only certain people
you know Oh actually get the story you
know and to me I don't know you know
what would make heads or tails of that
because like I never took the kool-aid
I'm not like saying hey you know r-tx is
the greatest thing in the world I'm
gonna level with you exactly what r-tx
is about okay right now the market is
completely utterly flat the markets flat
a and B has nothing competitive and
tells new graphic cards have not come
out so right now everything out there's
just a bunch of farts in the wind that's
all that it is there's nothing solid and
concrete coming out
do you see an AMD card out there that
can beat anything on videos plate no you
cannot there is nothing out there at all
so why would Nvidia really need to just
put a card out there that's just more
frames per second when they've already
got more frames per second on their
video card do you really understand this
fact they're already winning the frames
per second battle before any of the 2080
cards 2070 cards
none of that stuff before it even came
out of the market NVIDIA was doing a lot
of money all their cards were usually
sold out this is just the way things are
so at this point in time
Nvidia decide to just do something
different completely and I can
understand you know why they would do
this now whether I honestly think the
cards are worth you know $1,400 I've
told you before if people out there
don't have the kind of money to buy this
stuff right at the moment and r-tx is
not fully supported yet okay that's just
the way that it is and that he doesn't
like my opinion yeah I'm sorry about
that that's just how I feel is the
technology of valid technology for the
future yes I believe it is just like all
the other stuff that's come out just
when we first saw 3d effects and we see
physics and all that stuff it comes the
market and then after a while it just
becomes a standard thing that nobody
even really talks about you expect every
game to have physics in it now it's not
even talked about do you expect it to be
there so why wouldn't Nvidia at this
point in time there's absolutely no
competition on the market
whatsoever what better time honestly to
release something that's even ahead of
its time why not
why not put it out there and if it's out
there already then that gives gamers you
know and game developers especially the
time to develop all the backend software
for it so let's just say that Nvidia
waited I understand this point
completely I'm so my friend Nvidia I'm
telling you I understand your point on
this I really do
there really is no reason why they had
to wait why not release the technology
before it's really ready I mean what do
they need to do sit around and try to
get people to invest in this technology
and they haven't even seen it so it kind
of in a way does make sense to release
technology out there even though it's
not fully supported now does that mean
that I mean I'm telling you go out and
buy this right now you need it no I've
never felt that way because yeah it is
going to be something very effective
probably on the next-gen cards you'll
see you know 40 to 50 games maybe 60
games that all support r-tx and it's
doing what it's supposed to be now as
we've seen the results with the
battlefield 5 with the brand-new patch
you guys can see it did add great frame
rates at both 1440 and 1080p and I did
make a mistake
I said 10% and 4k was actually just 10
frames per second excuse me in the 4k so
they weren't very happy about that even
though that's really kind of a really
really small point nobody really you
know bitched about it whatsoever but the
bottom line is and video release this
technology because there is really
nothing on the market to compete with
them and the bottom line is why not
seriously it really just comes down to
that if you've got no competition you
don't have to release a new car there's
nothing forcing to you you can sit on
your laurels kick back and collect your
money from your 10 80s or 10 70s you
know your Titan XPS and you're good to
go you can chill out and make yourself
millions of dollars you don't have to
release a new card so in that case why
not release a card that has technology
it may not be totally relevant at the
moment but as you can see even as the
time has gone by we're starting to see
the relevancy of this technology become
more and more prevalent we see more
games coming out and that's just the way
it's going to be and other companies
have done this as well AMD is released
stuff that
ahead of its time and you know they
boasted about it hey we're doing stuff
ahead of our time now nvidia is just
doing the same thing so yeah so sure
maybe our TX isn't supported in every
single game out there at the moment you
know and if you don't have the money to
buy the cards then heck go ahead and
just buy yourself a 1080 TI 1080 1070
1060 those cards of all drop down in
price quite a bit no one is holding a
gun to your head making you go buy these
cards so why I see all these people
putting all these hate videos out and
it's bashing out you guys act like
NVIDIA has gone to your house and like
I've come to your house and we've all
told you oh hey this is the best stuff
in the world you need it you need to
have it it's like the Bible it needs to
be a part of your life like nobody is
really I haven't seen ever really said
that about RTX I have never heard that
ever it's ahead of its time
sure it totally is Nvidia they really
have no competition at the moment they
really don't you aim defense and get man
go yeah you know next year AMD is gonna
have something that's gonna totally
destroy these guys well you know what
when I see it I'll believe it I like AMD
stuff I use AMD stuff we have a bunch of
systems around there I saw a lot of AMD
systems to my friends because let's just
face it
AMD always has a better price point with
everything video card CPUs all of that
stuff Intel Nvidia always known to be
like the Ferrari and the rolls-royce of
these companies so if you want to have a
PC that's gonna have a Ferrari or
rolls-royce in it you're gonna obviously
have to pay these prices I didn't create
this market I'm not doing anything with
this market and that kind of a strange
thing is I'll tell you this you know a
lot of my Chinese friends one of the big
things in their culture is bragging
about how much they spent on their car
seriously like in their culture the
person who like who has the most
expensive car is like the G of the block
so maybe Nvidia it's thinking late we'll
charge is outrageous prices and the
mentality of B will guide our stuff cost
so much money people will buy it but at
the end of the day you have the choice
of where you spend your money you do not
have to buy r-tx you don't have to give
your money to Nvidia but if you like
that technology you like what it does
you're happy with your performance with
your Nvidia stuff and you're not really
too happy with a
D stuff well and hey you're just gonna
have to suck it up buy it and deal with
it as the technology comes out or just
wait till the next generation comes and
there's a lot more games out there so
that's it folks
Nvidia never had any competition leaving
a giant opening hole in the market for
them to do something completely
left-sided why move forward to an area
that you already are succeeding in why
not expand in a sideways motion in a way
it's like CPUs you don't CPUs you see
getting you know past five gigahertz but
what you do see is you see more cores
coming out more cores more cores more
cards as they speed up try to speed up
each core to be as fast working all
together so technology going sideways is
kind of a thing that always happens it's
happening CPUs and now with our TX we
see it happening in the video card as
well so like it love it no one's forcing
you to buy it but if you're into it hey
you know what you're getting and you
know how to spend your money I'm Mel are
you guys been watching techni Mauro
peace we'll see you guys back here for
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
