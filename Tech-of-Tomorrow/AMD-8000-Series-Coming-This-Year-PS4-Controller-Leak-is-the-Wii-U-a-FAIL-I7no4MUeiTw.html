sunday here on TECA tomorrow bringing
the Sunday edition the news edition I've
got both my pets right here the crazy
cat and the dog here together for you
today you saw the dog catches the cat
they actually love each other but
they'll get crazy if I hold them too
long together so what's going on today
well today a lot of stuff has happened
this last week that's pretty exciting
first of all we you you guys have all
heard about this thing now it's kind of
been a real flop for the people at
Nintendo compared to all the releases
that are being out right now Nintendo
has actually showed the worst sales
month in their entire history
unbelievably low why other companies
like Microsoft Xbox are number one and
they're selling like 281,000 you're only
seeing 60,000 units a month being sold
by the nintendo wii now there may be a
lot of reasons about this I feel they've
lost their you know touch with the
audience I grew up I was a Nintendo kid
but I feel that many of us have actually
outgrown the Nintendo brand we've all
grown up we've all got into our first
person shooters all those kind of crazy
games the people in Nintendo just
haven't followed trend at all they're
falling behind so if you guys want to
check out a full article in this and why
I think this is happening I know some of
you guys have made some comments before
like if I wanted to read i buy a book
well you know you don't have to read
I've told you pretty much the gist of it
right now but if you want to get more in
depth about it you can go check out the
article now next up on the agenda for
today PlayStation 4 rumors have been
abounding and there's been a leak about
what the new controller is going to look
like that's right now you guys all know
the controller is pretty much you know
it's a main part of your gaming
experience if the controller sucks it's
lame it's not organ AMA cure' not going
to like it you're not going to want a
game on it so people out there are very
very worried they're like hey what's
going on is this new controller going to
be so different that I'm gonna be like
what this is in my end dog hates of my
TL but you know there's been some big
changes now I've got pictures of this
and a small article written on this now

going to announce it in New York so
that's going to be some pretty
citing news so once again if you missed
that check that out in the link in the
description below now last but by no
means least a md that's right AMD what's
going on with AMD you guys all heard the
rumors last week that they're not going
to make it any more refreshed at all
through 2013 well that's not exactly
true what's really going on is our
planning on focusing on more on their
business end traditionally AMD is only
focused on trying to beat Nvidia at the
chipset game they haven't done that much
in business development haven't made
that great relationships with your
gaming companies that make the games
these are things that are all supposed
to change in the future now it's mainly
going to be focused on the mobile and
notebook market so you guys might want
to check that out I've got a full
article written on this also over on the
