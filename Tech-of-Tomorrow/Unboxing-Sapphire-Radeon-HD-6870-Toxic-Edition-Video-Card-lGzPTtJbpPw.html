reference card that you get from the
folks at AMD sapphires going ahead and
redesigned this for you and it features
the vapor x technology underneath here
which you can't see to keep your card
running very cool there's also two 6-pin
power connectors and inside this box
they'll probably be a couple of bollocks
adapters to hook into those as well the
