or a host down here from Down Under

new sapphire radeon HD 6870 toxic
edition what is a toxic edition you
might ask lads well the toxic edition is
the addition that comes overclocked
right out of the box it features them

and supports three monitors in I
affinity and DirectX 11 but for now

box of this new sapphire radeon HD 6870
toxic edition alright so starting off on
the side right here I'll show you and
the Sapphire boxes you just take your
little finger nail right there get a
little tape there you open it up take a
pop in the box begins to open a like
always gentlemen there is a box within
the box now sapphire sometimes it gets
confusing a lot of times I dump this
stuff out of the table in fact I did it
again upside down so I'm going to pop it
back around the other way you can open
the box up like this and then internally
you can see we start out with the card
completely sealed package yeah at the
aesthetic bag this time will show you
the card first as you can see the toxic
edition has a different heatsink and fan
of Simon on it than your regular
reference card that you get from the
folks at AMD sapphires going ahead and
redesigned this for you and it features
the vapor x technology underneath here
which you can't see to keep your card
running very cool there's also two 6-pin
power connectors and inside this box
they'll probably be a couple of bollocks
adapters to hook into those as well the
cards not that big takes about two
and it's about nine inches long so this
is the card on the back you can see the
rear I oh you've got two mini DV is a
high speed hdmi and two DVI ports on the
rear I oh so this is the card and we'll
move along and see what content also
comes in the box alright then so we have
another box within the box will open
this one up this is all the accessories
I will go ahead and pull them off from
the table and we shall talk about them
one by one as we
go through alright so we're going to be
in we get the graphics driver CD

the Sapphire select club what this is
your register your card you get three
stuff from sapphire when qualifying

their card as I spoke of before there

power connectors for those of you who

come in very handy then we have right
