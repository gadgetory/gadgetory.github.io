sisters welcome back once again to tech
of tomorrow I'm Mel arc your host and
today we're bringing you guys the full
review of the new gigabyte GTX 650 Ti
boost now this is their win forced
overclocked edition now before I jump
into the actual video I want to give a
special shout out to a data for making
this video possible now I know many of
you guys are into upgrading your video
cards but also another great upgrade you
can do when gaming is upgrading to a
faster SSD now a data has had their SX
900 series out for a while now and it's
gotten rave reviews across the internet
now reasonably a data has just let out a
new firmware update that makes this
kick-ass Drive even better with that
said let's jump into the review I folks
will wrap the bat let's take a look at
the physical aspects of this new GeForce
GTX 650 Ti boost windforce Edition from
gigabyte let's start dock differently
this time let's start out at the rear
i/o we can start up the bat we have two
dual link DVI connections single HDMI
and single standard DisplayPort now I'm
going to turn the card to its side where
you guys can see there are two fans now
this is an open-air fan design allows
cooling to go but it also relies on your
system the better airflow you have in
your system the better this card will
actually work unlike those little twin
the spinner things that look like
blowers on your cards which cool the
card good but are noisier than hell and
they're just kind of old-school
so why we've got the card right here
let's take a measurement of it the card
size is in at nine and a half inches as
far as being sideways the card is four
inches high and we see the card is at
one and a half inches in diameter
still a dual slot card you guys can see
the PCI 3.0 interface right there you
guys can also see some of the mechanics
right here of the card and the cooling
you guys can see the copper heat pipes
running all through there take a look at
that get a close-up of that you guys can
see all the cooling fins here you guys
can see it's the wind force addition we
have a single six pin power connector
you can see all the heat pipes clearly
running through the system
so the GPU it gets sucked up into the
fins then out to the heat pipes the fans
blow the heat out and your system will
push the air out of your system
keeping the card running as cool as
possible so there's also a single SLI
finger up here on top and that's right
this card does support SLI now you guys
can see that the PCB gets extended by
the fan the actual size of the PCB is
about 7 inches so the PCB 7 inches but
the shroud and the cooling that's what
gives it its extra girth with that said
let's jump in now and let's talk about
the features of the card the cards based
in the 28 nanometer process it has 768
cuda cores 2 gigabytes of gddr5 memory
and 192 bit memory interface now the
total memory bandwidth is 144 point 2
gigabytes per second now this thing has
a clock speed of a thousand 33 megahertz
right out of the box has a memory clock
of 1500 and 2 megahertz and a boost
clock of 1098 megahertz all the basic
features and vide are there the TxAA
adapted vsync the boost all these things
are still prevalent here in the card now
the card does come overclocked out of
the box but because of the great cooling
you should be able to push this even
further now let's take a look at the
test system and right now we've got in
the background 3d mark morning so you
guys can see that running right there
and the frame rates going on and you
guys can see I had this card in the red
dawn extreme which is our dual Xeon e5
26 60 80 gigabytes of RAM
whoo we have an ocz PCIe that's right
it's a PCIe SSD boot drive and we have 2
4 and 80 gigabytes by Kingston HyperX in
raid 0
all in all a solid system now with that
said let's jump in and let's check out
the card and how it performs and I think
you guys are going to be surprised at
how cool this cart runs compared to the
others
let's rock
you
oh I am so very
you guys can see now from the scores
from everything else about this card
that it runs cooler quieter and faster
than a reference based card the card is
also very small it'll fit in many
different systems power requirements
really low on it but if you're looking
for a card that's very well priced very
fast and very quiet
this new GTX 60 DTI overclocked bad boy
from gigabyte is a card you're going to
