to tech of tomorrow we'll bring you all
the tech all the time I'm Eric and today
my coast once again is jayjay from Asus
and today we're going to be taking a
look at their UEFI BIOS all the way
through their mainstream and rog
motherboards correct sir
correct and actually even the UEFI
options that we're going to show on the
UAF 5 part with the exception of the RG
ones will also include tough NWS right
on so with that said let's not talk
anymore let's jump in let's check out
the UEFI alright folks you guys can see
right now we're in the UEFI BIOS I've
got JJ right here by my side and he's
going to take us through a guided tour
and tell us some of the great new
features that are coming out on Asus his
latest products yeah you're a hundred
percent right doc we're going to be
covering some new features that we have
as part of our z87 series of
motherboards this will cover the
mainstream series the tough series rog
series and WS series as well as even
let's say valuated models alike are z87
- j as well as of course like our high
end boards like the deluxe so anybody
watching this video than any of the new
motor buds that are coming out for you
folks by watching this video they'll be
able to apply these same settings to
what they're doing in real time correct
correct but definitely for guys want to
tweak and tune their system they're
going to want to make sure to check out
our overclocking video which is going to
break it down in a whole nother way as
far as actually let you know how to
tweak continue your system and be able
to take advantage of the new fourth
generation Core Series processor alright
let's just see some of the basic new
features then ok so here you can see
we're actually in the easy mode
interface and the big thing that we want
to try to do with easy mode is try to be
able to add a bit more functionality to
it
before you had some great options in
there such as being able to go ahead and
drag and drop different boot devices in
sequential order so that you could go
ahead and have defined onedrive be the
bootable logging versus the other but we
want to go ahead and extend that a bit
further so we've added something very
basic such as being able to go in and be
able to make adjustments to your time
and your date very simply not a big
change but one that was requested a
bigger one is actually right here if you
take a look at the DRAM information we
have a nice break down that shows us
each one of the banks of memory it's
installed here so here we have some
great Kingston HyperX beast memory and
that's installed now one of the most
frequently executed items for users that
are more enthusiast oriented and
purchasing memory kits is enabling
XMP all right for a lot of users they
didn't necessarily know that they had to
enable this or where to even enable it
guys like me and you they've been doing
it for a long time we know we have to go
into the advanced property menu the
overclocking or area and then enable the
XMP profile it's true add many users
before contact me and say they had no
idea but just say this simple XMP
profile and get that extra speed out of
their memory
correct and now all they're gonna have
to do is just with an easy mode you can
go ahead and click this one option and
from there you can go ahead and select
the profile Kingston generally tends to
offer two profiles for their XMP other
vendors tend to only offer one profile
I'll but from there I can just go ahead
and click it ask me if I want to load it
and it will go ahead and apply it and
that's it so it's a one-button execution
of X and key much simpler than you
actually having to navigate into the
Advanced section go into a overclock
tuner and then go to manual then set X
and P profiling it's one across the
solution yeah so a really nice easy
function for any type of enthusiasts
that wants to take advantage of their X
and P related memory another option that
we've got ahead incorporated here that's
about streamlining the usability is to
go ahead and actually give you fan
control functionality but once again
accessible right here from the easy mode
interface so the user can go ahead and
straight go right to this expansion tab
and they can see actually each one of
their fan headers what it's running out
but if they want to go ahead make a
quick adjustment I can just go ahead and
set that to silent mode or can keep that
when it's standard maybe if I've got a
water cooling pump connected to this
other one I could go ahead and you know
set it to manual and then disable it
within the manual fan options so we
offer a much more advanced level of
functionality immediately right there
inside of the easy mode function so you
don't have to worry about once again
jumping into the Advanced section just
to make something as simple as an
adjustment to your Fantas settings
what's this interesting thing right here
it's it looks like a nice little diamond
received performance quiet and
energy-saving what's that this is a
feature that we've actually already had
in our previous generation you afi's but
it allows you to quickly tune your
system for one profile or another so if
you want to have a quick kind of
moderate overclock to your system such
as like a 4.25 gigahertz and just go
ahead and click on that button and it
will automatically overclock your system
and the click of a button now this is
advantageous because we have TPU
switches and EPS switches on the
motherboard but what happens if you
install your system inside the chassis
but you still want to take advantage of
that TPU switch function right don't why
I actually have to open it up correct
now you can just go inside the UEFI
click this optimal button and you're
good to go so normal is going to be
stock
was going to be an overclock and power
savings going to go ahead and do that
under volt to be able to go ahead and
conserve some power be able to reduce
the thermal footprint and maybe extend a
little bit of the CPU lifespan so down
here of course we maintain the drag and
drop boot priorities we also got ahead
and incorporated this great easy option
for SATA information so I can go ahead
and click on this and it will show me a
real-time preview of all my drives as
they're connected so I know which ports
they're on write it this easy mode
interface so you can see a couple of
touches but overall add a lot more
accessibility and usability straight off
the bat here inside of the easy mode
UEFI environment now us being a course
here at eka tomorrow and we have a lot
of advanced uses that when you own a see
maybe the more advanced functionality of
course we still keep the Advanced Mode
so we're just going to go and reset
things back to default and we're going
to jump into the Advanced Mode there we
go
so immediately off the bat doesn't
necessarily look too different but there
are going to be some really big changes
in terms of some key functionality that
you have to offer such as the AI Tweaker
I a Tweaker is actually what we've
previously always offered in terms of
tweaking all our performance related
options like frequency multipliers and
voltages well the first one that's going
to be special right here is this item
that's called quick note and what this
is actually going to allow you do is
actually create real time notes inside
of UEFI they could persistently be saved
so an example might be if I'm working
with my platform I'm tweaking it I'm
overclocking it and I figure out ok hey
I need to be able to overclock 4.6
gigahertz is going to require 1.2 volts
with no line load calibration I can make
a note of that so I can go ahead and go
to be able to complete stable over POC
add to define 1.2 volts for a 46 X
multiplier and you can go ahead and save
that information now how many of those
can you actually save in there how many
different separate notes or that just
one solid note it's one solid note but
there's braking amongst it so of course
you could just go ahead and you keep
adding all the way down keep keep adding
out and
you want so you have that flexibility
you could of course add if you want to
even break it down by date and time just
go ahead and store that information
there when you're first typing it out to
say that's with this information of that
information so we feel this adds a whole
new level of functionality and
versatility so that you know for guys
when they're tweaking and tuning your
systems a lot of times you sometimes
have a piece of paper and a pen just
writing down your notes you don't have
to worry about that anyway you can just
save it all inside of the UEFI you can
take advantage of it and when you reboot
back in if you need to reference that
information you just bring up your quick
note and bam you have all that
information right that's that's the only
one very very interesting new feature
and the great thing is like I said is
it's not going to just be reserved for
we're using a z87 deluxe series board
but this is going to be on the z87 - a
so even our entry-level a value oriented
board is going to be able to offer you
this functionality and this versatility
that's excellent
so we can go ahead and quit out quit out
of that and keep moving along now one of
the next options that we have got
incorporated is my favorites this is a
really cool way to be able to define the
UEFI in an easy accessible way a lot of
times there's lots of different options
that are spread out throughout the UEFI
and you might not necessarily need to
have access to every single part of the
UEFI because you just consistently use
same portions of it over and over and
over again right so we've previously had
an f3 option which is great which is our
integrated shortcut functionality so you
can go ahead and have different options
here that we predefined for you that
would allow you to jump to different
parts of the UEFI for this generation
we've expanded on shortcut and added my
favorites so what you can do is
essentially go in here and we can fully
modify whatever shortcuts you have
available to you so let's say we can go
ahead and take these out here and I can
add whatever I want so let's say first
off the bat I want to go ahead and maybe
add something like serial ata
configuration right I can go ahead and
go to f4 and I can add it to my favorite
page or excuse me I can go to and add it
to my shortcut page so you can see right
here if I go to f3 it's now set a
configuration is available to me if I
want to go ahead and maybe go to a
overclock Tweaker and I want to be able
to reach this section I can once again
go here I can add it to that page we can
go ahead and add it to my shortcut page
so now you can notice that I have now a
o'clock / tuner there and I can go in
and set those options right off the bat
from within
quick store cut environment and you can
add multiple items that my favorite page
as well as you can go ahead and add
multiple items to the shortcut page so
you can see like maybe once again also
if I want maybe something like my fan
control functionality for like my CPU
fan header are you go ahead and add that
as well
and now I have those options real time
available to me there so I can always
let's say even if I'm now here at the
main screen right I want to jump
straight over to that now it'll take me
straight to that section yeah most
people will use actually a few the
option the BIOS and like you say they go
back and forth those all the times
that's a pretty cool thing like I'm your
own quick shortcut way correct and it's
fully definable by you so you can always
go to any time if you want to go ahead
and remove these you can just remove it
from your my favorites page as well as
you could go ahead and make adjustments
to your shortcut page or you just go
ahead and if maybe I don't want that
option anymore I don't want that option
anymore and I don't want that one
anymore it's fully adjustable
controllable I use but it allows you to
have so much more flexibility in terms
of just making sure that you have
immediate easy access to the sections of
the UEFI that you use most consistently
yeah that's actually a really excellent
option so moving from there we've also
expanded on some other items so one of
them that's really cool here is under
satty configuration so if we go into
this option and let's say you go over to
here you can see that I've gone ahead
and have some interesting names right if
you look it says SATA SATA 6g to yellow
right but it actually gives you a name
how do I have a name inside the ua5 so
did you name it yourself that's correct
so if this actual system is set up in a
raid configuration which we went ahead
and load default so that's why it's not
listing us raid but now what we have the
fixture ability to do is that we can go
in and we can rename any single port
that's really cool so if you can imagine
if you have maybe two three four hard
drives you know one of my systems at
home I have for two terabyte hard drives
and they're all from the same vendor
right and so when they show up in my
UEFI I don't know actually which drive
might be which driving which was
connected to which port right so
sometimes maybe if you're doing
partitioning or deleting maybe secure
racing volumes you always kind of have
that worry hey you know which drive is
it that I'm working you got remember it
right you got to remember and that's
like even on rrg boards why we had those
those SATA cable labels that you could
put on the drives to make this easier
but now I can go ahead just
click on this this is much better and I
can go ahead and actually delete this so
if I want to call this you know raid
volume drive one that's it I can go
ahead and rename it and it's persistent
even when you reboot and save the UEFI
you'll consistently now have these
labels associated to whatever drives
that you have attached to that so it
allows you to just always have a more
kind of personalized level of
information on how you have your system
set up so you can imagine you know maybe
if I don't have anything connected that
volume but they may be let's say if I
want to say that I have me you know my
you know that's my steam you know games
directory right I know that that drive
is that always a good drive to protect
yes no ifs that um you know or if you
had that maybe that's your personal
backup or that's your photo volume
that's your you know your video volume
whatever it might be you just now have
the flexibility you can go in and you
can rename it to whatever you want one
thing I wanna talk about here judges
it's done awesome for too much but up
here on the SATA mode selection button a
lot of users still contact me and they
don't know that you can change the
things there to make your actually hard
drive performance better they always
want to set it to the standard they
don't really understand you could set it
to HCI I get much better performance
yeah I mean the lucky thing is with all
AC series motherboards to be default to
HCI operation
that's excellent so that makes sure that
you're already getting the best out of
performance right off the bag you don't
need to worry about changing that but
you're 100% right you know that if you
were using a potentially competitive
sport that could be defaulting into
compatibility or ID mode and you're
using a new generation SSD and a lot of
users don't know they're making that
simple change has a big impact on
performance high 2% your correct
so you know this we think is another
once again really valuable level of
functionality which is about us
ultimately helping to show that what
we're most interested in is not just
adding something that looks interesting
but ultimately something that we feel
that we want users to be able to use at
the end of the national yeah correct so
that's another great option that we've
gone ahead and incorporated inside of
the UEFI and when you add that together
with other aspects like the f12 a print
screen function which course allows you
to save screenshots of every single
section to the UEFI as well as let's say
inside the UEFI where you can go in
you can go into the advance fan control
functionality and be able to define full
manual operation per each one of the
headers you know for three pin or four
pin control that adds even more
versatility now a lot of time you also
go into the UAF eye and you make a lot
of changes so an example might be if I'd
say I was going to go ahead and
overclock my system I might enable XMP
and then I'm going to go ahead and go
ahead and set maybe my multiplier
information so I set that and then maybe
I'm going to define something else here
and then I want to go ahead and make an
adjustment it comes in my power
configuration I'm going to say that I'm
going to go ahead and make all these
other little changes right that you
might do when you're tweaking and tune
your system sometimes you might not
necessarily remember everything that
you're doing right and so a great thing
that we're now offering is going to be
this last modified function so you can
see here that when we actually complete
a change to the system we can save a
history of those things that are being
executed upon so it'll save right to USB
the same as like taking all the picture
the bios screens no so you can see right
here so i went to go save and exit right
and when i went to go save and exit if
you notice it gave me a history of all
the little things that i've changed now
so it gives you this great visual
snapshot hey these are all the changes
that you've made so right before you
save you can kind of get a verification
okay I set that adjust in terms of the
frequency the voltages the load line
calibration all those things that I want
to go ahead and be conscious on you can
see it all in one screen to them to
scroll back through a bunch of different
windows as well correct because you
might not even remember sometimes you're
maybe reading a foreign post or watching
a video or something else and you don't
remember so now we've given you
essentially a consolidated history of
all those levels of adjustment and the
great thing is once you go ahead and
actually execute your reboot and you
make your adjustments you could also go
into the last modified section and as
you saw if you want to then save that
and output it to a USB flash drive just
like when you're doing the f12 print
screen you can also track the data in
that way as well that's really cool
so that hopes it shows you some of the
really cool features and functionality
that we have integrated inside the UEFI
that we feel helps to also maintain the
great functionality and versatility of
what we feel that we're bringing to the
table now as you would expect there's
even going to be some further options
that are exclusive to ROG which we're
going to show in a little bit
cover also the complete scope of options
that we have available now the very last
thing that we do want to touch on is
that we have gone ahead incorporated a
new function that's called OC tuner
which we had in a previous generation
but it's been tuned for a little bit
more flexibility as well so for users
that sometimes want to be able to tag to
take advantage of a quick way of auto
overclocking their system instead of
having to go through our software if you
don't feel like loading that or
installing your system or using GP
switches and you want maybe a little bit
more aggressive in overclock you can now
go ahead and go in here leave as is and
you can select either ratio only or BCA
okay first and what that means is it'll
automatically attempt to auto overclock
the system through adjusting the ratio
of the CPU multiplier or adjusting the
BC LK and it will do dynamically without
actually the require marry software now
because we don't have an OS and you
can't fully stress tests to the degree
that we can with our audio tuning
technology the result won't be as high
but it'll still be a little bit more
aggressive than the standard options
that we have available so another cool
functionality that we've integrated
within the UEFI just another great
option for overclocking yeah alright
folks so there you have it the UEFI bios
all its options from mainstream and ROG
you know JJ you did a great job covering
all that stuff those are all kinds of
different kinds of options in your
guys's new UEFI including you know
what's something we didn't talk about is
being able to just use a mouse so very
simple and eloquently not having it
bounce around or jiggedy-jaggedy with
yours it just smoothly goes through and
able to click all those options
something that a lot of people will
appreciate no I had a percent agree and
actually thanks for calling it out
because it's something that we've worked
really hard on is that not just the
feature set inside the UEFI but even the
general responsiveness of it and even
things like being able to key on manual
entry values good simplified layout in
terms of knowing where things are
accessible to you they all come down to
making sure that when you go inside that
environment and you're working within it
it's a smooth positive experience versus
like you said something where it's
hopping in and out maybe have weird
transitions or animations it's just kind
of can be sometimes in inconsistent or
frustrating experience now you guys all
know that asus has always been a pioneer
when it comes to overclocking stuff and
you can see that all these motherboards
have really awesome overclocking
features whether you're just somebody
who doesn't know jack diddly about it
you can click a button and get some easy
simple overclocking or if you're an
advanced user who knows his stuff you
can go in there and modify and trick
this thing out just all kinds of
different ways hundred percent agree
with that I mean definitely the UEFI
though we feel also even adds value with
even functions like the quick note or
the SATA renaming you know or the easy
fan control functionality we now have in
the easy mode to even users that aren't
overclocking centric so we've tried to
give you guys a great balance of
features that benefit the overclockers
the standard users and the enthusiasts
who cross both lines as far as needing
things that are sensible and functional
but also are looking for performance and
edge functionality and you know at the
same time - we'd love to hear you guys
his feedback on things that you would
love to see incorporated you know
sometimes there's going to be
differences that what can actually be
done and what can't be done but we
always love to hear the feedback so you
guys hear that down the comments section
below we're looking to hear your comment
so tell us if you're a fan of Asus and
you use their UEFI BIOS go ahead man
give us your opinions your thoughts we
always want to hear them here on ticker
tomorrow Thank You JJ for once again
coming out on being here and we've got
more stuff coming up including
overclocking and well you'll see we'll
see you guys back here on teka tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
