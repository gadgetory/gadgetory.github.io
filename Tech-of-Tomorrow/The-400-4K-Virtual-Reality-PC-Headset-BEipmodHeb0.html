again detective tomorrow now we all know
that 3d virtual reality that stuff is
just taking over the market and some of
the headsets out there let's just face
it they cost big bucks but today we're
going to check out the pi max now the pi
max headset is actually under $400 its
4k
works with every variety of window 7 8
and 10
you poor Mac bastards you're Sol so what
that said though let's jump in and let's
check out the pi max 4k 3d headset upon
getting the box we open the box up the
first thing that we see is that all the
parts are pretty much not connected this
to me is a kit if you're going to have
to assemble more than one things and put
a bunch of stuff together that to me is
a kit now obviously everything does come
in the box that you need but you've got
to build the thing so if you want those
people out there you don't like building
things whatsoever that right off the bat
is going to be a caveat that you're
going to want to avoid now once you do
get the headset put together though it's
actually very comfortable one of the
things we did know it's sticking on your
head is it's got so many doggone pads on
it that you can actually wear the thing
for hours and it's not going to give you
any type of discomfort whatsoever very
comfortable that's the one thing about
that I'd probably have to say is very
very good about it is that it is quite
comfortable so if you're watching movies
or playing games for a long time well
that's going to be something you're
going to like as far as the features go
let's first talk about 4k because
obviously the PI max is pushing that now
the pi max features a resolution of 3840
by 2160 with eight point two nine
million pixels and 806 pixels per inch
and how this works out is it actually
works out to each eye cup having a
resolution of 1920 by 2160
combine those together you get 4k the pi
max headset also adopts a thousand hertz
dual gyroscope this helps reduce the
Disney effect when playing games the
headset also features a 110 degree field
of view and dual 53 millimeters
at spherical optical lenses and as far
as the headset goes the headphones
themselves feature a 40 millimeter
driver unit with stereo stage and
virtual 5.1 sound and as you can see
even though they're a bit bulky they're
also fully padded for maximum comfort
now the only caveat I feel to the
resolution however is that only comes
across at 60 Hertz so you folks out
there 140 bucks and that type of thing
this just isn't going to cut it the
overall design at the PI max VR headset
to me seems a little bit bulky now you
guys can see that on top there's just a
couple buttons for doing control this is
your power and your volume and beyond
that it's a pretty much simple design
there's a headband going all the way
across the top everything is completely
padded for comfort and you can also
detach the headphones in case you want
to try using them as speakers on your
desktop how well this will work we'll
have to find out now that the headphones
have been assembled the very first thing
that we had to do was go download the
app from a Chinese website now
downloading it that didn't seem to be
too much of a problem but we try to use
anything inside of the app like the
movies of the games they could not be
opened or downloaded any cost it which
is so slow that it became pretty much
impossible to do these things getting
the driver that wasn't a problem using
what's inside of it absolute no-go
before I delved into my review I made
sure they checked out some other
people's reviews just to see how their
opinions are and how their experience
what the headset was and one of the
things I have to say that I saw that we
don't agree with whatsoever is a lot of
people said that they had problems set
up they saw ghosting inside the game and
all that kind of stuff
we actually experienced none of that
whatsoever all the games that we played
whether they were steamvr seed jammer 4k
any of the games that we played they
actually looked completely great we had
no problem getting things to line up we
had no ghosting whatsoever so I don't
know if those problems were just a part
of you know some old driver but for our
experience everything actually went
pretty damn smooth VR movies also look
absolutely great so if you're going to
use the headset or be our movies alone I
think this headset actually stands out
that's the one two thumbs up that I give
the headset all the way across the board
watching VR movies and you know movies
are very long so when you're watching
something for a really long time like I
said previously these things are very
very comfortable the PI max is not
something you put in your head and go oh
my god it's hurting my neck it's
bothering me
you can leave it on your head for a long
time and watching movies is like I said
one thing it's very solid I know there
are a lot of different 3d games out
there a lot of different VR games I
don't know how this headsets going to
work across the board with everything
but from our experience and from what
we've seen they do work a lot better
than a lot of the reviews that I read
online maybe this is due because they've
updated the driver and fix things a
little better because obviously some of
these reviews were from a few months ago
so our experience just as far as gaming
and watching movies I say this headset
works pretty solid the PI max VR headset
does look pretty well though and the
sound is pretty much compatible to
anything else we've seen there now are
the visuals as good as the oculus or the
HTC vive I have to say absolutely not to
me as far as things go the HTC vive is
up here on the top but it's also $800
the oculus ripped it's $600 and then
you've got these down below $400 so it's
pretty much you know every additional
$200 you pay you get some more features
you know and that's just the way things
are but if you're looking for something
that's going to be entry-level that you
can use play your games with and it's
not going to totally break the bank and
in fact we've had people come over to
the house and they try to virtual
reality stuff and they don't really like
it that much in fact virtual reality
gets some people sick I myself I play
for a few hours on no matter any of
these headsets I feel really sick geez
the Cameron he can play this damn thing
all day long as can my son but for me
personally I start doing that stuff I
don't like it so if you're looking to
just you know jump into VR and try it
out and find it if you really like it
this might be a really good headset for
you to start off with now if you know
for a fact that you like VR and you want
the absolute best setup that you can get
I wasn't just saving your money and just
get the HTC vive we're going to be
working with them very soon and turning
an entire room into an HTC vive room
will bring you guys that video I think
you guys will think it's pretty cool
so I'm going to green-screen an entire
room the entire room will be covered in
green screen and in the middle room will
stand and be able to play different VR
games and from what I'm reading online
and from what people have said this is
the ultimate ultimate VR that you can
get right now so that's the direction
that we're going to go here on teka
tomorrow
so at the end of the day my opinion I
want to like bore you guys are too much
stuff on this stuff because I know VR
stuff is just what it is at the end of
the day if you're going to do
entry-level you don't want to break the
bank you don't really know what VR is
then this might be a great headset for
you to get now like usual down below
like button will have a link to this
product where you can check it out I
think I could probably even get gearbest
to actually give us a coupon for this
but personally I think I'd at least get
the oculus if I was really going to buy
one but if you want to save money and
try this one out for some people it
might be the perfect fit hi Mel are you
guys been watching Tekken tomorrow we'll
see you guys back from the channel
because uh we just got Conan going so
I'm off to be a frickin barbarian shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
