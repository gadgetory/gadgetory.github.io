been doing a lot of solo music well that
said you guys might not know it but I
have a recording studio here at the
house as well and we've been having a
lot of trouble with the electricity with
using regular amps and my camp speakers
we're just going to damn buzz and it has
been working out at all so we got
together and we actually said let's just
make a purchase to some that we can
actually use that's really awesome
so we went and we checked out the
fractal audio systems this is their axe
FX - I'm gonna do the unboxing today
this is actually a trippy product you
plug your guitar in here and you can get
all these radical effects and sounds
just like you actually had a real live
amp this one's supposed to be
professional quality and hopefully it'll
work for us in the studio that said
let's see what comes in this the fucking
box alright folks so here we have it
here's the boxes the way it came from
the UPS folks fractal audio systems XFX

songs from the old days pop it open and

windows and end caps pop out the other
end cap inside of here we've got the tax
effects to pre-emptive it's processor

tell you how to program it and do all
that stuff
one thing cool is you can actually
program this through the unit or you can
program it on your computer that's
really cool here we got the power plug

mice that run real quick and make it
work then let's get to the heart of
matter some more sound effects whoo and

off switch you can see that it's going
to take a to our use in a rack space
moving around show you guys the back and
all the different connections that they
have there a lot of different stuff here
digital s/pdif USB this thing's actually
going to connect up to the computer
through the USB which is amazing since

time you're able to use the USB and you
don't have to use a firewire connection
