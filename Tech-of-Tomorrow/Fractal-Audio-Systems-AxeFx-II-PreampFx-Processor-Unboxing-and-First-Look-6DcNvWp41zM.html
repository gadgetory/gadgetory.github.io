me Elric here over the tech demorrow
youtube channel now some of you guys
know some of you might not know lot of
you guys who go over to motherboards
that are here the benchmark song well
that's actually my band pane cylinder
and now I've kind of broken off I've
been doing a lot of solo music well that
said you guys might not know it but I
have a recording studio here at the
house as well and we've been having a
lot of trouble with the electricity with
using regular amps and my camp speakers
we're just going to damn buzz and it has
been working out at all so we got
together and we actually said let's just
make a purchase to some that we can
actually use that's really awesome
so we went and we checked out the
fractal audio systems this is their axe
FX - I'm gonna do the unboxing today
this is actually a trippy product you
plug your guitar in here and you can get
all these radical effects and sounds
just like you actually had a real live
amp this one's supposed to be
professional quality and hopefully it'll
work for us in the studio that said
let's see what comes in this the
box alright folks so here we have it
here's the boxes the way it came from
the UPS folks fractal audio systems XFX
- preamp FX processor made in the US of
A like usual I got my trusty knife I'm
gonna flip that bad boy out
make it insertion right here on the top
like a little surgeon like a surgeon
cutting for the very first time like a
surgeon
oh that's right it'll it'll get old
songs from the old days pop it open and
wow we've got the Box ception with the
box
lovely inside of the box let me try to
remove the box out of the box alright so
here I'm gonna go ahead and take this
out of the box boy just pull this up
like this
probably gonna grab her like this it's
not coming up it's actually really heavy
smack anything let's get it out of here
at least you know it's going to come
nice and secure and double wall box
sound effects flip it over got another
little thing here little piece of tape
oh that's gonna be some good sound
effects huh
pop the top right off the bat will
spinning it around you can see the units
all nice and here and stored pop-up
windows and end caps pop out the other
end cap inside of here we've got the tax
effects to pre-emptive it's processor
this is the owner's manual this is gonna
tell you how to program it and do all
that stuff
one thing cool is you can actually
program this through the unit or you can
program it on your computer that's
really cool here we got the power plug
gonna need that unless you got little
mice that run real quick and make it
work then let's get to the heart of
matter some more sound effects whoo and
let's get to the matter at hand here
this is the front of the unit
you can see all the controls everything
are simply laid out here in front simple
instrument Jack there headphones here
window here this is where you're gonna
be able to see all the different things
you're programming into it you're on an
off switch you can see that it's going
to take a to our use in a rack space
moving around show you guys the back and
all the different connections that they
have there a lot of different stuff here
digital s/pdif USB this thing's actually
going to connect up to the computer
through the USB which is amazing since
you're not using multi instruments at a
time you're able to use the USB and you
don't have to use a firewire connection
to still get awesome stuff so this is it
everybody man I mean this is it and also
if you guys don't know it you guys can
check out my music channel Elric Ferriss
music where my song America
out and available on iTunes and all
around the net so that's it folks

move it in the studio we'll show you a
little bit of how it sounds in our next
single thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
