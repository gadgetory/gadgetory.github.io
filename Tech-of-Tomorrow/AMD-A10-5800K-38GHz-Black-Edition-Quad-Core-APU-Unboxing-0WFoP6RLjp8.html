welcome back to the ticket tomorrow
YouTube channel what are we doing here
today other than rocking out well today
we're gonna be looking at the AMD that's
right this is their new a 1050 800 K
Black Edition now this bad boys coming
to market at 3.8 gigahertz has 4.2
gigahertz and it's maximum turbo boost
mode 4 megabytes of cache all in all
it's a pretty good thing now the APU is
the accelerated processing unit unit has
the graphics built inside of it and in
some ways this is where AMD's actually
winning the game if you had just
compared the Intel I gave you the 4000
to this the AMD one does a little bit
better that's right so in this respect
a.m. defender doing good by the way some
people out there say that I don't like
AMD I'd really like to know where you
guys get that from I just don't get a
lot of support from AMD I get all the
video cards have you guys ever seen me
beat up an AMD video card waiting
waiting that's right you have it because
I don't do it because I like their cards
I just don't get their CPU much
this one I got donated by my friend you
know that's right my friend Jerry kicked
this thing down for me so I could have
it to bring you guys for review so
that's what I'm doing right now I'm
gonna bring you the unboxing and first
look we'll see what comes this nifty
little box back here and then I'm gonna
go ahead and throw it on a couple
different motherboards I've got one from
biostar one from a soos hopefully I'll
get a few more and in fact I think I
just got one in from ECS so for right
now let's pop over the table though and
let's unbox this new 5800 Cape Black
Edition 5 folks say here we go on the
table you guys might win a while the
knives they're facing me eight ten
fifteen hundred Kate's because it's
cutting edge technology no no I'm just
kidding we just thought it'd look kind
of cool so anyways here it is 810 5,800
K four point two megahertz Mac's turbo
unlocked quad-core processor the Black
Edition you guys can see it's the a
series down the bottom the Box kind of
hard to see flip it around once
the back you just see it says AMD
a-series all right over here we have the
AMD dual graphics you can see the APU
itself inside there and you can see
here's all the series the a-10 the a8
the a six eight ten being the top of the
line and the 5800 K unlocked version
that we're looking at happens to be the
top dog in this thing so let's flip the
round
I think thinks about it right here you
guys might want to see this a 1050 200k
4.2 maximum turbos 4 megabytes of cache
black edition socket FM to AMD 85 X
chips got a knife nice and handy banging
this bad boy out
so kaboom - blam drop the bat
you've got the heatsink and fan
now obviously you guys know this thing's
gonna run very very quiet it's not big
time on power it secured towards you
know probably things like this is
probably be like a really ultimate
laptop CPU actually it may get really
nice so you can see everything's on
there you've got your thermal paste
already on there from you put it on
there you don't put any additional on
there make sure to take note some people
might put some on there to be too much
so here's a clips one for each side so
basically this thing you're going to
clip it on one side clip it on the other
and KaBlam you it goes on here is your
power connection for going on to the
motherboard
alright out of the way then next up
you've got some paperwork Advanced Micro
Devices and II processor just some
literature nothing here alright hitches
basically here right here it's going to
show you about the socket and it gives
you some warnings that type of stuff
you've never done this before make sure
you read up on it before you do all
right so now we're gonna get to thought
of the matter here we see a little
sticker the a series AMD
and inside the plastic package you can
see the APU alright folks thanks for
watching
next up the unboxing of the a 85 w by
the people at Biostar this is their high
