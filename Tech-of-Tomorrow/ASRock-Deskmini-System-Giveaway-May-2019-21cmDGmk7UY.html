to start off the week then a giveaway
right I mean come on what can be better
than getting something I mean come on
free is free right although I do
remember and this crazy movie with
little soldier guys that they were
saying freedom it ain't free what movie
is that let's see if you guys know
because it was one heck of a funny movie
that's right very funny movie and if you
can tell me what movie that is the first
one who tells you what move that is
we'll get a free game coat so if you're
the first person down there and you tell
me what movie I'm talking about well
then you will get a free game coat so
check this out what's this all about all
right well if you guys follow the
channel a couple of weeks back we did
this video on this little desk mini
system this is a little little system
that's from asrock now the system comes
bare-bones but we've put a 2400 G inside
of this it's an APU from AMD it's a
really nice ap we've got 16 gigabytes of
RAM we actually have an m2 450 gigabyte
hard drive in here so this thing's
actually very fast and so if you're
looking for a computer that's for like
media streaming or just watching TV in
the living room or doing cool stuff like
that this little box will definitely do
that for you and all together all the
parts in this particular box are about
$500 so it's not like a little junky
thing it's actually very small it's no
bigger really than my hand it's like my
hand time just a few of my hands but
it's really no bigger than my hand and
so if you really want to know more about
this particular system um real quick
we'll have a link down below go click on
it you can see the full video about the
system and what it's all about and maybe
that'll entice you more to like enter
this contest you'll be like hmm that's
actually a very interesting thing I know
the next question that's on your mind is
you're going to go calorically you're
talking about a giveaway but like I live
in Timbuk frakkin - ok even if you live
in Timbuk frackin - yep this is a
worldwide contest although I will state
for the record I am not paying anybody's
duties in their country I have no
problem shipping the unit out to you but
it's
my duty to pay the taxes of your country
or any of your duties there any stuff
like that that's out of my hands that's
on you because I don't even know what it
is and it's impossible to make keep to
keep track of but I will give the system
to anybody who lives up to Pluto if you
live past Uranus I'm just gonna have to
count you out of the contest I tried to
say it was a straight face but you guys
know what I mean so it's a worldwide
giveaway now this particular system is
pretty nice it runs very very cool if
you guys are playing games that are just
like the top down RPG type games you're
good to go this will actually play all
those games and it'll play them at above
like almost 40 frames per second and
everything after you think that you're
gonna play the latest first-person
shooter and triple-a titles on these
things then no you're probably not going
to do that and you're not going to be
getting it at 4k either although if you
want to watch a movie or something like
that you'll be good to go because the
onboard graphics for this will do that
no problem you'll be able to hook up a
free sync monitor if you want to get all
that technology and it's very small it's
very economical and just overall if
you're looking for something like this
this is an easy contest to get into so
you're asking me okay Erik we've already
gone over what it is alright get past
that and then your blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blahs I know but so
here's all you got to do it's simplistic
I would ask that you would like this
video I would ask to leave a comment
down below and that you sub the channel
now once again I must say people have
asked me to punch time so dude how do
you know we even subbed the channel or
it's really easy all I have to do is go
over look at your channel and look at
your subscriptions that says your sub to
the channel so you know if you're not
gonna sub the channel then don't think
you're gonna be in the contest so leave
a comment down below like the video
makes your subbed and then I will
announce the winner for this next Monday
so every Monday I'm gonna start having a
new type of contest going on so on
Fridays we're gonna have game giveaways
on Mondays we're gonna have a different
type of giveaway and then on Thursday
I'm gonna try to do as many throwback
Thursday and do as much retro videos as
possible because a lot of people seem to
really think it was cool so that's what
we're gonna do so there you have it you
want a chance to win this awesome little
mini cube but you could
we used to make a lot of different
things as well I was planning on doing a
bunch of modification and building into
some of their system but to Anthony he
just got himself a new job and like
we're kind of on a height as I'm
building custom systems for a little
while while he adjusts to that new
positions so I figured well why not give
it to the fans so there you have it
it's Monday thanks for watching Tekken
tomorrow hey you guys know what to do
I'd really appreciate if you sub the
channel no matter what and I'd
appreciate if you do sub the channel
that you at least stayed sub the channel
for six months and give us time to give
you different types of videos and see
what things are about so if you want to
win this you know what to do look next
Monday back in the channel well we'll
announce the winner of this and like I
said it's worldwide you've been told
what to do so hey go for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
