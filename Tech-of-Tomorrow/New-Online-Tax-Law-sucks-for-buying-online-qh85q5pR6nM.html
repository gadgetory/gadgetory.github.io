greed ruins everything now if you're
like me chances are that you do a lot of
your ordering online in this particular
video I'll say right now only applies to
people in the USA so if you're from
another country or something else
there's really no reason to watch this
video unless you just want to be
entertained and watch me rant about this
particular subject because this subject
is definitely only for my fans here in
the United States because this is a
matter that's here in the United States
and it's part of our economy and it's
just greed greed greed greed greed now
like I said before lots of us you me
order stuff online and the cool thing
about this for years and years and years
it's been this way is that if you
ordered something from out of state you
did not have to pay sales tax you could
order your thousand dollar item from New
York get it here to California and just
pay your thousand dollars it was awesome
we've all done it and now things have
completely changed now if you happen to
live in Oregon or Nevada where there's
absolutely no state tax whatsoever are
you good to go bro you don't even need
to watch anymore go chill have a beer
man you know party down smoke them if
you got them but if you live anywhere
else everything that you order online
now is subject to the sales tax of your
particular state now I live in
California California is definitely the
most greediest state of all is there
maybe Washington DC because let's just
face it there's lots of money here so
there's lots of greed here and with that
greed California just kept complaining
and complaining and complaining to the
federal government that oh these people
aren't giving us our cut of our tax I
mean I guess some were in the legal
schmegle of it all with some other you
know BS it's going on apparently maybe
these me states were supposed to be
paying sales tax but it's never been
something that's ever been enforced
until now and I really got shocked
because the other day I went to go place
an order online to replace something
that I got rid of I had an instrument I
sold it
actually Jesus the Cameron he got it so
I got I got him him a bass and I got me
a different bass and when I ordered it I
noticed that it had this giant sales tax
attached to it and so I called him up on
a mic hey what is this I just like I've
ordered from you and like I've never
paid this before what the frak is going
on here man and they're like oh yeah
check this out there's this new law now
this particular law on some states that
passed on January 1st I guess for
California it passed on April 1st of the
April Fool's joke is on us ah you're not
funny California but as of that we're
paying it so whoo depending on where you
live in California you can be paying all
the way up to 11% of sales tax that's
right it's a lot of money so if you pay
$1,000 you're gonna be paying another
111 dollars on top of that you know
which just sucks because a lot of times
you really doesn't want to be taxed I
mean I heard something on eBay or
something I'm just expecting to get my
item but now there's really no way to
order anything online without paying
state sales tax and that just sucks I
mean I feel like it's taxation without
representation cuz I'll tell you what
they took my tax do I have any idea
where that money's going
I mean honestly do any of us though we
have no idea where money's going it
honestly could be going to someone's
grandma living in a mansion you know it
in Timbuktu just chilling and she's got
a 6-pack of the best beer and then she's
got her own little head shop even you
know I mean granny's cool you know I'm
saying like we don't know any word that
our money's going it's just taking our
money and saying hey we've created a new
tax law so greed once again has
destroyed what was a cool thing you used
to be able to go online buy your stuff
not even have to worry about that silly
sales tax almost all the time at least I
did when I bought an eBay I would look
around and look for somebody who wasn't
in California if it was in Arizona and
it was a dollar cheaper and I just had
to wait a day longer I was like hey for
sure cuz why who wants to pay that
stupid tails sales tax but now we are
all doomed and screwed and greed is once
again Bennis over like we they little
you know I'm saying and now we're all
gonna be paying sales tax I'm pissed
I would really like to build tell you
how much I really feel but now here on
YouTube everything has to be g-rated or
I can get a flag or they will give me
any answer they just won't give me any
love at all and try to put me out of
business so I have to keep everything
like it's Disneyland or we get wine or
saying oh can you not please out it'd be
more family-oriented you said something
believe it or not the other day when I
said jerk off when I was talking about
the video I had somebody complain that I
said that and say oh you're giving adult
content in front of my children
jerking off a bolt off of something they
yeah whatever you guys know what I mean
anyways that's what it is I'll have a
link down below or you guys can check
this app you know I'm talking about
because actually the Supreme Court of
Justice or whatever the you know the
bigwigs back there you know in DC who
run our lives a lot us having anything
to do with the damn thing have now said
that yes we all must pay the state tax
of our state
so no more saving money ordering online
you must go down your local 7-eleven
and if you don't think that this is
hurting online businesses oh you would
be wrong be as I've talked to lots of
places like AMS Sweetwater and they've
all said that this particular thing has
caused a shift in business now these
guys have great payment programs and so
do other places out there the places
that have these great payment programs
this probably won't affect them as much
but when you're just straight up paying
your cash and you got to pay that tax
yeah I don't know I liked it when I
didn't have to pay it I'm sure you did
as well I'm Elric peace out we'll see
you guys back here in the channel man if
you want to sub you can do it if not hey
it's not the end of the world but I'd
love to see you back here again peace
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
