once again in the channel it's me buddy
the dog the mascot here at Tech of
tomorrow
now you guys all know on launch day of
the 290x we hooked up with my homie
linus who bought us an awesome video of
that new card but a lot of things that
actually probably weren't really
specified is how loud this card actually
runs with its fans going now we did this
in three different stages 25 50 and 75
percent and this thing was getting up to
93 degrees Celsius which is basically
hot enough to no burn a hole through the
moon so with that said though let's jump
in now and let's actually see the noise
levels of this new brand-new 290x and
the people over at AMD I think you're
going to be a bit surprised so first off
we see it at 25% me not too bad right
yes good listen that it's not going to
drive you too mad right not too bonkers
but now let's kick it up a notch to 50%
okay even buddies reaction I was pretty
funny here as well you see them buddies
all wow that kicked cloud but now let's
go all the way up to 75%
holy jesus it sounds like a jet plane
that is escape from the airport is
trying to crash-land into the yard next
you I mean this thing is amazingly loud
so for your AMD fans out there I know
you guys are loving this card in the
price point and everything but this card
is honestly very very hot and very very
loud there's no room really whatsoever
with this card for any type of
overclocking not really at all with the
way this card is running right now you
overclock this thing at all you're
probably going to be burning up your
card or it's just going to perform very
badly
one thing taken consideration and this
is not trying to beat AMD up whatsoever
so you guys know that the hotter that
the card gets the more the performance
degrades so if the cards running for
long periods of time you're going to see
performance degradation if the card is
overheating so if you try to stick this
thing in like a little small case or
something that has no airflow this card
is probably going to overheat on you now
currently we're right in the middle of
testing this card so we're going to have
all those results for you guys and we
test the card at just at standard
performance levels we didn't overclock
it whatsoever we did not want to fry our
buddies card that we borrowed it from
now when aftermarket people come and
they make their own cooling solution
this is actually going to improve the
thermal on it quite a bit but there's
only really so much you can do with a
thermal design if your GPU is running so
hot that it's having trouble at all
times being kept cool you're really
going to have to step this stuff up with
a water cooler we're hoping that people
like Gabe from Swift tech and others
will go ahead and make a cooler for this
when we get our car we can slap a water
cooler on it and then see the real
performance benefits of it at this point
from what we're seeing the 290x is an
awesome card but the reference cards and
everything are just running way too hot
way too loud I'm thinking slap water
cooler on it it's going to be a much
better card but we'll get there soon so
one last thing before I bounce out of
here and this pretty much pertains to my
AMD fans out there are you guys willing
to sacrifice you know noise and heat in
order to be able to beat
videocard with the price and all that at
the end of the day is a 290x like your
guys's total cup of tea you guys like
hey screw it I don't care about the
noise I don't care about the heat all I
care about is that it beats the nvidia
card let me hear what you guys have to
say and you guys all know that nvidia
has now announced their 7 ATI card will
be coming out and we'll have that for
you guys shortly as well because hey
like Sherlock Holmes said the game is
afoot hope you guys like this video if
so you guys know what to do sub buttons
down there as well
peace out taking you up with buddy we're
going to go have some doggy treats see
ya
