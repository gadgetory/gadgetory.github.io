have the best pc mods you've ever seen
today's video is made possible by Hulu
Plus for a free extended two-week trial
period head over to Hulu Plus com /t ot
so check this folks hopefully this is
the first of what will turn into many
other videos just like this if you guys
like this type of video and you guys
want us to do more
you guys can show us by clearly going
insane on that like button now our main
idea for this - take it and let it
evolve is that eventually we can
actually go to the people that are doing
all these mods visit with them and film
their system in person for now as we get
the ball roll and get those wheels just
moving we're going to show you five of
the coolest that we were able to find on
the web first up damnation by Jacob
Holden Brant now this baby dates all the
way back to 2009 I was inspired by the
Western inspired shooter from back in
the day damnation we're going back in
time for the specs and it featured an
Intel Core i7 965 CPU 12 gigs of ddr3
RAM hmm we're still on ddr3 been a long
time annex 37 motherboard a dual Radeon
4870 in crossfire mode and a one
terabyte hard drive now you guys can see
this thing in my is is totally like
steampunk I think it's totally badass
all that copper and what I think of it
it just totally reminds me of steampunk
stuff what do you guys think leave a
comment below next up is the Iron Man
helmet mod now this thing's made by
Franco's war Boy martinelli and it's
basically well obviously Iron Man's head
and for me one thing I've always
wondered about now when Iron Man's
inside of that suit doesn't he get
really sweaty balls just saying now this
beauty was created to pay tribute to
Iron Man no I'm not talking about the
Black Sabbath song this thing was built
from scratch and made entirely by hand
which I have to say is pretty damn
impressive
including the helmet the base was
created by just an old ATX pc case
Franco had lying around by the end of
the project you'd have never guessed
that's what it was we couldn't dig up
too much as far as the specs go or parts
goes but regardless this is one amazing
look
PC what I really like about this thing
though I have to say is the attention to
detail Jarvis on the side all the cool
elements about it the helmet on top and
think about this this guy made this
thing entirely by scratch by hand that
itself is a thumbs up in my eyes now
this next one is for the despicable Me
fans out there and no I'm not gonna sing
the happy song alright maybe just a
little well I'm happy alright Shh
well anyways check this out this guy
named Ronnie mods has created this total
minion PC mod now this thing is totally
cool I don't know about you guys
me myself I can always use an extra
minion now this little slave to the
system was made up a Coolermaster cosmos
- and it's a totally fully functioning
minion PC the attention to detail from
the paint job to the eye and goggle to
the teeth to the real Jean cloth are
incredible now this little minion can
seriously tear up some games - featuring
an Intel Core i5 46 70k MSI z87 empower
Mac's motherboard MSI r9 270x Hawke
video card eight gigabytes of Kingston
HyperX 24 hundred megahertz RAM and a
Kingston HyperX 3k 120 gigabyte SSD for
those folks were interested in the
complete parts list I'll have those down
below the like button so make sure you
check that out next up life of prodigy
this sweet looking little PC was modded
by Frost mod and is based off the
BitFenix prodigy case it features a
beautiful Asus Republic of gamers logo
on the front and two amazing looking hot
rutted side panels that flap out like
wings it also features an ASUS Maximus 6
impact motherboard Asus GTX 670 mini an
Intel i5 46 70 K Crucial Ballistix elite
memory and a Kingston HyperX 3k 120
gigabyte SSD it seems like all the
modders are really diggin on Kingston
now this mod is obviously for those
people who like their systems very
compact not really a lot you can do on
something that small but this guy still
took the effort and the time to make
something cool the life of
gee now next up is the green man Alicia
now I know the green man Alicia because
growing up that was on my favorite Judas
Priest song you know now yo the green
man Alicia with the two-prong crown
while my driving is up who are you
bringing is down now this bad boy was
modded by mr. Hanover fist now I don't
know if any of you guys remember the
movie heavy metal but Hanover fist was
one of the characters in the movie he
was this guy who was working for this
crazy general guy who was basically kind
of a total prick and basically as soon
as the guy got his money he changed
leave a comment down below if you
remember the movie and tell me what
happened the Green Man Alicia was made
of a fractal design arc mini art
suitcase that features quite possibly
one of the most amazing paint jobs PC
modding has ever seen the radiator fan
and pumps are absolutely jaw-dropping
I'm having a Jim Carrey from the mask
moment it's rocking gigabytes g1 sniper
5 motherboard and Intel i7 4770k 2 EVGA
GTX 770 s and sli mode a thousand watt
EVGA g2 power supply and 16 gigabytes of
g.skill sniper 21 33 megahertz memory
and lambtron cooling I just have to say
that the build logs and everything about
this are like off the table type of
this guy is like a moderate who takes
stuff beyond the norm I gotta say hand
over fist
you get thumbs up Kentucky tomorrow so
alright folks I hope that you guys had
as much fun watching this video as we
did filming and if you did the way to
show us is by going completely apeshit
on that like but can we get 10k and legs
let's see if we can by the way I want to
give a special shout out to Hulu Plus
for making today's video possible
I know that most of you folks out there
know what cool is
but Hulu Plus is basically like taking a
plain old boring white PC case and
painting that bad boy to a custom level
and I don't know if you guys have heard
this or not but they've recently inked
that an awesome deal to show every
episode of South Park and this also
includes all the new episodes which is
just like sprinkles on the icing Hulu
Plus worked on your computer Smart TV
Roku Apple TV Xbox pretty much any
streaming device you already own and
check this out say it's one of those
moments when you've got you know number
two you can even watch it in the John

days but for you TECA tomorrow fans its
extended to 14 days that's 14 days of
free Hulu Plus for you to check out and
