Tech fans Elric a tech of tomorrow with
Nick from Asus and we got a lot of
really killer stuff to show you guys at
this year's CES 2014 including some
concept stuff that may not come to
market but a Zeus wants you to know that
it's very possible so with that said
let's hand the microphone over to Nick
and let's hear what Asus has it this
year's CES so Nick right here behind us
we have a concept thing right yeah so
this is more of a concept demonstration
that we're showing we have a z87 deluxe
quad board which has two Thunderbolt 2
ports on the back of the board and here
we're taking two of our radar PCI
Express SSD cards or basically raiding
them together over Thunderbolt and then
thunder bolting it back to the
motherboard itself and what I like the
fastest speeds you guys have actually
seen on this thus far this demo that
we're showing here is getting you can
see over a thousand megabytes a second
in read and write is getting a little
bit under a thousand so that means you
could transfer your your your games
everything very quickly right on in a
snap so this is something that will be
possible maybe it will see some vendors
implement some some external hard drives
in this fashion there's a lot of
possible with Thunderbolt 2 so how very
I mean even though right now this is a
concept how very feasible is it that
this can actually hit the market though
as a product if someone wants to jump on
and grasp it I think all the tools are
there so it's just a matter of someone
thinking that the markets out there and
making it right right on well you guys
out there if you're a manufacturer or
something you guys see these guys have a
new concept item here which is faster
than fast now I know there'll be some
stuff coming out with ng FF technology
that may be a bit faster but for those
looking for this type of technology it's
going to be breaking the barrier and
then standing on the Thunderbolt 2 ends
if we shift over here to the next
product
whoever Thunderbolt 2 PCI Express cards
so it's even a nice glass cabinet to
show how beautiful it is for some some
of you may have seen the first one that
we had shown before that wasn't on it
did not end up being certified did not
end up being sold this one has already
certified it will be compatible with a
list of a see some other boards that
you'll be able to pull up serum right on
so that means you guys are gonna be able
to actually get this product right
you'll be able to add thunderbolt to
functionality to your existing HD
support and oh this will come late
February early March yeah so this is
awesome stuff I mean when this hits the
market I think a lot of people are going
to jump on this everybody's always
looking for the fast of the fast and
with Thunderbolt flexibility I think
everybody's gonna be jumping on it so
what else we got here I see we've got
stuff run all the way down the table
this is this is another thing that you
will see in the future you will not
necessarily see on this board here were
showing off SATA Express functionality
so we have site Express implemented um
you might you might be springing demos
using this you see the SATA Express
ports here in the bottom right corner
this we expect to see on future chipset
series motherboards but can I get it
with like a little man on the end here
so I can put it in my computer case
having a little flop around a little
like a little funny head on my dashboard
you gotta let people know where the set
Express is all right God dog it alright
then
and over here I see you guys have your
latest motherboard for the AMD platform
so these are gonna be coming out soon
this is our 888 X - Pro and this one's
actually currently selling right yes
alright so folks if you guys are
interested in this motherboard for you
folks out there who love the red and
black and it'll loving the a Zeus well
here you go alright folks so those were
just a few of the things we have here at
the Asus booth stay tuned because we got
a lot of things happened with video
cards including the society 2 station</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
