three two one oh he scores
today's video is made possible by
audible.com audible.com has over 150,000
downloadable titles across all different
types of genres for your free book head
over to audible.com forward slash
tomorrow hey tech fans welcome back
detective tomorrow we're Hey we knew the
trash can jokes were coming so we made
one for you and nope this is not r2d2
here back behind me this is the late
2013 Mac Pro you guys all call it the
trash can Mac and I've got it right here
behind me
now this thing is incredibly incredibly
small nine point nine inches tall six
point six inches in circumference and
only eleven pounds in weight now this
thing comes with a bunch of different
configurations you can start out with
quad core 6 cores all the way up to 8
cores all the way to 12 cores this thing
is just insane the one that we got is a
$4,000 model now this model comes with
the six core 3.5 gigahertz CPU that has
a turbo boost up to 3.9 gigahertz 16
gigabytes of 1866 memory this is the ECC
type and it also comes with 256
gigabytes of a built on PCI SSD now the
big thing about this though is the
expand ability now you guys all know
that the PCI DisplayPort is all
configured in that Thunderbolt
technology you can hook up 4 that's
right for 4k monitors and 6 different
Thunderbolt devices in a daisy-chain
that's the reason why all the storage
and everything is not inside this
computer this computer is made to use
that technology which means you could
hook up you know as many different
things as you want all through a daisy
chain you can set up a huge rate system
like the type that Pegasus uses you can
hook up monitors just all kinds of
things through this technology now I
know a lot of people are going to talk a
bunch of crap and say on a crappy crappy
crappy but this is actually one of the
very first Mac's that's ever come out
that is totally upgradable you can
change out the memory you can change out
the SSD and you can even change out the
CPU that's right the CPU when have you
ever seen a Mac before that you could
change the CPU edge it's not happening
so you can tell the people over at Apple
are really trying to get your attention
by saying hey we have this machine
already in itself it does a lot of kick
ass
but if you want to expand it you can go
even further now I know the people out
there hate Mac and go oh man screw that
thing 4,000 bucks but hey there's a
market for this already people have
bought a bunch of these they were sold
out almost instantly I don't even think
there's any more coming into stock I
think until like February of this year
so I mean those people were able to get
their hands on it we're very lucky and I
was able to get my hands on one too
that's pretty cool right here you got a
little sliding thing and you can
actually slide the entire top off now I
want you guys to think clearly superhero
x-men Who am I come on man this thing
looks almost exactly like Magneto's
helmet didn't think about that too right
now so you know alright I got too fat of
a head it won't fit me but hey maybe
some skinny fell you can stick us on
your head you can have the magneto look
so we'll get that out the way actually
very well-made I gotta say though even
jokingly it actually feels though like
trash can and I'm just saying it really
does it's kind of funny but it's also
very unique now here's the unit itself
this thing has 2d 500 video cards in it
these are the fire pro cards that are
made by AMD these things are totally
geared towards doing high-end stuff each
one has three gigabytes of RAM through
an 84 bit memory bus this thing's built
to kick ass now check it out
I'm not going to totally disassemble the
machine for you guys today this is
pretty much just a first look but I want
you guys to see everything here is the
memory very very easily accessible very
easy to change out you guys can see that
very simple all the way around the unit
it's geared to be ergonomic geared to be
small and geared to be upgradable now
you guys can see I want the tamron to
shoot back over here look at this
computer back here behind me this is my
Falcon Northwest gaming machine okay now
look at this thing next to my Falcon
Northwest gaming machine okay now I know
a lot of people just want to say hey
Kapil but I got to say this man I'm
really not there with this I know it's
pricey and right now I can't afford it I
look at and I've met I'm a little bit
jealous I don't know the catch that
right now but if I had the cash I would
get one because it's very interesting
and it's very very small and I know
it actually runs cool I'm not even
 you it doesn't get all
SuperDuper hot it's not overheating it's
not you turn it on you're like oh my god
this thing's hot Apple really did a
really nice job in their design of this
you guys can see all the connectivity
and the power right there on that back
panel on the bottom just your standard
stuff thing says the Mac Pro and I'll be
bringing you guys some benchmarks and
some other stuff of this as we go along
but I thought for some people out there
you might just want to see this because
I know that that not many of them would
come out some tech channels out there
have these already and they've been
showing them off I was lucky to be able
to borrow one for my friends at TLD now
before I bounce out of here I just want
to give a special shout-out and thanks
to audible.com for helping us bring this
video to you guys you guys if you guys
paid into the channel before I download
this book called Ender's Game and when I
was in Vegas I got time to actually
finish this thing and I will say the
movie was actually pretty close to the
book there were some things that were
missing but I was actually surprised
because I heard the book watch the movie
and I was like you know there's not
really that much of a difference you
know when I watched Hunger Games I read
the book I was like damn son they left a
lot of stuff out but in Ender's Game
it stuck pretty much and I thought the
movie was actually pretty decent so if
you guys out there person who travels
around a lot you don't have time to like
read a book but you still like to get in
that information check out audible.com
cuz right now man you get a free book no
charge whatsoever audible.com forward
slash tomorrow you guys can get a book
absolutely free try it out maybe you'll
like it I know I do
I'm Miller Kim before you guys leave all
the hate comments down below I want you
to take one thing into consideration
your brain this is a totally workstation
level computer this isn't some i7 4770k
gaming machine with some standard 680
780 video card not that at all like I
said before man
2d 500s in this thing this thing is
going to be an editing monster so before
you go crazy think about these things
because if you're a person who uses
their computer to make money the better
your computer the more your time
translates into dollars thanks for
watching teka tomorrow we'll see you
guys back here for more
proaction real soon
and be
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
