you're looking for a 280 or 360 mm meter
radiator check out the corsair hydro pro
RGB liquid coolers let's get up close
and personal mother
now let's do it all person personal I'll
whip you boys oh yeah
anybody left oh one guy left hard let's
get rid of this guy all right
oh man all right I got a say playing
doom never really gets old I could play
this forever and a day now a lot of
people you live in a dorm or you live
with parents who don't like you playing
games they pretty much you know just
like to see you not hear you well these
headphones are under 50 bucks and they
absolutely are really cool for the price
range there's not a whole lot to them
they're pretty straightforward but they
have 53 millimeter drivers they have
removable ear caps so if depending on
the type of you know ears that you like
and depending on the comfort level you
like you can change them out they come
with these actually in the box they're
straight in they plug in there's no USB
no nothing like that so you can plug it
directly into your sound card removable
microphone and an adjustable ear band
now the ear band is kind of tribute away
to just because you just move it up and
down nothing else you have to do it just
goes up and down not many other
adjustments beyond that now the headband
on the top it's actually pretty damn
durable like you notice the guys to see
me do videos before I twist them all
around talking about flexible these are
not like that at all these are really
really solid and what I like about that
is because you see what they're doing
they're forcing to go so when you put
the headphones on your head they really
do have a really nice tight grip on them
and you once you're in game you really
cannot hear external noise so if someone
comes to your door and says hey you
you barely you're gonna be able to hear
them especially if you're in the game
you're gonna have to be yelling at you
comfort level for hours on end I know is
something that's very very much a
concern these you can wear for hours on
end they do not make you feel like
you've got something on your head
they're not bulky I actually like these
big thick thick cushions but if you want
to change them out you guys can see it's
very easy to do you simply just read
move this set and then simply put on the
other set and you're up and going
depending on what you're doing now
I'm not exactly sure why they give you
two different types of these type of ear
pens I mean these are okay but why would
you want to get rid of the comfort level
these I mean these are SuperDuper soft
the material that they're made of it did
it honestly it's just like SuperDuper
soft on your ears and around your ears
so you're not going to worry about any
discomfort there whatsoever these that
kind of feel are redundant
I don't know they given to you what
exactly the use is for I'm not exactly
sure maybe somebody would prefer to have
ones like these maybe they don't want
you know to have their their ear that
much cushion or they want to be able to
hear you know incoming sound a little
bit easier that might be why they're
doing it sound wise honestly you could
put this pair in or you could get a pair
that's probably $200 of gaming
headphones it as far as the sound goes I
do not believe you're going to hear any
difference now
one thing about these being under fifty
dollars they're very basic there's no
simulated 5.1 no simulated 7.1 and like
my son like he swears by 7.1 headphones
if they're not 7.1 you know gaming
headphones he PI you know is like
looking at you like you're a peasant you
know but I don't really feel that way
7.1 5.1 I think that stuff's really cool
for movies and stuff but you know unless
you're gonna be having something like
using EAX type stuff and being able to
hear every sound coming around you just
having standard two speakers inside your
headphones is perfect I don't really
feel that you need that whatsoever
the microphone at the very end of the
video I'll talk to the microphone and do
the conclusion and you guys can hear the
microphone sounds but there's absolutely
no problem with it whatsoever it's very
very clear I really think the big point
though about these phantom headphones if
I didn't say the name yet the funtom
like the funtom of the opera no no but
it's a phantom phantom funtom well you
know what I'm saying that's the name
it's kind of a weird name but under $50
hard to get probably a set of headphones
for gaming that sounds this good I mean
you can turn your games all the way up
you can blast the stuff in it yeah
there's not going to be any type of
response inside here that's gonna cause
your headphones to rattle or or like if
it gets to bass you're not gonna defend
there anything like that whatsoever
they're made to be a work within the
volume standards of today's you know
music also few folks after wearing how
do they sound with music well here real
quick let's check out a clip of what
music sounds like threes I know it's not
going to be the exact representation
because you know your speakers and
whatever you're listening to now we're
going to have some you know effect on
the colouring of the sound but you can
still get a general idea of what it
sounds like
[Laughter]
earlier I told you guys about the 53
millimetre driver but these drivers are
a little bit different than your average
headphone they're actually graphene
diaphragm drivers and what that
translates to the layman is that means
that the actual sound sine wave is
coming through your headphones is much
cleaner than a standard driver another
nice feature about these phantom
headphones is they actually feature
what's called a dual chamber system so
not only do you have the driver inside
of there you also have two different
chambers around the driver to give it
even bigger ambient sound and this also
helps to separate the bass signal from
the treble signal alright folks so there
you guys have it those bottom headphones
under $50 solid sound inside honestly
these 53 millimeter drivers their dual
chamber design whether it's listening to
music or playing games you guys can tell
if the sound inside of me if you
actually had a pair in your head you
would be very happy with the sound
quality musics not even an audiophile
level whatsoever but it still sounds
really good so if you want to have a
general set of headphones that you can
plug into pretty much any 3.5 millimeter
device and use you'd be good to go and
these other headphones these are just
actually the ear cups excuse me are just
to make them lighter and stuff so if
you're out like maybe you want to like
run with them or use them somewhere else
these would be okay for that but I must
emphasize I know you guys always like to
hear somebody beat up a product what can
I beat up though for 50 bucks
I mean gaming headphones that I see
usually although out that sometimes they
have 5.1 and 7.1 you might want to say
that's a Campea these headphones they
suck you know but those headphones are
usually between 100 and 129 dollars
these are only 50 bucks
nice solid sound inside the cans the mic
works excellent as you guys can see
right now because everything with I'm
recording right now as far as the audio
goes I'm only using the mic that came
with these headphones so we'll have a
link down below if you guys want to
check them out me buddy dog Angie will
be back here on the channel for more
videos
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
