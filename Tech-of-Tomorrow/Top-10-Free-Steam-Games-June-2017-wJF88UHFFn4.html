now I know all of my fans out there love
to game most of you guys I know our
gamers as I read the comments but on the
other hand I see a lot of folks out
there don't have a lot of money to buy
these top triple-a titles but that's not
gonna stop you from gaming whatsoever
because on Steam
they have many free games that you can
immerse yourself in for hours and not
have to pay a penny so we played a bunch
of different games and I chose the top
10 that I thought were worthy for your
gaming time so with that said let's jump
in and let's check out the top 10
favorites of mine for June 2017 and
they're absolutely free so the first
game we have up folks is path of Exile
now this is an online action RPG set in
a dark fantasy world with zombies and
different dark creatures massive XII is
a game where you choose an exile who is
struggling to survive and a place called
where class and you exact your revenge
on those who wronged you so you're
basing it even with your foes I don't
know what you guys think but let me know
if you play it what you think I feel
this game is kind of conan mixed with
zombies this game is pretty fun however
it has cool combat animations it has
deep character customization you can
really customize your character you can
customize your weapons and there are
hundreds of skills with different gems
you can collect there are lots of
different missions and to control your
character it's very simple let's just
point and click with your mouse now this
game is absolutely free you guys check
it out we'll have a link down below and
this is number 10 out of the top 10 next
up is number 9 we have war thunder a
very loud title now war thunder is a
very interesting game for one thing it's
a very cross-platform
MMO you can control games and Windows
Linux Mac and PlayStation 4 if we're
into World War 2 I think you'll find
this game pretty fun because you fight
in air and land battles and you're using
the military vehicles that were used in
World War two and the Korean War period
so if you're into that type of theme
you'll be really into this game it's
player versus player and player versus
environment you get team battles and
campaign modes it has really easy
controls simple
mouse and keyboard now as far as the
weapons go it is pretty limited because
all you do is get guns and missiles but
the positive thing is the game does have
good graphics and it's pretty fun to
play and let's just face it it's free so
why not now this next game which is game
number 8 for a long time this game was
actually sold as a standalone title but
now it's free and I'm talking about EVE
Online now an EVE Online there are a lot
of different options you can choose what
you want to do Annie from warfare to
being a space pirate and there are
multiple paths and careers to choose
from now this game features a huge
massive multiplayer online environment
you can create your own character it has
easy controls Mouse point-and-click to
move just like the previous games we've
looked at and it has very excellent
graphics if you're one of those peoples
who truly likes to get their selves
totally involved in a game spend lots of
times immersing yourself into it
building your character building all
that kind of stuff
Eve online might just be for you and
like I said this game actually was a
game that was being sold as a standalone
title but now steam is brought to you
guys for free so you guys should really
check this one out because if you're
into that online thing and you like a
bunch of depth of your character this is
something you might want to seriously
check out now game number seven is a
game that's been around a long long time
this is Team Fortress 2 I think most you
guys out there and know what it is but
for those who don't let's take a quick
look at Team Fortress 2 is a totally
team-based shooter game with nine class
of characters which are kind of comical
and one thing really cool about Team
Fortress 2 is that they are constantly
upgrading the game with new game modes
Maps equipment and act so if you like a
lot of change and you like a
first-person shooter this might just be
for you
now obviously Team Fortress 2 is a
first-person shooter each class has its
own special weapons the graphics are and
they're ok there's nothing to write home
to your mom about but they're not
totally crappy easy the controls are
easy and everything's done with the
mouse and keyboard
alright tech fan so game number six is
cloud of pirates now how these guys are
going to steal clouds I just don't know
but let's check out the game now cloud
pirates was an action MMO involving
pirate air
lanes equipped with cannons and
fast-paced aerial battles you can
customize your own ship with different
weapons and there are tons of unique
ship upgrades you can pick your own
captain and navigate the skies so this
game is all about air battle there are a
variety of weapons guns and cannon it's
got really good graphics for different
game modes and once again keyboard and
mouse easy controls in truth this game
really isn't all that in-depth but if
you want to sway some time shooting some
stuff up hey cloud pirates might just be
for you put on your eye patch and get
going matey
alright Tech fans game number 5
paladin's now if you're a fan of
overwatch I really think you're going to
like this game paladin's is a team-based
shooter game that kind of feels like
overwatch there are different characters
they call champions and they each have
their own special abilities they range
from humans to goblins to elves to even
jetpack clad dragons did somebody say
dragons and the absolute coolest thing
however is you can join battles or
create your own custom ones all to your
specifications
now paladin's has good graphics not the
absolute best nor but they're still
pretty soft especially for a free game
it's a first-person shooter there are 4
attacks and special abilities it has
easy controls and once again it's all
done by the keyboard and mouse alright
folks so game number 4 fractured space
and then pretty much that of all the
free games I think this one probably has
the best graphics and it's also a lot of
fun let's check it out fractured space
uses the stunning Unreal Engine 4 that's
why it has such great graphics this
spaceship combat game looks absolutely
brilliant you captain this giant ship in
space and your main objective is to
pretty much capture mining stations for
resources so that way you can upgrade
your ship and just make it more badass
fractured space features cool graphics
in space you get a variety of weapons
and attacks you get missiles guns
gravity noobs it's done by a keyboard
mouse and you can even hyper drive
can anyone say engage next up we have
planetside 2 which is basically three
empires going to bat
let's check it out planetside 2 is
another massive multiplayer online
first-person shooter game you can
customize your character you can
customize your weapons and even your
vehicles to match your playing style the
basic strategy the game is you choose
between three warring empires as you
capture territories and defend them from
those other pesky online players
planetside 2 features four diverse
continent Maps huge maps in fact with
dozens of square kilometers of seamless
gameplay you get a huge variety of
weapons and vehicles the graph is adjust
okay but the controls are pretty easy
and there once again keyboard and mouse
based now let's check out game number
two in our top 10 Atlas reactor ah outs
reactor is actually a pretty fun game
it's a turn-based player vs. player game
where freelancers which are heroes with
different abilities fight off in
futuristic arenas and the arenas do look
pretty damn cool allas reactor features
awesome graphics a variety of different
moves each character has its own special
attack it's a strategy game which is
very addictive and it's also very easy
to control all in all if you want to
waste a lot of time and pay no money
this game is definitely worth checking
out
alright gamers so here is my number one
choice of the three games out there
because I feel that this one is just the
coolest one overall for being free and
that is warframe warframe is a game
about a race of warriors called Latino
now these are warriors of blade and gun
and you awaken from what seems like a
long sleep when this character vaak
awakens you he pretty much once you did
it's not a bad story and it does have
some pretty neat graphics for a free
game warframe is a third-person shooter
it's got lots of aliens a variety of
weapons you can use it's got gun staff
pistols throwing knives the kitchen sink
it has awesome electric attacks it has
definitely easy controls although they
have to be a bit awkward sometime but
the coolest thing about this game
however is it's lots of action lots of
fun you can waste lots of hours in here
just playing this game it's absolutely
free alright tech fans so there you have
it my pick of the top 10 free games on
Steam for the month of June and 20
17 now I know you guys out there might
have different opinions I would love to
see them down below please tell me what
your favorite free game is but the
bottom line here is folks is that all of
these games cost no money some of them
are better than others obviously and
depending on the genre of game that you
like you may be able to find they're
just like totally in love with and
they'll be others that you're just going
to be like yeah that's not my style but
at the end of the day you don't have to
pay any money for these games so that
means they're completely pretty much
stress free cash free and you can play
them and if you don't like them big deal
but if you do just think about it hours
