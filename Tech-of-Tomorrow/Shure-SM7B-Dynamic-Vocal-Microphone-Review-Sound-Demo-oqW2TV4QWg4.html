of the world it's me Elric first your DJ
here on tech of tomorrow radio we're
featuring the latest in music of every
style so that everyone is pleased we're
not only visually playing we're also
sexually appealing we're coming to you
live from Mount Baldy with 12 million
watts of power yes sir we are the number
one radio station in the world coming to
you live right now from my Baldy bedroom
I put on the serious side folks you can
see I'm talking this microphone just
like many DJ's and other people will do
today I'm taking a look at the sm7b by
sure this microphone is great for people
doing podcast great for people doing a
live broadcast and believe it or not
this microphone has been used in about
40% and that's a fair estimate of all
popular recordings ever made that's a
pretty good thing for sure okay so check
it out what comes in the box of this new
shure sm7b will you get a couple of
things you get the microphone and you
get two different pop filters get the
pop filter on top my head and you get
the pop filter that I'm talk into right
here you also get the mic clip and you
get the thing that mounts right onto
your stands that you can put your
microphone on any boom or other stand I
don't have a balanced head and therefore
the second thing has fallen off but this
microphone is very good it comes the few
great things in the box and it's ready
to rock and roll and use so far
everything that I've been doing it's
review has been done recording to the
new shure sm7b now we're going to take
it over and we're going to show you what
it sounds like through the standard
canon camera mic and show you the mast
difference there is between the two okay
so now we're using the onboard recorder
on the Canon camera you can hear there's
a major difference between this and the
shure sm7b while the shure sm7b has a
very clean tight sound when i mean by
this is that you don't hear any really
external noises you don't get any of the
background stuff and you don't sound
like you're in a cave most of time we're
using these onboard Canon or other
microphones you sound like you're in a
cave or the bunch of background noise
going on with
a clear perception of the recording
going on okay so check it out at the end
of the day will you get with the new
shure sm7b you get a microphone that has
a multitude of functionality and can be
used in a lot of different environments
if you're a DJ podcaster anybody doing
any type of Live recorded sound this
microphone works excellent also if
you're a musician like I stated before
this microphone has been used in about
40% of the popular recordings that have
been made including the most popular
album of all time Michael Jackson's
Thriller
so this microphone comes in at about
$400 at your local eat a lure retailer
you can get this at Sam Ash you can get
this at Guitar Center or various other
places it's a very good mic it's very
well built comes with just enough that
you need at the end of the day I give it
an editor's choice here on tech of
tomorrow for all of its applications and
usage value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
