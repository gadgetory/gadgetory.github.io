once again to another edition of tech of
tomorrow we've got something really
frakkin incredible going on today the
msi r9 290x lightning edition card now
this thing's pretty awesome it comes
clocked out of the box with a core of a
thousand 80 megahertz this thing's got
four gigabyte gddr5 memory this thing's
made to kill that of you guys know it as
lightning edition cards are their top of
the line cards by MSI these things are
made to be overclocked they're made to
kick-ass they're made just be in the top
of the Lian system and they're not for
the faint of the heart and they're not
for those who are faint of the wall
because this bad boy cost a whopping
eight hundred and forty dollars so
basically if you want the best of the
best and you want the ass kicker you've
got to pay for that big ass foot but
with that said let's jump in let's check
out this card and why it's an awesome
thing and why you might just want to
stick it inside of your system let's go
all right folks we're off the bat check
out this box I mean this thing's giant
shows a plane coming after you probably
you know for some of their afterburner
software the afterburner on the jet you
guys can see obviously it's the Radeon
r9 290x the Lightning Edition AMD Radeon
overclocked series graphics on the side
it says msi overclocked series no limits
no limits folks that's right it's gonna
go all the way unlike that one girl you
were dating this will go all the way
with you so here you go ms on the side
once again the Lightning just those four
gigabytes pcie 3.0 DirectX 11.2 yeah
yeah we'll get to the back you guys can
see their triple force architecture
MSI's new r9 290x lightning provides
triple force architecture that brings
out a blockbuster level of graphics yeah
basically what it is this is their
awesome cooling solution you guys can
see it's got three different layers that
go into their cooling solution to keep
this thing running really cool once
again we see their military class 4
components these are all high-end
components I mean they say military
class they don't necessarily mean it's
using the military's want to clarify
that for some people to think that it
just means very very high-end components
when Bruce Wang actually came up with it
he was just trying to come with a sly
and said alright this is a really good
stuff that's
Terry class twin BIOS and ants power
design super pipe technology and dust
removal technology is basically the
things blankets who the dust takes it
away from it instead of being there
copper Moss ic-cap a new SFC and dark
solid caps like I said all awesome
components because things made for
overclocking enough of that once we'll
just show you the side here here's the
nomenclature shows all that stuff so you
guys are looking to buy this well I'll
have this information down below in the
description but some people like to
check that out so well over here on the
side of the box they do have like all
this stuff I don't know I'll show it to
you guys we just see a bunch of features
of the card all its opengl all that
stuff you guys AMD fans you guys are
gonna know all the stuff the minimum
system requirements you guys can see
right there it says 500 watt or greater
power supply so make sure you have the
proper components stuff for that memory
bus 512 bits let's actually jump in now
let's actually check out the car we'll
talk about more about those specs so let
me just pop the cap right here I want to
be very careful with this box cuz I like
it and I want to keep it as like a
collector's edition so I don't want to
destroy it so I will take my little
ginger time here and uh I will gingerly
remove it from the box and no I don't
mean ginger like South Park I'm just
generally doing it I don't mean ginger
from Gilligan's Island either I just I
just don't so check it out looks like a
giant shoebox
so that is what it really looks like it
looks like you know mama just got a
brand new pair of shoes but it's not so
check that out pretty awesome looking
giant box really really cool storage for
collectors this is going to be a really
cool things you know a lot of people
they not only get their video card they
collect it because after a while
obviously new video cards come up so
boom BAM Shama lamby check that out
that's really really cool and then check
this out down here below
just like a toolbox all the accessories
pull out
so let's first off let's talk about the
accessories and then we'll move on to
the card itself so let's slap this down
real quick I'll move this just off to
the side for a second and we can check
out the accessories that come inside the
card so right in the top here we've got
our certificate of quality and stability
you get a nice little certificate there
pretty cool little thing get an
alternate bracket for doing different
type of cooling if you're doing ln2 and
stuff like that this might be come in
handy here goes all kinds of types of
connections so if you have different
types of power supplies that may not
actually work for out the box
these rim there you have all your things
for connecting to the board to check all
your electronics out and all that stuff
that's all this stuff these will all
connect to the video card so you can
check all your voltage and all that
stuff during overclocking you know so
you don't go crazy and blow the thing up
all your different connectors for the
power supply whatever your going to need
more various right here you got molex
molex to with this one this is a molex
to 6-pin these are both 8 pin to 8 pins
and a 6 pin power connector screws and
stuff like that for the bracket we saw a
second ago
get down down and dirty the drivers CD
we also see the quick user's guide and
then last but not least we see the r9
290x lightning graphics card little
thing with those three mark 11 up there
so that's basically it as far as the
accessories can be one second here folks
and we back with the card alright folks
so let's move on and let's take a look
at this insanely beast of a card whoo
this thing is incredible alright so
that's all that comes in the box so I'll
close the box up and we'll move it out
of the way now this thing weighs 1580
grams that's right it's a pretty heavy
dang card it's also 302 by 131 by 55
millimeters while that's translated into
English it has crossfire support 4-way
pretty incredible stuff
when pumping a cap right here
static bag pull this bad boy out all
right now I'll start off in the back
side now right off the bat I like this
card because I love these things when
you get a high end graphics card and it
has a nice protective plate on the rear
end of it I really like that a lot of
keeps you from cutting your hands keeps
you from shorting the card out just all
in all totally much better design when
you see that here we see the Lightning
nomenclature across the bottom there
these are all the things you have to do
if you want to remove this and change
off the heatsink like I said before to
take it off and probably use the Ln two
and different stuff like that here's the
pcie 3.0 right there up there on the
side see all of the thin array they were
talking about before flip it around
again he ruins again we see the
Lightning nomenclature more of the fans
- eight pins and a six pin power
connector on there and this thing has a
maximum resolution of 2560 by 1600 so
that's pretty dang incredible stuff here
on the front of the card we see there's
three different fans now these fans all
spin and you can change them at
different speeds now this little one in
the middle can actually get quite loud
and you've got this thing blazing but
lightening cards offer amazing cooling
right out of the box I got to say the
coin on this thing is gonna work really
badass the previous version of cards
I've seen especially the 780 even though
was in a video card on your game depends
on raw but that car just ran amazing I
know we're gonna get the same thing out
of this r9 290x with this great cooling
on it you're gonna get a mediate
overclocking right out of the box if you
want to go crazy and do that there's
stuff you'll have that option but you
won't really need to let's take a look
at the rear in here now this thing is
completely gold-plated very nice black
hardware you've got a single DVI dual
DVI you have a standard DisplayPort
standard HDMI I said in the beginning
but this card has a core clock speed of
a thousand 80 megahertz has a memory
clock speed of 5,000 megahertz and
features a 512 bit memory interface now
as we take a look at the rear of the
card you can see that all
the fans are plugging into these headers
right here and then right here these are
all the connections that you will use to
measure the voltage on your card so
you'll plug those little things right in
there you'll have your voltage
multimeter you'll be to read all that
stuff and even if you have to ln2
cooling with this being on the back end
right here I'll have no problem at all
accessing it here on this side folks you
can really see the amazing amount of
aluminum fins going all the way down the
side of this card so this thing's gonna
amazingly keep it cool you've got heat
pipes running all through it heat fins
it's gonna have direct contact with the
GPU I don't know
I love these cards a lot of people out
there are always wanting to know about
the difference in the cooling fans and
stuff like that we're trying to get a
video together like that for you guys
but you guys can see this a lot of stuff
came in the box alright folks so there
you have just the unboxing and first
look of the brand-new msi Lightning r9
290x next is the testing and then the
full review of this bad ass card now
folks I know this thing's a bit pricey
but right now as we know the Bitcoin
things going on and whether Bitcoin
things going on AMD pricing just has
seemed to soar hence when we did a
battle why this card actually lost
because of the price on it but if you're
looking for the top-line AMD card you
want it's gonna overclock out of the box
you're not an ln2 person which is just
somebody who wants your card to
absolutely kick ass this is gonna be one
of the absolute best cards you can get
your hands on I know there's gonna be
other versions by other companies but
this is going to be very competitive I
don't see there being all that much of a
difference at all right out of the box
between this one from azuz 1 from
gigabyte everybody who's gonna be
bringing their top kick-ass card is
gonna have a top kick-ass garden and
from MSI this is their lightning version
so it's gonna strike and it's gonna
strike hard I'm Eric thanks for watching
Tekken tomorrow if you like this video
and like this video card make sure you
hit that like button down below and if
