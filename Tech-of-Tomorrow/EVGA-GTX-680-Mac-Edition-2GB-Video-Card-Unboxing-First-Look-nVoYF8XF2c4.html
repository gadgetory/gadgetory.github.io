to tech damar we're bringing you all the
tech all the time now check it out just
a few weeks ago we saw sapphire release
their version of the HD 7950 geared for
the Mac Pro and for hackintosh is now in
a countermove just like an vidi to do
they got to have something bigger
they've pulled out their owned Mac
Edition card and we have that sitting
here right in front of us now this card
got launched this morning and this is
the new EVGA Mac edition geforce gtx 680
now check it out over in the bottom over
here we can see clearly it's got the Mac
logo right there now you're gonna notice
that this card cost $100 more than a
standard card you guys want to know why
you see this little logo over here and
that's why for that logo alone I'm sure
EVGA is happening to pay the people at
Mac on under bucks so we'll go over here
you guys can clearly see it's the EVGA
Mac Edition over here is the geforce gtx
680 now there are some requirements to
the card I'm gonna pull the card right
here you guys can see Mac Pro early 2008
or later models Mac Pro 3.1 or later
with PCI Express 2.0 slot Mac OS version
10 point eight point three or later also
works with Microsoft Windows 8 Windows 7
Vista and all that stuff so you could
build one of those things and you can
also use Apple's bootcamp so you can
either make a dual boot system or build
a boot camp system and this card will
work just perfectly we'll flip it on the
back of the box it has all of the same
features and a little bit more than your
standard car paint the Mac Edition it
also has an ef5 BIOS this thing also has
your standard 1536 CUDA cores most of
the basic features of the car camerman
can just zoom in very close over here
you guys can see this will bring this
out here NVIDIA GPU boost so that
supports the boost the clock that means
when the card is running and it needs a
particular booth the card will actually
increase itself making the card run
faster has recruited technology PCI we
talked about opengl 3.2 OpenCL support
and it has all the stuff that's in the
box what mods we'll take a look here
real closely you guys can see this
this is all stuff that we're going to
get to in just a second there IO
featured a display port HDMI DVI and DVI
D so let's go ahead now and let's talk a
couple more things in the back here EVGA
heads us warranty and also 24/7 support
and that's pretty much it let's go ahead
and take the trusty little thing here
and let's begin the unboxing you go
ahead and take this up here I cut in
here camerman he has prepared himself
and so this will be thrown at the
cameraman at high velocity but I missed
Justin by that much alright so let's go
ahead also once again we see the box is
sealed by the EVGA a little thing right
here and I'm gonna go ahead and make it
a little slice right here yeah alright
and I see there's stuff in here that's
gonna come flying out so I'll just go
ahead and get that down shake that make
sure there's nothing there once again I
throw alright it's like the Wild West
around here alright so starting off we
have this book get it up here EVGA gtx
680 graphics card for apple mac pro
installation guide hopefully it will
come with all the proper cables because
basically there are two cables that you
need to use to hook up so let's go ahead
we see a big EVGA logo thing here once
again at the Chairman whoo
almost got it all right accessories pack
they're all inside of these things right
here and yes here are the two cables
inside this bag there are the two cables
that you are going to need to do the
installation very very important and
also very very easy we have the DVI to
VGA little adapter inside here and we
got this right here we have a standard
DisplayPort two main DisplayPort that's
kind of important for those people for
the Mac obviously you're going to want
to have them a display board because
most of those Mac monitors have that and
that's it's inside of here
then last but not least we have the card
itself completely sealed from the
factory we'll go ahead and take this
I'll be nice this time and not put the
cameraman please give me that dirty look
again means enough throwing at him all
right
we get your message men I hear you let's
go ahead and just remove this now the
seal I'm going to have to break it right
here
so kaboom you're breaking the seal and
deep virgin eyes doing that card oh my
oh my
and for those who are concerned yes I
did round myself out before taking the
card and touching the card some people
asked that no take the card right here
I'm gonna go ahead and we'll just let
the camera zoom in right here to the
rear i/o DVID dvi-i standard HDMI
standard DisplayPort a little cap things
just pull those out of there real quick
you guys can see those right there easy
money set those off the side real quick
you guys can also see the card two slot
design down here in the bottom of the
card we see the pcie 3.0 interface let
me set the card back down let's see how
big the card is shall we got the
measuring tape out the card is sizing it
at exactly 10 inches now as far as the
height the card goes inside your system
will see the card is four inches in
height and as far as the thickness of
the card the card is one-and-a-half
inches thick it's kind of hard to see
because my thumb I'll try them with them
out of the way but one and a half inches
is the thickness of the card just go
ahead and set that down
let's go ahead and move a little bit
this plastic now you guys can see a
closer look of the card I'll just have
the cameraman zoom in here real quick
and we'll take a little stroll just
across the car too so you can see it now
you guys can see it's got a plastic
shroud and come see the entire card and
we also see the blower type fan here I'm
gonna go ahead and turn the card on to
its side on the side we clearly see the
GeForce GTX logo EVGA here are the two
6-pin power connectors those are for the
cables that are right in here you're
gonna want to plug those into here and
then right directly into your Mac or
your PC I'll have it on its power supply
you guys all know that also I were on
the top here let me remove this little
rubber thing right here and I'll move
the card to the back where we can
clearly see there are two SLI fingers
right there now we also have a card in
the back I'll set it down you guys can
clearly see it the PCB is completely
black in color and this is also a pretty
reference design card so if you're
trying to look for printing a water
cooler or anything else if you want to
go all crazy as hell on this you could
install a water block on this very very
simple due to its design alright folks
so that is it I'm glad you guys watch
this video for those people out there
looking to build a dual-boot computer or
just looking for a totally cool car to
upgrade their aging and fledging MacPro
because you know it's been years since
we didn't refresh this can be a really
really awesome product for those people
so I hope you guys like this video if so

we also once again want to iterate that
we're having the 100k system going on
that we're giving away plus over on our
