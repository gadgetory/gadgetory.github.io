what's up Tech fans Kevin here on TECA
tomorrow now watch dogs finally got
released earlier this week and a lot of
you out there are probably wondering
whether or not you can play it no I'm
not just talking about the horrific
problems ubisoft's been having with ste
RM in the form of you play which a lot
of us have been having fun with the past
couple of days but I'm just talking
about how your system can handle running
it at what graphics settings so we're
bringing you this little video where
we're showing the game running at its
four different preset graphic quality
settings of low medium high and ultra
and we're also going to let you know
what kind of frame rates we were seeing
while running at these different
settings at 1440p resolution on our test
system now those you that aren't
familiar with our test system it
includes a GTX 780 Twinner frozer gaming
Edition as well as an i7 4770k processor
overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz so we're
just gonna show you how the game looks
running at those four different settings
at 1440p those of you that are curious
how to run at 1080p we're going to give
you a list of benchmarks for that after
the video as well so let's check it out
so that's how the game looks running at
those four different settings at 1440p
now if you run it at 1080p you are of
course going to see an improvement in
the framerate at low settings our system
was getting about 67 point 3 frames per
second at medium we were seeing 63.8 at
high 55 point 6 and at Ultra 47 point 3
now as far as the actual gameplay itself
goes not just how it looks I'm still
working my way through it right now so I
don't feel comfortable just yet bringing
you guys a full review but as far as my
thoughts so far go it is very much a
free roam style grant the photo type of
game but with a heavier emphasis on
vigilantism rather than on just being a
straight-up criminal as far as the core
gameplay goes it's got some great
platforming for a free roam type of game
and has way better stealth mechanics
than you're normally used to seeing in
the style on the other hand the driving
mechanics are just really bad now there
are also a lot of different things going
on on this game all at once there's lots
of different side quests collectibles
different ways of progressing your
character and even just completely build
side minigames that are honestly some of
the most fun parts of the game
especially spider tank now if you guys
want to see a more in-depth video
showing more gameplay and more on just
what I think of the game so far I did
post a day one impressions vid over on
my own channel which we're actually
going to have linked in the tech of
tomorrow forums as well as with a
written version of my day 1 impression
so if you want to check that out we do
have that linked below down in the
description now before I get out of here
