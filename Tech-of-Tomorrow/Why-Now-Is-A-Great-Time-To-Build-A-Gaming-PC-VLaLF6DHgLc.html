time was really sucking especially for
people trying to build their own
high-end peace seeds because the miners
and all that stuff that was going on you
couldn't really get your hands on a
video card and with memory prices
sky-high and even all the really good
CPU sky-high for the longest time
building a PC especially a Hyland
was really kind of like death valley in
a way I mean if you had a lot of cash
you were good to go if you didn't you
were kind of on the bad side of things
son that's right it wasn't a good period
of time at all so on the periodic time
table you're gonna sell us in this drop
something can you sense it all no it
sounded good periodic time table sounds
like a big word big word but anyways
right now though things have actually
changed and currently especially if you
don't care about trying to be 4k and you
just want some good solid 1080 gaming
right now is a great time to build
yourself a gaming PC and I'm gonna tell
you why first of all all of the older
video cards from Nvidia all the older
cards from AMD are pretty much selling
for dirt cheap on eBay and other places
I've seen honestly a gtx 1080i obviously
a used one and not a founder's edition
but for as low as three hundred and
fifty dollars maybe even some I saw at
325 but I wasn't quite sure if they were
working or not it was like earn but
still the prices on those cards are way
loan-out which means that any of the
older generation video cards you can now
buy in abundance and you can buy them
for cheap and regardless what anybody
says regardless of r-tx or an it stuff
so no there's gonna be some people out
there like what doesn't have r-tx and
isn't going to do all the you know all
the ray-tracing that I don't really care
Elric I'm moving on from your video have
a nice day but for other people would be
like hey hold on hold on video car you
know prices going on the cheap this is
exciting stuff and I think it's really
exciting because now when people call me
up and they're like hey I want to build
a PC I don't have to go okay well I got
a PC for you but if you want a video
card it's gonna cost you like double
everything else just because that's like
this state of things so this is really
cool plus
Intel CPUs all the other previous
generation stuff you're gonna be able to
get an i7 8700 K for under $300 I've
seen them for as low as 260 so I mean
even if you're gonna build a super duper
high and Intel I need to buy as an older
chipset you don't have to worry about
buying the latest chipset for mental you
don't have to worry about buying an i-9
even though it might be the fastest chip
there is you don't need to invest your
money in that I mean if you really got
yourself an i7 a 7 or 8 K overclock that
bad boy with a real good cooler get
yourself a 1080 TI you could build a
whole system now probably even get a
monitor if you played your cards right
for under a thousand bucks I don't think
that's really gonna be that hard
whatsoever I'm gonna start looking this
as well so do future videos I know you
guys like stuff like that you guys like
400 800 600 so I'll start doing a lot
more that stuff because right now it's a
good time it really is because prices
have been slashed so low on a lot of
stuff I've even want to go online I'm
seeing cases and stuff EVGA is always
always having sales and their sites you
can get power supplies and motherboards
and all kinds of stuff and as long as
you're not trying to buy the latest
current thing which obviously didn't
cost money you can get all these parts
again at a very affordable price and now
memory if you're gonna try to even give
me the super duper fastest overclocking
memory yeah you're still gonna be paying
a little bit for that but now that's
gonna be the component that's expensive
instead of your video card you know and
you can always get away especially with
an Intel system with slower memory on
AMD systems it's actually better to have
faster memory because the faster memory
inside of those systems just seems to
make everything work a little bit better
but on the Intel side of things having
your memory be faster doesn't make that
much of a difference especially in the
gaming arena so the drought is gone and
that is good and plus what I'm hearing
is that mining is going to be dead for
quite a while now so if there's not
gonna be any mining for a while now that
means that this market should stable out
for a while which is just great for
everybody out there's into PC gaming
especially for all those folks who were
just hanging around going okay man um
video card prices are off the hook I'm
not gonna pay you $1600 yes I found a
link for $1,600 $1,600
for GT X 1080 Ti come on 1600 bucks for
dainty yeah I I mean these guys mr.
Walker the morning just said good stuff
that's Muslim must have happen because
who in their right mind is gonna pay
that much money for that car that's just
ridiculous and thank God that that stuff
is over so as long as there's no more
mining going on we don't see that going
on you buy especially for your video
card you want to buy a used card you can
get a much cheaper on eBay and eBay will
protect you on that so if you do buy a
car from somebody and it's a stanky
danky card you'll be able to return it
no problem within the 45-day period you
know so you can get a really good card
on their use but if you want a brand new
card prices are still dropping as well
and if you don't need a 1080i you know
you just play 1080 you've got a monitor
that's not got a lot of stuff on it and
you play your play the games you play
you don't require the absolute best you
know graphics because maybe you're a guy
who plays competitive stuff most of
those guys keep the resolution at a
lower resolution anyway so they can be
really really fast for you guys it
wouldn't even really matter whatsoever
you could be able to build even a
cheaper PC you know and have yourself a
great PC for doing all your competitive
gaming without breaking the bank
so let me know what you guys think also
want to specially thank Jonathan
Morrison from TLD he actually started a
GoFundMe campaign to help pay for all my
doctor bills cuz like they're outrageous
from all the surgery and stuff like that
like you can't believe how help being in
the hospital for like eight days can
always sudden like create these mass
giant builds it's just like how much do
you charge so anyways if anybody wants
to support that I'd appreciate if you
even just share it or whatever to select
people no that would be absolutely great
I'll have a link down below there's a
little thing that they have it's like
where you can go like ring a little bell
if you guys want to see my videos make
sure that you get the latest videos that
are coming out and make sure you click
that little bell so it notifies you and
if you're not subscribed hey I'd like to
see you subscribe the channel we'd
always love new faces here at tech of
tomorrow I'm Elric thanks for watching
hey right now it's a great time to build
yourself a gaming PC so if you got a
little cash make it happen
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
