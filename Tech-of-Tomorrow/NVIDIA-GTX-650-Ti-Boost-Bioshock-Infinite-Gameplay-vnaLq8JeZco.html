all know BioShock Infinite was launched
today for the PC and I'm very excited to
have it here on my desk also we've got a
new release from Nvidia this is their
brand new GTX 650 Ti boost edition video
card so with that said let's jump in
let's first check out a fraps recorded
video and then let's check out live
gameplay with the fraps going to see how
many frames per second we can get with
everything set on high so let's go
through the motions now take a look at
the option screen
so
and so here we go we're off the game is
loading fan we're about to jump in I'm
afraid of you
you
are you going to just sit there
standing swipe folks here we go I'm
stuck in a boat with some talkative
people and the game begins like I said
this is just the fraps recording you
guys can check that out I thought I'd do
a little bit of both this way people
could actually see how the game's going
now I have everything set to its high
setting 1920 by 1080 P sound everything
seems to be playing pretty well quality
is is is quite well got a gun a whole
box that a hand grenade got some
instructions in there just like a ticket
to New York City bring to New York and a
key and what's all kinds of goodness
anyways we poured across the water here
you can see that obviously the chick
she's kind of a lazy beeoptions in a row
at all just talking smack the whole way
making for homeboy if they're doing but
obviously this shit Nick was his idea
so we're popping in and then after we go
up here to the top up here we'll jump in
and Washington's alive
and so here we go we have arrived
you guys can see we have flats on the
corner over there returning it does
doesn't it talk boo me and rainy and
shit damn
and you assholes brought me out here
that is this plane messed up some
friends you are probably get killed
maimed hopefully nothing involving weird
shit cert some stuff here guys to see
we're still maintaining pretty much
sixty frames per second
excuse me
it's Booker do it I guess you're
expecting me yeah I think you AR any
time it goes to any type of movie it
stops down to 30 but as soon as I get
out of it usually changes and goes back
up so from Sodom shall I lead thee I'm
not even touching that one no I am shy
it's making our way through Harry you
guys can see everything looks really
cool I searched things all over the
place
I need to collect that Monday and sunny
somewhere there's some funky ass music
playing I'll make my lips tears looks
like a bloody hand I could not vote good
for me maybe not get some Co edge get
some money I'm man whatever this fool
damn it
look at this pant detail though it looks
really looks cool actually great detail
all around got some tools here somebody
did some torturing somebody was kicking
somebody's ass we'll keep climbing
higher and higher so at the top Oh
interesting
so although we got here let's see
earlier I saw it said let's see with
that one
No all right let's try it again so
now all by golly what happened there
that should have worked well in here now
Oh shit's gonna hit the fan look at the
water DEET on the ground it looks badass
doesn't it
can I run can I hide is there nowhere to
escape I mean come on man let me
provisions search spare all right this
is crazy looking stuff it's jumping over
here of way
and the chair okay so I think there's a
part where the games are really going to
begin the expectancy yes they do so I
guess I better take a sit oh yeah like I
didn't see this coming your legs and
kiss your ass good-bye
you can see my reflection I'm scared
shitless
and so the game begins and we land in
the beautiful city in the sky where
other beautiful people live crime does
not exist
it's just peace harmony love and joy
with some leader look at how beautiful
it is would you look at your beauty out
there hey let's open a flag flying in
the sky father Comstock our prophet oh
those look like the friendly sort now
okay I'm gonna hurt my hemorrhoids damn
you're telling if they're gonna fucking
pop up on his ass like that
all right so here we go
jump into the actual game
so far the frames have been pretty solid
across the board
I do have vsync enable by the way
because this is where I want to be
alarming to look nice no tearing
and we're almost at the bottom oh the
thing
Wow look at that homeboys got himself
out there like either Jesus and Moses
all open to one these Jehovah's or we'll
just call him Jonesy all right folks so
we are now about to officially begin the
game you can see my little heart meter
up there on the left there says I'm in
full health and will step out onto here
now we're actually in the gameplay check
out the water says end to help navigate
so check that out
