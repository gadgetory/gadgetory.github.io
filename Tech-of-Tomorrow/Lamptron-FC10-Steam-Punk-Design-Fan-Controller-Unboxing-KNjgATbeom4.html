ferrets from the tectum our YouTube
channel bringing you guys an unboxing
first look an overview of a brand new
product from the people over at lambtron
now this is the FC 10 FC 10 fan
controller which I think stands for
 cool or freaking cool or you
know just freaking cowabunga but it's
supposed to be pretty nice it's got a
tube design a lot of different face
changes you can change all the different
face plates of different colors it also
has different types of voltage to
believe it's 30 watts of power and this
thing is really geared to be a high-end
really just cool looking fan controller
so if your motherboard doesn't have
enough fan controllers on it and you
want to have a bunch of fans in your
system you hook up this bad boy and then
it gives you cool things to look at as
well so you get aesthetics and a fan
controller all-in-one so let's jump in
let's get my trusty knife out here and
we're in one box there's a little
plastic sleeve around the side of it
here we're gonna take it put an incision
right here nice little medical incision
and try this at home kitties
dangerous takes time and effort to do
this no I'm just kidding
in the old Schmo could do it I just like
to have fun and do it so check it out
here we're gonna show you guys I bring
over to the camera in the front of the
box the fan controller AFC 10 and check
it out it's even got a remote control so
if you're lazy ass couch potato and you
want to use this thing you can sit
across the room and adjust your fans now
I don't know why it's got a remote
control on it because that seems kind of
crazy but hey they should have included
like a media controller yeah media
controller plus bank controller that's
the thumbs up idea we'll see how it
works and floss my breaths there here in
the back of the box that actually shows
you everything it comes in the box so
you folks can see all that and then
beyond I'll go back over to the table we
got a little sliding a little box right
here slide and then we throw the box to
the cameraman like so got the box here
sit down here got that I'm done yep okay
whoo hey cool check it out now I'll have
no excuse to miss any meetings or
anything else because they have sent me
a calendar the lambtron
2012
calendar featuring riding the cover the
FC ten all the different months their
products cool stuff look at that gold
front oh I know Anthony rounds my tech
could be covered in that he loves
anything gold all different stuff Bank
controllers FCB
just does their didn't products I can
show them all to you but what the heck
they're all in there now here is the
remote control let me get that with the
Cameron so you can see there's your
remote control so you know you're lazy
you're sitting on the cows and you're
like hey no problem close open well you
know what it does have open close so I'm
wondering if open closed for some reason
will let you open and close your CD
player I don't know because I haven't
hooked it up but that would be cool
wouldn't it open close
that would be a nice feature other than
that maybe this thing is it opening
close I don't know but here's all the
fan things up and down a little mute
button I guess it's a mute button mmm
here's some cable connections as you can
see they're all nicely sleep I know you
folks out there love customs leaving
stuff well look these are all sleeve
like they do a custom sleeve snake I'm
gonna get you last one right here
love adieu love dating then we'll go
ahead and pull out the assembly thing
carburetor oh here goes some screws verb
not to get inside your system and set
those up the side now this one is the FC
ten and FC ten special edition
instruction manual see we got that there
it also says press the M button wants to
set the display mode so it's not a mute
button that's set your display mode and
that's about it
open close doesn't really say exactly
what that does I'm Zen you're reading
through it not to bore you guys but just
trying to see what there is on there
they basically is just giving you
instructions on how to use the thing but
opening clothes it doesn't actually even
address that so get that aside now let's
take a look at the front of the unit you
can see all the tube designs in there
you guys saw in the box you can actually
make it say like 2150 you're gonna make
it say 2112 you may say something you're
probably say it make it say
of you know SWAT whatever you want
probably I don't know I haven't really
tried it out yet that's the front here
we'll show you the back here's a
connecting wire that works for thermal
the coupler here be very careful with
this wire I mean this wire
I'm putting the camera's barely even
hooked onto here be very careful with
this that would break off very very
simply here's all the connectors in the
back we look all your fans up to here we
add some additional thermal cabling
these things right here they pick up the
temperature and they run them into this
and they tell the temperature of
whatever is it's touching so like you
know I was sweating inside the case for
the case you could have one touching a
fan when touching the CPU you can have
them all inside of there registering and
telling you what's going on with them so
that's it folks I guess I was wrong
I actually thought that this came with a
bunch of different covers I read online
that it did but I guess that must be the
special edition one this one's not the
special edition one so I guess I didn't
get that mine just black but that's cool
because most of my cases are black
anyways but the really gold one would
have been really cool to have maybe I'll
contact when bug them and say hey watch
me they have special edition one fools
but that's it lamb from FC ten fan
controller cool design I think it's
gonna be a nifty little product not
over-the-top but interesting see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
