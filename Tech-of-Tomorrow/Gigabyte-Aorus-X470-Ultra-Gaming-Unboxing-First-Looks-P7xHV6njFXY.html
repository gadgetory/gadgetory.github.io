guys here now before we jump in today's
video and check out this really cool
motherboard from gigabyte let's real
quick hear a word from our sponsors at
Corsair the dark core RGB se gaming
mouse is where wire performance goes
Wireless with an ultra-fast low latency
wireless Bluetooth connection you know
you're getting the same performance as
you would with a wired mouse but if you
still prefer that wire the dark core RGB
se comes wired as well the dark core RGB
se also features key wireless charging
so you can charge the mouse on any
compatible charging pad or with the
Corsair mm 1000 mouse pad for top
performance and with the 1600 dpi
optical sensor the ultra accurate
high-speed tracking engine can be custom
tuned to virtually any type of mousepad
and for custom comfort the dark core RGB
se comes with two interchangeable side
grits to fit your playing style and oh
yeah the dark core also comes with
customisable three zone backlighting so
if you're an RGB fan they've got you
covered the dark core RGB se also comes
with high performance
Omron switches which are rated for 50
million clicks that's right 50 million
clicks so you won't have to worry about
your mouse cutting out on you anytime
soon and last but not least using the Q
software you can fully program any of
the nine buttons for total control and
customization so if you're looking for a
mouse that can handle the best of both
worlds both wired and wireless check out
the dark or RGB se from Corsair you have
to admit that dark core Mouse looks
pretty doggone badass and I have to say
I've been using it for a couple of
months and it does work really well so
if you get a chance check it out
now we all know that AMD has always been
the budget King and with the release of
the rising two CPUs in their brand new
ap use we see that trend still
continuing now what we're gonna check
out today is one of their really nice
entry-level motherboards and this is the
gigabyte a OS X 470 board coming in to
market at a mere hundred and thirty nine
dollars so that's a really really
affordable product this board has a lot
of features advanced features that I
think are cool and competing with some
higher-end boards and what's really cool
now is that you
don't need to get a separate motherboard
to use the a-series CPUs this
motherboard will take the non graphic
CPUs and the CPUs that have the Vega
graphics on them so with that said
though let's do the unboxing and let's
see what this boards all about ok so
like any good unboxing let's first check
out obviously the box itself now in the
front just the basic things tells you
the name of the board all its
nomenclature on the back a little more
information the eight plus three power
design with this is a power conditioning
allows your board to have the
electricity being regulated coming into
your board ensuring that your board
lasts a long time and the latest in them
to technology it's just back there so I
thought I'd throw that out to the earth
for you but that's pretty much all there
is to the box there's nothing really too
much here and there's also nothing
really much here but with that said
though let's hump in let's see what's
inside the box so I'm going to pop the
cap on this bad boy wrap the bat on the
top we see the motherboard in the
anti-static bag we'll go ahead and just
set that off to the side and let's check
out the things that come in the box
other than the motherboard itself and
excuse me folks I got 101 temperature
today and this is actually being kind of
hard to stay focused and do this so
we've got the user's manual we've got
two SATA cables the rear i/o shield you
also get a thermal sensor cable so this
way you can monitor the temperature
board that's actually pretty cool
there's also the multi-language user
guide but I think that most of the guys
that watch my channel they know what
they're doing with this stuff and they
probably never use this whatsoever this
right here is a little screw this little
screw is for holding in your NDE drive
so your m2 Drive will be secured with
this little screw right here now this
little doohickey right here in my hand
this is actually for the RGB lighting on
this these are all the connectors you
can hook this up to your board so for
those people who are doing the whole RGB
thing you may find this quite handy and
then last but not least we see the
driver CD with all the drivers on it you
may want to check their website though
even though this is a brand new board
sometimes new drivers are available on
the website so just to be sure check it
out and then last but not least
obviously in the box is the movable
itself and I got to tell you for the
price range this is one very
nice-looking motherboard just at first
looks I gotta say it this a OS
motherboard is a looker it's not too
fancy but yet it's not so diminished
that you just go oh my god that's Plain
Jane it's somewhere right and that nice
middle niche now you guys can see the
ARS logo
this is on the shroud covering the rear
i/o on the very top of the board we see
the single 8 pin power connector you
guys can see all the capacitors are nice
and well hid underneath those shrouds
plenty of room around the am for socket
for aftermarket cooler so if you guys
are gonna do a liquid cooling or any
type of stuff like that you'll have
plenty of room to do that this
particular X 470 motherboard has a lot
of different connections for your fans
you have a single CPU cooler fan
connection you have 4 system connections
for fans and you also have 2 connectors
for liquid cooling you can see these in
various spots around the board you have
two located up by the top of the memory
one located to the right near the bottom
of the memory one located by the CPU
shroud and another located down below
the SATA connections for those of you
who have USB type-c products there's
also a single USB type-c connector it's
located right to the bottom and to the
right of the memory now as we go down
towards the bottom of the board you guys
can see there's a nice little shroud
there and this shroud actually lights up
in the RGB environment making your board
look really cool and located to the
right of the shroud are six six gigabit
per second SATA ports as far as PCI
Express support at the very top you see
a single 1x connection and then you have
three major slots this is where you can
install your video cards and things like
that the very top one is a 16x slot the
next one is 8 X and the one on the
bottom is a 4x slot in between the PCI
lanes you can see there are two nvm p.m.
two slots you can remove that little
thing right there to stick the first one
in and you guys can openly see the one
below that also the BIOS for your
battery is located in there as well
this motherboard also features the ALC
1220 Realtek audio chipset you guys
concede that the audio on this
motherboard is actually pretty well
segregated and even though it's not
using the most expensive Japanese
capacitors these are still very nice
and the fact that they are pretty much
secluded away from the rest of the
motherboard means you'll get the lowest
noise possible located at the very
bottom the board are all your different
connections for external things such as
your comm ports USB 3 and where you
connect all the wires from your system
onto your motherboard to the far right
now taking a look at the rear i/o to the
very far left r2 standard USB 2.0
connections next to that are the USB 3.1
next to that are the two USB 3.0 ports
and below that is the HDMI port so if
you have Ambar graphics you'll be able
to hook up your monitor this particular
connection instead of using a video card
now right next to that we see the land
port this is actually an Intel LAN port
so that'll work really well and then
below that we see two more USB 2.0 ports
now right next to that is the USB gen 2
connection I don't know if I said it
before with those yellow connections
those are generation 1 4 USB 3 the red
one is USB 3 but its type 2 and then
down below that is your USB type-c
connection you guys can see for audio it
features all the standard points it also
features 7.1 surround sound and if
you're into s/pdif and digital audio
it's got that connection as well on the
back of the motherboard there's not much
to see all you guys can see is all the
tracer elements from all the connections
on the board itself alright folks so
there you have it the gigabyte ARS X 470
motherboard coming in to market at about
a hundred and thirty nine dollars I
think this is an extremely nice board
for that particular price point my CPUs
they should be here today by new way I'm
hoping they arrive and I have one more
motherboard coming up cuz I'm going to
do two different system builds I'm also
going to buy the a series CPUs but I
don't know if I'll actually dedicated an
entire build to that but I'll definitely
bring you guys the score so stay
watching Tekken tomorrow because we got
lots more stuff coming rise into like I
said all of our tests and everything is
just right around the corner and I
bought all this stuff from my personal
pocket do you guys want to get more
information about this down below that
like button will have a link you guys
know what to do and if you're not sub
today we'd love to see you back here on
Tekken tomorrow Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
