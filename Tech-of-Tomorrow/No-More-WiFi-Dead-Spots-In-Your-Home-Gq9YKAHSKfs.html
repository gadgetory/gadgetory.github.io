once again to the channel now if you're
like me you might live in a house where
you're farthest space away where you
need to get on the Wi-Fi is a long ways
away from your router so I was having a
lot of problems with to the veterans
upstairs in my house in fact we couldn't
even use the room that we originally set
up for our test lab because we're only
downloading stuff at like 1.7 megabytes
a second really utterly slow I go ask
gee dude are you done yet and be like we
know these things suck my mom couldn't
watch it really the TV in my room it was
just really a pain in the butt to get
any kind of decent Wi-Fi upstairs in my
house so I was like damn I need to get a
product that can solve this and me
personally I'm really picky when it
comes to hardware I like new hardware
but I like stuff that's really going to
work so I started looking online for
like reviews and stuff and I found this
one about this Deco m5 unit and a lot of
people out there have reviewed this and
given it great praise and that's why I
bought it I admit that I've had products
in the past and I've always been a
little bit skeptical because they've
never really worked what I thought up to
par but I have to say that this unit
actually does as far as like clicking it
up and everything goes it's probably the
most simplest and easiest like
no-brainer
that you'll ever be able to do you
simply plug it into your router install
the app on your phone and after the apps
on your phone you just turn on all the
different units and you can use a lot of
different units all off the same thing
they have packs that come in one for
like nine nine bucks or a three pack
that you can get for like two hundred
and thirty nine dollars so it's not even
really that expensive but using it I
mean is really that simple all you need
to have is a simple wall plug and a
place for you to set the device I mean
they're really really small they're
white so they'll pretty much go in any
environment I mean if you have a really
dark like house or something maybe it'll
stand out and pick it back you know you
might even think it's like one of those
fire alarm things cuz it kind of looks
the same as that it's about the same
size as well but you can put them on a
wall really easily with like double
sticky tape and all that kind of stuff
but it's really simple to use now what
came in the box well we got three deco
units one rj45 ethernet cable to connect
to your router and then three power
adapters one for each deco unit inside
each deco unit is a quad-core CPU
featuring Wireless 400 megabits per
second on the 2.4 gigahertz connection
and 870 megabits per second on a 5
Hertz connection for great connectivity
each unit contains four internal
antennas and you can actually use by
cable each one of these and daisy chain
them together if you don't want to use
wireless the units also feature for
power a type c port and each unit is
compatible with ipv6 and each unit also
features bluetooth 4.2 connectivity and
like i said earlier like using this
product doesn't take anybody like any
kind of thought process whatsoever so
you're thinking oh my god I'm gonna get
this am I not gonna be able to do it no
I think pretty much anybody who can read
instructions can do it and the best
thing that I think about it is that it
actually works and emulates the speeds
that you get from your router now it has
a three-year warranty it actually comes
with protection on it so you it comes
with like you know Internet protection
on it for a few years as well it has
parental controls so if you want to keep
people from doing certain things with
each different one you can do that and
like I said best of all you just plug it
in wherever you want to and you get
forty five hundred square feet now in my
house my whole house is just a little
bit smaller than that and one of the
units might have worked just fine but
when I put them on one end of each of
the hallway then things really picked up
so at each end of my hallway now
upstairs I'm getting almost the exact
same speeds that I'm getting from my
router downstairs through my Wi-Fi with
no cables no anything just a simple wall
plug so for me this actually solved my
problem you know absolutely flawlessly
now if you're a person and you your
house is is having a little bit of
problems you probably don't need the
three pack but like I said you can get a
single unit of these for 99 bucks now if
you live in a place that doesn't really
have any Wi-Fi problems and okay you
probably don't need this but if there
are any walls or anything that's you
know keeping your signal from getting to
where you're want to put your Wi-Fi
signal you're gonna start having
problems so if you're a person out there
and you're having problems getting your
Wi-Fi to be really strong in the area in
your house that you want to be I can
tell you right now I was paid no money
for this video this is totally unspun
surd this is just my personal opinion as
a person I really really like this I
didn't want to like it as much as I do
I'll admit that at first I was like okay
well at work we've had these in the pass
and they were all kind of aunt honestly
but this one works exactly as described
good price good warranty if you for some
reason actually come with a problem and
you can't figure it out they've actually
got live support as well to help you get
up and going but like I said it's really
really simple honestly folks we had this
entire thing up and going in about 15
minutes I me work with a lot of tech
stuff all admit we're like pretty semi
tech savvy I think around here so we
were able to get this up going very very
simply but if you have any problems like
I said you can contact them this product
works I endorse it like I said before no
money involved no nothing but if you
want a product that actually works right
out of the box with no problems
whatsoever this dekho m5 unit worked for
me and it solved all of my problems
everywhere in my entire house now I have
a very strong Wi-Fi signal and it's
pretty much matching exactly what I'm
getting at my router point so I'm gonna
say at the end of the day I give this a
definite editor's choice here on techo
