almost three months to finally figure
out what was actually wrong with me and
start taking the steps to heal me but at
least that hasn't have been done and
even though I am still in pain I can
function now and we're gonna be getting
back to work so all of this pain all of
this stuff over than when I had
pneumonia resulted from two herniated
discs in my neck the l4 and l5 right up
here on the center and it was shooting
out all kinds of things to my nervous
system and that's when I was in so much
pain
why couldn't hold any food down or
anything else and then resulting from
that the muscle in my shoulder
completely went into a ball like
literally it's the hard purple ball it's
you could've seen up here and it was
just so unbelievably painful and that's
why I wasn't able to eat for so long and
the reason like I said before like I was
shaking like a leaf because my blood
sugar was down to like 51 and that is so
dangerous the doctor when I went had the
surgery last Wednesday almost didn't he
want to do the surgery because he's like
wow your health status is so bad but I
begged him I said but listen if all of
this is resulting from the pain from
those herniated discs and from my
shoulder why can't we just fix that so I
can start getting better so well he did
it
I got a local they went in there they
released the pressure and did something
to the herniated disc and they give me
what's called trigger point injections
if anybody else is out there you've had
like problems with your shoulder stuff
you may know what I'm talking about it's
where they do a bunch of different shots
into your shoulder it's like lytic pain
it's like
it's all kinds of stuff it's like lytic
Kane there was like some kind of like
protein enzymes that they stuck in there
which is like steroids pretty much
basically and then a painkiller that
they gave me and on the 23rd of this
month I go back one more time for those
trigger point injections now right now
my shoulder it does hurt it doesn't hurt
so bad that I'm like lying in my bed
screaming and wreathing in pain and not
able to eat for the last week since the
surgery I've been able to eat food and
I'm gonna be honest with you on
Saturday and Sunday I just felt like a
glutton because I hadn't really eaten so
long i sat in the living room from the
TV and just kept eating and eating and
eating and eating and eating no I'm not
eating bad stuff I'm eating junk food
candy that kind of stuff but I was
eating a lot of different chicken a lot
of steak a lot of stuff trying to get
some energy back into my body now if you
guys have ever followed the channel you
can see that I've lost all of my muscle
mass in my arms it's all gone completely
all the muscle mass that I attained
through my entire life is completely
gone that's how really sick that I was
um it seemed like some people got really
mad at the last video and unsubscribe
because I said the doctor misdiagnosed
me with Parkinson's disease but why
you're mad at me about that I don't know
the doctor just thought because I was
shaking so bad and everything that I was
showing the signs of having Parkinson's
disease well I found out that there's
really no actual true test for
Parkinson's disease you either keep
getting worse and they try to cure it or
you don't have it well I don't have it
and I'm very very blessed and thankful
that I don't have it it was really
scaring me to death
so that's a totally you know that's in
the past and it's gone the only thing
that I'm gonna be doing now is having a
couple more of these trigger point
injections on my shoulder
they've already relieved the tension
from from those herniated discs in my
neck and I'm gonna tell you that alone
felt so much better I can't even
describe to you the amount of pain that
it was causing every time I literally
moved or anything my neck and my arm
would make all these weird crazy loud
sounds and then I'd be in excruciating
pain and in fact the day after the
surgery on Thursday was probably the
most painful day of my entire life on
the history of the planet Earth
I don't know what happened what was
going on but I guess it was a problem
you know because I obviously went under
the scalpel and had that stuff but I'm
Thursday I was literally in so much pain
that I just sat in my bed ridden and I
was like oh my god can I get rid of this
and no matter what kind of pain pills I
took no matter what I tried to do to get
things to alleviate the pain it just did
not work luckily though on Friday I woke
up on Friday morning and the pain had
kind of alleviated
on Saturday it was a little bit better
and on Sunday kind of still the same and
today it's still kind of the same I have
moderate pain right through here the
muscles still hard as a rock they're
still like a giant you know muscle
that's all contracted there and that's
what we're gonna be trying to work on to
get now is to get those muscles to stop
contracting and causing me so much pain
I still can barely breathe I can breathe
but when I breathe in really deeply it
just hurts all in my sternum and
everything else due to this you know to
to this injury so right now we're gonna
be coming back to work we'll be back in
black we're gonna be filming videos
again and trying to run the channel if
it's normal thing I try to do the
website and the forum and all that stuff
but due to my help I really haven't been
able to focus on that as well as I like
so I'll be making some announcements on
Twitter and other places or I want to
actually find a crew that I can work
with who can handle working in the
forums and handle working with the
website and helped me with those things
part of the business doing the videos
and stuff me and G can handle that as
long as I don't get an excruciating pain
again I don't see there being any
problem with us continuing on doing our
videos we've got some cool stuff coming
up I got a really cool r2d2 robot that's
really neat I think you guys have really
liked it especially fans of Star Wars
you guys thanks so cool man and we'll be
bringing that to the table and we've
just got all kinds of other stuff we've
got cool cases we got more build so but
bottom line of this video is that I
think that I am past the worst of this
I've had relatively pain-free days for
the past few days I'm functioning I'm
eating I'm no longer using the bathroom
of myself or throwing up so I'm really
very thankful for that
I finally feel like I've you know got
out of the woods saw that light at the
end of the tunnel and moved past that
so I wanted once again thank all of you
people out there with your support the
kind messages the kind emails everything
you guys have been such a great great
help and before I get out of here I just
want to spend a special thanks out to
Kyle from bit wit and Paul from Paul's
hardware they've reached out to me as
well they're gonna be coming and
visiting me next weekend hopefully with
that I can actually integrate being able
to do a little bit more with these guys
and other guys in the industry because I
like to spread out and we're
with other people I know I feel my even
myself that in some ways we stagnated
and what we've done and we need serious
change but after what I just went
through coming so close to death I'm
ready for massive change I know there
needs to be change and I'm my personally
and mairead to make it so you guys will
see some big changes here on tech of
tomorrow so stay tuned we'll be back
with regular videos from here on out
unless some weird thing happened so I'm
praying to God it doesn't we should be
good peace and thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
