Audemar with more of our coverage from
CES 2014 now a lot of times you don't
cover TVs but these TVs were just a
little bit too cool to pass up when we
were doing our Intel meeting and this is
a company called hisense now what we
found out about this company is that
these guys are actually the number one
company for doing this type of
technology in China and fifth largest in
the world that's probably due the fact
they have a lot of things going on with
this company one of the main things is
this technology called Vita it's like
having a smart TV that's even smarter
they have a 3-2 button program remote
control comes in multiple colors and
this thing's like a wizard because
basically it'll handle all the chores
that you need to do for operating any
type of device via TV your DVD any type
of thing so this video technology is
going to be hitting the market they have
tvs all the way up to incredible 85
inches they also have really cool stuff
as far as seeing your face and having
facial recognition you guys can see some
of this is pretty funny media's the
Cameron made a few weird faces here as
we're doing this then we also got to see
a demonstration of completely hands-free
technology so basically be waving our
hands around the air you know somebody's
gonna think you're on crackers I'm drawn
through you're waving your hands wrap
they see it for another place but you
could actually be operating your TV on
one of these new license TVs and we have
a couple shots here from the demo of
them doing this is I thought was pretty
cool now one of the big things about the
entire show though is curved TVs that's
right curved TVs are hitting the market
you guys seen there with some other
videos out about the one they made by
samsung but the one being made by
samsung currently right now is not
shipping now hisense also told me that
their products are available at new aide
walmart in a lot of different places so
if you're looking for this brand you
want to check them out what a link down
below
check out some products from them and
you guys can tell us what you think if
you have your experience now the TV that
they have its curved but it's
permanently curved doesn't offer any
changing whatsoever you can't make it go
back and flex back it's just straight up
a curved TV but it looks badass also
roku big company I have a couple their
boxes they're great for streaming movies
and TV they have actually one of these
TVs with builtin Roku right into it so
that's pretty much it folks these guys
from hisense make a lot of products I
don't know how many of them actually
shipping into the u.s. right now but
like I said they have tvs all the way up
to eighty five inches which is
incredible i wish i had one in my living
room now they didn't have an 85 inch
curved TV quite yet i'm sure that's the
future but hey thanks for watching I
hope you guys really like checking out
this type of technology CES 2014 has a
lot of stuff to offer we try to bring
you guys to coverage the stuff that we
know our fans like and we thought you
guys would be interested in this video
