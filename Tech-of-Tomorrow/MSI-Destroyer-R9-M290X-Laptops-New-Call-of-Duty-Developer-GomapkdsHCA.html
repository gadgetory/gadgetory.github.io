back once again to techyv tomorrow for
another edition of tech news that's
right so what's going on we'll check it
out top stories this week start off with
msi doing the refresh on their GX
destroyer laptop series now these things
are going to be pretty awesome they're
gonna have be two miles that are coming
out the GX 70 and the GX 60 and those
are gonna only be like the only two
miles i think currently right now that
we're gonna see with all of the bells
and whistles they're gonna contain eight
n processors and they're gonna contain
r9 290x graphics so picture that a10
290x all in a package that's going to be
red and black with our dragon stuff and
it's gonna have some really cool stuff
has their dragon gaming center the GDC
and this stuff's totally cool offers a
lot of different options things like
totally monitoring your computer telling
you when it needs new drivers how hot it
is what's up with all the stuff about it
now the GX 70 is going to have a 17 inch
monitor the GX 60 is going to have a 15
inch monitor there's a lot of other
specs that are out there but these
things are gonna really kick ass so
probably a little bit pricey but they're
gonna be really cool there's also some
other unique things about these things
that are coming out as well so if you
guys are minted in this and want to see
more information check out the full
story over on our website WWE tomorrow
calm at the end of the video we'll do a
roundup and we'll talk about it all and
all the information like usual we'll be
down in the description so what else is
going on in the news okay everybody out
there knows Call of Duty now there's
gonna be some changes now the last time
this thing's been going around they had
a bunch of different developers that
were involved but they're gonna change
things around quite a bit so let's talk
a bit about that Activision Blizzard has
now announced as part of their 2013 q4
report that one of the largest
franchises Call of Duty will now be
developed in three years cycles coming
from three different developers
currently CEO D has been getting
released from to alternating developers
Treyarch who's responsible for world at
war and black ops 1 and 2 and infinite
which was responsible for modern warfare
one through three and most recently
ghosts though several team members left
after mw2 while three ghosts were
co-developed with sledgehammer games
well as of now sledgehammer games has
graduated to being in control of its own
co d series and will be responsible for
the release later this year Treyarch and
a reform infinity ward will continue
their current series black ops and
ghosts meaning that each game within
this series will now have a development
time of three years rather than two this
innovation will hopefully bring a bunch
of new things in the game breed new
blood and hopefully make the series even
better than it ever has me personally
I'm not the biggest co D guy I think
it's more of a console game whenever
ports over the graphics aren't that
really that great maybe things will
change in the future we can hope so at
least hey I hope so now last story up

are hitting the market and now a Zeus

seventy nine dollars asus is announced
