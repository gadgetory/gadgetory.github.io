tackle over here for Elric with tech
tomorrow and he looks much better now
and i'm really glad to see that he's up
and walking and smiling and just full of
energy and also i show a little and kill
cute huh anyway I'm back today for an
episode on my top five favorite
keyboards so let's get started the first
keyboard on my mind is the k70 RGB and I
know it was like super super like highly
anticipated last year and it doesn't
disappoint so I really really love the
RGB lighting of course I mean that was I
believe at the time the only keyboard of
its kind to do that and the soft floor
does need a bit of tweaking as in the
group lighting effect is still you know
not as user-friendly but I have to say
that being able to program the rainbow
any kind of rainbow effect that you want
and the speed as well as the type of
effect like wave ripple I mean that's
just really sick I mean it's probably
the only keyboard of his kind that is
that complicated in its lighting effects
and unlike the original k 7d the RGB
does come with a fully programmable
board which is always cool especially if
you play a lot of games and you just
have to set a lot of macros things like
that it's also very complex but I'd say
complex in a good way
now what I do wish it had were pbt
keycaps I know they used to be very
popular but I think they should start
bringing them back however I did replace
my current set with a whole set of white
vortex ppt caps and LEDs look amazing
with it next up on the list is another
RGB keyboard the Razer BlackWidow chroma
and I have to say the how bright you
know the lighting is how intense it is
it was very impressive and I don't know
how they were able to do it but it's
just one bulb on top of the housing
whereas the case 70 the bulb is there
bulbs are under this clear housing
and also really like how simple the
software is it's very user friendly but
you know on the other hand it's a bit
too simple in some ways as in there
weren't enough lighting effects you
couldn't add you know certain lighting
effects to a certain group however I
believe they've changed up and I don't
have it on me today I'm sorry but you
could definitely check it out on my
channel the full review anyway but yeah
that's the Razer BlackWidow chroma and
let's move away from RGB lighting
tutto praise that was also a big deal in
the last year even though topiaries
aren't exactly new but I think
Coolermaster made them a bit more
mainstream last year anyway so I'm gonna
talk about the Coolermaster nova touch
what i like about it is that it's got
this stealth look to it not too many
logos and the top reefs which is more of
a silent variant if you compare it next
to them around for example they should
be more quiet and also with this top
price which you get a faster debounce
time that means quick responses so for
gaming it's really good and for a
Tofurky board they do include I believe
media keys and the windows lock and that
wasn't heard of anyway until I saw that
and as for cons I think that of course
there's no LED backlighting however once
again bringing back the vortex pvt
keycaps it is possible to have clear
legends so hopefully they'll introduce
them and one last thing is that no
programmability so no macros or anything
like that
but you know maybe some of you don't
need it for gaming so next up like Kula
roster this one came before it this is
the real force 87 you
it's a white tank ILA's top or a
keyboard and oh my goodness it feels
like butter it's like your fingers are
gliding on but it's a quite amazing and
I would say it's even more silent than
the Nova touch which for some of you
might be a perk and also it's compact
but I know some of you you know need a
numpad kind of like me I crunch numbers
anyway and they do have a dedicated
numpad in a very interesting location
like congi like middle set of keys I
believe
and they're on the lower key cap their
only key kept put on the bottom edge and
it works I mean you know and I just
thought that was a really unique and
that stood out to me also I love that
it's PBT keycaps I mean that's quality
right there quality and as for the
clones like the Nova touch the real
force 87 you that one also doesn't have
LED backlighting
I mean maybe for the caps lock but like
overall or you know any macro
programmability function but tape like I
said not for everybody and last not
least does the ducky shine floor also
really really exciting keyboard from
last year I believe it released November
2014 but do not quote me on that
and with ducky it is all about the
lighting whereas even the sound all of
that the thing is about the bass anyway
so it's all about the light and what's
cool about it is you don't need software
to run it although it's a little bit
complicated in that you have to kind of
remember memorize that function and what
keys go with what in order to get the
lighting effect that you want with the
lighting profile that you want and well
let's just say once you play with it a
bit it becomes a lot easier and also I
really really love some of the effects
that ducky has it's different from what
I've seen on other keyboards for example
a lot of keyboards have ripple or wave
but ducky has something called what does
I call the ringing effect
it's like pitter-pattering on your
keyboard and it looks like it's raining
but different colors so that is really
cool but unfortunately it's not RGB
because they only gave you two colors
red and blue but I'm hoping or thinking
that by next year are by the end of this
year they will bring out the RGB version
meaning they're just gonna introduce you
know a green you know LED switch so that
you can adjust the red and the blue and
the Greens to the intensity level that
you want to achieve the color that you
want
however it's probably not gonna be true
RGB you know 16.8 million colors or
anything like that but total thing is
gonna be pretty fun I mean with the
naked eye help you know most people
can't tell anyway but yeah
and also as for the lighting effects I
think it might be less complicated if
they did have some software but there
aren't too many cause of Ducky's I think
they are also really solid keyboard in
terms of quality as in dual air PCB
solid steel things like that one kind of
annoying con for the ducky shine for if
you're a gamer and use the windows lock
key a lot is that you'll have to flip a
dip switch on the bottom of the keyboard
in order to lock windows no one wants
that I mean it would be nice if it was
just on the keyboard even if it was just
a function key but yeah that's that's
what I have to say about to be a shy boy
well I guess that wraps up my personal
look at the top five favorite keyboards
of I guess you could say 2014 and hey
buddy
I think you've shed like 10 pounds of
fur on me that's a great way to go isn't
it all righty I hope you enjoyed this
video and if you want to see more about
these keyboards go ahead and check out
my channel Joanne tech lover all the
reviews are on there if you want a
closer look and I really enjoy being
here love seeing Jesus as well as the
Elric of course well thanks for having
me take them tomorrow I'll see you later
bitches yeah
just kidding bye
I'm buddy I mean this is buddy I'm Joann
and all right here we go
I think he's farting it's okay I'm so
used to just fart like whatever okay um
that's not leak one time I said okay
