it tomorrow I'm mark Faris your host and
today we got an unboxing first look an
overall review of a brand new case from
the people over at inter max you guys
can see this is one giant huge size full
tower case in front of me this is the
new full moe g-e-t so now you guys can
see the front of the box so now folks
let's take a look at the back of the box
at the top we can see it says the full
mode GT when take a step downwards can
talk about some of the features you guys
can see it automatically supports dual
PSU positions supports hptx motherboards
you guys can see it is the EVGA SRX
motherboard in there we've talked about
that board before we're actually doing a
review on it 10x HDD bays internal USB
3.0 for the fastest data transfers easy
removable top cover 23 centimeter
monster fan for supreme cooling
performance tool is designed for easy
installation once again 10 X PCI slots
support squad graphics cards top hop
swapped up which means you can put like
an HDD or a hard drive right on top just
like a lot of products that are out
there pretty cool robust wheels with
breaks for utmost mobility and stability
so that's going to be pretty cool it's
gonna roll around the floor with the
case this size you're kind of wanted to
because this is a huge full tower case
integrated LED and speed control for up
to three fans sorry not you seen the
other front of the box in the back of
the box let me turn the thing to the
side here actually you know some folks
probably will want to see this as well
so I will just have the cameraman focus
in on this real quick so you guys can
see all this I won't talk on a lot to
you guys I'm sure you guys can read this
off to yourselves
so I'm gonna take my trusty knife down
I'm going to take it up through the top
of the case make a nice quick insertion
right here another one on the other side
pull this up this over to the flight in
the center groove clickety clackety
clickety clackety all right now while I
pull this thing out of the box we will
now throw the knife at you the audience
and I challenge you to duck so probably
the easiest way to get it out is the
turnip lay down and then just pull it
out so I'm gonna do that now I'm good
turn it put around at the front side
back side take the box and step it off
to the side even through shipping though
we can see there was no damage that's
good tall nice fold up in package there
this thing is coming to market also
folks at about two hundred and nineteen
dollars that's what I'm hearing so it's
like the $200 range $219 so let me go
ahead and set this down all right well
so let's take a look at the bottom of
the case you're at the back all rubber
feet now remember they're also going to
have wheels so it'll be wheels that
you'll be able to put in this case to
wheel it around here's one of the
removable grills right here on the
bottom more rubber up here so I'll put
the thing around put it on the bottom
side and we'll continue along doing
these big on case unboxings is a little
bit difficult because they're just well
they're freaking huge man they're weigh
a ton
so here we go though let's go get it
here make it all all magical beautiful
some nice music here
Cameron
all right so now here we at least we got
out of the box so we'll flip it around
the front here you guys can see the
front of it so I try to stay in camera
range
lots of bays lots of space
let's see if the front pump is pulls
completely off so you guys saw that I
mean it really wasn't that difficult it
sounds more dangerous does that pops off
really really loudly but you guys can
see the front grille does come
completely off it's removable
inside there's filters keep the dust out
a couple of sharp edges in there plastic
edges kind of cut myself differ so
slightly right there so something to
take note of for intermix folks clean
those edges up just a little bit not the
end of the world but here we are here's
the inside so you can see that if you
want more bays they're removable you
just pop these little plates out one of
the cameramen and then just stop all
right now flip it up on top get the
camera to zoom in so you guys can see
this stuff really nicely he say that
four USB 3.0 headphones microphone reset
start fan fan control plus on the inside
right here is where you actually can
stick in a standard hard drive or an SSD
that's right you're on top you just get
one of those bad boys slide it in there
and it's easily mountable right there so
now if we walk to the side the side
panel doesn't have a window but it does
have two giant size fans these things
are huge if you want you can probably
take this off and customize it and do
whatever you want so let me start up let
me take these side screws off here a
couple of them
by the way these were very easy to take
off I mean that the hassle anything or
doing anything we're they just were
easily taken off pull that here's the
side let's flip it around so you guys
can see it you said two fans on the
inside connections let me go ahead and
just take that set that off to the side
now we can see just the well the huge
amount of room that's on the inside of
this case I mean this is pretty much the
biggest case I think I've ever almost
looked into other than like just you
know the super huge ones are a few out
there that it's bigger much saying it's
the only one but you post that admit I
mean this thing's frickin huge I mean
look at the inside of this thing so
basically you can install a Sherman tank
in here a couple of area bays and
probably an aircraft carrier and also
inside highway tailgate wrong things are
good now like I said before it'll fit
the SRX motherboard we have that
motherboard we're actually working with
rows one a project right there using the
one of their things but this case would
be a really nice one so I think that I'm
going to integrate the a Zeus
motherboard inside of this one now since
we got some projects going on a thin on
the inside you can see there's more fan
control more fan plugs right here
there's all kinds of open base for your
cable management plenty of room right
here behind the CPU to be able to access
it I mean there's ten of these bad boys
right here
the angle is kind of hard for me to pull
it out they're actually a lot easier and
do the math but if the angles kind of
weird for me so you got ten of these all
the way down amazing
got some more room right in here here's
all your other stuff right here through
USB 3.0 there's all your front you know
how a connectivity so all this stuff's
going to be able to hook up to your
motherboard so that all that front panel
stuff will be able to be used including
some of the fan stuff it's actually
pretty cool now before I show you the
back there's a fan another connector
this is room for nine video cards in
here so let me Tommy so you're gonna be
able to do four-way SLI four-way
crossfire no problem at all it's geared
for water cooling let's slip it around
here you guys can see with all the
different holes and everything it's got
enough things for in and out for any
type of water cooling that you're gonna
want to be doing dual places for the
power supply you spoke of before now
let's take off the other side once again
very easy to list design the only reason
is making a lot of noise folks of ways a
lot I mean it's a very heavy duty case
made of steel so it's not no flimsy
thing you can actually put another fan
right here if you'd like let me move
that and just get that out of the way
now can you decide and hole does the
word yeah yeah you mean hell yeah oh
yeah there's plenty of room in here for
field management put this thing around
put my whole hand back in here you got
plenty of room
for cable management in this system and
plenty of holes to do it in man just
from first glance alone I'm gonna say
this is probably gonna be an editor's
choice product here at Echo tomorrow I
mean this thing is just a really nice
got plenty of room its giant size cable
man is gonna be off the hook I
understand that this top thing slides
off as well so I'll just continue on
dissecting the thing so let's check out
more about the case folks so here's the
top part again don't want to make sure I
don't miss anything because there's so
much to talk about I could easily miss
something so this comes off now check
this out also inside of this when you
spin this around better so you guys can
get a go on too
yeah there's some cool options don't
check out you have a fan right here so
you can remove the stand if you want and
you can put a radiator here and then
check it out for us there's probably
enough room right here if you modded it
out you can't possibly have a radiator
appear on top or at least have the fans
on top and the radiator inside depending
on the design so this thing's totally
decked out totally ready to go ready for
water cooling it's ready for air cooling
it's coming to market at about two
hundred dollars like I said before I
think it's a very very nice case from
first looks and everything I'm really
have to say this is an editor's choice
product here at Echo tomorrow let me
hear your guys's comments we'll see you
later as they get Anthony Reynolds our
tech to build us a badass system
featuring the a Zeus motherboard so
peace out we'll see you guys back here
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
