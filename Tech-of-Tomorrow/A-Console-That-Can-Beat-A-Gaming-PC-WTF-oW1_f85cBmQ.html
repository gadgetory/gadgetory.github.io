you guys here now today's video is
brought to you by none other than buddy
the dog that's right my little pup so
check this out in the video I brought
out a day ago I talked to you guys about
a bunch of different things going on in
the industry and how I thought that a
console could actually take over the PC
industry and drop it to its knees
literally with a few changes and I'm
being honest about this if you could do
completely everything on your console
that you could do on a PC you would
totally not buy a PC anymore whatsoever
you'd have really no need for it because
like I said gaming fuels the PC industry
without gaming there would really be no
PC industry there be no innovation no
Drive no competition no gaming teams out
there no AMD and video fighting it out
no Intel lawsuits none of that stuff
will be going on excuse me
so you pull the gaming out of PC where
does that really leave the PC industry I
mean if you're not building stuff or
doing cat and designing stuff you know
for space programs or something like
that and you're not designing it for 3d
gaming then I mean pretty much the only
people who are gonna need pcs and
computers probably at all are gonna be
people who are working because if a
console could let you do everything like
I said as your computer did obviously I
think prices would probably rise so I've
been thinking about this I want to hear
what you guys think about this because I
think this would be the ultimate thing
so console starts out at 399 goes up to
$4.99 maybe starting at 300 what the
dependent of the technology goes but
here's how it would be you'd have a 399
you know maybe $4.99 maybe even a $5.99
super top of the line which is depending
on how things go but check this out what
it would be is everything complete in
your package when you get it okay
so when you get it it would come with
wireless keyboard wireless mouse you
know all the stuff that you need for
gaming and everything right there in the
box including a keyboard that you could
type on a word type program
be able to do all this stuff now right
now on the new Xbox on the PlayStation
so you know you can browse the web a
little bit and yeah you can watch
YouTube and that stuff but you can't
write letters there's just a lot of
stuff that you can't do now obviously
this would probably take a little bit
more processor power but if Intel got
together with these companies than
Dental you should probably listen to
this because you've kind of gone off on
the deep end on some weird stuff this
could really help build your market
again get with the console guys and get
a console because I gotta be honest to
you after playing on my big-screen TV
for the last week and playing games I
like it I mean it doesn't have the same
great refresh rate obviously as my
monitors but that predator monitor cost
me almost 1,200 bucks so you know
instead of you know spending $1200 for
PC that sits in my room we're not on why
not actually have it and especially with
these newer TVs out there why not just
spend another you know $1000 or get a TV
for like 24 2,500 bucks if you're really
gonna go for it and you have the
ultimate entertainment your living room
you have your TV and you now have this
console now the thing that would be
different about consoles as well is the
upgrade ability factor so let's just say
the 399 won the entry-level one that's
your basic model you know it comes with
a little bit of storage space you know
it has the it has the weakest of the
video cards and it has the least of
great ability but as you go up the up
great ability factor would change so we
would say the model that's $5.99 you'd
be able to change out the video card
what if they did this instead of
actually making these giant old big old
video cards that slot in why don't they
just kind of make a GPU change that you
can just change and pop on there like
they could do that like they could make
it varies like the CPU you guys all know
the better your GPU unless your CPU is a
pile of crap it's really not going to be
taking that many frame rates off what's
going on you guys know that so if
there's a really really topo line video
card and you still want to put it your
new in your new Xbox ultimate you could
go out and change that and make that
system last for a few more years so
instead of just being able to last a gen
you could be able to have this thing
glass for two or three generations and
as they're changing the tech they could
change it around so the next models that
actually came out made it so you could
change
everything the CPU the GPU the memory it
can be done I mean the way the PC is
market is and the way they just use
gaming against us and these video card
you know things were they're going up in
price and nobody can afford stuff this
is just kind of ridiculous man I'm
really like pissed off the PC industry
like I said in the video this is the
absolute worst time in the PC history
ever for building a personal PC
it's just ridiculous not so much a
personal PC but anything that has to do
with gaming so I mean if you want to buy
this - motherboard and you know you use
the CPU and use it to power your
graphics with the ombr√© graphics those
things work fine for anybody out there
who surfs the net plays poker it'll even
play some of those games like wow and
that stuff I know play it you know
halfway decent you're not gonna get all
the bells and whistles but if you want
to play it you'll still be able to play
it so cut out the gaming thing move
gaming over to consoles with a bunch of
different options and I honestly see the
PC industry completely changing because
right now they rule the field so every
time they say gaming PC gaming monitor
gaming this we're all spending our
hard-earned cash to pay more for that
because our basic instinct of want want
want like I said before you know we all
want good food we all want great sex we
want hot chicks we want want want one
it's kind of what drives people I think
is there want so the more you want want
want want want gaming well guess what
the more you'll pay for but if there was
a console that I could sit in my living
room with and in the comfort of my
living room with my food right there and
everything and chilling out and I could
type all my letters do all my work make
all my YouTube videos live for you guys
and everything else that would be really
really awesome and like I said there
still would be PC market but it would be
more for people who were like editing
the videos making the videos or making
the game that you play on the consoles
and the PCs but if the console people
would just step up their game just a wee
bit the whole market the entire dynamic
would totally utterly change what do you
guys think man I mean I've been thinking
a little bit and I honestly think this
would be the absolute cure to the PC
market and their high prices so hey I
would appreciate it if you guys like
