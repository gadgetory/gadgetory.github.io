others it's fun of hate but either way
apples always coming out with new
products and they talked about a lot of
them this week also nvidia 9 series
stuff is coming and dell has announced a
5k monitor now obvious this week if you
guys pay attention the apple stuff you
know they talked about three new things
iphone 6 iphone 6 plus and their new
watch now the watch doesn't come out
till 2015 so not really too much to talk
about there but tonight for those who do
care they're going to announce their
pre-order that's right so now you got to
make a decision do you want the iphone 6
where do you want the iphone 6 plus now
obviously iphone 6 plus since its plus
is going to be a lot better has a bigger
5.5 inch screen versus the 4.7 inch
screen it's got more pixels per square
inch and it's actually true 1080 instead
of the 750 on the iphone 6 so you're got
to go home or do these things really
matter to me cuz I'm you're going to be
like okay it's bigger well for me I
always liked the note 3 so if it's
bigger it's gonna be able to easier to
see for me that's gonna be one thing
that I'm clearly going to be saying I'm
gonna be drawn more towards that but
other people could be going no I don't
want to carry that bulky ass thing
around at all I want something more
lightweight now there's going to be some
other features that are on the plus
sitting better as well you're going to
get better stabilization and you're
going to get better landscape features
so all in all the plus is going to have
a lot more stuff on it but if it's not
something that you want because of the
size and everything and you're going
obviously be pushed to the iphone 6
another thing to take note of is the
battery life sure you guys can see that
the plus obviously has better life in
the standard iphone 6 and for many
people out there this may be a deciding
factor in your ultimate decision now
obviously i know that a lot of my people
out there to view it they're not Apple
fans their pc masterrace guys but hey I
know that some of you guys out there do
love the apple stuff so tonight it'll be
time to make that decision if you want
to pre-order and get this thing going so
would like to know from you guys is
leave a comment down below if you do
like these products and what you think
about them we'd like to hear about it
next up in the news its King ringing on
the nvidia
front and what seems to be really weird
is that Nvidia seems they've just skip
the aid series off together and
transition into the night so it seems
that video carts com has posted alleged
benchmarks of all these nine series
carved in three mark fire strike the
geforce gtx 980 sits pretty high with a
score of thirteen thousand and five and
is only trumped by dual GPU
configurations for reference the gtx
780ti boasted a score of twelve thousand
seven hundred and two these dudes have
posted three different clock speeds for
the gtx 980 and that's because video
cards com was unable to confirm from
Nvidia which is the actual reference
clock the thirteen thousand and five
score represents the fastest clock
version and a car with an eleven hundred
and ninety megahertz core Nvidia's new
flagship gtx 980 is also rumored to
feature four gigabytes of gddr5 memory
on a 256-bit bus and a seven gigahertz
memory clock now with that said though
we are attending an event at Santa
Monica and hangar something or another
with NVIDIA so maybe on that date we'll
hear more stick around 720p you're
kidding 1080p and 1444 que ha Dell says
5k dell's new 27 inch pixel monster the
ultra sharp 27 Ultra HD 5k monitor packs
a resolution of 50 120 x 2880 with 218
pixels per inch the display does come
packed with a color depth of 1 billion
colors a mini DisplayPort for 4k input
216 want Harman Kardon speakers six USB
ports and an SD card reader refresh
rates are something you want really to
get the information on right now but I'm
sure soon will be will bring it to you
now this thing's not really ready to
come to market though until Q 4 2015 so
basically not this Christmas but next
Christmas you can stick this bad boy
under your Christmas tree and it's
priced right now at twenty-five hundred
dollars but I guarantee you that
probably by the time it comes out it'll
be a little bit lower because there'll
be more competition alright folks so
that pretty much wraps up today's video
but before I get out of here you guys
all know we've been talking about
bullies oh
true crazy systems in fact going to be
building one on Intel's x99 platform
it's going to feature two of AMD's
latest r9 290 5x two cards from XFX
that's right if we're going to have to
start testing in 4k so with that said
we're going to have to buy a monitor so
we're going to do is we're going to link
a few down below and we'd like to hear
from you guys which one you guys think
that we should buy and why so please
