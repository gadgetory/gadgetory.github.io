check out another system and I just want
to say you right off the bat that I'm
not necessarily saying this is a system
recommended for you to go build because
some of these parts are probably not
even available anymore so basically it's
like this of my room I didn't have
anything to watch TV game or anything
else I just an older Mac in there so I
was like I really want to upgrade my
room have something that I can not only
play my games on but watch my movies and
all the round system for myself that's
right it's a little selfish little
system I should call that system the
selfish system cuz it's all for me but
anyways it's not this isn't called the
king's throne it's pretty cool system I
think you guys are going to like it now
I want to say something many people out
there live in rural areas or they just
don't have the technical skills to build
these crazy liquid cool systems with all
hard and pipes and looking like the
badass you can get from some of
these crazy you know build sites for
five grand but if your needs areas you
want to build yourself a system well
today's video you can use there as a
kind of guide you can watch anthony
build the system see how he does the
cable management see how everything's
done and all of the parts other than
pretty much i think the case are still
available so you can put those in any
case you want cuz i know people are very
picky about it so if you don't like this
case you don't even have to use it you
can find a case that's similar to it and
build your system around it because
beyond that the parts in the system are
pretty amazing now there are no moving
drives at this moment none absolutely
none
there are moving fans on the video cards
and to keep the system running but all
of the drives are PCI SSD or m2 SSD
making this thing freakin fast as hell
quiet and there's absolutely no moving
drives which means that you know that's
just just going to be very fast and
access everything super quick so with
that said though let's check out my new
personal system the king's throne
so starting up obviously we're gonna be
using a Roseville case now this is the
throne this is a bad ass case though it
looks really cool the whole front lights
up blue it's white it's got a window the
windows kind of trippy though because I
had this giant fan in it that I couldn't
see the system and so we just took that
damn thing off all the way and you'll
see we do the system build that we just
have that completely off now this case
is no longer available through Amazon or
anybody I couldn't find this case maybe
you could find one out there but it does
look nice when you see the build you'll
see it there's just so much room inside
of the throne that cable management
multiple cards power supplies tons of
tons of hard drives are just totally
able to be stuck inside this thing but
if you want to do the build in black the
black case is actually available for 89
bucks which is a pretty cool deal for a
case this size because it competes with
some of the bigger cases with some of
the bigger names the motherboard is the
asrock LGA 2011 v3 x99 taichi now this
motherboard not only looks awesome it
functions very very well it's laid out
nicely you can do an SLI build with no
problem whatsoever the price is pretty
decent it's not up in the 500 just
around the $200 range and just for the
looks and all the features with it I
felt it was a great choice for this
build the CPU is the Intel Core i7 6800
k processor now this thing can turbo
mode up to 3.6 gigahertz it's priced at
about four hundred and fourteen dollars
so it's still a little bit expensive but
this is a very fast CPU one of the most
expensive parts in the system however is
the PCI Express 3.0 intel SSD now this
is the 750 series its 1.2 terabytes
this thing's incredible but it's 770
dollars so it's almost a thousand
dollars just for the SSD I'm now the
king of excess and the other drive I
have in the system this thing's brand
new from Corsair and this is the Corsair
force MP 500 series now this is an m2
Drive
it's 480 gigabytes and trust me m2 is
absolutely amazingly fast so you can
store a lot of games on for Nady
gigabytes and they're gonna be accessed
like
for the memory I wanted something that
was not only fast but looked cool so I
asked the people who are Patriot they
had anything and they sent me a really
cool 32 gigabyte kid now this is just
two sticks of twenty hundred megahertz
ddr4 it's the Viper elite series and
though it looks cool for cooling the CPU
we wanted something that was really nice
but could fit right inside the case
without any problem we found that in the
Corsair Hydra series h100 eye now this
is an all-in-one liquid cooler that'll
keep your CPU running cool and it fits
this system just perfectly as we had
absolutely no problem sticking it inside
the throne case which you'll see in the
build for the video cards I decided to
go once again with two GeForce GTX 1080
founders edition cards and sli why
because I really like these cards in the
future if I decide I want to
liquid-cooled them I can easily pull
that cover off and any of the major
brands I can stick their liquid cooler
on it and upgrade my system even farther
and make it totally liquid cooled and
powering up this throne system is once
again something BIOS will now this is a
1300 watt 80 plus gold certified power
supply called the lightning 1300 and
this thing is pretty damn bitchin it
lights up all the different connections
are modular and those light up different
colors as well so you can get a lot of
different colors inside your build going
with the thing and with 1300 watts it
doesn't matter what I want to stick
inside this thing you know it's gonna
power it with lots of room to breathe
one thing I want to take note because I
know that people gonna say hey man Wow
13 or what power supply is like overkill
it's a waste but I'm gonna be honest
with you in a lot of ways it's really
not if you're using a really SuperDuper
high end power supply and you have lots
of room on it that's not being used that
means your power supply is not being
stressed at all and it's gonna last much
longer
so now that we've seen that let's check
out Anthony Reynolds our man in house
and show you a time-lapse video of him
putting the system completely together
and believe it or not following these
methods with a little time and a little
patient you could build a system just
like this for yourself now let's check
out that time let's build
change
so that was pretty cool right Anthony
building that system in a time lapse and
what's best of all is that for you
people out there who don't have the
technical skill to build some crazy
liquid cool system with hard pipes and
all these crazy stuff
you can actually build this build there
was nothing that was done this build
that takes some great superior technical
knowledge or great neo mechanical skill
to build if you take your time you can
do a build like this yourself now if
that said though let's run a few tests
and let's check out how the system
performs now some of the tests that we
did especially Geekbench we actually
tested against the very highest end iMac
that you can get now the IMAX supposed
to be the superior computer for doing
all your editing and all that stuff
people you know rave on and on about it
well this system in multi-core is
actually faster in single core since the
iMac has a 4.0 processor and this has a
3.6 gigahertz it gets beat and single
but in pretty much everything else the
throne just kicks its ass
we tested in both 1440 and 4k and you
guys can see that this machine kicks ass
in gaming even 4k stuff is being played
great some games being over a hundred
frames per second some a little under
but overall just kicking ass obviously
because some games are gonna be
different than others
the scores are different but overall
it's kickin ass alright so there you
have it the lord of excess system the
king's throne where i can go like this i
look down at you you pc peasants down my
studios no but honestly you guys know
this system has a lot of expensive parts
it's pretty much the lord of excess you
don't honestly need a PCIe SSD but if
you want the absolute killer the
most expensive well then hey we'll
have a link down below to all these
parts once again you guys can make your
own choices about what you want to use
in your build you know I know you can
build a cheaper system out there I'm
quite aware of that I go to PC parts
picker and just cheeps the absolute
stuff and click a button going hey
here's a system anybody can do that but
taking the time to choose the parts
build a system and put it all together
that's a different thing my main theme
about this for you folks is though is
that you could actually build this
system you don't need any great
knowledge I've been stressing that
throughout the entire video but if you
want to do this build
like I said down below at like button
which you better do something with will
be all the information now I'll be
making a few more change in the system
like I'm gonna be putting in a blu-ray
player and then I'm gonna get bent a
bunch of hard drives and run them in
raid so I can store all my movies and
all my music and all that and make this
the ultimate multimedia and gaming
system so I'm Mel Eric you've been
watching tikka tomorrow and before I go
out of here let me just once again say
yeah pc peasants
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
