heard that good things come in small
packages not a small package right here
ce2 km 11 deluxe that's right I couldn't
memorize all these numbers off of the
bat now this thing's supposed to feature
the latest AMD technology it's basically
based for a thin client type user it's
going to be very low power
very high efficiency very quiet and very
cool you guys can see that JJ has the
Kingston logo memory on here fits this
perfectly and now we'll let JJ just tell
you guys some of the real specifics that
make this thing a quality component yeah
so this is an awesome new board for the
users that are really interested in that
kind of small form-factor everyday box
you know they want to be able to go on
YouTube get some great quality web
decoding performance but like you said
the energy efficient but then also maybe
you'll switch over to some casual gaming
be able to load up you know steam play
different games over it stuff like
Awesomenauts you know burn out you know
Battlefield Heroes and be able to get
some really gameplay great gameplay
performance in terms of fps so this is
using the new and the new AMD Trinity
core so 1.75 gigahertz in terms of the
core clock speed which got a Radeon 70
340 GPU built inside of this so you can
actually have some really nice overall
casual gaming performance right when you
say casual game explains people when we
say casual gaming we mean basically non
first-person shooter games first-person
shooter games are always the most
highest they suck up energy like new
tomorrow and they acquire lots of stuff
with the video card that's on here you
can play anything you can play RPG games
role-playing games any of those type of
games will actually play just fine but
you're not just strictly to Zynga games
trust me ya know hundred percent but
even in terms of FPS depending on the
engine there can be a lot of flexibility
you know I mean if you're somebody
that's still interested in Unreal
Tournament counter-strike yeah oh sure
oh yeah definitely play all kinds of
content so it's really nice to actually
have an updated graphics processors
built in here we've also done some cool
updates in terms of the Wi-Fi so we have
this updated from single band to dual
band so now 2.4 and 5 gigahertz plus
Bluetooth 4.0
comes with the I don't think bullies out
here but actually comes with one these
folks these are the wireless they
actually work very well and they have
great distance on my house is very large
enough big my house is JJ we go to the
very back of my house you hook one of
these up you actually get still really
good reception and I don't have an
approximate but you gave me some
products of yours that actually multiply
the signal yeah those things worked
really well in that yeah well you
actually be seeing some newer stuff that
we're going to showing off in our
networking site but overall you know you
got an awesome media features we have
our Wi-Fi to go which allows you to DL a
media serving to different devices like
tablets or televisions or different
types of devices of course you've got
USB 3 integrated in here with our USB 3
boost and even our network I control
would loves you to do packet priority so
you can get better video decoding
performance or better application
network performance as well so overall a
really rich board the size of my hand
yeah that's the size of your hand and
super cool super quiet the fan can
entirely be controlled so for you guys
this thing operates in terms of whisper
quiet but if you want to be able to
tweak and tune it you can go into our
great software whether it's in the UEFI
or boots in Windows that I deal with
just it so a really nice small factor
for board people looking for HTPC
everyday box or a small form-factor
little gaming box do you know what the
manufacturers sector retail price on
this one is yet we haven't said it but
it's going to be coming to market soon
and generally these boards are priced
pretty competitively use you're going to
be looking somewhere about 182 by 220
dollars
considering that's already got the CPU
yeah just throw memory on as you're gone
to go so so price pretty competitively
but final pricing like I said you know
make sure to just check out to your
favorite retailer and I'm sure it's
going to be available there yeah and one
thing that's really cool about this you
guys are going to see in the future I've
heard that a lot of companies are going
to start developing more cases for these
so right now cases are limited you
pretty much sticking a little tiny
square thing that's what it is but in
the future next year which I guess is
upon us now you're going to see all
kinds of new cases that actually will
accommodate these so you get a choice
which it'd be cool so alright folks see
you guys back here on Tekken tomorrow JJ
take care brother and we'll see you for
another videos thanks for stopping by
