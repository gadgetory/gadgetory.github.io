and their struggled to be number one and
why that struggle is such an uphill
battle for them but real quick let's
check out a word from today's sponsor 0
&amp;amp; 9 if you're the type of person who
builds a lot of PC's or just changes the
parts out inside their PC quite a bit
having an extra Windows 10 Pro key can
be a lifesaver especially if something
happens and all of a sudden your
registration isn't working and right now
at 0 &amp;amp; 9
they have Windows 10 Pro for sixteen
dollars now this is like 84 percent off
but with a coupon code that we're gonna
share with you you'll be able to get the
same code for thirteen dollars that's
right Windows 10 Pro for thirteen
dollars we'll have a link down below
where you guys can check us out on their
website and one thing that's really cool
is you can buy as many keys as you want
so I know that there's some AMD fans out
there will probably get mad at this
video just be like no Elric but
everything I'm gonna be telling you guys
today is absolutely no bullcrap it's
completely true everything I'm saying is
just the facts and that's all they are
they're not my opinions really they're
just really the way things are in the
market it's like get a frog caught in my
throat there today like cough it up I'll
have a little permit thing jump on the
floor but check this out
AMD if you followed them for years and
years and years and years like I have I
follow them since the very very
beginning when the PC industry first
started AMD has always had a place in
the market and that place has always
pretty much been the underdog now I know
some hard core AMD fans are gonna be
like hey man they have had CPUs that
have been faster than Intel and they've
had a video card that's faster than this
guy but just having a better processor
or a better video card for a slight
moment in time is not really the whole
war whatsoever it's not at all it's a
battle in the war and you might win one
battle but the overall war for them is
very very very hard
personally I think it would be really
cool if AMD could rise all the way to
the very top and be number one and the
reason for this is for competition
competitiveness creates diversion in the
market makes things change and is better
for me and you at the end of the day for
the products that we can go buy with our
hard-earned cash so one of the very
first things that AMD has going against
them this has kind of hurt them
traditionally I'll explain this is that
if you're a company especially if you're
a technology company pretty much the
biggest aspect of your company other
than the sales is going to be R&amp;amp;D
research and development which is the
guy who's sitting back in the back
trying to think of the most awesome
thing that he can do out-of-the-box
thinking so that he can come up with a
product that will beat the other guy now
for years
AMD had a report every year about them
losing money not making money this went
on for a long time and so if me or you
or most people had a company that lost
money all the time
we wouldn't be in business we be gonzo
but somehow hey AMD has been around
forever every year they lost money they
still were here now my reasoning is
because they're funded probably by the
federal government or somebody else now
in America we have laws against the
monopolies which means that no one
company can completely dominate a market
so if Intel was the only company around
they would have the monopoly on
absolutely everything
Intel would have the monopoly they don't
the market there'd be no competition
whatsoever
AMD honestly has to exist they have to
exist because they are the competition
for Intel they always have been and now
they've jumped into a totally new market
buying ATI which is probably one of the
smartest things that they ever did
because actually AMD has improved since
then they've gotten better rd they've
gotten better products they've done a
pretty good job of closing the market
between both Intel and NVIDIA but here's
the whole thing about that they're not
only fighting a battle on one front
they're fighting a battle on two fronts
just right there alone they're trying to
dominate in the GPU and the CPU market
no one else is doing this in the entire
world so AMD is actually in a very
unique position where they're at they
actually keep both companies now kind of
in check because Nvidia is really the
only other game for video cards so
there's AMD and NVIDIA and then there's
Intel and there's AMD AMD Nvidia AMD
Intel see the pattern they're like
they're keeping both these companies
from having a monopoly on the market
which is if you think about it it's kind
of crazy stuff right so AMD has their
position but their position for them to
move into the number one spot it would
be very very difficult and is very
difficult for one thing like I said
these guys don't have the money right
now
to invest enough money in R&amp;amp;D to beat
two people on two different fronts maybe
if they just chose one area and focused
on that and kind of let the other one
twiddle you could do that but fighting
two different battles is really really
hard
so the R&amp;amp;D fact that's right there plus
just think about this the overall market
share for AMD right now is probably
between 17 and 22 percent depending on
what's going on and this is because of
name branding if somebody goes into a
store to go buy a computer or their
ordinary computer online from Amazon and
somewhere else traditionally people look
and they go oh Intel Inside and when
they see that they recognize the Intel
name and it's the same thing with Nvidia
honestly in some ways ati actually had
more of a name for themselves in the
video car business than AMD does since
AMD changed the name maybe they should
just have left at ATI that's a whole
another video but right now that's
really what really keeps me afloat even
though they've changed the market with
with the CPUs pretty well the video card
market has really propelled them
quite a long ways now since they only
have a smaller amount of the market
share that means they're making less
money so let's just say that tomorrow
AMD all of a sudden came up with a
better video card than Nvidia and a
better CPU then Intel okay they make it
how long will it take the general public
and the people who go out there and buy
stuff beyond enthusiasts that will
change the markets there so much that
AMD is now getting you know 80% of the
market instead of the other guys getting
that market share that's a real big
thing right there because even if they
had better products the way things are
right now it would still take a few
years probably for them to market the
crap out of stuff and get it out there
that hey AMD is actually now better more
stable and you know and it's bigger and
better than these other two companies
and that's gonna be pretty hard
Plus AMD honestly should work much more
with all the gaming companies than they
do if you go out and you see most games
a lot of those games you see say meant
to be played with Nvidia a lot more than
on the AMD side so if AMD really wants
to get more recognition in the gaming
industry especially which is like you
know the industry that fuels the whole
and piece the entire thing these days
pretty much I mean Gaming is the number
one thing with 3d and VR and all other
crap it's where it's at
so if you're gonna be inside of that
market you have to always be on top of
your game I know all of you diehard fans
and everybody you know want AMD to
succeed and be the number one company
but unless a few things within that
company change it's going to be very
hard for them to dominate and get that
position and to hold that position now
just think of this Intel and NVIDIA even
when they stumble they have so much cash
and so much cash reserves from all the
years that they've dominated the market
that even if AMD does come up with
better products traditionally it goes
like this they bounce over each other
that would force these guys to do that
and this is what I think and I feel is
the most unfortunate about all of this
if AMD really doesn't push Intel and
NVIDIA we're not going to see any really
changing products from Intel or Nvidia
because why are they going to change and
release all these products if there's
really no competition I mean think about
it if they're selling more they're still
selling more they can sit on their
laurels and just kick back and chill and
wait for AMD to do whatever they are
going to do so if AMD changed a few
things and somehow got infused with a
lot more money for R&amp;amp;D I think there is
a good possibility that AMD could come
up and they could dominate on both
fronts but the way things are right now
I just don't see it happening for quite
a long while even if next year like I
said they have absolutely better
products that still gives the other
these other companies who haven't even
really released their new arts and
little stuff they have at least a little
bit of stuffs and we don't know how you
know the 11 Series launches we don't
know if it's gonna be a rebrand for some
reason the back of my mind now I'm
thinking it probably is because there's
really no reason for them to release a
card that's so fast it's double the
power of a 1080i because that would
really make the playing field
honestly there'd be no reason for
anybody to go out and buy an AMD car at
that point there just wouldn't be
because if it's you know was it 599 600
bucks right now for the Vegas 64 if they
had a card that was even $700 749 people
are still gonna be willing to pay more
money for that Nvidia card just because
of the performance and it would be very
hard for AMD to sell those cards at that
price point they'd have to lower their
card to a lower price to get people to
buy it since the performance differences
would be so much and that would honestly
hurt AMD quite a bit so hopefully I
guess for AMD sake you know maybe this
will be a rebrand by Nvidia with the 11
Series cards and we won't see the market
pull so far ahead but until AMD actually
does have better CPUs and better GPUs
across the board can maintain those
products those prices and get those
products to the market and then get the
public awareness to be
like hey Wow AMD is a force to be
reckoned with now I know enthusiasts
already know this but general people out
there who aren't computer enthusiasts
only are gonna buy what they recognize
Intel and NVIDIA are very very
recognized names they have stuff
everywhere they spend huge marketing
budgets because they had that money to
throw away if less AMD can compete on
all of these fields work with the gaming
companies to get more games to do this
it's gonna be an uphill struggle now
please don't take this as I'm dissing on
AMD because I'm not whatsoever but still
the facts are the facts and reality
sometimes it's just a bitch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
