once again a tech tomorrow Elric here as
your host and we've got something pretty
cool going on today we've got the
Hellfire under eight hundred dollar
gaming PC build this is a pretty nice
system you guys can see right here next
to me it's very clean very simplistic
pictures a very nice video card and just
got to tell you guys right off the bat
trying to find an AMD video card like
trying to find a needle in a haystack
right now and prices are outrageous so
just please take that in mind as we jump
into the video so let's check out the
Hellfire system let's check out its
build the parts how it performs at the
end of the day whether it's worth your
hard earned cash let's go so starting
from the outside let's check out the
case this is the thermaltake Versa n24
or as it's called in house the Hellfire
system in this case has a lot of room
inside of it it's under $60 and let's
just face it this thing looks badass to
power the system we chose something that
was very much in the budget range we
chose the EVGA 500 watt 80 plus power
supply this is a very nice power supply
and you could actually get it for under
$40 for the motherboard we chose
something from MSI this is the B 350 M
gaming Pro not a lot of PCI extention
slots on it but it does do well for
overclocking and it has all the features
you need to get up and going for the CPU
we wanted something that was very entry
level and also with the motherboard that
we chose like I said you can change it
to any CPU that you want for this build
though we use the rising 3 1200 CPU the
memory that we used in this build is the
Kingston HyperX fury black now this is
an 8 gigabyte kit coming to market a
little bit under $100 let's just face it
ddr4 memory in general is pretty pricey
and if you want really good stuff you're
just gonna have to face it it's probably
going to cost you a pretty penny the
video card that we use for the build is
made by power color this is their Red
Devil series in this series is also a
little bit pricey this particular card
comes to market at $349 but there are
other video cards out there that you
could substitute for a lower price so if
you like this card and you want to get
it you can get it but there's also other
cards out there you can find that are
lower priced the only thing is though is
however like I said earlier finding an
AMD video card right now is like finding
a needle in a haystack
and last but not least for the storage
on this we use the Western Digital black
drive that is a one terabyte drive but
they actually have these on sale for
under $50 right now alright folks so
there is the system now one thing to
take note of we bought the case it only
had one fan in it some people may be
happy with that we actually added a
couple of extra fans and there are more
of a link down below that as well but
that's pretty much the system folks like
I said this system is pretty much
entry-level isn't a video card a 570 is
a very nice video card even though it
probably will bottleneck to CPU just a
little bit that's probably to be
expected but most gamers when they go
out may buy a system they like to get
the absolute best video card they can
and then worry about the other stuff
later so if you like this system but you
feel like you know you're not really
happy with the video recorder another
part another thing is that all of my
bills are just suggested billed you can
always change the parts around yourself
to build something different these
builds are basically just to show you
what the builds look like and what the
performance levels are of buying a
system at this caliber now if that's it
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
let's check out those performance floors
all right folks so there you have it the
Hellfire system coming in a little under
$800 and like I said you can swap parts
out to whatever you want to make your
own bill this is just a suggestion but
you guys can see though that at 1080
every game is played at over 60 frames
per second that's a pretty nice sweet
spot for people out there right also if
you get yourself a monitor that features
their freesync technology your gaming
experience will be even better now like
usual level link download like button
for all of these parts and all that
stuff and we always want to hear your
comments down below in our comments
section so if you guys like the vid hey
give it a thumbs up if you didn't please
let me hear comments we always love to
hear them I'm Elric you've been watching
techy tomorrow we'll be back here
tomorrow with more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
