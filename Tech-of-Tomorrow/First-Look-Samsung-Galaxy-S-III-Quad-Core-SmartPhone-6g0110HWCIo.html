tech of tomorrow YouTube ciao I'm elric
first your host and today we're going to
be looking at something for those out
there who have a flair for the fancy
phone that's the samsung galaxy s3 phone
oh what's this bad boy all about what
you would ask now wouldn't you now this
thing has a four point eight inch Super
AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1280
by 720 this thing's also point three
four inches thick and it's going to be
very lightweight so without any more
further ado let's see what this little
phone has got for you
new galaxy 3s is also going to include
the android 4.0 ice cream sandwich mmm
EMA a 1.9 megapixel front camera and an
8 megapixel rear camera with an LED
flash autofocus and 1080p resolution it
features 4d LTE data speeds and
hopefully Samsung's quad-core Exynos
processor which is already leased in
Europe it's still not clear whether Sam
time will opt for dual-core processors
in the United States hope we don't get
screwed just as HTC has done before once
again screwed let's just keep our
fingers crossed shall we now like the
HTC One X it pretty much match stood
spec sheet except in fraps and the quick
run of GL benchmark get scored a highly
impressive 99 frames per second while
the HTC One X scored only 65 frames per
second expected to arrive here in states
in June it will come in white silver
blue and silver looking forward to it
