year's CES 2016 was very different for
me than a lot of other CES is gone were
the mass displays of computers and all
the computer components and now there's
just a whole different type of
environment here now it's all about
phones virtual reality audio and a lot
of different things but this year's CES
still had a lot of cool things one of
the very first things that we set our
eyes upon we walked into CES 2016 was
Intel's massive booth featuring a lot of
things including their Curie technology
right off the bat they had an artist
demonstrating on a screen virtual
reality art which is pretty cool the guy
was using a VR headset and playing
around and doing a bunch of different
designs on the screen now although in
its infancy this technology in the
future can grow and become something
really really cool other things we saw
were people playing games obviously
virtual reality is coming right around
the corner many companies have products
that are geared to be released later on
this year and we saw that evident all
over the place another really cool thing
that was inside of the Intel booth was
this thing called torch now this was a
game that you really get interactive in
whatever you're doing on the sand and
yes that's just plain sin that you get
in the beach it's you see right there
you interact with this and a screen is
shot down under this and everything that
you do is done in real time so you build
up walls you move mines and there are
also some buttons and a controller that
are used as well so it's kind of like
mixing an old-school video game with
something totally modern it was killer
it was a lot of fun and I had a great
laugh doing it
drone technology is starting to be
prevalent everywhere and yes Intel and
their Curie technology was on the spot
they had a drone that was really really
yeah it was very interesting to say the
least they had a guy walking in as a
volunteer and the drone could basically
do a few different things they could
either follow the person around or
completely avoid that person and another
cool thing about it is it mapped the
entire area of the room and you can fly
that thing inside the room on its own
autopilot without hitting anything so
this is very interesting technology if
you're looking for like technologies
like deliver stuff this is going to be
one of those things I think that's going
to hit the market because the way that
this thing works is it works with the
environment around it so you could
actually have this thing I would think
in theory go and map the entire city and
know where it's going this is definitely
techo tomorrow and really cool stuff
that's coming
and although Intel had their drone stuff
going on they were definitely not the
only people all around the entire CES
2016 you could see that drone technology
is coming I would expect that 2016 is
going to be the year of the drone TVs
were also something that were all over
the place at CES 2016 a you guys all
know about 4k TVs they're all over the
place you guys all know about OLED
technology because you guys saw me
review that LG TV but there's also
companies out there who have another
version called Hewlett and the only real
difference that I can see with my eyes
honestly between the two was that the
EULA was actually just a little bit
brighter in some places but then in
other places the oullette was brighter
so making distinction between the two I
don't think there's much of a difference
in technology I think it's just a name
branding but obviously these TVs are
incredible and they also come in 8k
that's right 4k is a thing of the past
now and why we were there even though
they didn't have a display they had told
me clearly they have 10k TVs that will
be coming out later this year it was so
real that I actually tried to reach in
and grab a beverage from one of the TVs
but nope it wasn't real damn them all
right guys so now we've all seen 3d TVs
we know they've been out there when you
go to the movies
they want a pair of glasses you watch
the movie that's really killer but what
about new TVs and this is also something
that I feel is really tech of tomorrow
now these are these new Ultra D TVs and
they require no glasses that's right
this stuff is so realistic and so weird
that if you turn it up really really
high I started to actually feel a little
sick because it was so 3d they had many
options there including gaming multi
monitors featuring the Kung Fu Panda 3
movie that's coming out these things
look just simply incredible every visual
aspect all the way down to a tablet to a
big huge giant screen was just
incredibly 3d and required absolutely no
glasses whatsoever and the really
interesting thing about this was by a
simple slide control you could control
the depth of the 3d amount that you
wanted to have you could put it to it so
3d it looks really really weird or just
mildly 3d the choice was yours depending
on what you liked another thing that we
saw all over the place at CES 2016 and I
do mean all over the place or minicams
but one of them that really stood out
was by the people over at Kodak they
have a mini cam that acts records in 360
all at once that's right in 360 all at
one time
you know what that is so cool if you
could do that in space or something that
could make for translating to such a
cool movie in fact I didn't really talk
about it much but in my eyes this will
be perfect to actually make a true 3d
complete surround movie where you sit
down and all you have to do is basically
move in your chair or something like
that or have a screen move and you could
totally immerse yourself in a complete
3d real world environment really killer
stuff by the people over at Kodak I
can't wait to see how this is
implemented everybody's familiar with
throwback Thursday that's a term people
throw around every Thursday right but
check it out
vinyl is actually coming back and that's
a complete throwback to the past when I
was growing up vinyl was really all you
could get your hands on everything was
vinyl you bought yourself a giant record
it had a cool design in the back a cool
design in the front you pulled out a
thing there was a sleeve there was
lyrics it was really cool experience and
it was big and you could hold it in your
hand
and then as I got older it just kept
changing now from a CD dando cassette
tape and then down to now or what do you
buy digital audio and there's nothing
you can put in your hands now one thing
I think is really cool is this company's
coming back with so many different types
of players and ways to play your music
back that it was simply incredible it
went all the way from the cheesy all the
way to the high-end but if you love
vinyl and you like that it's really cool
now if you don't want to own a record
player but you still want to hear your
music how about a little car that drives
around on your record and plays it and
plays all the sound is that cool or what
now for you artsy fartsy vinyl lovers
out there we actually found a booth that
allows you to take your old unworking
vinyl and turn them into a custom piece
of art that you could hang on your wall
and say hey I made this it's actually
pretty cool another thing trimming this
year is 3d printing and at CES 2016 we
had to see a lot of them right at the
bat we up to a booth by the people at
Polaroid where they were making these
little pieces and we're like hey what
are all these little pieces for well
they had a guy there who was happy to
demonstrate and what he did is he put
all these little pieces together and
made himself an atom and you guys can
see that he was a very happy camper with
his work 3d printing is definitely the
way of the future we saw a lot of
different applications being used and a
lot of different things being made
including that's right
the TARDIS from Doctor Who which I
thought was really cool we also saw
wrench being made and we saw an
assembled part that was the complete
byproduct of the entire process we also
got to check out a few laser printers
and even though these things aren't
totally as cool as a 3d printer you have
to admire the depth and detail that this
machine can bring out I mean this is
something that the minds would be like
holy how did you do that and while
we're still on the topic of printing
what about a camera that actually
printed your picture out on the spot
that's right we were over at the booth
by the people over at Polaroid and once
again they had another killer product
now back when I was a kid you actually
had a camera like this and it was what
everybody used you know you guys can see
a few here that black camera on the
right is actually the very first camera
my you know family of her head and the
one down there below the barbie one that
was used
very first camera in fact I think it's
the camera is using now but the really
cool thing is is now these cameras will
not only store digital image you can
share you can actually have your photo
printed on the spot to give to a friend
here we print one word that you can see
it's see no evil speak no evil hear no
evil canon had a pretty cool photobooth
but what I thought was the coolest thing
was this little train
whoa the optical amzing booth was
something that was a really interesting
but the thing is it wasn't really
interesting for their new speaker line
it was more interesting because of the
artwork and their display now the
speakers they're okay they're more of a
low-end communal thing for these guys
for me I like their high-end stuff but
if you're looking for stuff that's
waterproof or lower-end you know out the
cleansings obviously stepping into this
realm but when I say that was really
cool was their display because there's
this place honestly where some of the
best at CES 2016 strolling around one of
the halls we came across something
really weird though from the people over
at Samsung and this was their a digital
fridge now for your smart home this
might be pretty cool but I was kind of
crazy at CES this is amazing it's
totally you know displaying a frigerator
and talking about how you could use and
have a digital refrigerator but it was
pretty cool anyways it was really nice
and shiny so if you like bright shiny
things and you like future tech hey this
was something like that samsung also had
a giant giant TV display and this thing
looked really cool we got to look at
this thing and it was visually exciting
but I gotta say that people over at LG
really outdid themselves they had the
most killer display that I think in all
of CES 2016 this was visually amazing
with screens covering the entire wall
and the entire roof that's right this
was the most impressive display at CES
2016 as far as I'm concerned the TV
Department LG you guys are getting crazy
and speaking of crazy I tried to steal
this really fast car but it wouldn't go
anywhere damn it I don't know how many
of you out there have seen the movie
Martian yet but it's a really killer
movie and we can tell that the people
over at GoPro seriously science the
out of
and they had the suit from the Martian
movie there at the show but
unfortunately there was no Matt Damon
you guys who follow TECA tomorrow you
guys know who he blue is because we've
done a few of their products over the
last few years but at this year's CES
these guys really actually kicked it up
a notch if you guys are fans of Iron Man
which I know that you are I know I am
they had some killer products including
a keyboard and mouse all based off the
Ironman theme the coolest thing however
at the e-blue booth had to be their
chair though man this thing was really
comfortable and when you weren't sitting
in it the light in the back lit red but
as soon as you sat in it the e blue
turned to blue so if you're looking for
something that's really comfortable
totally futuristic yeah this thing's
really cool now while we're speaking on
the topic of cool how about the world's
biggest Nintendo controller that's right
and the funny thing is this controller
is so big that the girls are in this
picture I think would take two of them
to actually lift and use it the big guy
there he'll probably have no problem but
this is absolutely totally the coolest
coolest thing probably at the show as
far as just little niche items the
world's largest Nintendo controller
right there were also a lot of cars at
CES 2016 really fast cars that you could
actually drive and simulate via computer
screens now if you're in a totally
simulated driving this is incredible
because it's actually using a real car
so you're inside of a car simulating
your driving experience but instead of
going down the road your viewing
experience is through a screen now I
know you guys have all seen multicolored
lit keyboards they've been around for a
while but what sets Rockhead apart from
the rest is that these guys actually
have software that can independently
change the color of every single
solitary key on the dang thing and
that's something that's really cool we
also saw a couple of rechargeable
lithium batteries now what's cool about
these things is that you'd probably
never ever have to buy a battery ever
again for your car the bad thing is they
cost about 16 under
another big thing at CES 2016 was
waterproofing we saw all types of
devices that were being made that were
waterproof from speakers to camera's to
phones to actually phone cases
now this last company we saw actually
made a case for the iPhone 6 and I
believe for the note as well that was
completely waterproof you put their case
on and you could even drop it into a
fish tank pull it out of the fish tank
and the phone was still fully
functioning alright folks so obviously
there were many many other things at CES
2016 but a lot of these things were
rehashed we just wanted to bring you
what we thought were the really cool
things at this year's show and I hope
you guys like what we brought to the
table so thanks for watching we'll see
you guys back in the channel for more
tech goodness here in 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
