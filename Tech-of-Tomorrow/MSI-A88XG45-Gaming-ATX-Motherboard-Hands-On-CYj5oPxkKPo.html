here at CES 2014 still with the msi
suite and we're here again once again
with mark tran talked to you about the
brand-new MSI motherboard now this
thing's something totally different and
unique
this is their new 880 XG 45 motherboard
now this thing's totally geared for
overclocking and for gaming something
that's never been done before and
something really unique also this board
features all that to the a10 processor
so for you guys out there or looking to
save a lot of money you guys know that
they're getting on that platform is very
affordable
can't afford Intel you can go from that
so when I handed a remark and the
mark just go over a little bit more
about some of these new things in this
board and people will talk about it so
let me introduce this is not new
actually the first gaming series for the
AMD board a lot of MSI was uh you know
asking about this like when are you guys
gonna have the gaming series for the AMD
boards you know so I finally yes you've
been asking for and we finally deliver
so this is gonna be the first ever as
the FM 2 socket board and it has all the
features that we implement it in the z87
previous one like the military class 4
components SFC and also the audio boosts
that we implemented and the killer NIC
card that's already is implemented in
here you guys know the killer NIC card
that's Mac car was very popular a few
years back when it made its emergence
under the market it's very fast very
durable and one of the most popular ones
on the market member I it was like 100
something dollars I got a big ol I got a
big old necklace it looks like I'm a big
rap yeah yeah you can ward a couple of
videos like I was like all right like
I'm a rapper guy so funny maybe I'll
bring that stuff back for some other
videos but yeah we added a lot of value
and features into this board and also of
course we we wouldn't this is gonna be
overclocking board also that's why we
include the OC Genie for you know people
that don't really like too lazy to do
like overclocking custom one-button
overclocking is one button let's talk
about something really interesting
though the slow mode button yes that's
something new that we we implemented
this to this board where if you're gonna
be doing
extreme overclocking and you know you
can do the switch and it automatically
back into normal exactly so if you're
doing ln2 stuff and you think your
stuffs about to freak out or whatever
you want to save your scores by the way
you can also save all of your scores
through either USB or on to the web now
that has that ability in it so basically
if you're doing it you're gonna lose
your score you click on the button
instantly switch it back to normal mode
and at the same time actually pushes
your score out so you can save that
score so it's gonna be a really
interesting type of board especially for
a 10 platform exactly you're right it's
gonna be really interesting oven rear
i/o really fleshed out yes and the audio
on here is actually incredible and on
the back of the board when you're doing
the audio all the circuitry has led in
it so all back behind I think don't you
have your little you little phone right
there mark will try shows to you folks
you can see this but it's actually gonna
be a really cool feature this
motherboard especially if you like you
know trick stuff inside your system so
we get a close-up of that or whatever
you guys can see this but basically you
can see all those lights are gonna be
lighting up on the motherboard so when
the motherboard is up and running you
got your sound going you're gonna have
that going it's gonna be pretty awesome
so folks look for this this is something
that I want to show you guys one of the
things though before it bounced out of
here this thing is really cool the GTX
760 little mini which will actually
match this motherboard if you wanted to
use it with it I know it's kind of like
mixing you know you know dirt and water
you get mud but hey what the heck but
you can do it so this is pretty cool 760
very small fitting any of those light
systems totally cool backplate you guys
know I love the backplate you guys do to
this fully has it on it so that's going
to be awesome and is this available
already this is available right now
available already and also it has a
unique raid X fan where it will actually
blow like down and outwards and also the
good thing about this that you can
overclock with afterburner Wow cool yeah
no fancy stuff no extra software just
straight up overclocking yeah alright
folks so that's it that's we're here at
Emma sighs sweet here in lovely Las
Vegas Nevada and I'm out of here and
guess we're going to see mark at a party
tonight later
