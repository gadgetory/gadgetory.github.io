step that has to do with Apple iPhones
and all that kind of stuff it's kind of
a lukewarm subject on our channel you
know we're not really known for that
kind of stuff but I happen to see a
video on unbox therapy that I thought
was very very interesting I thought I
would share with my PC you know user
group so check this out right now it
looks like Apple is going to be making
iPhones in India and they're going to be
coming to market at about a hundred and
fifty dollars that's right one hundred
and fifty dollars for an iPhone now
India is going to be one of the absolute
biggest markets in the world you know
for selling iPhones and I guess
currently phones are a little bit too
expensive over there for the people's
budget so they need something that's
going to be very very affordable and my
question in today's video is this is all
great news you know
India's got a great big population so
they're gonna get phones that are
affordable but now is this going to
translate over to the American market
and if it does how would actually affect
the American market overall and my big
question to you guys is this if you
could buy yourself a really nice iPhone
and it was only gonna cost you 150 to
200 dollars would that make you switch
from your Android over to an Apple user
group because I think that many people
probably would I mean let's just face it
we know that right now you know new
iPhone X ARS and all these phones
they're like eight nine hundred dollars
you know cell phones are really
outrageously priced I think they are
overall just in general way overpriced I
mean they're not really a computer
they're just smaller so I guess you're
paying for smaller technology at you
know and paying the big budget because
let's just face it cell phones are very
very very expensive it strips me out
because even little kids it seems to
have really expensive cell phones these
days I go to restaurants I see a whole
family including little kids everybody
just playing you know on their cell
phone at the same time not talking so I
mean are they really worth that much
money now if Apple could translate these
sales of iPhones over the United States
at a hundred and fifty to two hundred
dollars even myself I think I would
consider translating over calissa's face
it if you can get a phone that's gonna
have features that are as well or maybe
even better than
the Samsung or Android phones that are
out there on the market people are gonna
really want to gobble this up they
really will because the phones will be
super duper affordable now this is
actually you want to totally happen I'm
not sure I'll have a link down below
also to the unbox therapy video where
Lou talked to them and talked about a
lot of different things about their
market the pricing and all this
different stuff but at the end of the
day I really have to say if Apple can
somehow get those phones over here to
the USA at that low of a price margin I
think they would dominate the market
because people don't want to spend $800
and even if you're a person who's an
Android lover if you have to pay $900 to
get a new cell phone or you could just
switch over to an Apple phone and only
pay $200 the numbers are pretty obvious
and at the end of the day price usually
dictates sales now obviously you're
gonna have your fanboys the people who
only want to buy Apple stuff they're
gonna buy that regardless but people who
are you know Android lovers if the
phones are priced the same they're
probably not going to go out of their
market you know I mean if you're paying
$800 for an Android you're paying $800
for a phone that it's an iPhone that has
their own you know their OS on excuse me
their iOS on it you're probably not
going to want to switch you're familiar
with the platform that you work on
you're comfortable you have your phone
but when it comes time to buy a new
phone if you're going out of the store
to buy a phone and they tell you oh well
that phone you have right there is $900
but we have these brand new phones from
Apple that have all the features of
their major phones but are only $200
you're going to be like wow okay this is
something to consider so I'll have a
little pull up here on the top I want to
know what you guys think if you could
buy an Apple phone at really a quarter
of the cost of what all the major phones
out there are would you switch from
Android would you jump over and hop on
the Apple train and use the iOS happily
if it was that cheap of money or would
you just be completely set in your ways
and saying no way am I ever going over
to Apple regardless the price price
means nothing to me I want to hear what
you guys have to say please leave
comment down below it please these
comments down below if you guys aren't
sub the channel hey please sub
the channel if you don't have
notifications turned on hey turn on
notifications so you can see the videos
coming into your boxers we got lots of
killer stuff coming here in 2019 but at
the end of the day hey would you switch
to an iPhone it was really cheap hmm I
think maybe I would what about you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
