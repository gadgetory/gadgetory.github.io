the channel now chances are that if
you're a gamer you're gonna be looking
for a good gaming mouse now there are
all kinds of gaming mice out of the
market some of them have just a whole
ton of programmable buttons so if you're
playing those games that have a lot of
spells and involve you know multi
clicking buttons a lot of people buy
those particular Mouse because they're
great for doing that kind of stuff other
people don't really use that many
buttons they play first-person shooters
and they only need just a few buttons
and what's really more important to them
is the accuracy so today we're gonna be
taking a look at a very interesting
product from Cougar this is their Sur
passion Gaming Mouse and what's
interesting about this is you can change
the DPI from 15 all the way up to 7,200
and you can do this all by seeing what
on a little LCD screen on the back so
you have one button to the left of the
screen this is for doing all that type
of stuff and to the right you have one
this is for your polling rate for
liftoff and for angles so if you want to
do programming all that stuff you can do
it right here now as far as programmable
buttons this is one thing about this
Mouse that I'm just like okay it's 44
bucks but there's no programmable
buttons now there are a total of five
clickable buttons too on the left hand
side too on top and the scroller also is
a clickable button on it as well
now that's very very limited and the
fact that you can't program any of those
whatsoever to some people out there this
might be a big thing and you're going
hey that's a caveat I can't live with I
need something that I can program but
further people they're not going to care
whatsoever now one thing about this
mouse is well if you have a small hand
this mouse is going to be very perfect
you this mouse to me is actually really
nice I have a medium sized hand I don't
have a large hand or a small hand and
for me this is very comfortable it's a
little bit small but somebody who has
even smaller hand I think will find
themselves right at home with the
comfort level you know of this mouse and
the optical sensor on this mouse is also
pretty nice it reads on just about any
surface so it'll read on this plastic
it'll read in a book so no matter where
you're gaming at pretty much you're not
too worried about taking a mousepad with
you and getting it to work now obviously
some of those nice mouse pads they have
out there we'll probably be able to read
a little bit better and if you're a
professional gamers
someone who takes your gaming you know
that seriously you're probably gonna
want to get something that actually
matches up with it for the absolute best
performance but like I said if you're on
the go and stuff like that it'll still
work wherever you're going one thing to
point out however and this is definitely
a caveat in my book is even though
there's a cool LCD screen for you to
read all the DPI when you're playing
your game you really don't want it to
pick up your mouse and start clicking a
button in the middle of your game to get
the DPI that you want it would have been
better actually if they had the LCD
screen on top and with the button on
tops that you could click it on the fly
that's one thing that I think some
gamers are really gonna take notice and
be like what the hell what's what good
is that I mean it actually is a really
cool idea but I think it would have been
much better implemented it if it would
have been on top now the button on the
other side of the LCD screen this
controls three different options it
controls your polling rate it has
available settings from 125 all the way
up to a thousand Hertz another setting
is something interesting called angle
snapping now angle snapping can make
normal computing tasks you know like web
browsing and those kind of stuff it
makes it easier but it also messes with
your aiming in first-person game so with
this particular feature you can turn off
to make sure you're getting the best
headshots you can get and the last
feature is called LOD or liftoff
distance now this feature allows users
to define the height at which the sensor
will stop tracking what this means is
that users have big mouse pads and they
constantly lift the mouse pad to
recenter it they can avoid undesired
tracking by setting it on low and for
those users who lift the mouse slightly
when they're aiming you can set it on
high so it will keep following their
movements and if you're wondering about
durability and the SIRT passion has a 50
million click warranty we all know that
right now RGB is the craze everything's
RGB hell I think mine to wear RGB let's
look no I'm just just kidding but
anyways right here on the button down
below the little scroll wheel there's a
button right here and you can change it
to 13 different modes as far as the
colors go so as far as having back
lights and all that stuff you get 13
different choices of what you want the
mouse to look like honestly overall this
is a very very simple product there's
not a whole lot to it to even bring the
able to review one thing to take note of
though if you're playing games and
you're playing games for hours on end
you definitely need a mouse that's not
going to hurt your hand make your wrist
a make your fingers feel where we're
like you know going like this is your
hand going ah
it's aching as far as comfort level goes
this is extremely comfortable now like I
said earlier in the video if you're
somebody who has really gigantic size
hands I probably would not recommend
this mouse also if you're someone out
there looking for a mouse that you can
program also something else you might
want to not consider with this mouse but
if you're looking for something that has
accuracy like I said from fifty all the
way up to seventy to hundred as far as a
dpi goes that's a large spectrum I mean
honestly when it's at 7200 to meet just
like it fly like a bat at a how low the
screen I can barely keep up with the
thing so why they have it set that high
I don't know maybe just some people are
really that good and can can do that but
my eyes match the screen sorry that's
just way too fast for this kid but this
thing is like 39 bucks at Newegg or it's
like 44 dollars over on Amazon there are
a lot of different gaming micellar that
I feel out there that have these same
type of features what you're probably
going to be getting with this particular
one is that it's made very well it
doesn't feel cheap whatsoever like you
can tell when you're holding something
in your hand it just feels like junk
this doesn't feel like that there's a
nice little rubber grip right here
underneath the button so if you're just
in gaming and going and shooting things
up you've got a nice little rubber grip
on here the buttons are very easy
accessible above it so if you just had a
couple things in there you know set up
for your your bombs or your grenades
whatever you can have it set up that way
you can do all that in game it's gonna
be just great there's also the other
side the same type of grip so when
you're holding the mouse in your hand
everything as far as the grip and all
that goes it's very very nice and like I
said it'll work on just about any
surface if you want the absolute best
obviously a gamepad is going to be the
way to the go yeah
excuse me going to be the way to go but
that's pretty much it I mean the sir
passion is priced at about like I said
about $40 so if you're looking for
something that won't break the bank has
accuracy and it's very comfortable then
hey you might want to check this out
a few cabinets like I said no
programmable buttons and if you got a
giant-sized hand you're not gonna want
to get this one but it's just too small
for those giant sized hands I'm mark you
guys been watching teka tomorrow like
usual all the information about this
product will be down below like button
so we'll see you guys back in the
channel for more tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
