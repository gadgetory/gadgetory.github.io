guys all know that I've been out for a
little while yep I actually got my left
foot amputated not the whole foot but
pretty much almost all my foot so now
the doctor made it so both my feet
bounce and I have six inches on my right
side and six inches on my left side
which means all together I got 12 inches
so I'm swinging now but I'm back I'm
still injured you guys can see I still
got all my crap from the hospital all my
arms my viewer got all swollen up but
I'm back and why am i back well because
there's the holidays are going on and
I've got some awesome tech last-minute
gifts for you guys to check out and a
lot of this stuff I actually use myself
because hey why offer gifts that you
don't use I figured hey these ones I
actually use I endorse Mosley's products
so let's talk about them the very first
one is this awesome aki 20,000 milliamp
external battery now this thing has
monster capacity man like i said it's
20,000 milliamps it will actually charge
an iphone almost nine times large
capacity phones like the galaxy s4 five
times or at least a full charge on an
ipad 3 or 4 the battery has a super fast
charge output 5 volts 3.1 amp total
through dual USB ports which are also
five volt two amp and five volt one amp
these allow for simultaneously charging
of your iPad iPhone Android and more at
high speeds it also features for blue
intelligent LED indicators to display
the remaining power built-in flashlight
for dark or Laura light environments and
hey this thing will pretty much charge
anything the next item up is actually
really cool especially for the student
or the parent or person who travels a
lot and that is the google chromecast
this thing is so small it will fit in
your pocket and will go anywhere the
chromecast can stream online video music
photos and more to your TV using your
smartphone tablet or laptop it also
supports a growing number of apps
including netflix youtube HBO Go Hulu
Plus
Pandora ESPN MLB TV google play movies
and music plex mls crack o vivo radio
and it also allows a chromecast browser
tab inside the box you get the chrome
cats itself an hdmi extender USB power
cable and power adapter no remote is
needed it also features an easy setup
plug into any HDTV and connect your home
Wi-Fi network works with android phones
and tablets iphone ipad mac windows and
Chromebooks and like I said the damn
things portable and it's very well
priced I know all my fans that there are
always looking for an affordable gaming
mouse this one right here is the g400s
by logitech now this particular mouse I
haven't used but we asked around a lot
of fans so that hey this is a really
really cool mouse so I thought you guys
might want to get your hands on this
it's very well priced has good features
as an all-around solid gaming mouse that
isn't going to break the bank like I
said in the beginning the video a lot of
these products I use especially these
right here these are the audio technica
ath m50 headphones and these things are
bad ass with your listening to music
whether you're dialing and all your
music doing mastering rocking out
playing games I mean all around I think
these are a solid set of headphones many
fans out there have sim emails tell me
how much they like these things so last
year went out and got me a pair might
actually got the white edition and these
things are just awesome I love these
headphones I know many of you people out
there love them as well this is a great
gift if somebody gave me these I would
be just like oh man thank you so much so
for a gift idea I think these are
seriously a kick-ass product alright so
the last of my best of the last minute
gift ideas is something that I always
use I use it on both my mac and my pc
I'm not a big fan of this keyboard for
gaming but it does work ok send us a
wireless product people are hardcore
gamers gonna be like yeah but this
thing's really cool Tom about the k750
from Logitech it works for both a PC
which is the one I have right here in my
hand and also back behind me here is the
one for my mac so I truly endure
product I use it on both my pc and my
mac this keyboard you can get for around
50 bucks sometimes it's a little bit
more but this thing's awesome you never
have to worry about how am I going to
get my power because it charges off of
lights even off yeah you're gonna trip
out on this even from the glare off your
monitor that's right so even with your
monitor on nothing else this keyboard
charges up it's got a lot of nice
features it's very lightweight its
ergonomic if you like a totally flat
style keyboard you're going to really
like this product and like I said they
have it for both the pc so the master
race can have them and if you Mac boys
out there like them as well well you got
it here as well so all in all I think
that's a win-win situation so there you
guys have it is a pretty quick pretty
fast video I'm still not totally back to
my health got a shit ton of medical
bills I gotta deal with in everything
but I want to jump right back in the
game in fact like you guys saw in the
video from Jonathan I would have had
them come to the hospital I would have
filmed on my videos in the hospital for
you guys but they were like no get
healthy but I love my fans and before i
bounce out of here i guess that in some
ways I've said some things to people and
reply that we're pretty offensive I've
been really sick for a while my blood
Sugar's been down my body's been all the
place and for anybody out there who I
ever sent a nasty message to I humbly
apologize I'm past that point in my life
you'll never step type of behavior from
me again so please I asked for you guys
forgiveness everybody makes mistakes I'm
human I made them too so please can we
just roll on past that and live for a
positive future like usual all of these
gift ideas and everything will be down
there below that like button so you guys
can check them out I gotta say the k750
and the ath m50 headphones for me are
seriously products that i like and use
every single solitary day because every
day i'm in my recording studio and every
day i'm on my computer so for me those
are really cool things i know others out
there going to like other things but for
me hey I like those I'm elric thank you
guys very much i love you guys thanks
put up with my craziness I'm past the
craziness now and I'm just here to bring
