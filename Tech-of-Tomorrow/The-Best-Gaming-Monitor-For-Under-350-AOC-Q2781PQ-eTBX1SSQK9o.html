killer freakin Tech today we're looking
at a pretty bad ass monitor this is the
P 2781 P Q long name right took me a few
seconds to memorize this monitor now
let's just face it
your PC itself very important part of
your gaming experience but let's just
face it your monitor you're staring at
that as a Spanish would say that is muy
importante
because you're staring at your monitor
the whole time that you're playing your
game so it's pretty much in my opinion
just as important as your tower now the
monitor we're going to check out today
is pretty unique and the fact that
playing games and stuff is pretty much
like playing games on a monitor that has
144 hertz refresh rate it's that same
complete flicker-free experience you
guys have heard me talk about it many of
my videos like staring at a normally at
a 60 Hertz screen I get a major headache
when playing games and I usually always
have to play at a minimum of 144 Hertz
if there was more
I'd be looking at it because my head in
my eyes is for my age and stuff my
diabetes it kicks my butt look in those
monitors I know there's a lot of other
people out there that are the exact same
way this monitor Hauer features
something different it features a stuff
called flicker free technology now most
monitors use pulse width modulation
technology and even though when you're
looking at the screen you can't see the
screen tearing this type of technology
still causes lots of stress on the human
eyes and the brain and everything
because it's flickering at a whole time
even though you can't see it with your
human eyes now the monitor we look at
today uses direct current and what that
does it allows the technology to be
completely flicker free so even though
it's only a 60 Hertz monitor I can play
my games this monitor for hours at a
time without getting a massive frickin
headache but beyond that let's jump on
and let's check out the specs and let's
see why this monitor is something very
nice unique and you guys will see it
actually is really elegant because it
doesn't have really virtually any bezel
whatsoever only 22 millimeters of
material covering like the entire thing
is what they're saying so it's really
crazy so let's just take this out
now when you first receive the AOC q2
780 1pq you'll notice that there are
just very few things in the box you get
the
or itself the DisplayPort cable the HDMI
cable the power cable and the users
guide so on the front side you guys can
see obviously a 27-inch monitor it's an
IPS panel which means it from any angle
that you're looking at it's going to
look the same so if you're a person
that's doing a lot of business stuff as
well as gaming you can stand off to the
side talk to your partner about all
those spreadsheets and all that stuff
and everybody will be able to see it so
not only this monitor good for gaming
it's also really good for the business
person as well now the resolution on the
2781 PQ is 2560 by 1440 and this is
actually becoming the new standard in
the past 1440 was kind of like the
mid-ground in the stepping stone to 4k
but now 2560 by 1440 has become the
sweet spot 1080 and kind of in the past
1440 s worth sap for the moment baby and
that's what this monitor features with a
16 to 9 aspect ratio 350 for CD for the
brightness 50 million to one for the
contrast ratio so you know this thing is
going to be pretty trippy now as far as
the color goes it features a true 8-bit
color correction so the colors are going
to be as vibrant as close as you can get
to looking like the real thing the color
depth is at sixteen point seven million
colors and pixel pitch is something that
you don't really hear people talk about
much anymore it's pretty much measuring
the pixel density
you know horizontal versus vertical and
this monitor features a pixel pitch of
0.23 which means everything's going to
be very very tightly together in the old
days back when you had CRT monitors if
you were able to get your hands on a
point like 17 monitor you're like oh my
god this is like the best thing next to
heaven so from monitor with the newer
technology this pixel pitch is actually
very very well now one caveat in my
opinion you guys might disagree because
maybe it means nothing to you but to me
I like a monitors you can pretty much
adjust to anything you want portrait
mode you can move it up and down back
and forth the more of the Merrie that's
the way I feel but unfortunately on this
particular model that's kind of limited
kind of stand does look badass and all
together things very artistic but if you
really want to monitor gonna be able to
move around do a whole bunch of stunts
you're really limited with this one now
the bezel list feature that that's
really touted on this monitor I gotta
say is kind of a mixed thing because
even though there actually is a no bezel
there's still a space between the actual
you're seeing on the screen and the edge
of the monitor so at first I was like oh
man this thing's so bitchin man
I'm gonna go put three of these things
together and there's not going to be
anything but actually even if you put
three of them together they're still
going to be that small space now to me
if this thing was going to be the most
absolute badass motor in the world it
would have actually had no bezel
whatsoever kind of like the new Samsung
phone you know just have a monitor it's
completely a monitor with no bezel come
on folks I know you guys can do it
because technology keeps advancing and
so to me that's going to be the true
completely bezels monomer that monitor
excuse me when you can set three these
bad boys right next to each other and
see no separation between all three I
will be happier than a camper with a
campfire and a marshmallow as far as
power requirements go on stand by this
monitor consumes a half a watt when it's
fully up and going it consumes 47 watts
but one really nice thing about the
monitor is there's absolutely no heat on
a lot of monitors I've got in the past I
go if I touch the thing it's like whoa
this one's actually very very cool now
the on-screen displays they're pretty
easy to access they're located on the
left hand side right underneath the
monitor there's a few different buttons
in there you can go in and choose what
type of display port you're using if
you're using HDMI all that good stuff
and there's those other buttons where
you can do just a whole cavy two
different things they have so many
different features how many of them
you're actually going to use I don't
know but they're still cool to have now
the inputs for this monitor
they're pretty minimalistic at least I
think that most folks are going to think
this you have a VGA connection which can
do DVI DVID all that kind of stuff you
get a single DisplayPort and two HDMI
connections now the cool thing about the
DisplayPort over HDMI is that you've
been hooked up multiple monitors all
along the chain with HDMI it's really
really great but if you're going to be
doing something that I require it like
we talked about a min ago those three
monitors having a DisplayPort it's
really good
and although this AOC monitor doesn't
actually have speakers built into the
monitor itself it does have an audio out
jack now the biggest question probably
on everybody's minds okay or if the
specs are cool and everything but how
does the monitor look well the screen is
completely crisp and clean it looks very
very nice even though it's not a curved
modern still gives you lots of area to
visualize and so that
178 viewing angle that you can see from
anywhere that's really cool so if you're
playing your games and stuff your
friends could check it out like I said
before business folks can check it all
out and just looking at in-game when
you're checking out all the visuals
inside of the game you guys can seed it
this thing looks totally killer I mean
between monitors it's really hard I
think and especially in the high quality
range of seeing a dynamic difference you
know between the differences in the
colors and stuff but you guys can see
the in-game this monitor just looks
totally badass
what more can I say there's nothing that
I can really say that's negative about
this monitor other than you know the
price is about three hundred and fifty
dollars but the biggest thing to me is
the ability to play games for hours on
end on a sixty Hertz monitor that
doesn't make my brain fizzle make me go
ahh I just honestly I hate that so to me
that's the absolute biggest aspect about
this monitor to me it's a very beautiful
27-inch monitor the IPS screen is
totally kick-ass it's got just enough
controls that you need the on-screen
display is nice I mean it just looks
nice it's elegant you know I've talked
about the few things that work a bit you
can't move it around or do anything like
that so that kind of sucks you know from
my personal thing but other people are
going to be like who gives a crap that
means absolutely nothing non move on
alright so we'll move on but at the end
of the day you guys know that monitors
out there that feature g-sync and
freesync and honestly g-sync is way
overpriced and video wake the up on
that one you guys just give that
technology for free AMD does who cares
just give up that dollar and make
monitors equal across the board now
those monitors feature pretty much kind
of the same thing as a flicker free
monitor it's a little bit faster refresh
rate and everything but the blinking is
actually the thing and you know is what
gives you the headache so if the monitor
has you know absolutely no flicker
whatsoever it's pretty much in my eyes
as a user as being the equivalent of
that and let's just face it man
g-sync monitors are like almost six
hundred bucks some of them we've seen
with the predator series and come
on that was 1,300 bucks bro you
know and freesync monitors they are a
little bit cheaper they're like in 500
the low range for the AMD fans that's
really cool but if you don't care about
you know manufactured card or anything
like that you just want to monitor it
you can play on that
give you a headache that's great to view
you guys might want to give this a
chance and check it out go down to Best
Buy or something like that we'll have a
link down below to Amazon if you want to
get more information or bio in for
yourselves but if you want to see it in
person find a place that has it and go
check it out
I think you'll be pretty impressed here
at Tech in tomorrow I give it an
editor's choice I think it's a pretty
badass monitor at the end of the day I
want to see what you guys had to say I
hope you liked this video and if you do
go Jackie Chan Chuck Norris Terminator
every badass mofos that severed been on
that like button if you're not
subscribed you like what you see hey

here almost every day bringing you new
