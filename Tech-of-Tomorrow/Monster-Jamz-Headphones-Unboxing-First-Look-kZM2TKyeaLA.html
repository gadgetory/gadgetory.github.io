YouTube land Elder affairs here the tech
of tomorrow youtube channel we'll check
it out today we have a really cool
unboxing of a product from our friends
at monster this is the new Jam's inner
ear headphones now these are sound
cancellation headphones that have many
many options to work with your iPhone
and Apple products these things are
coming to market at about a hundred and
fifty dollars I notes from you go on ah
but these things carry all the same
quality features as monster cables do
all the nice 24 karat gold connections
and all the good workmanship that goes
into a monster product so fall around
i'll show you on this video what's
inside the box and then i'll listen to
these things for a few days and we'll
come back and give you a full review
okay so now that i actually showed you
the box with the boxers like here is
actually the entire box content you get
a bunch of little earbud things here for
different size of your buds to fit
inside your ear you get a bunch of
different ones there you get the actual
headphones themselves with their little
quarter inch of jack here now i will say
this that i find is kind of odd with
this packaging there is no Jack from
quarter inch to larger I would have
thought that a package that cost 150
dollars that you might have actually had
that in there that's not in there but
you get the headphones you get a little
carry case for the headphones that says
life is too short to listen to bad
headphones I agree with that because
life is short then you get the little
monster life com a little thing a
customer service number I jams handbook
here's the thing on inner ear stuff I'm
gonna bring the substance of the Cameron
get this this actually shows like how
you can actually hurt yourself using
these by inserting them too far into
your ear so I'll make sure that I do
them I don't give myself ear damage
that's everything that actually comes in
the box of the new monster jams
headphones thanks for watching the
unboxing and look forward for the full
review to come sometime next week here
on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
