tomorrow that's right it's finally a
Friday and we've got some hot news
stories for you guys now you guys all
know one of the most anticipated phones
the new Galaxy s5 it's been officially
released but is it worth it
today's video is made possible by
Squarespace now if you're like me and
most people out there we were all hoping
that this would have an aluminum build
but unfortunately I think we were all
pretty let down because it's contending
along the same lines with a plastic
build what's up with that now this thing
comes in four colors black white blue
and playing down but ugly gold not like
the cool golden my guitar over here mind
you that's still cool now there's been a
minor screen bump with a 5.1 inch 1080p
display no qhd slightly faster 2.5
gigahertz quad-core processor and a 2800
milliamp hour battery now the new galaxy
s5 is ip67 water-resistant and dustproof
however this is a far cry from being
waterproof now you might get away with
dropping this thing lightly in water but
if you try to go swimming or dive into a
pool anywhere this thing's gonna go now
one thing though with this phone being
water-resistant and dustproof the USB
port is now covered and I'd like to know
what you guys think about that feature
is that a pro or a con now the camera is
actually one of the bright points of
this thing it's got 16 megapixel camera
and also features full 4k resolution
filming so those are actually pretty
cool things about the new galaxy s5 now
just like the iphone 5s this bad boy
also has a fingerprint reader for
security reasons just like the Apple one
now one thing I think is really cool
though is Samsung is leaving their API
open for people to develop unlike Apple
locks everything in-house so this might
actually be a really cool feature about
the phone in the future as well some
people may argue about security this and
that but let us know what you think and
lastly but not least the galaxy s5
features a heart monitor that's right so
you know if you're getting excited with
that sexy girl walking by them since
that heartbeat going up your board since
it going down all in all kind of neat
stuff are you guys as appointed are you
guys excited about that that's really
the main thing you want to know about
this number one story of the day so down
the comments below let us hear what you
guys think is the samsung galaxy s5 is
it a win
or is it a lose inquiring minds like
mine want to know next up AMD fans
another day if you don't get up and
Cheer that's right the latest catalyst
beta drivers have been released 14.2 has
been released from AMD and there are
some actual fine points about this now
one of the main highlights is for the
latest version of thief it features a
crossfire profile update and performance
improvements for single GPU
configurations now for you mantle users
out there there's been another update if
you're using multiple GPUs in
battlefield 4 you can now use up to four
cards fully supported through mantle now
there's also been some frame pacing
improvements in both battlefield 3 and
battlefield before now if you guys are
looking for all the information on this
and want to get all the Keen details
check out the link down below like but
in the description will have all the
information for you folks now next up
just in case some of you guys might have
missed it we have the Metro 935 build
now this thing is a totally badass build
featuring part for many many of our
supporters it's got the cooler master
stacker case it's got an M powermax
motherboard just all kinds of decked out
stuff if you guys are interested in
checking that out make sure you guys
also look down in the link below in the
description we will have the link to
this I think it's a really killer badass
system and I think you folks will agree
as well also it's the end of the month
and we have the top five deals of the
month for you folks we go you guys like
these every month so every month the
other month we bring you the top 5 and
this month is no different so make sure
you guys check that out and of course we
want to send a special thanks out there
to Squarespace for making this video
possible for you good folks now one
thing that's really cool about this
though is its GUI interface it has all
the drag and drop menus you want to use
all the type of plugins you need to get
your website up and going it's something
very interesting if you're looking for
something that's very quick easy and
efficient just make a quick website and
get up and going Squarespace is
something that you guys are going to
want to check out and one thing that's
also ultimately cool as you guys can
actually save yourself ten percent and
get a free trial membership by entering
the code t OT to a check out so that's
really incredible stuff you guys can
save money check out what it's like to
have your own website if you like it you
can stick and if you don't
dumped into the side of the road but
actually Squarespace is really cool and
it's really intuitive for those who are
brand new from creating websites like
usual I know I'm reiterating as a bunch
of times but if any of this information
you missed it will all be down there in
the description now there's been a
couple people have actually sent me both
and said hey man where is the
description well when you look at the
video just look right below it there's
