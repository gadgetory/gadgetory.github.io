once again to TECA tomorrow I'm Eric
your host and today we're going to bring
you something very interesting unless
you guys have been living in Iraq you
know that AMD has released a brand new
GPU out into the market now why is this
well when AMD looked at their lineup
between their 7770 and their 7850 they
felt that there was a gap in between
there that could be filled and therefore
the new HD 77 90 was born not today
we're going to bring you the review
comparison against its little brother
card the 77 70 which many of you have
asked for so what that said let's get
ready to rumble and jump in to the ring
so now let's talk about some of the
basic differences between the new 77 90
and its little brother the seventy seven
seventy now the 77 78 GPU was called
cape verde and it actually featured a
die that was slightly smaller than the
new 77 90 the 77 90 is based off the new
bone air GPU and actually this is the
very first of the sea islands to
actually hit the market there'll be many
more that are coming out but this is the
first now stream processors which is
really the most important thing about
the card is a major difference between
the two on the 77 90 we see 896 stream
processors on the 77 70 we see only 640
there are also some difference in the
total available memory bandwidth now
take into consideration that both these
cards are overclocked on the 77 90 we
see a total available memory bandwidth
of 100 and 2.4 gigabytes per second on
the 77 70 we see slightly lower at 80
3.2 gigabytes per second so there is a
pretty big difference there now let's
talk about the GPU core clock speed one
thing to take note of the 7770 is
actually clocked higher it's at eleven
hundred megahertz on the 77 90 the core
clock is at a thousand 75 but the memory
speeds in the 77 90 are actually faster
we see the memory speeds at 1600
megahertz and on the 77 70 we see them
back to 1300 megahertz so there are some
differences there as well both cards
feature one gigabyte of gddr5 memory
both cards feature 100
memory interface all those things are
pretty much the same so now let's take a
look at the aesthetics of the card we
can see that right off the bat both of
these cards feature aftermarket cooling
the real difference is one has vapor X
which is a 77 70 and the 77 90 has dual
X you also want to take note that both
of these cards are sapphire based cards
other cards from other manufacturers
will differ in how their size what the
shroud is and everything else on the
card and for those various models and
pricing make sure you guys check out the
link right below the like button both
the cards that were looking at today
feature the same 7-inch PCB although the
7770 has a blue PCB and the 77 90 has a
black home which you know may matter to
some people but I don't think it's too
much of a concern now let's take a look
at the rear i/o on the i/o of the 7770
you can see that the card features two
dual link DVI connections a single HDMI
and a single standard DisplayPort on the
77 90 however things get a little bit
different there's a black port and a
white port the black port is a single
link DVI port and the white one is the
dual link you also see once again the
standard HDMI and standard DisplayPort
technology now that we've seen the
features differences between the 77 70
and the 77 90 and we've got that clear
in our head let's now jump in and see
some performance comparisons now we know
that our red dot extreme system isn't
you know the absolute highest in gaming
system it was meant more for
workstations slats gaming but we're kind
of waiting for Haswell to come out when
has what comes out will be changing it
up and changing out our test system
right now we're using the SRX
motherboard we're using 226 60 Zeon's
we've got two HyperX drives from
Kingston that are in raid 0 80 gigabytes
of Patriot memory just all kinds of cool
stuff including an OCC PCI 256 gigabyte
ya boot drive that's right so this thing
really does Rock in a lot of
circumstances so with that said let's
jump in and let's see the test
okay so there you have it we've seen the
differences in features we've seen the
differences in performance and we can
see that as far as the sheer performance
goes the 77 90 does blow away the 77 70
although there is a slight kick back to
that the card is actually running quite
a bit hotter as well pretty much this
new card is running hmm hot hot hot hot
hot
now with drivers and stuff and as they
do the fan timing and they custom do
that maybe it'll actually get better
some companies spend a lot of time doing
custom fan tuning I think with these
release they were just trying to pretty
much get the card to market but as the
drivers improve and that fan tuning gets
better we'll probably actually see some
better cooling on the car so if you guys
also want to see the full written review
on the new Radeon HD 77 90 meets you
