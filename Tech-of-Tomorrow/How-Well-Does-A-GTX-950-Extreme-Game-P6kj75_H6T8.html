tomorrow where today we're taking a look
at a pretty mean card from the people
over a gigabyte now this is their GTX
950 gaming Extreme Edition overclocked
right out of the box
12:03 for the base 1405 for the boost so
you know this thing is going to move but
that said though let's hop in let's take
a look at the cards let's take a look at
our test system the scores and then at
the end of the day let's see if this
card is actually worth your money as we
take a look at the card we can see on
top there are two fans now this is the
new win force 2 edition you guys are all
familiar with the wind force Edition
they've been their top of the line cards
from gigabyte for the last few years so
some basic specs are this it's a 2
gigabyte card 7000 megahertz memory
clock 28 nanometer process 128 bit
memory bus and obviously gddr5 supports
DirectX 12 opengl 4.5 and obviously it's
PCB form is ATX the card features a
maximum digital resolution of 4096 by
2160 which is 4k and the maximum analog
resolution is 2048 by 1536 you can dig
up to 4 monitors via the rear i/o the
rear i/o features 3 DisplayPort and HDMI
and a single DVI connector and the card
size is then like this height is 42
millimeters length is 240 millimeters
and the width is 132 millimeters we will
also have this translated into inches
for those of us here in America now
there are 5 extreme things about this
card that make it the extreme gaming
Edition the first is the extreme coin
with the new wind force 2x fans now
these things are 3d active fans which
means they're made to cool and maybe
keep all that air pressure going down
against the card the next is the extreme
outlook now everybody has a custom build
with a custom theme and being able to
change the lighting on the card is
pretty cool so now the little wind force
logo here can change to whatever color
your system is so that's pretty cool
stuff another thing is this backplate
really killer extreme backplate on this
card
another is the way they do their extreme
gauntlet choosing which means it
basically only the absolute
best parts are put into this card before
it gets manufactured and the last thing
is this card is made with gigabytes
totally true stuff two times more copper
just like all of their other extreme
stuff so basically this card is
well-made all around on this card now as
far as power requirements go there's
just a single 8 pin power connector on
this card and all you need is a three
and 50 watt power supply to get it going
there's also a single SLI finger your
own little top here there's a single SLI
finger so you people want to use SLI
setups you'll be able to do that and if
you're using multi monitors you'll be
able to do that as well because the rear
i/o is pretty fleshed out you get three
display ports an HDMI and a DVID
connector so the cards really rockin and
ready to go so that's pretty much
everything about this car it's pretty
cool-looking its overclocked out of the
box like I said 12:03 for the base
fourteen hundred and five
that's the boost so this thing is ready
to rock and roll now we've actually seen
a couple cards in here before that are
the same speed the zotac was just
clocked as much that pretty much seems
to be like the threshold of where these
cards are being released out of the box
on the very high-end spectrum of things
so with that said let's real quick check
out our test system and then let's rock
out to the benchmark song and see how
this car does against the competition
let's look
all right folks so there you guys have
it the gigabyte GTX gaming extreme
edition card now this card is running
pretty cool twenty-nine 68 so it means
in our full low at 68 Celsius that's
actually pretty cool leaves you plenty
of room for overclocking and you guys
all know that on NVIDIA cards all your
overclocking stuff comes from how cool
your card is running it boost is
completely based on how cool the cars
running cooler the card the better the
boost and the better your gaming I guess
you know although these cards are pretty
much clocked out of the box now you guys
can see this card does really good
against the competition it's a hundred
and sixty dollar card it's a few dollars
more than the entry-level card if you
guys are looking for something to
complain about I guess you guys could
snow viewer than go I don't want to pay
for the extra cooling but I don't know I
think it's worth it for what it is you
get a pair of these cards they're gonna
be really fast this card does run very
very cool it's quiet they have all their
own type of overclocking soft that you
guys can use I'm not gonna tell you what
to use because I know that everybody has
their favorite I could recommend one you
guys are gonna go yeah right I just use
this over here but overall this card is
very solid it's pretty much the entry
level gaming card from the people over
the Nvidia it's geared the cord you know
compared against I think the 260 is kind
of works like competing at yeah you know
if you're an AMD fan you're probably
gonna go in the ad camp regardless of
what I say about this card for NVIDIA
fans you guys have probably seen a lot
of these cards already so you know what
it is like usual all the information
will be down there below like button you
guys know what to do I know you guys say
that you know it's not a total review
unless you tell the good and the bad so
the whole thing is well what if you get
a product and there really isn't a whole
lot of bad to talk about because like I
mean with this card I mean if I was
sitting there trying to scratch my head
and go OK or scratch my ass and okay you
know what's something bad to say I mean
the only thing I really complain about
is okay you know maybe a hundred and
sixty dollars a little bit steep for an
entry-level car B which would be one
hundred and forty dollars but beyond
that there's no coil why none of that
stuff going on the card runs cool you
guys can see it games great if you're in
a 1080p game it's going to do just fine
if you're using 4k and stuff I don't
know I just I would suggest using a
different card for that kind of stuff
pushing 4k with this a single card by
itself yeah yeah I think it's pushing it
anyways I'm Ehlert thanks Rock from the
channel peace out see you guys back here
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
