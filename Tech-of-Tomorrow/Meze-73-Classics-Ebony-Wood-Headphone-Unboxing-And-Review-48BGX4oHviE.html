youtube channel i'ma work your host and
today we're going to be taking a look at
something very very interesting these
are the new mez 73 classic headphones
now you guys have probably seen all
kinds of headphones from all kinds of
people but these are very unique no two
pairs are identical due to the fact that
they're made out of natural wood these
ones are made i have actually ebony wood
and no two are alike which makes them
kind of like headphones art and a
collector's piece all in one so now
let's go ahead let's open these things
up and let's take a look at the specs
and what these things are all about so
here's the box right now these are the
miz 73 they have a 73-inch sir compass
on the earpads hence why they're called
that show you guys the back of the box
alright folks so let's go ahead and
begin the unboxing go ahead and open up
the top we can see this is pretty just
simple and elegant as it is you open it
up you've got the headphones you've got
the two removable TBE cables these are
right here one goes to each side so you
have one cable for ripe one cable for
left then the stereo plugs in it comes
to two different types ones that are
wood and then ones that are black go
ahead and start taking them out now the
drivers in these are 50 millimeter
neodymium that's the type of baguette
that's used inside of them and they're
using a lot of different types of
headphones that are usually supposed to
be on the high end and stuff they also
feature impedance of 40 ohms it's very
adjustable fit any type of different
type of head you guys can see they're
very very soft cones these are 73
millimeters hence why they're called the
messia 73 clip them round you guys can
see the wood here and this is what I was
talking about and why no 2 would ever be
saying being that they're made of
natural wood means they're going to have
a much more natural sound to them each
one of these is handmade no two are
alike at all so let's go ahead and let
me put them on my head over here now
we'll take a few at the comfort level
all right so I'm going to go ahead and
put them I head like I said they are
very adjustable so if you had some was a
giant sized head like a giant you can
see they could fitna Giants head area
I'm a giant or they can be adjusted all
the way down to fit on my head my small
petite beautiful head right okay now
these feel very very light there's no
discomfort whatsoever external noise you
can still hear a little bit of external
noise I don't really think they're
geared for noise cancellation they're
more geared for high audio so with that
said I'm actually going to go ahead and
plug these things in listen to them for
a little while and then we'll get back
to the end of the review so we'll see in
a minute now to put the cables in before
I put these on my head all you basically
do is you put them right here and with a
simple little pop they go inside you can
separate them right and left and then
all that's left is to plug them in so
now stick them on my head
all right folks so you heard it I played
it through there that's my song Sunset
Beach now these things do sound very
incredible they have a frequency
response range from 18 hurts all the way
to 22 kilohertz the response range on
these though is pretty near flat
depending on how you set the EQ is how
they sound like I know we kind of like
you know showed you guys into the video
but we actually sat heard about 15 or 20
minutes listen to a bunch of different
types of music and tried the headphones
out now when i was playing heavy metal
music with a bunch of bum buh buh buh
buh buh buh buh buh I admit I didn't
really think that these were sounding
all that great is just pumping a bunch
of base everything and stuff we were
listening to but as soon as I switched
over and started listening to more
broader music such as like pop or you
know rock and just stuff like that these
things sound really incredible what do
you think Cameron you listen to him what
you think thumbs up there you go to get
the Camerons thumbs up so I know these
things are going to be expensive they're
two hundred sixty dollars probably not
very many people are going to be able to
afford them but for those people who
want something very very classic they
want something that nobody else has the
same thing then you might want to think
about getting a pair of these men 73's
they do sound very very good I haven't
actually gone out and bought any $300
you know when I would consider
audiophile headphones that require an
amp I don't have videos here most of my
stuff that I have you guys know is
geared around the recording studio us
recording music and all that and that's
where I'll test these out next but for
now they sound really well it's
interesting how they have the cables and
everything set up with them I don't
think that they'll ever make you tired
on your head they're very very
comfortable you really can't hear any
external stuff when I was trying to talk
to Jesus when he was listening he was
just like I can't hear you and vice
versa when I was listening I couldn't
see them so thanks for watching at the
end of the day I think these are very
interesting whether they're exactly
worth two hundred and sixty dollars is
going to depend on the type of person
using them but I say for style and
design and just for something really
cool these things definitely get an
editor's choice here on tech of tomorrow
just for being frickin original
I mean hey this is a fact nobody's got a
set of headphones out there that look
exactly like mine so I hope you guys
like this video if so hit that like
button you guys know we have all kinds
of stuff going on including the 70 k sub
contest so make sure your sub to the
channel and I'll see you later as I take
these things on a stroll in the
recording studio see how they sound over
there see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
