our YouTube channel I'm mark your host
and today we're gonna be taking a look
at something very very interesting these
are the new mez 73 classic headphones
now you guys have probably seen all
kinds of headphones from all kinds of
people but these are very unique no two
pairs are identical due to the fact that
they're made out of natural wood these
ones are made out of actually evany wood
and no two are alike which makes them
kind of like headphones art and a
collector's piece all in one so now
let's go ahead let's open these things
up and let's take a look at the specs
and what these things are all about so
here's the box right now these are the
MS 73 they have a 73 inch circumference
hence why they're called that show you
guys the back of the box alright folks
so let's go ahead and begin the unboxing
go ahead and open up the top we can see
this is pretty just simple and elegant
as it is you open it up you've got the
headphones you've got the two removable
tbe cables these are right here the one
goes to each side so you have one cable
for ripe one cable for left and the
stereo plugs in it comes to two
different types ones that are wood and
then ones that are black go ahead and
start taking them out now the drivers in
these are 50 millimeter neodymium that's
the type of baguette that's used inside
of them and they're using a lot of
different types of headphones that are
usually supposed to be on the high end
and stuff they also feature impedance of
40 ohms it's very adjustable did any
type of different type of head you guys
can see they're very very soft cones
these are 73 millimeters hence why
they're called the messiyah 73 clip them
around you guys can see the wood here
and this is what I was talking about and
why no two would ever be the same
being that they're made of natural wood
means they're going to have a much more
natural sound to them each one of these
is handmade no two are alike at all so
let's go ahead and let me put them on my
head over here now and we'll take a look
at the comfort level alright so I'm
gonna go ahead and put them in my head
like I said they are very adjustable so
if you had some was a giant sized head
like a giant you can see they could fit
in a giant's head area I'm a giant or
they can be adjusted all the way down to
fit on my head my small petite beautiful
head right okay now these feel very very
light there's no discomfort whatsoever
external noise you can still hear a
little bit of external noise I don't
really think they're geared for noise
cancellation they're more geared for a
high audio so with that said I'm
actually going to go ahead and plug
these things in listen to them for a
little while and then we'll get back to
the end of the review so we'll see in a
minute now to put the cables in before I
put these on my head all you basically
do is you put them in right here and
with a simple little pop they go inside
you can separate them right and left and
then all its left is to plug them in so
now stick them on my head
all right folks so you heard it I played
it through there that's my song Sunset
Beach now these things do sound very
incredible they have a frequency
response range from 18 Hertz all the way
to 22 kilohertz the response range on
these though is pretty near flat
depending on how you set the EQ is how
they sound like I know we kind of like
you know showed you guys into the video
but we actually saturd about 15 or 20
minutes listen to a bunch of different
types of music and tried the headphones
out now when I was playing heavy metal
music with a bunch of bum buh buh buh
buh buh buh buh buh I admit I didn't
really think that these were sounding
all that great is just pumping a bunch
of bass and everything and stuff we're
listening to but as soon as I switched
over and started listening to more
broader music such as like pop or you
know rock and just stuff like that these
things sound really incredible what do
you think camerman you listen to them
what you think thumbs up
there you go get the Camerons thumbs up
so I know these things are gonna be
expensive they're $260 probably not very
many people are gonna be able to afford
them but for those people who want
something very very classic they want
something that nobody else has the same
thing then you might want to think about
getting a pair of these men's 73's they
do sound very very good I haven't
actually went out and bought any $300
you know when I would consider
audiophile headphones that require an
amp I don't have videos here most of my
stuff that I have you guys know is
geared around the recording studio us
recording music and all that and that's
where I'll test these out next
but for now they sound really well it's
interesting how they have the cables and
everything set up with them I don't
think that they'll ever make you tired
on your head they're very very
comfortable
you really can't hear any external stuff
when I was trying to talk to Jesus when
he was listening he was just like I
can't hear you and vice versa when I was
listening I couldn't see them so thanks
for watching at the end of the day I
think these are very interesting whether
they're exactly worth two hundred and
sixty dollars is going to depend on the
type of person using them but I say for
style and design and just for something
really cool these things definitely get
an editor's choice here on techo
tomorrow just for being frickin original
I mean hey this is a fact nobody's got a
set of headphones out there that look
exactly like mine so I hope you guys
liked this video if so hit that like
button
you guys know we have all kinds of stuff
going on including the 70k sub contest
so make sure your sub to the channel and
I'll see you later as I take these
things on a stroll in the recording
studio see how they sound over there see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
