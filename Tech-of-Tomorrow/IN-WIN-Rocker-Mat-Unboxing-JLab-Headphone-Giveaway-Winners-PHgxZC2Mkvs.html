day and we bring it for you we like to
rock and we like to roll I like to bring
you stuff to you I'm a product ho I
really like to but of I had to bring it

an unboxing fool i'm going to do a taste
of rock'n'roll cekam tomorrow style
welcome here
oh that funny I'm having funny stuff
here on Sundays guys welcome to the
Sunday edition of tech of tomorrow where
I've been just playing some roofies you
get up anyways it's Sunday it's the
update now gotta love piece of paper
over here I even got my old reading
glasses uh want to say hey thanks a lot
every guys now the 70k contest ended and
I guess that there's still some kind of
confusion about what you've got to do to
win so check it out when you go to your
channel or to my channel be a little
thing that says send a message minds
wide open it's very easy to see you need
to send me a message from the channel
that one you can't send me a message
from a channel from another country and
try to tell me you're a person over here
you lost your password you were on the
moon for six months and you forgot your
 sorry it doesn't work that way man
bottom why is this you have 30 days to
claim your prize has to be from the
account that you picked now please guys
you can see there's links in that 70 k
video you guys can check that out right
here behind me go back and check that
out and tell these guys bug the crap out
of and let they know that they have one
let them know that they have one rather
and so with that said let's check it out
let's do the weekly update because we
get a lot of stuff going on so this week
we have lots of stuff from a Zeus
motherboards monitors transformer
tablets all kinds of stuff iphone 5s 6
rumors that was cool stuff check that
out we also have we just talked about
the 70 k giveaway and the J labs
headphones these two things we talked
about and those are going to be the
random contest now these letters down
here are big so I don't need these
reading glasses for that so number one
is bomfunk 1991 that'll be back here
over here in the screen behind me as
well and hang yang so bum funk 1991 and
hang yang you all the homies who won
these things right here that's right so
anyways check it out
we also got a product we're at CES from
inland now check this thing out this is
their rocker Matt show you guys it up
here check out the back now it says it's
got nano-coating scratch resistant
unique design made by aluminum it's
washable liquid resistance non-slip base
and easy to clean so let's go ahead
there's a little tab right here and they
pull up to camera man right here so we
can see it and but I'm also going to
kind of mess with the mic here well I
guess I'll leave it cuz I'll do the
strip thing so Giri focused up here so
we get the true sound of it opening
there's a little bit of it right there
this little strap it's not very
cooperative I'm telling you right now
alright so just rip that thing open here
we go and then we shall pull it out of
the package bump bump bump bump go ahead
G go ahead try to punch me go ahead try
to punch me go ahead oh that's right you
can't do it don't you try it again
that's right that's right now this thing
doubles not only is it a mouse pattern
also doubles as a protective weapon
those of you who followed Spartacus or
I've seen some of those guys who carry
their shield this is the new porter
shield you carry it with you anybody
breaks out and try though if you you
just break this out my swing in here
Chad damn yeah take that and then you go
on to gaming and you kick some ass in
some virtual reality stuff so it's got a
really cool coding base so let's bring
it over here so mr. G can get up close
in it I like the brush look of it
there's been a lot of cars with this
color in the last couple years that I've
seen that's been pretty cool now the
fact it's a metal surface it should
actually work really well depending on
the coating they used so it's flipping
around the back also they talked about
the non-slip you can see there's a
rubber mat all here on the back right
here kind of just like you know the same
neoprene you see on most mouse pads I'm
going to scoop back and on place in the
desk and I'm going to try to move it
around
you get the camera meant immediate soom
this a little bit over here with that
but it's not moving so when it says it's
you know nonstick it's really hard I'd
like basically push all my weight to get
it to move so here's a mouse pull the
dang thing go there to see what it feels
like on a metal thing or get working on
tagged up back here um huh doesn't feel
bad at all I'll actually have to have to
do some gaming later today and see if it
actually helps with a head shot because
for me if your mouse pad works with your
mouse really well and makes it so it's
very smooth like I hate when my mouse
when you see it and it's like moving
back and forth like if it's sitting
there like I've had mice that just
sitting there and they move back and
forth I'm not even doing anything so
hopefully that won't do that at all and
I hope that really does improve the
traction we won't know actually until I
actually turn on but i'll let you folks
know and then i'll get the damn thing
away that's what we like to do around
here so many ways you guys are always
asking how you can support the channel
and everything is you guys saw in the
intro today's video is brought to you by
biostar they make their hi-fi series of
motherboards they've got all kinds of
great boards that are priced very very
well their boards are bade for the
segment that doesn't want to spend a lot
of money and still want some good solid
features the sound on their boards is
very high quality it's above the generic
realtek chips that you get out there by
any means much warmer sound the only
thing out there that's better at some of
the really really high-end stuff that
they have on the area zoos rog series of
motherboards which you also you know
we're going to pay a pretty penny for
because that's very premium stuff so
they're placed right in on that little
niche market you guys want the
information about those guys check them
out in the link in the description below
a lot of my users on Facebook and stuff
have actually went out and bought these
motherboards and are using them and I
know that a long time ago they had a
bunch of low-end series boards that were
actual total I mean they'll admit
it themselves there was a time when they
made just a bunch of OEM motherboards
this is a new biostar they have much
better products I work with them I help
them design stuff sometimes we talk
about the stuff they're engineers are
very interactive with a lot of people
that you know that just aren't legal out
there speaking their mind about it but
they're actually out there so check out
the link in description below I hope
like usually you guys can hit that like
button up there make sure to tell
anybody out there that we pick their
names go to their channel tell them hey
you won go to techo tomorrow and send
them a message because I need a message
from your
count so I appreciate you guys love you
guys make sure your I subscribe so you
don't miss any videos or any of the new
giveaways that are coming up like I said
we always pick two rounds a weekend
we're going to try to have a weekly big
contest all the time so see you here on
the channel happy Sunday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
