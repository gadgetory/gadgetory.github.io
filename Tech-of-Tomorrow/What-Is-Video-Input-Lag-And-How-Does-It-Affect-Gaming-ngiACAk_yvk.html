what it is but first we're gonna talk
about something that really gets under
my skin and makes me want to hook out on
you folks and that is laggers you know
laggers close those friends who never do
anything on time they never show up on
time they don't complete anything on
time
they make you late they're just
seriously people that make you sit
around and wait for them there are
laggers I really hate them you know they
promise you something yesterday and then
deliver it next Thursday now what are
these people doing all day long to be
laggers I mean really what are they
sitting around all day trying to decide
whether they're gonna eat you know
popcorn or chips or what they just eat
both and hang out or maybe they're just
sitting around all day strumming on
their guitar like the world is passing
them by or are they just playing asleep
I mean come on I honestly I can't stand
these laggers no I'm just joking that's
not what today's video about it's just
thought it would be kind of funny but
Before we jump in and talk about input
lag and how it affects you in your games
and the different things that you can do
to test it and find out what input lag
is let's hear a word from today's
sponsor wondershare dealing with PDF
used to be such a pain there's no easy
way to modify the content on the PDFs or
convert the scanned PDFs but with PDF
element it's a totally different story
you can easily create edit convert sign
and OCR PDFs to simplify your document
tasks work smarter faster and easier
experience PDF element today now today's
video is really about input lag now a
lot of people on my monitor reviews
recently have been asking me on almost
every review as hey man what is the
input lag on the monitor and I was like
ok well heck you know I mean I wouldn't
looked at about you know 20 different
monitor box that we have around the
house and on none of those boxes
anywhere does it talk about input lag
what it's about what it does anything
else about that so I thought alright
people are asking questions and since
I'm always learning from you guys you
know I learned from you you learn from
me that's what I've always wanted this
channel would be about and I love it
when I learn stuff from you guys so I
started looking into exactly what input
lag is and how does it really affect
your game plan what you know games will
it really affect the most you know so
input lag is this it's the time before
your keyboard and the striking of your
keyboard gets to your monitor so that
means if you're playing a game a racing
game a fighting game whatever when you
hit your keystroke it's the time between
you eating that keystroke and what it
actually appears on your monitor now I
don't really didn't know how the heck we
could test this I was like okay well how
do we test this I've never like even
really heard about this dub so like I
said I started doing some research and
then I found this company called Leo
Bodnar I was hoping it was gonna be Leo
Bogner so I can get you know a really
nice amp but nope it is just a lag
tester but it's actually a pretty cool
product I'll have a link down below for
that as what's about 149 bucks it's a
decent product they actually shipped it
to me within two days now
input lag can go anywhere from like in
the hundreds of milliseconds all the way
down to like four and five milliseconds
depending on the product that's out
there now the first thing that I did
today
was I tested all of the different g-sync
models that we had in the house I think
we pretty much had all of the ones by
Acer pretty much all the Predators that
they've released so the first monitor we
tested was the predator Z 35 now this is
a curved monitor 2560 by 1080 16 to 9
aspect ratio it had a lag time of 14
point 3 milliseconds next up we had the
predator X 27 4k monitor
you guys might have remembered this
monitor we tested it really recently and
it was like $2,000 had a lot of great
features but this is kind of weird even
though this monitor is really expensive
and it's 4k has quantum dot technology
19.9 milliseconds is the lag time on
that particular monitor the predator xB
271 HK which is a 4k monitor this
monitor actually had the lowest
millisecond lag time of all the monitors
this one came in at like 9.3 so under 10
milliseconds the last monitor we tested
was the predator X 34 this is actually
the monitor that I use in my gaming room
now this is the curved monitor it
features a resolution of 34 40 by 1440
and the lag time on it was only 13.1
milliseconds kind of in the middle of
all these monitors I also did some
testing on the TVs in my house and even
though my OLED TV is pretty much the
most expensive TV in the house it was
still having extremely long lag times of
over a hundred and forty three
milliseconds so that's pretty much the
longest in the entire house now the best
one that I tested in the house is a
brand new LG HDR monitor it was actually
down to 35 milliseconds as far as the
lag time goes so as far as the TVs go
now a lot of TVs out there are probably
not going to be you know great for
gaming because of this but real quick
let's talk about something okay we're
talking about some monitors that have 35
milliseconds maybe a hundred and fifty
six milliseconds okay how many
milliseconds are in a second there's a
thousand of them so when the numbers are
this low you know the lag time isn't
really going to be that much I mean
you've got a monitor that's you know
like under ten I don't really see how
that particular monitor could really
affect your gameplay in any way now
maybe they'll get stuff in the future
where it's instantaneous but when you've
got something that's under 10
milliseconds for the lag time I don't
think it's gonna affect gameplay
whatsoever now you might also be asking
okay Eric you've talked to all this
stuff about like stable what does it
matter okay if you're in a racing game
and you're coming around to a curve in a
corner and stuff like that and you're
really being competitive with
those few milliseconds could be the
difference between you crashing into a
wall crashing into somebody else or
losing your place in the game therefore
making you lose your position and losing
it now when you're talking about
first-person shooter games and stuff
like that it could be the difference
between you taking the headshot or
somebody else getting the headshot to
you just because their input lag time
was much less I mean let's just face it
if you're playing at a TV and your input
lag you know is coming in you know at
huge numbers and this other guys got
something that's only got four you know
or three or even nine I think he's gonna
be a little bit faster and even though I
know those numbers are really hard for
us to you to comprehend in linear time
because let's face it we live in linear
time and you know it doesn't matter you
know 150 milliseconds to us isn't even
like you know there's even that much of
a breath so the time you know is really
really short but a lot of people seem to
really care about this and no monitor
company out there that I've seen so far
is actually including these numbers on
any monitor box you know nobody's
talking about the input lag and I know
that it may not really matter all that
much because obviously we're talking
about stuff that's pretty much under you
know a quarter of a second you know if
we saw some of those 250 milliseconds
that still a quarter of a second which
is basically a breath and these numbers
are much lower than that so even all the
predator monitors that we checked out
today and by the way we'll do another
video coming up where I show all the
monitors I have all the different free
sing g-sync non free sing g-sync all
those different monitors and we'll take
a look and see which monitors actually
have the best and absolute lowest lag
times also if you'd like to see a video
where me and G the Cameron like we
cruise over to Best Buy
we'll talk to Best Buy and see if though
let's go in there and film video or I
can go in and I can test all the TVs and
we can see which of the latest and
newest TVs actually have the lowest lag
times for you to purchase for your
gaming stuff now I don't like to watch
TV just to watch TV but a lot of people
you know they buy TVs and stuff just to
play their games on because they're huge
and let's just face it they're cheap as
hell now when we tested everything at
1080 at 60 Hertz now the faster the
refresh rate the lower the lag time
so if you have a monitor and it's gonna
be true hundred and forty four Hertz you
know that your lag time is going to be
much lower than that which is pretty
much probably a reason why I've always
liked 140 for its monitors better than
the other ones even though I didn't know
that I just know I like him better and
they don't give me a headache when I'm
playing it and I really love those
particular monitors so how much lag time
really affects stuff I don't think it
really matters and let's it's going to
be a huge huge number I think pretty
much anything out there that's going to
be under you know 25 milliseconds you're
never gonna be able to notice that I
don't think in a game 25 milliseconds it
may matter but it doesn't really seem
like it when you're talking about things
that are close to a second maybe even a
quarter second if you're talking 250
milliseconds maybe but I don't know but
a lot of people wants they're saying
it's excuse me a lot of people are
saying hey what are these numbers so I
got this little tester right here this
is from the Leo Bodnar dude it's very
easy to use you simply plug one in into
this one in into an HDMI port on your
monitor you click this little button
right here and then the screens are
gonna come up and you're gonna see a
bunch of different bars now at the very
top of the monitor the numbers always
the very fastest the very fastest and
you go in the middle it's like in the
middle and you go in the bottom and the
number is the slowest so the number that
they ask you to test with obviously is
like I've said before many videos like
so it's like the three bears in them you
know you've got too too hot too cold and
right in the middle so just like that in
the middle is right where you want to be
and those are the numbers that you take
and you translate those numbers into
your testing and that's what we're gonna
do in the future so all the monitors
that you see from here on out on techo
tomorrow we'll have all the standard
stuff plus we will let you know what the
input lag latency is on all these
particular monitors so I hope this gives
you a slight a little bit of an
education I know some people already
know about this for those out there who
aren't in the know you in the know now
baby and hey thanks to my subscribers
out there and viewers who obviously give
great information and educate me I'm
always willing to learn from you I don't
consider myself the smartest guy in the
room I'm just an average Joe like most
of you guys so thanks for watching techo
tomorrow peace out and we'll see you
guys back here in the channel for more
tech
and I really do hate those darn lagers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
