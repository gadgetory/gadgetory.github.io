the delay for the last few days we've
been doing all of our rides in three
testings so we can bring that stuff to
you to the table I think at the end of
the day you guys are going to be very
surprised with the numbers for the last
pretty much forever Intel has always
been a little bit more expensive but yet
a little bit more powerful than AMD but
you guys are going to see with the brand
new rise in three chips that have come
out that AMD has honestly finally
leveled the playing field at the same
price point now I did something
different I actually made everything
that we tested for almost dollar to
dollar exact price the motherboards
there was only a few dollars difference
between I think the AMD but was about
ten dollars more but everything else
that we didn't assistance exactly the
same we use the same memory we use the
same power supply the only thing
different on the boards is the board's
themselves and the CPUs that are on them
and the way that I do this and the
reason I do this is I feel if you walk
into a Best Buy or you walk inside of
the store you usually have a budget you
have five or $600 you walk in the store
that's what you've got to spend you
don't have anymore
so I feel dollar to dollar pricing
versus performance is the absolute best
way to do testing like usual I want to
hear you guys as thoughts but I honestly
feel this is the absolute best and most
fairest way that you can do the testing
so we went that way and I really think
that you guys will be very surprised at
the end of the video on how things went
I know what I was because like I said
traditionally Intel at price per price
usually always beats AMD but check it
out things have changed now for my test
systems I use two different motherboards
for our Intel test system we use an i3
7100 and a gigabyte h1 10 M motherboard
and on the end these other things for
the CPU we use the 1300 X and for the
motherboard we use an MSI B 350 M both
these motherboards have very similar
features across the board the AMD board
was however $10 more one thing to take
note of however is the 1,300 X comes
with a wraith core and this is much
better than the standard core that comes
on any Intel CPU for the memory on both
boards we used eight gigabytes of
kingston hyperx ddr4 and for the power
supply we use two
EVGA 500 watt power supply so everything
in these test systems is the same except
for the motherboard and the CPUs and the
video card that we use for all of our
testing was an rx 560 from Asus like I
said earlier everything on these systems
is identical except for the CPU and the
motherboard itself and the prices were
equal all the way across the board the
CPUs were pretty much the exact same
price we use the same memory for it's
the same price so the only difference
you're really going to see are the
prices of the motherboards like I said
the one that's on the AMD side was $10
more which is really no big deal
with that said though let's jump in
let's check out the benchmarks and then
talk at the end of the day why AMD is
finally leveled the playing field let's
rock
you
as far as temperatures go you guys will
see that the AMD rise in three is
running a little bit hotter but that's
due to its four cores and it's higher 65
watt TDP alright folks so there you have
it and you guys can see that the scores
are pretty much equal all the way across
the board now in some instances the AMD
CPU actually did a better when it did
multi-core testing but on single core
testing the Intel i3 still did win and
there were a few places worthy until I
three won but overall everything was
pretty much equal in a trade up so I
really feel at the end of the day that
AMD at the same price point as Intel is
now bringing the same performance and
that's really the first time I've ever
seen them from the history of doing
testing it's always been into more
expensive Intel always a little faster
but now in my dollar-for-dollar testing
you guys can see that AMD is completely
leveled that freaking playing field and
made it so they're equally as well now
there are a couple things I do want to
talk about we did have a little bit more
difficulty getting the AMD system up and
running we just had some driver issues
and I don't know exactly what was going
on there and it did seem that we were
just doing standard interface stuff you
know just sitting and working in front
of your computer that the AMD skid
seemed just a little bit more sluggish
than the Intel that could have been you
know due to some of the drivers we were
having but at the end of the day I had
to say if you're going out and you've
only got five or six hundred dollars and
you want to get yourself a pretty good
system you have now a choice between AMD
or Intel and the performance is pretty
much great across the board I will say
this since AMD has a quad core processor
versus a dual core processor I think for
like future proofing that the r3 is
actually a much better investment than
the i3 that's just my take on it I hope
you guys agree but like I said man it's
been a long time coming but it seems
like with AMD's rise in r3 the playing
field has been leveled and
dollar-for-dollar you're getting the
same performance of a NV as you do with
then till I'm milk you guys been
watching Tekken tomorrow like usual
every part that we use and links them
will be down below at like button so if
you like what you saw hey you know what
to do and if you're not subscribed we'd
love to see you back here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
