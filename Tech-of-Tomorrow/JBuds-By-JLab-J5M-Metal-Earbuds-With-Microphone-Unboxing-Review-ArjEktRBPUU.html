once again the TECA tomorrow YouTube
channel now most people out there in
fact just about everybody that I know
has a brand new phone or one type or
another and with that said a lot of the
times the headphones that come with them
let's just face it they suck ass and so
many people want to go ahead and get
something better now some people want to
go out and spend a fortune other people
just want to buy something that is much
better but not going to break the bank
now with that said these are the J buds
by J lab this is the jm5 graphite series
now these headphones are about 35 bucks
and they're a special on Amazon these
things are really cool too they're fit
in your ear and they actually have a
microphone as well so for you know under
40 bucks you get an all-in-one solution
so let's check it out here's the
packaging they come in you'll probably
see these all over it like Best Buy and
places like that as well sitting on the
shelves since they go right I'm gonna
shuffle this little plastic tab on top
so let's pop over the table here and
let's go ahead and package them alright
folks so you guys already saw the
packaging pretty much they did it with
the camera so this is this the front the
back go ahead and open them up I start
on my computer in the back and certain
my CD into it now we can actually do a
listening test so right here J labs want
your own custom earbuds
J lab now offers exclusive premium
custom earphones their little sales tab
in there J lab audio comm custom you can
see it they make them for clients
everything else comes with an owner's
manual and warranty I won't show you
guys my little code there we'll go ahead
let's go ahead and you can see they're
in little plastic things right here and
we get a bunch of different options over
here as well you can hear Windows
starting from the background by the way
I would've listened to these so they
have a bunch of different rubber sizes
because you know different people have
different sized ears mine are pretty
neutral I'm going to go ahead and remove
these right now why are you able here
good and remove this little wiry cable
here
goodbye wiry cable kaboom and there it
goes alright then so here we have it
here's the plug control button and
microphone you see that right there and
the headphones and see the buds they're
removable like I said with those other
different ones
now I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna put
these in my ears and see how these feel
all right like I said I have average
your size and these did very well so I'm
gonna go ahead and bring these over here
take this out plug it in click the
little media player with the mouse and
then we'll take a listen you guys aren't
obviously going to be able to hear these
it's going to be next to impossible so
I'm not even gonna try to waste my time
so here's what I'll say about them I put
in my CD and I'm used to hearing it a
certain way now these things are very
basing the very deep and bass as far as
the high-end clarity there's not much
going on there but then think about it
they're under 40 bucks and they even
have a microphone installed which I'm
not even gonna probably bother going
into right now so alright folks so with
that said I'm just gonna say this for 35
bucks they're probably well worth the
money if you've lost your headphones or
anything like that if you're looking for
something higher-end I'm sure you can
find it but these are pretty good for
that price if you're losing you're not
gonna scream bloody murder now with that
said I'm also going to give these away
that's right so five days from to
release this video I'm gonna pick a
comment from down below now what does
this comment got a beam we'll check this
out I'm gonna give the prize away to
whoever has the funniest joke so please
tell me your guys's jokes down below
I'll look as well as the likes as well
as what I think is funny and in five
days I
gonna pick a winner now unfortunately
folks I know don't get mad I'm gonna do
this for only us only I'm not gonna ship
a $40 set of headphones and pay $60 plus
your custom fees just to get them over
to Europe or somewhere else it's not
feasible or worth it so this is you as
only the rest of you guys are willing to
participate just for love you guys know

America only just for the fact that it's
just too damn inexpensive so with
