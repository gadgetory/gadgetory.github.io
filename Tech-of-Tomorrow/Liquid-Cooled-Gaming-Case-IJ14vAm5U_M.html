built-in liquid cooler
check out the deep cool Gino
aesthetically wise you guys can see that
the genome is really bad at its a mid
tower case that can take ATX micro ATX
or Mini ITX motherboards and as far as
weight and dimensions go the genome
weighs 12 kilograms and size in at five
hundred and six by two hundred and ten
by five hundred and five millimeters now
I know there have been other
liquid-cooled cases out in the past but
have you ever seen one that actually had
the res built into the front of the case
the genome has the reservoir built in
the front of the case and depending on
what kind of liquid and stuff you put in
it you can dynamically change the way it
looks and the colors if you're thinking
of going old-school and you want to have
a CD player though mmm unfortunately the
genome has zero 5.25 base so if you want
to get a CD player
you're going to have to use an external
but since everything's pretty much USB
driven or online I think you're going to
be good to go and as we migrate up to
the top of the case you can see there
are a few external connections we've got
two USB 3.0 ports headphone mic jack and
then the opposite side of that we have
the power button and the reset button
the top panel has a really cool design
that features a lot of vertical slots
and these vertical slots allow airflow
through the case you can also remove the
entire top panel so that you can access
a 360 millimeter radiator the 360
millimetre radiator also features 320
millimeter fans and these things are
very unique in their design as you guys
can see and they also work for dual duty
they can be installed in your case or
they can be used as throwing stars to
throw at your cameraman
and as we move to the back of the case
you guys can see that there are also a
pair of rubber grommets this will allow
for additional water cooling if you
choose to do so looking at the rear
panel we can see that it's also
completely removable underneath there is
room for cable management as well as a
set of 2.5 SSD drives as we move down we
can see there's a little cage in the
front of the case this allows to 3.5
inch strides be mounted and then we also
have room for a rear mounted power
supply as we move to the other side of
the case you guys can see right off the
bat there's a nice clear window to see
everything inside there as we move the
side panel
you guys can see that there are room for
seven expansion Bay's plus something
really unique this uniqueness is the
ability to mount a vertical video card
that's right you can actually mount a
vertical video card in this case which
makes it really different than any other
case I've seen most cards are always
going to be to the side but this card
can be mounted where it's sitting
upright inside your system and that's
really cool it's something that's also
pretty visually appealing which you guys
will see in the build and even though
the genome is a mid tower case it
actually has the VGA compatibility to
put an SLI - 330 millimeter cards you
guys can also see that the interior of
the case is completely painted black
which is really cool for builds another
nice feature of the genome like I said
is the ability to do vertically mounted
cards now if you want to do extremely
long cards with the genome you are in
luck because even though it's a mid
tower case it can take video cards up to
330 millimeters and this can be done
simply by removing a part of this cage
it's there take it out and the cards fit
in just nicely another thing in the
interior the case is obviously the
waterblock now I couldn't get a whole
lot of information on the waterblock but
what I do know is it supports any of the
current chipsets for the desktop that
are out there so whether using an AMD
board whether using again Intel board
they have the bracket actually they come
with a bunch of external components so
whatever you need is going to be there
so what do you guys think tech fans I
mean me from first impressions I gotta
say it this deep cool genome is
definitely a pretty badass looking case
I mean it's nothing like completely off
the hook like they're tri stellar case
we showed you guys before that kind of
look like an x-wing TIE fighter but
still with
built-in liquid core the window the
features this cool helix thing right
here the way you light up inside your
cage is going to add like more dimension
to the visuals I think it's pretty damn
cool in fact this thing is so new right
now that I couldn't even find a place at
all to find a link to buy it it's that
new they ship this thing to me from
China a couple days ago and I just want
to make sure I got to the table for you
guys to take a look at but from first
looks and first impressions this guy
says hey it's a thumbs up but I want to
see what you guys think by the way I
don't think this case is going to be
really too expensive I think it's
probably going to be under 150 dollars
these guys are trying to keep their
prices a lot lower in these cases so I
don't think it's going to be anything
you know - steadily expensive in fact it
might even be cheaper but that's it man
mid tower case
lots of room ATX micro ATX mini ATX
seven expansion slots vertical GPU
mounting come on man vertical GPU
madding I can't actually wait to do that
can you imagine that
honestly I can't so anyways I'm Network
I tell you guys as a link down below
like wouldn't you guys go check this
thing out at but I'll put the link to
their website if you want to go check
their stuff out but right now I don't
think this case is for sale anywhere but
still you guys get to see it here I'm
taking tomorrow because that's what it
is
peace out we'll see you guys back here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
