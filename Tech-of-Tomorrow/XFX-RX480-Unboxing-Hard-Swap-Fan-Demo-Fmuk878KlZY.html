glad to see you guys back here once
again on the channel today we have
something interesting to take a look at
now they're a little bit late to the
game but XFX has just released their
version of the our X 480 gamers
certified now out of the box this thing
has a standard base clock of 1280 8
megahertz really really close to the Red
Devil there
it's got 256 bit memory interface a
gigabyte EDR 5 you guys know that
2304 of those lovely stream processors
so this card is ready to rock but what's
really interesting about this card isn't
so much the card itself because there
are a lot of four eighties out there
what separates this one from the pack
however is they're hard swap fans I have
right here in front of me they come in
three different colors and you can
change these things out to any color you
want so you want your card to be all
white you got white lights you want red
lights hate you got red lights you want
blue lights hey you got blue lights so
any of those kind of lights do you want
you can put in the car now I wish it
would've had three fans so you could
went red white and blue and had it all
America but with that said though let's
jump in let's do the unboxing and then
let's check out how these fans are and
let's do the fan test let's go
so first off folks let's check out the
box itself you guys can see it's the XFX
version of the Radeon rx 40 like I said
they have some of their own things here
gamers certified B already all that good
stuff no need to focus too much in the
box on the back this talks a little bit
about but more their technology and
their type of things but you guys want
to see what's actually inside this box
so let's pop the cap alright get it
outside of the box there yeah and there
we go and then also when you get it in
there says XFX right on the top of the
cardboard so your box ception
is on the move off the cap once again we
see more stuff on top this should be the
accessories pack let's see if there's
anything in there nowadays since the
drivers are available online and stuff
most companies don't give you too much
other than sometimes wow I can't believe
mmm this much trouble getting that
little simple thing but there we go okay
so inside of here we've got the driver
CD that was cool them to give that and
then you have two 6-pin to an 8 pin
molex connector good to go
steps it off to the side I believe
that's all there is as far as other
stuff goes there's a little manual
inside of here just tells you about
different parts and different things and
about the installation I think most of
my viewers out there have installed mini
video
card you guys know exactly what's up so
that's probably pretty much unneeded and
beyond that the box is empty so go ahead
and close the box get that out of the
way let's take a look at the card itself
inside of it sandy style anti-static
packaging pop that out now here are the
two fans on the front part swap Bulloch
you said pop these bad boys out very
very easily both sides actually there
hit that other boom doing pretty good
there so yeah you can see actually what
I really like about this too is a lot of
times and you're looking at a card you
can't really see the aluminum heat fans
you can't really see the copper heat
pipes but with this card if you get in
close you can actually see all that
stuff really well and that's just a
pretty cool thing so we'll get back to
that in a minute though on the bottom
nothing too special it's just simply
your PCI interface that you stick in
your motherboard nothing too much
exciting they're put on the card of the
back you can see the two ends of both
the heat pipes on the top of the card we
see the XFX logo this lights up as well
and one thing really cool that I like
about all the AMD cards are gone or any
type of crossfire fingers that's one
thing they definitely have over Nvidia
you no longer have to use any type of
thing to do your crossfire connection
which is cool as far as the cards
measurements go the card size in it 28
centimeters long by twelve point four
with a dual slot design as far as power
requirements go the eight pin power
connector requires 150 watts and XFX
recommends a 500 watt power supply
minimum to power up your card and as we
flip the card around to its backside you
see something that I am well known to
love and that is a durable back plate
I love to smack on these and you fans
out there who freaked out I hope that
you're right now getting all giddy about
it the hot but no it's tough and I like
it it looks really really good so last
but not least we have the rear i/o on
the rear i/o
we see a single DVI connection three
display ports and a single HDMI 2.0
connector so that's the card now let's
check out how really cool these hsf fans
are in action you guys saw a room a
video how easily I was able to remove
the fan they also pop in from the other
boxes just as simply I mean this is
no-brainer as you
can get the current color scheme is red
white and blue and each different color
cost about $20 a box but you can make it
any color you want or a combination of
the two so what do you guys think I
think it's pretty damn awesome that you
can hard change all of these different
fans to different colors hopefully
they'll come out with even more colors
in the future so you have more options
but right now that's it so it's time for
me to take my ass to the lab and do some
testing and then bring you guys the full
review so I'm Elric you've been watching
Tekken tomorrow and hey I want to hear
what you guys have to say do you guys
think this shit's really dope cuz I do
