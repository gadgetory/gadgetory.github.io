back TECA tomorrow we have all the tech
all the time now
you guys who have been following the
channel or followed me on my previous
adventures know that I have the system
the red dot extreme to now and I just
want to start out by apologizing because
in the last video I said that it had 128
gigabytes of RAM that was incorrect the
system has 96 K bytes of RAM not 128 my
apologies on that I'm just getting
caught up in the moment of excitement
but still get the system and now I've
got it back and we've made some serious
changes if you guys saw it originally
you guys see right here we had Swift
tech cooling but we're only using a
single fan we were using clear tubing
and using a red type of cooling liquid
to keep it cool inside now we've
completely changed the system around now
now you guys can see we've completely
removed the entire front cage of the
system we've placed another Swift tech
tripple rad in the front changed out all
the tubing in the system all the coolant
in the system and now you guys can see
that the SSD drives are actually in a
floating mount also a couple of their
changes in the previous system here
between the CPUs you can see that the
Barb was kind of placed crookedly inside
the system that was kind of a temporary
thing we're now you can see in the new
system this is completely been corrected
now this entire complete cooling kit had
to be built from the ground up it's
built from a bunch of different various
parts from Swift tech we used all kinds
of stuff in this build for both of our
Xeon CPUs we use the apogee drive to
used a pair of those we also used the
Malstrom you guys can see that that's
here in the front of the case that is
our lovely little reservoir we're also
using two of the Swift tech triple rads
one on the very top of the system one
here now located in the front so just a
lot of changes folks so there you guys
can see it though in it we've made a lot
of changes to the system I know a lot of
you guys out there said why don't I use
to single six nine or this that in the
other well this bill was pretty much
sponsored
by the people at EVGA so and you know
we're gonna use their parts in this
build and show their parts off sure I
may change in the future I'll be talking
to the guys over at EVGA s hopefully Joe
and those guys let some kind of stuff
hearts and they'll swap some parts out
but as you guys can see now the cooling
system and everything has been
completely redone in the Red Dawn - and
I'm very happy with the way that looks
and with the way that it runs previously
the system would get slightly slightly
hot it wasn't over the top but now even
with dual CPUs being cooled I'm rarely
seeing ever over five degrees over the
temperature in the room that's right so
the ambient temperature in the room I'm
beginning about five degrees above that
always with my system which is pretty
dang good that's actually excellent
cooling showing good results also if you
guys rinsed it out there and swift tech
products and stuff these things can be
completely made from the ground up
design how you want them or they have
their own type of cooling kits for you
guys to use so that's it this is just an
update on the Red Dawn extreme - hope
you guys liked this video make sure
you're subscribed because we have all
kinds of other cool stuff always coming
up here on the channel so we'll see you
guys later as I go play some games on
