tech fans from around the world it's
time to set all of the bullshit aside
that's right I said it all the bullshit
off to the side my friends get rid of
that stuff because now is launch day so
we can dig deeper into these brand-new
founders edition cards from Nvidia we've
got the 20 ATI and the 20 80 in the
house for you guys we got 15 different
games and some other tests as well to
show you if you happen to amidst our
other unboxings where you show where we
actually show you guys the basic specs
of three different cards we'll have
links down below to those things first
off though let's talk a little bit about
the architecture behind these new r-tx
cards so let's take a little bit of a
deeper look at the TU 102 chip the
touring tu 102 GPU includes six graphics
processing clusters 36 texture
processing clusters and 72 streaming
multi processors each GPC includes a
dedicated raster engine and 60 pcs
TPC includes two SMS and each SM
contains 64 cuda cores 8 sensor cores a
256 kilobyte register file for texture
units and 96 kilobytes of level one
shared memory and this memory can be
configured for various capacities
depending on the compute or graphics
workloads it's set to do ray-tracing
acceleration is performed by a new RT
core processing engine within each sm
the full implementation of the t-- 102
GPU on the 28 ETI includes the following
4608 cuda cores 72 r/t cores 576 tensor
cores 288 texture units the tu 102 in
the 2080 I also contains 12 32-bit GD r6
memory controllers 384 bits in total
tied to each memory controller or a trop
units and 512 kilobytes of level 2 cache
the full tu 102 GPU consists of 96 wrap
units and 6140 4 kilobytes of level 2
cache
and videos latest cards have some very
new features under the hood starting off
with a brand new SM the touring SM which
provides each CUDA core with 50% more
power per core than the previous
generation Pascal SM improvement has
been re-engineered so that the SM memory
path has been redesigned to unify shared
memory texture caching and memory load
caching into one unit this translates
into two times more bandwidth and more
than two times more capacity available
for level one cache for common workloads
next we have the all-new Touring sensor
cores the new tensor cores are
specialized execution units designed
specifically for performing the tensor
matrix operations that are the core
compute function used in deep learning
these are very similar to the volta
tensor cores the touring sensor cores
provide tremendous speed ups for matric
computations at the heart of deep
learning neural network training and
inferencing operations tuning tensor
cores bring new deep learning based AI
capabilities to GeForce gaming PC's and
quadrille based workstations for the
first time ever a new technique called
deep learning super sampling or DL SS is
powered by tensor cores DL SS leverages
a deep real network to extract
multi-dimensional features of the
rendered scene and intelligently
combines details from multiple frames to
construct a high quality final image DL
SS uses fewer input samples than
traditional techniques such as taa while
avoiding the algorithmic difficulties
such techniques face with transparency
and other complex scene elements the
really big thing about arc TX in general
is well rate racing in real-time now
this not only makes games looks amazing
but it actually makes them run better as
well
touring introduces real-time rate racing
that enables a single GPU to render
visually realistic 3d games and complex
professional models with physically
accurate shadows reflections and
refractions basically what it does it
makes it look more like real-life
Touring's new RT cores accelerate rate
racing and are leveraged by systems and
interfaces such as
videos r-tx ray-tracing technologies and
api such as Microsoft's DXR and videos
opti xtm and vulcan ray-tracing to
deliver a real-time ray-tracing
experience there is also another new
feature called mesh shading which is
just really more eye candy for the gamer
mesh shading advances invidious geometry
processing architecture by offering a
new shader model for the vertex
tessellation and geometry shading stages
of the graphics packed line supporting a
more flexible and efficient approach for
computation of geometry this more
flexible model makes it possible for
example to support an order of magnitude
more objects per scene by moving the key
performance bottleneck of
object list processing off of the CPU
and on to the highly parallel GPU mesh
aiding programs mesh shading also
enables new algorithms for advanced
geometric synthesis and object
management this is called LOD lastly we
see VRS or variable rate shading with
texture space shading objects are shaped
in a private coordinated space which is
a texture space that is saved to memory
and pixel shaders sample from that space
rather than evaluating the results
directly with the ability to cast
shading results in memory and reuse
resample them developers can now
eliminate duplicating work or use
different sampling approaches that
improve the quality and the way the game
plays when I did the unboxing I showed
you guys that all these new cards had a
USB seat connection now all the new
touring GPUs will include a hardware
support for USB type-c TM and virtual
link virtual ink is a new open industry
standard being developed to meet the
power display and bandwidth demands of
next generation VR headsets through a
single USBC connection if you've ever
set up VR you know that it can be a real
pain in the butt now in addition to
easing the setup hassles present today's
be our headsets virtual link will bring
VR to more devices that will actually
work a lot better and easier all right
so those are the tech facts a lot of
stuff there there's actually even more
to it but I know that a lot of people
out there aren't really engineers
they're not totally understood in the
engineering side of things but I thought
it'd be kind of unfair just to do gaming
without actually talking about the
architecture and stuff under the hood
I know usually if you go like a buy a
car you look at the you know the review
of the whole car you don't really look
at the review of the exact engine and
stuff like that but I just thought in
this case it's just better now real
quick here the card specs side by side
you can see there's not really too many
differences between the two of them just
very little between the two the power
supply differences are both 650 watt
recommended and you have the 2080
recommending that you have a minimum of
230 watts to power it and you have the
20 atti requiring that you have 260 now
the 2080 I requires 2 8 pin power
connectors the 20 80 requires a 6 pin
and an 8 pin before we jump in and do
all the testings and rock out to a brand
new song let's first check out our test
system and our test system is a pretty
nice test system i7 8700 k 16 gigs of
ram all in all really nice beefy system
we're using the latest edition of
Windows 10 with all the latest updates
these are actually required for some of
the games and some of the DirectX 12
testing that we're doing for the AMD
side of things we're using their latest
driver that's available on their website
and for all the Nvidia testing were
using the new beta driver for the RT X
cards with all the fluff out of the way
let's now rock out to a brand new song
called arc of angels and check out the
benchmarks let's go
what do you guys think of that new song
I mean in video cards aside for the
moment um what do you guys think of the
song I love it I got this brand new
guitar player been working with he's a
really great guys named Shaun Hernandez
the guy can come up with riffs and he's
awesome to work with we have lots of fun
in the studio let me know what you guys
think of this song first of all now I'm
of three different minds when it comes
to these new cards now a lot of the
things that I was speculating before
kind of in a way panned out to be true a
lot of the things about the r-tx cards
really are just visual eye candy making
things look more realistic now in the
long run all these new shadows and all
this stuff yeah it does make things look
more realistic me and Jesus we talked
about look to the games look okay you
know which ones really look difference
okay here's a here's an AMD card here's
the Vega 64 let's look at a minute and
try to remember exactly what it looks
like you know mean and then put it on
there until if I you know put it put put
two computers right next to each other
and and look at them you know what I
mean
which maybe I'll do a video later if you
guys want to see something like that let
me know the new RTX cards just look
really really good all the details are
there all the shading is there it looks
really really nice now is it going to
totally make you go if you have a 1080i
make you go oh my god my 1080 TI sucks
I must sell it now and buy new r-tx card
I'd have to say the answer is no now my
three minds of this are there's the good
the bad and the ugly and the good is
this these cards do look great they do
if you've got the cash to throw down and
you just want the absolute best of the
best and you don't give a frakking cows
but about the price then these cards are
really nice cards all the bells and
whistles on you guys can see even at 4k
60 frames per second or more on every
single solitary game that there is so
that was a goal that
they said oh you know nobody can have a
video card that I can hit for came you
know it's 4k is sixty frames per second
but look NVIDIA did do that with these
cards so if you're a 4k gamer and you
want at least 60 frames per second
gameplay well now you can actually get
that with an RTX 2080 eye or a 2080 card
you can do that that is the good you
know I'm saying now the bad of this
however is that currently there's not
very many games out there that support
all the new ray-tracing technology now
this is probably going to be the future
of games in the future of technology as
people implemented into their designs
but currently right now there's very few
games that actually take full advantage
of it shadow of the Tomb Raider was an
amazingly great looking game it's
actually pretty damn fun too you can you
know check out lure crows booty that's
right so I mean at that level you know
that's kind of you know the bad because
okay well if it's not gonna support a
whole a whole lot of games right now if
you go out and you buy this card right
now and just rush out what are you
really jumping into I mean cuz all your
other games and stuff yeah they'll play
you know and they'll play actually you
know Nvidia really didn't hype this up
too much they said between 35 and 45
percent better performance than a 1080i
and 10 percent better than a Titan then
you know what it turned out to be true
those numbers were actually accurate
they didn't hype that up whatsoever but
unfortunately the bad is there's just
not a whole lot of games and a whole lot
of things right now for us gamers to
take advantage of and then last but not
least the ugly is just that whoo 1,300
bucks holy frickin shit Batman that is
so expensive to get a video card I mean
I can't say that's honestly just totally
not worth it I mean almost I can I'm
like this close to saying it's just
totally not worth it but the person the
media likes really knew Tekken is is
okay it is but it's just it's kind of
ahead of its time when USB first came
out there were actually built or not a
few years where there are USB plugs on
every motherboard and no USB devices now
this isn't that bad
you know with the USB type-c connects on
the back of it hopefully we're gonna see
all kinds of new VR headset gear that
comes out that's much faster has much
better frame rates and makes VR just an
overall better experience you know I
mean hopefully we see that but these
prices you know for 13 or bucks for a
fountain tradition 28 yeah holy crap
that it's so expensive yes you can get a
non founders Edition 28 for about you
know over a little over a hundred
dollars right but that's just still
supremely supremely expensive I just
released a video yesterday if you guys
happen to miss that as well the link
where I talked about like right now for
you you know want to go out and you want
to build yourself a high-end gaming PC
and you're like an Intel you know Nvidia
guy the prize are getting so up there
that unless you're a rich person you
really can't afford it you know really
offering AMD a unique opportunity to
GABA pull out of market share because
the people who don't have money or it's
gonna be like you know what all these
fancy new features yeah they look great
they're all cool but man I ain't got
that much money period
I don't even can't even think about
getting that much money and that puts
Nvidia out of their reach and in a way
that kind of really sucks because it
puts in vidi in a position where
honestly even if they make more money
they're not going to be a card that the
Lehman's going to be able to afford
they're only gonna have cards out there
that really rich people can't afford and
that's gonna kind of suck so at the end
of the day that's it folks the good the
bad the ugly that's just how it is
oh another thing I want to talk about as
well I think I kind of I kind of missed
this earlier the cards temperatures were
actually pretty nice the 28th et I it
got 81 Celsius under full load and the
2080 was at 77 so
those temperatures weren't very bad at
all and the card is completely quiet
there was no lawn mower type effect
going whatsoever I should have mentioned
that earlier in the video the
speculation it's over the results they
are in I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you guys for watching tech
of tomorrow if you're not sub he please
sub the channel we'd love to see you
guys back here and
make sure you see your subs hey make
sure your notifications are turned on so
that you see our videos in your Inbox
