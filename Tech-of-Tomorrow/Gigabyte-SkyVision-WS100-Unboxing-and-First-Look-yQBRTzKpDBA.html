tomorrow glad to see you guys here elric
Faris your host now today we're going to
bring you when unboxing a very very
interesting product from the people at
gigabyte this is their new sky vision WS
100 which is geared to like basically
take all of your device that use an hdmi
cable and make it wireless means
basically you can take your Xbox you can
take your PlayStation 3 your portable PC
your laptop whatever use this device and
might transfer all the data directly to
your TV eliminating the use of the hdmi
cable which is pretty cool another some
other products that are slightly geared
like that but this isn't supposed to be
very affordable and actually going to be
pretty well available so i'll be selling
it all over the place so without so much
further ado let's go ahead and do the
unboxing and I have my knife collection
over here teasing you guys we're going
to do a video because you guys about to
see what they all are so we're going to
show you in another video but for now
let's take a look at the new sky vision
WS 100
all right folks here we got it the
gigabyte sky vision WS 100 HD video sink
on the go you can check out they got a
picture of it to me it almost kind of
looks like a postal scale if you get
your buttons on here tear out your
little package to do a little weight
thing there but it's not it's actually a
device for transmitting all your data
and all your movies to your big-screen
TV so here's one device this is one
that's going to plug in we see her in
the front as HD 1080p is the transfer
rate says both source and display must

you guys can read it if you care to but
basically it's tone that you can take
all your devices transmit them through
your TV wirelessly and be able to take
that stuff anywhere you want around your
home like so you can take your laptop be
probably watching moving your laptop and
transmit to the TV at the same time so
