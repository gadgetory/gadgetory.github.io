nomar we're bringing you the tech of the
times on today's video is about 1070 TI
in sli so we're gonna show you it
against a standard 1070 and against a
1080 TI now Before we jump in and show
you guys the benchmarks and all that
stuff I want to give a special thanks to
our friend Mark from babble tech reviews
he's the guy who did all this 35 game
testing this guy actually lives to test
which is kind of crazy because sitting
there for me for hours on end I did that
in my 30s and 40s I was like almost
blind from staring at a screen but hey
he loves it so let's real quick let's
jump in let's check out the test system
then let's jump in and let's see the
benchmarks and let's see at the end of
the day is 1070 TI SLI actually worth
your cash today's test system consists
of the Intel Core i7 8700 K this is
running with turbo boost up to 4.6
gigahertz on all cores and for the
motherboard it's the asrock z 370 killer
sli motherboard 16 gigabytes of HyperX
ddr4 memory that's to a gigabyte sticks
running at 3333 megahertz all of the
games tested except for Wolfenstein were
tested with NVIDIA GeForce 3 8 8.0 9
driver but for Wolfenstein we use the
3/8 8.13 driver because it is optimized
for that game so alright guys I know
these are a lot of benchmarks to sit
through and watch but there were 35
games tested and we got to bring them to
you in a format that's not like dragging
on forever and that's the way we do it
this way but for those people out there
who enjoy the music and everything hey
enjoy the music and check out the
benchmarks and just chill
all right Tech fans so there you have it
35 games has it that's a whole hell of a
lot of work trust me once again special
thanks to mark for doing all that work
over at Babel tech reviews we'll have a
link to his site down below now you guys
can see that too 1070 t is an SLI
actually is the same as a single 1080 TI
you know when it does well in SLI when
it doesn't do well in SLI obviously it's
a totally complete wasted point in this
online means nothing so if you have
older games or you know you have a lot
of games that actually do support SLI
then getting a 1070 T is my set up is
probably for you if you want to get a
1080i a SLI setup it's gonna cost you
about 300 more dollars but if you want
those people and you can really afford
$900 I don't really feel that spending
$300 more is really that much the
performance differences really aren't
going to be that you know ginormous but
if you're somebody who wants the
absolute best in SLI performance then
obviously spend the extra $300 and get
yourself to 1080 T eyes in SLI but as it
is when it works it works and I mean
that's kind of like dumb stupid you know
to say but it's just true when SLI works
and it's supported the cards do very
very well you can see they easily
support and beat a 10-8 and excuse me a
1080i in some instances so it's a pretty
good deal after you play games that do
not support SLI don't even waste your
money whatsoever so I know you guys been
watching Tekken tomorrow thank you very
much for sticking around down below like
button we'll have links to all these
different cards so if you want to
purchase one of these cards or just I'm
testing for yourself you can do so we'll
see you guys back from the channel
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
