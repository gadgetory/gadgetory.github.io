seen the Red Devil rx 580 and what it
looks like how it scores now let's check
out its little brother that's right the
Red Devil RX 570 now some of the
features about this card is it has
triple blade technology on the fans you
guys can see right now it's three fans
in front this actually increases how
long the fans last and has 20% better
efficiency some of the other features
about this car it has great power
conditioning talk to you guys about this
before power conditioning is basically
regulating all the power that comes into
your card the smooth of that is and the
less variance there is the longer your
card will last so you know this card
will last quite a while it's also priced
very well doesn't have a great huge
power requirement on it but with that
said hey then let's jump in and let's
check out power colors Red Devil RX 570
so first off folks let's check out the
top of the card now you guys can see
unlike the rx 580 that we saw earlier
today this card actually has three fans
on it three of those triple blade fans I
was talking about but that actually
makes the card a lot longer
in fact this card is 11 inches long by 4
inches high and features a dual slot
design so it's a lot longer than most of
the cards out there you probably want to
make sure when you're checking this out
it'll fit inside your system because it
is like I said it's an 11 inch freaking
card and that's pretty damn long now
underneath all that stuff you guys can
clearly see more aluminum heat fins and
everything to keep the card running cool
but the look just looks nice it's black
and red fits that AMD theme so people
out there who are building systems like
that this will fit right in there with
that color spectrum and you'll be on the
go take a look at the bottom the card
the first things you guys will notice is
the PCIe connection and if you look
again you guys can see more of those
aluminum heat fins permeating all about
the side of the car this helps dissipate
that heat away from your card and keep
it from burning up now taking a look at
the top of the card you guys can see
this card also is a lot more simplistic
than on the rx 580 the RX 580 had an RGB
switch it has a switch between the dual
bios's this card doesn't have anything
like that whatsoever it's a lot more
vanilla good thing about it is though
single 8 pin power connector minimum
power requirements 431 power supply
so that's really cool and then once
again we see the little red devil logo
there and taking a look at the outputs
you guys can see there's a single DVID
connection three display ports and a
single HDMI connection alright folks so
when we take a look at the back of the
card you guys are going to notice for at
the bet that there's no Seal of Solomon
on you that's kind of crazy cuz I think
it's like one of the things that people
talk about this card creates a little
bit of controversy but it does have a
full fledged cover in the back so it'll
keep your card from getting banged up
like from people like me you like to
smack the back of the card so there it's
durable but that said though let's jump
in now and let's check out the specs the
Red Devil RX 570 features four gigabytes
of gddr5 memory with a 256-bit memory
interface features 2048 stream
processors a boost clock of thirteen
hundred and twenty megahertz
now the memory clock on this card is
1750 megahertz which translates to seven
gigabits per second alright so that's
what she looks like
and her specs and folks I got apologize
to you guys if I don't have as much
energy as normal I haven't actually
slept in days and I feel like crap I
know this stuff's important so I made
sure to get this video for you guys now
as far as our testing goes we use our
producer system this features an AMD
risin 1600 X it has a liquid core h-11 o
zero this thing works right out of the
box not to worry about getting any kind
of connectors to change out to get it to
fit in your system so I love that thing
for that particular reason alone now we
use this test system because I figured
like a lot of people out there who use
AMD stuff we really like to see what it
is in the cpu that people are saying is
a sweet spot 1600 X seems to be by
voting and all accounts out there to be
the very sweet spot of a new AMD Rison
lineup so therefore decided let's do
those tests on those types of systems
instead of using some super high-end
Intel system with an i7 6915 all this
other crazy stuff that most people would
even be doing to get these cards because
let's just face it AMD is known for
budget this card is going to be priced
probably right around 200 bucks there's
going to be a definitely you know budget
video card so why not use a system that
can be built up to a budget system with
a good be 350 motherboard this card you
have the basis for a really nice system
that's not going to cost the bank a lot
of money but with that said though let's
jump in
let's check out those test scores and
see how this card does
against the competition let's rock
you
whoo okay and I really were to start
with this thing I'm just going to say
this right off the bat I'm just not
impressive discard not in any way shape
or form just me personally I'm not
impressed you guys can let me know what
you're thinking out there but this to me
is kind of a weird card in a lot of
instances the rx4 80 still beats this
card and although this card does come to
market at a little bit of a cheaper
price I just don't really know where
this card actually comes in it's pretty
much like a card that said it's balls
cut off you know so for gigabyte card rx
40 is an 8 gigabyte card so why even
really bring a 570 you know to the
market that's kind of a cut-down now
obviously you know the 470 the previous
generation this is kind of it's like
replacement and it's a little bit faster
than that I was also expecting a little
bit more from this card although the
price is low power requirements or just
a single 8 pin that's still cool even
the fact that you don't even have to
have a very powerful power supply to use
this you know recommended as a 430 what
power supply so that means pretty much a
really low end power supply can power
this card and that's good for people who
are trying to you know do build that
have low-end parts all the way around to
keep it cheap but as far as the
performance goes and just not all that
impressed this card the card does run
however cool it does run quiet those
things are good but if you are really
looking for something to come in and
basically replace your old card I just
don't feel that this is the card to do
it with some people out there may
disagree I always want to hear you guys
opinions about that but for me
personally I don't see myself buying
this and I can't honestly with a great
heart recommend this card to anybody to
be true to myself I'm sorry about that
but if you guys want to get more
information about this card down that
like button will have more information
where you can hopefully purchase one or
just get more information if you're
looking so it will be there please don't
kill me if you don't like the card I'm
just bringing you guys the news so peace
out and we'll see you guys back on tech
of tomorrow for more damn tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
