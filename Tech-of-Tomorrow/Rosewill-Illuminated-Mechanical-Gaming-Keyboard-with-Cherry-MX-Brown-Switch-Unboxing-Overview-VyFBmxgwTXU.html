and we're gonna get the hell out of
there cuz I think about this box name
I'm gonna pop it open right here simple
thing Oh looks like I actually am going
to need a trusty knife which I shall
borrow from Doc's arsenal make a quick
incision here another quick incision
here org incision in the cameraman no
just kidding
Cameron doesn't like to be incision
politically incorrect that's my parents
okay so here it is in a box I'll serve
it up next with some locks I'll serve it
up with dirty socks and then I'll look
like Goldilocks
I don't know it's just tryin to be a
funny guy there I'm not as funny as the
doc I know anyways here's the keyboard
inside of its box go ahead and pull it
out here now and what we got in here all
