that Russian guy today he who usually
does the Rose will stuff he has the
autumn vacation right now you will not
see Ivan he is not here right now so I
bet back sir so do these videos for you
today all right so what's up back into
it here it is right here in front of me
it's the illuminated mechanical gaming
keyboard from Rosewill
supposed to be bronze you know Cherry MX
bronze that's the key case you guys are
wondering what I meant by that it's
basically around the hundred dollar
price range but it's gonna be totally
illuminated and will actually plug it in
anyway so let's jump over the table
we'll just do the quick unboxing and
then let's look at this damn thing so
come on down
alright so we're the friendly Box folks
says Cherry MX which this one's bronze I
was told gold plated USB connectors LED
indicators durable metal inner chassis
two port USB 2.0 hub and six key roll
over the rest of it I already told you
about the aluminum mechanical gaming
keyboard or the i mg good that's right I
like that sound better on the IMG kay
let's just call it that folks let's
agree it's the IMG K by Rose well there
we go so here's the back of the IMG K
and we're gonna get the hell out of
there cuz I think about this box name
I'm gonna pop it open right here simple
thing Oh looks like I actually am going
to need a trusty knife which I shall
borrow from Doc's arsenal make a quick
incision here another quick incision
here org incision in the cameraman no
just kidding
Cameron doesn't like to be incision
politically incorrect that's my parents
okay so here it is in a box I'll serve
it up next with some locks I'll serve it
up with dirty socks and then I'll look
like Goldilocks
I don't know it's just tryin to be a
funny guy there I'm not as funny as the
doc I know anyways here's the keyboard
inside of its box go ahead and pull it
out here now and what we got in here all
right we've got the the Rose will oops
we do it again
we've got the rose well nope take five
there we go
the Rose will illuminate a mechanical
gaming keyboard the arcane 9100 be our
of the IM g k network that's right
sounds like a game the ing k I get down
with the IMG K I am alright two of the
gold plated connectors right here you
can see those alright enough for the
gold plated connectors go ahead and take
this out of the package open the back up
here cut a zoom design let's try to get
this plastic off in here
raw nice steady your Ripper there

on the back you see two flipper switches
get that up a nice solid rubber solid
River again since we got it on this side

let's just go ahead and let's plug this
thing and to see what all the
illumination is about so I show unplug
the one I have plugged in and then we
show plug in Z new one look one nd plug
it to and there we go illumination let
me turn off some lights in here so check
that out folks
gnome latke is it a green light Tillie
it's on or off says on the screen my
device is ready to use so you're not to
install any separate drivers but to
check it out so it's plug and play you
can see all the keys are nice and blue
I'm actually wearing sunglasses and I
can see it very well so since you're not
wearing sunglasses or maybe you are that
you want to get into Biff Baxter
character I know I do whenever I watch
Biff I want to get in character just
saying what yeah I'm just saying all
right so all right folks that's it oh

verts in so this thing's gonna be pretty
good for gaming for typing I won't know
till I actually use it but I shall set
it down just take a feel of the keys and
make you feel pretty good
so alright folks I hope you guys liked
