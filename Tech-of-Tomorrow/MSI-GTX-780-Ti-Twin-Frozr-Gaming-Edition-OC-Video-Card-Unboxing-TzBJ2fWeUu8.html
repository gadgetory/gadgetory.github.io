780 Ti Twin Frozr gaming edition from
the people over at MSI you guys all know
the 780 is pretty much the fastest
single you know card you can get right
now on the market going head-to-head you
know with 290x and all that stuff but

Frozr cooling on it so with that said

ready for 3d mark obviously it's ready
for the remark let's pull it around the
back here here is the nomenclature here
we go
there we go nice shot for you guys there
now we'll move past that and go ahead
and just pop the cap here now one thing
to take notice of most of the video
cards that we get don't come in like
shrink wrap packages now I don't know if
you guys buy a lot of these things out
there in the old market and they do but
this one I believe is already seen the
CES show a lot of the stuff we've been
getting in lately saw CES and that's
going out for sampling afterwards some
looks like it has the full content
though so let's pop this little cap here
what we got in here and dump it all out
of the centerpiece here and then toast
the camera Harvick can yeah he's lucky
you ducked that's right
sucker knows what's up that's right all
right so we get the little driver CD all
your and video stuff in there you get
the quick user's guide you get a little
8 pin a little power converter right
here and then you get molex to 6-pin so
you know an 8 pin and a 6 pin power
connector 2 different types of
connections there and your DVI to VGA
connector that's all the accessories
under that is the card itself dun dun
dun dun dun on a steel package are let's
take this grab it and throw it on the
floor over here so we can get that later
alright now we'll open up the card
itself double wingy I feel like I'm at
Vegas alright everybody doing the show
here you go here's the car whippin it
down here for the public alrighty then
here we go for the first time whipping
it out the big and gigantic twin frozer
look at that sombitch it's huge so let's
set it down real quick and let's see how
big it is so card length is about ten
and a quarter inches we'll have this
translated on the screen for you folks
those folks who don't use inches and use
millimeters will have that translate in
the car going upwards is four and a half
inches so it's four and a half inches
tall a pretty tall card and as far as
it's with goats it's one and a half
inches in thickness
not too shabby there you see the two
fans obviously on the front hence the
Twin Frozr name underneath the cooling
apparatus they have tons of stuff here
it's all gonna be connected to the GPU
it's gonna dissipate out into the heat
fins and then we're going to see it out
into the heat pipes and then that's
going to keep the car running awesomely
cool to the MSI logo here you see more
they keep piping around here here's the
eight pin and the six pin we talked
about earlier those connection cables
came inside the box so if your power
supply doesn't happen to have them
you'll have them right here on the card
no problem on the back see it's a black
PCB I wish was a cover on this that's
become my favorite thing lately I love
that I know you guys do too we see two
of es Li fingers here on top the PCI
insertion right here flip around you
guys can just see a thin angle of the
card and then here on this side we can
see more of the heat pipes coming all
around right there then last but not
least let's flip it around let's take a
look at 3:02 DV is standard VGA standard
