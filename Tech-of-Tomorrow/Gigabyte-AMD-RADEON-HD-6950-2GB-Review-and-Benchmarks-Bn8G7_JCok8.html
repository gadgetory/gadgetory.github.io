end of the day whether it's worth your
money at the end user let's check this
out
okay the new AMD Radeon 69 series
features a dual graphic image of the
Nuvi liw 4 core architecture which you
can see illustrated here it also has a
fast turn 56-bit gddr5 memory interface
AMD has busted out some new features
here which is an enhanced quality
anti-aliasing err eqa a and there's
three types supported adaptive
anti-aliasing super sample anti-aliasing
and the new morphological anti-aliasing
features you also see the new AMD power
tune technology now what this does is
this either increases your performance
by 20% or decreases your performance by
20% whether you're in gaming or non
gaming mode this is pretty cool because
it actually can make your computer save
energy when you're not in gaming mode
the card also features fifth generation
vapor cooling now that the vapor cooling
does is it helps get all of the heat
away from the GPU now for efficiency in
acoustics this makes the card run cool
and also keeps it from being very loud
in your PC for those of you guys into
the Eyefinity technology this card
supports up to six monitors out of one
card here in this illustration you can
see how this is done okay so here we go
onto the features of the new HD 6950

gaming power when gaming is 140 watts
and idle power is 20 watts this card
requires just a 6 pin and a 6 pin power
connector and it also features two DVI

connector
okay so you see the scores the new HD
6950 actually is a card that has a niche
of its own it's below the 416 470
but it's below the gtx 570 it's also a
little bit cheaper this card comes in at
