waiting for it we've been waiting for it
to the brand new AMD R X 480 is here
it's supposed to be price right and you
want to see what it's all about we've
got what it's all about
let's go
alright kiddies so I've got this card in
my hot little hands and there's some
things you're going to want to know
about it now this card as you guys can
see it's not any aftermarket design
whatsoever this is just straight-up one
of the cards from AMD this is the 88
goodbye virgin in our hand now the front
of it features just a single fan design
the card size is in though at nine and a
half inches long by four inches high and
it's a two slot design so pretty much
like all the other cards that you're
seeing out there in the same size range
there's nothing too exciting or two
different about that now in a reality
there's not too much the design of the
reference model you know our X 480
it's simple front design single fan the
back absolutely no backplate if you
touch the card over there you can't
actually cut yourself you guys can see
the PCB is actually even smaller than
the cooling solution you know all that's
pretty is pretty simple stuff now there
are some cool things about the car that
you're going to be very happy about
first of those is the power requirements
single six pin power connector only
requires a hundred and fifty watts of
power we actually did some of our
testing on an AMD based system that an
8350 you guys thought it was the Icarus
system this card is running on the EVGA
430 what power supply absolutely no
problems whatsoever so it doesn't
require a giant power supply to run the
RX 40 that's for damn sure
now the Rio something cool few folks out
there like running through your TVs and
all that hdmi 2.0 is on the polaris
chipset so you get that support with
this card and there's also three display
ports you can run multi monitor
technology all off the 480 so we've seen
how the card looks we've seen it speeds
and feeds now let's talk about some of
the special features that you're going
to want to know about as a gamer the RX
authority is based off the 14 nanometer
FinFET process it also features a
fourth-generation GCN architecture
it features 36 compute units 2,304
stream processors it as a base clock
speed of 1120 megahertz a boost clock of
twelve hundred sixty-six megahertz and
features up to 5.8 teraflops of peak
performance like I said the card that we
have is the eight gigabyte model there's
also a four gigabyte model available out
there as well the RX 40 features a
256-bit memory interface and it also
features a memory band
with of 224 and gigabits a second come
like I said previously the board power
only requires 150 watts to power the
cart and that's awesome
you also get AMD freesync technology
direct x12 support Vulcan support and
support for BR premium and if you happen
to be wondering what is VR premium
basically VR premium is AMD solution
this moment to the VR world so all right
folks that's what the card looks like
that's the card speeds and beads now
there are some special features that
come with this cards and things that
have been improved like liquid VR that's
going to have improved stuff of Polaris
DirectX 12 all going to be supported and
they actually have a new type of audio
the disposition inaudi oh and everything
throughout the card so your audio
environments also going to be improved
as well few people use the audio you
know directly from your card I know
there's some hardcore people out there
who still use a sound card but you
really don't need it with the new
technology that's on this card so with
that said let's first check out that
test system and then let's rock out to
the benchmark song and check out those
bitches
now if you folks wondering how does the
480 boost with most games we saw the
card burning at about 1200 67 megahertz
but when it came to overclocking I don't
meet a kick AMD but the overclocking
results in this card were actually
pretty shoddy we just did a 1.5%
overclock the card shot from 83 Celsius
all the way up to 91 Celsius and if we
try to push it any farther than that the
system would actually crash how so there
you have it a and DS rx 480 is here
starting at $200 with a base model and
moving up to the 8 gigabyte monsters I
think I'm $300 so you guys can see it
runs a little bit hot but the scores are
really nice in 1080 and 1440 this card's
kicking absent for the price range it's
going to be a serious competitor out
there in the market I may lurk you guys
been watching teka tomorrow we're going
to have lots of more videos including
this card inside the system we made last
week the ecosystem which is all AMD
based so you people out there well in
8350 1820 those types of CPUs you'll be
happy to see that video and that's
coming up next
like usual all the information about
this will be down below that like button
hopefully you guys like this video go
Jacky Chan style in it and we'll see you
guys background check in tomorrow or
more fricking tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
