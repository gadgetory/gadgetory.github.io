Braintree hey YouTube and tech fans from
around the world I'm Eric and you're
watching tech Oh tomorrow now Apple has
been releasing their iphones since 2007
in the fall of 2016 they're planning on
releasing their brand-new iPhone 7
supposedly there be a couple of
different models and we were actually
able to get our hands on a nonworking
mock-up which will show some of the
supposin iterations that might be coming
out now real quick though let's talk
about so far what Apple has released the
og iPhone was released in 2007 followed
up in 2008 by the iPhone 3G in 2009 we
see the iPhone 3GS 2010 and iPhone 4
which actually features a new design in
2011 the iPhone 4s in 2012 and iPhone 5
once again featuring a new design in
2013 the iPhone 5s 2014 the iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 plus also again with the new
design and then in 2015 we saw the
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s plus
now if Apple keeps following their
numbering sequence obviously the
following iteration will be the iPhone 7
and there's supposedly two versions that
are supposed to be coming out one with a
4.7 screen and one with a 5.5 inch
screen now a lot of the features that
you're going to see though in the iPhone
7 are definitely going to be a lot like
the iPhone 6 and its brothers right in
that range but there will be some new
features obviously since Apple is always
bringing something new to the table what
exactly these things are going to be
well that was the big question and what
is a big question the table so real
quick let's take a look at some of the
rumors of what people are saying might
happen with the new iPhone 7 so first
off like I said before there will be two
versions that are coming out you're
gonna have the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7
plus there happened some rumors
circulating around about a version
called the iphone 7 pro but that is yet
to actually be officially announced or
confirmed in any way at all it's rumored
to have the same general shape as the
iPhone 6s but with a camera that
protrudes less now a lot of people
disagree with this and they're saying
hey there's no way that that's fact but
that's actually one of the biggest
rumors around right now
on the mock-up unit that we were able to
get our hands on the antenna bands are
no longer located on the back of the
device they're actually located at the
top and the bottom and around the sides
now another thing that's really crazy is
there's no headphone jack whatsoever
there are rumors however though that
Apple is going to sell a separate pair
of bluetooth headphones but that's just
a little bit crazy now replacing them at
the bottom there you can see there's
actually two stereo speakers now so
hopefully with the new iPhone 7 we're
gonna see stereo sound now how the
headphones are gonna go are we gonna see
an adapter are they going to include it
or we're gonna have to buy them
separately that's all speculation but
one thing is for damn sure the headphone
jack is gone the other guys are gonna
adapter and hook it up to the Lightning
port or use bluetooth so the old days of
using any kind of wired direct
headphones are gone the front of the
iPhone 7 is also expect to see some
changes with a longer earpiece cut out
or relocated ambient light sensor and a
flush pressure-sensitive home button
that incorporates haptic feedback well
this happened hmm
rumors say it will another big rumor
about the iPhone 7 is they're saying
that since they removed that headphone
jack maybe they'll make the unit 1
millimeter thinner now a lot of people
disagree with that they're saying crazy
though no way because if you guys send
it before a lot of people out there
unbox therapy people do this whole thing
about the bendgate you know about
bending the phones putting in their back
pocket and doing it my friend Jonathan
he'll be shot an arrow through one like
people have done this crazy stuff to the
iPhones the insane stuff but I don't
know what do you guys think about this
particular point I mean everybody is
saying ok the thinner the better but if
they actually did bend and break do you
think that one millimeter thinner is
actually a good design implementation or
do you think that's just crazy
that's gonna lead to more breakage let
me definitely hear your opinions on that
down below another rumor that it's been
floating around is people are saying
that the removal of the headphone jack
will actually allow the iPhone 7 to have
a better waterproof design hopefully
that'll be seen because we've seen some
phones out there that are completely
submersible maybe the new iPhone 7 will
be something you can take swimmin with
naked women
there are also some blueprints that have
surfaced that show a smart connector on
the new iPhone 7 but what that shows
that it will only be incorporated though
into the larger screen
if at all although the internal specs of
the iPhone 7 aren't known yet we can
speculate that they will continue on its
path introducing more powerful efficient
devices with each design iteration the
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are expect to
include next generation 810 processors
manufactured by tsmc but one of the
biggest upgrades is that internal
storage space is getting a boost with
entry-level device expect to start at 32
gigabytes instead of 16 gigabytes this
is awesome stuff Apple and there are
also rumors saying that there might be a
versions available up to 256 gigabytes
another big difference between the
iPhone 7 the iPhone 7 plus is the amount
of RAM the iPhone 7 is supposed to have
2 gigabytes in RAM while the iPhone 7
plus 3 gigabytes of RAM plus the plus
version is supposed to have the dual cam
design that we showed you that our
mock-up has here as well and come on we
all know two is better than one the
iPhone 7 plus will use two cameras
instead of one with a 2 to 3 X optical
zoom and improved performance and low
life conditions for brighter more
detailed photos the iPhone 7 will likely
continue use a standard single lens
camera as multiple sources said that
dual lens camera is exclusive to the 5.5
inch iPhone plus but there's also a
rumour saying that the iPhone 7 may have
optical image stabilization we'll see
and before we wrap up today's video I
want to give a special shout out to the
people over at Braintree for make in
today's video possible
even the best mobile app will not work
unless you have the proper payment API
and that's where these folks come in to
solve all your problems
this is where brain trees V 0 SDK comes
in one amazingly simple integration
gives you every way to pay it supports
Android iOS and JavaScript clients and
it offers a simple integration that you
can do in minutes if this sounds good to
you try it out for yourself in the
sandbox all you gotta do is go WWE bring
three payments dot-com /t ot although
the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus will
probably have an official
release date of September 23rd on
September 16th the public will first see
the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus with
pre-orders beginning on September 9 so
this thing's coming to market and it's
coming pretty soon now like I said the
mock-up that we have is an unworking
model but you guys can see as the 5.5
inch screen now one thing I want to note
though there has been rumors that the
mute button they see you located in the
side of this phone will be removed I
don't really think that's going to
happen I don't think it's a good idea at
all I know a lot of you Mac fans out
there I want to hear what you guys have
to say about that
and also we see the dual camera mode on
this one so I'm thinking this has
definitely got to be the iPhone 7 plus
mock up not the iPhone 7 itself since
you know it's got a bigger screen and
all that stuff now all this stuff that I
stated though however is room are not
actual solidified facts and people over
at Apple itself and I know there's a lot
of fans out there going hey man what's
happening on that and so you guys can
see they're going to be some big changes
and some things are gonna stay the same
so a little bit of the new a little bit
of the old so I'm Network you guys been
watching teka tomorrow now one thing I
do want to note though it has been
stated though that if this thing does
have some of the features I said like
the waterproofing the newell dual lens
camera all that stuff that may actually
delay shipments of the new iphone 7 but
that's also rumor we'll have to see when
that day arrives for now i'm Elric
you've been watching tech of tomorrow
we'll have more information about this
down below where you guys can check out
some more stuff about it around the net
peace out and uh hope for the new iPhone
sevens will be here soon and see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
