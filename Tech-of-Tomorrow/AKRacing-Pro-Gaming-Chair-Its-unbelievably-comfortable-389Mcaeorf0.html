many times about the word gaming and how
attaching it to stuff a lot of times
really doesn't mean Jack diddly it's
just kind of a sales play to go hey
check me out boom ah I'm a gaming
product and we've seen a lot of chairs
that have come in through the door that
say they're a gaming chair now we all
know that in reality a chair is just a
chair you know it really is so when I
think of a gaming chair the number one
thing that I think about is can I sit in
this chair for hours on end without my
back hurting my butt hurting and without
being uncomfortable and one of the
things I really hate is when the
armrests are like really super so low so
I feel like I'm going like this I just
really hate that so to me to qualify for
a gaming chair the very first thing that
I'm gonna be looking for right off the
bat is comfort and today's video is
about a chair that I have honestly found
to be the most comfortable chair that
I've ever sat in I don't care whether
it's been a gaming chair an office chair
a lounge chair a beanbag chair whatever
I like this I know they're gonna let
people have every all they want to see
in the video as a person you know
beating a product up because that seems
to be their thing but I honestly the
only caveat about we're gonna be talking
about today is probably the price
because a chair with this much quality
is actually gonna cost you a few bucks
but it'll last an extremely long time as
well
so today I've got a cheering from a kei
racing now this is their pro gaming
chair and I'm just gonna tell you guys
right off the bat this is the most
comfortable chair I've ever said I'm
sitting here right now and as I'm just
sitting here I'm really and in my
thoughts my mind is God how comfortable
my back is many times the lumbar support
in the chair we have to remove them
because when you have the lumbar support
on most chairs it feels like it's
pushing you off the chair you guys out
there know what I mean you put the
lumbar support it feels like you're
sitting on the edge of your seat I'm
totally chill all the way back in this
chair right now and the lumbar support
is just perfect for me
is the perfect chair now these guys did
ask me questions before they sent the
chair they asked me how tall I was they
asked me how much I weighed and they
even asked me a few other questions
because I guess with different
parameters they have a lot of different
chairs I actually just sent an email to
the company and asked him to give
discount codes for you guys so you guys
can check one of these out so we're
gonna definitely have discount codes for
this chair and she told me to reply that
she was really glad that I liked the
chair because she wanted to make sure
that I got one that fit my body height
and my weight so they honestly do seem
like they're doing research about their
chairs before just throwing a chair out
there and attaching a name on it so why
am I saying all this cool stuff well
anyways I don't know let's take a
close-up look at the chair and you guys
tell me what you think so we'll just
start off at the bottom now you guys see
this is a five-wheel star aluminum base
the wheels on this are really really
nice um
wheels in my opinion can always be
better on almost every chair out there
the bigger the wheel and the bigger it
is the easier it is a slide across
carpet and stuff like that
I was able to slide across the carpet
and do stuff on this chair pretty easily
not the absolute best wheels I've ever
seen but they're not junk either they
actually do work now next up we have the
class 4 gas lift now you guys are going
to locate class bored gas lifts well
that's just a rating system about how
well they work and how long that they
will last and this particular one not
much to really say about it other than
the fact that once again it does work
and it's pretty silent I mean you might
like that cool Shh sound it makes as
you're going up and down and best of all
this gas lift can support people up to
330 pounds so even if you're a big guy
you know you're gonna be able to sit in
this chair and not have to worry about
breaking that the chair also features
three inch casters now one thing I
really like about a lot of chairs is the
ability to do a full 180 recline is when
you can pretty much just like lay down
in your chair I mean if you ever seen
like in movies those old-school chairs
we could just kick back and the footrest
came up and all that stuff
those little recliner chairs now this
chair would be like really totally crazy
if they had some attachment you could
put because then you could totally sleep
on it but it does do a full one
80 reclined so if you want to just
totally chill out in the chair you can
do it another thing that I don't like
about a lot of chairs and I said a right
the beginning of the video is how the
armrests work I mean a lot of them just
all I do is go up and down they don't
really do much and they don't go very
high up now for me I like these because
they go high enough where I feel like
I'm not like putting my arm just like
way down and these are 4d adjustable
armrests which means that you can turn
them left to right you can move them up
and down sideways you can do pretty much
everything with this armrest to make it
to your comfort level the pro racing
chair also has a wide metal frame so you
know it's not going to break down soon
at all now I told you guys the very
beginning of the video that I thought
this was the most comfortable chair well
they used cold cure foam and this makes
it so it as the ultimate durability and
comfort and it actually translates
because it is very comfortable the
outside is breathable perforated PU
leather you guys know the PU leather
stuff you don't stick to it it's
actually kind of I think better than
leather because some of the things about
leather change and cold and hot this
just stays the same pretty much no
matter what temperature in and you don't
stick to it and and also it doesn't make
you sweat the stitching on the chair
looks really really nice and the color
that I chose for this particular one was
black and gray because you guys there's
so many red-green-blue chairs even plain
black I wanted something that was a
little bit different now they do have
this chair and a bunch of different
colors as you guys will see when you
guys show you the link but this
particular color suited me and the
stitching is actually really really nice
um you have a really nice headrest you
have lumbar support you can remove both
of these like I said before if you don't
want them on there but what I really
feel what I really like is the fact that
you can keep the lumbar support on the
back and not feel like you're being
pushed off the chair and it still feels
really comfortable and natural okay
before we get to conclusion I just want
to state for the record because people
always ask us if I give any type of
positive review it has to be I've been
paid off and cookies or cash and I'm
just gonna tell you that's honestly
never been the case ever
ever you don't believe me do research on
me I've been offered money to do lies
and stuff like that all the time I've
never taken it ever I reject that stuff
maybe people just prefer videos where
people kick everything in the nuts but
that's just really not me if I get a
product and I really feel it gets kicked
in the nuts a lot of times I just pass
on reviewing it period I try to live a
positive life I got enough health issues
another crap going on where I don't need
to sit around and be a negative nanny
and every you know single one of my
videos unless there's something that
really needs to be pointed out so this
chair yeah
the price is kind of high you know
there's a couple different places you
can get at different prices I'm gonna
have 10% coupon codes down below where
you can buy it on Amazon or you can buy
it directly from their website the
choice is yours
now this chair what I like best about it
is it's wide enough to fit me in here
it'll fit a big guy up to 330 pounds I
weigh about 230 pounds I'm a six foot
tall guy you can do any kind of
adjustment you want you can get up and
down depending on what kind of desk you
have you can adjust the armrest you can
tilt back there's just all kinds of
adjustments pretty much any type of
adjustment that comes in a chair this
chair has it on it it's well-made it's
comfort and the warranty in the chair
it's not bad at all five years on all
the parts and ten years on the frame so
if you want to just like do that
mathematically that means you're
basically paying for a super comfortable
chair for a hundred dollars a year what
you want to break that down I mean come
on it's less than like you know what a
few dollars a month if you want to
consider it that way and honestly this
chair is super comfortable if you could
never go out and find one of these
somewhere you could try one out I know
with the you know with the new world
where everything's coming from the
internet there's not many like you know
brick-and-mortar places to try stuff out
but if you ever get a chance to honestly
use some of these chairs you're just
gonna be like dang honestly if you don't
like this chair I'll make sure the
company takes total care of you and get
your money back
but I think that anybody who gets this
chair is going to sit in and just be
like wow one thing that I really like
about it too is the design of it now I
didn't really probably dump too much in
this when we were doing the Scriptures
trying to concentrate and do what I'm
doing but in the design the size of the
chair where you sit
they kind of curve around you they
really do and I drove this guy's
mercedes-benz the other day and this is
like it it's like a freaking $150,000
car super expensive and when you turned
in the car the seats actually moved so
like you know if you're going around a
curb you like oh like this you won't do
that because the seats actually curve up
and keep you from going sideways it was
kind of cool and so when I saw the
designs that's the first thing I thought
about is this guy Jerry Chang's car no
because he took me out for Ryan took us
out to dinner and like I guess it was
just a real kind of show off his car and
rub it in my face but that's cool best
of luck on that car Jerry by the way but
this chair kind of reminds me of that
because these way the chairs design and
the way the sides go up it feels like
when you're sitting in the chair you're
kind of like being hugged from my body
size so if you're a six-foot guy you
know you weigh up to like 250 maybe 260
70 pounds you're probably gonna be the
same size guy as me a little bigger
maybe a little smaller I think you'll
fit in and you'll like this chair and
like I said I'm gonna have some 10%
discounts down below do you guys want to
check out more information or get one of
these tears for yourself I think you'll
really really like it so if you're
looking for a video for me to get on
here and complain about this chair and
beat it all up I'm sorry I just it's
just not me man I'm more of a positive
grade kind of guy see you guys back here
on Tekken tomorrow all that impose down
below man peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
