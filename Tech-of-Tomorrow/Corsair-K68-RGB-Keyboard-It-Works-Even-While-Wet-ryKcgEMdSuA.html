there are just a ton of mechanical
keyboards on the market and what
differentiates these models from others
is really not a lot it's usually just
very small features the biggest being
the different kind of keys that they
have now today we're gonna be taking a
look at the k68 keyboard now this is a
mechanical keyboard featuring MX red
switches from the people over at Corsair
and there are actually two models to
this particular keyboard there's the k68
standard which just has standard red
back lights no RGB and then there's the
case 68 RGB which features their cue
software so you can change all the
lights it's got a lot of different
features but like I said the main real
feature are the MX red switches if you
guys have you ever used them before
they're not too tactile they're not too
bouncy they're kind of like right in the
middle I feel of everything and this
particular keyboard is a full-size
keyboard so not only do you get the
keyboard itself with all your normal
keys you also get the numpad as well
some people prefer that some people like
smaller ones I like a full-size keyboard
now the really big thing that's being
pushed by Corsair but the K 68 I believe
is its ability to be water and dust
resistant now this is something that's a
little bit strange to me and we'll get
back to that two minutes so first of all
let's just take a look at the keyboard
as you guys can see it's just got the
standard layout of most keyboards out
there now another thing that makes this
keyboard cool is it does have complete
dedicated audio controls so you can mute
pause all that stuff all from your
keyboard you have to go you know you
don't have to go on to your computer get
into a program to change all that stuff
you can do it all from the comfort of
your keyboard which is pretty nice
especially if like you're in game or
something and you don't want to mess
that you it's really nice as it be able
to hit those controls and change the
properties that you want
now this particular keyboard also comes
with removable rest I like the rest some
people don't like them they remove them
but for me personally it just makes my
hand sit very easy on the keyboard also
some people like to keep their keyboard
completely flat I like to have my
keyboard at an angle so it is a good
thing this particular keyboard like most
of them out there has a little feet that
will allow you to tilt the keyboard
because at an angle for me it's just
honestly a much more comfortable
or deal now here's the thing that I'm
kind of tripping on because it says that
it's dust and water resistant okay let's
go there now if you look up the IP
rating it basically says for like mist
and light dust okay well if I was going
to be looking at a keyboard I'm sorry of
course I don't mean to kick you but
honestly I mean I'm not gonna take my
keyboard out in the rain so what's you
know what's the really the big deal of
being you know mist resistant or
whatever how many people are gonna be
standing around their shower in the rain
playing on the keyboard what I really
was expecting was more of a type of
thing where if you spilled a drink
you know onto the keyboard that the
keyboard would keep going on forever and
ever and ever so let's just real quick
let's knock some water on this keyboard
like a normal user would do and let's
see if it actually fails okay so here we
have it folks glass water Elric and the
k68 RGB now most people I know will
probably spill their drink you know onto
the keyboard me myself I'm just going to
pour the water on there and let's see
what happens so we got the water the
water is all on the keyboard take the
keyboard making a mess up here on my
desk but you guys can see beyond the
mess that this keyboard can take a whole
glass of water on it and still function
with that a problem so that's a thumbs
up so okay you guys can see it passes
the water test the keyboards still up
and running a little bit wet mind you
but it's still up and ring and that's
important because if you're playing a
game or something you're doing something
that's important to you and you
accidentally knock over your drink or
something into your keyboard in a lot of
ways you're going to be screwed
especially if it's like a Pepsi or coke
or one of those products as a bunch of
syrup in it the problem isn't so much
with the liquid it's all of that sugar
and caramel and all that crap that's
inside of it that makes your keys all
sticky and nasty that's why I only used
water now obviously if you do spill your
Pepsi and stuff like that the keys are
all removable you guys can see
underneath the different different keys
so you can remove all the keys off the
keyboard you can hand dry it off and do
all that stuff to keep your keyboard you
know up and running so it does seem like
it works a little bit better
and the IP because the way that the IP
no protection reads off it only seems
like you know drizzling rain or a little
bit of dust and that's really to me not
what I'd really be looking for but the
fact that you can spill your drink in it
and then clean it up afterwards
that to me is a really big deal now
another thing is you get 100% key
rollover it means no ghosting none of
those problems it's wherever you can hit
all the keys at the same time your
keyboard is not gonna freak out or do
anything you know how it is when you're
in game you're doing a bunch of stuff a
lot of times you can hit the wrong keys
and stuff you don't want to hit the
wrong key
Beebop back out the windows screen or
just make a big mistake because you know
you're just doing the wrong thing so and
that that also is something that's
pretty nice
both k68 feature a thousand Hertz
polling rate and the two different
models are priced like this the standard
version is actually under $100 it's on
sale right now for $89 so it's sub
hundred dollars from mechanical keyboard
which seems like his you know it's
starting to be right around the perfect
price range for mechanical keyboards and
they first came out they were two three
hundred dollars
we've seen the price go down and down
and down and down and now the RG model
it's a hundred and $19 so we have two
different models to choose from I want
to be Asti folks I'm kind of getting
burned out on the RGB thing I mean it's
just everywhere all the time I have a
gaming system in my room it's all
corsair stuff pretty much and everything
just blinking all the time I mean yeah
you can tone it down and stuff with all
these blinking lights and all this stuff
it's almost like being in a disco I mean
so the days of just having your PC you
know look cool and stuff has gone a
whole another level now everything's got
RGB your mouse has RGB helped pretty
soon your mouse pads gonna have RGB your
monitor is gonna have our GB heck your
butts gonna have RGB you're gonna be
born with RGB coming right out your butt
so it's just everywhere now at the end
of the day you have to ask yourself okay
I want to keyboard that's mechanical I
want it to be comfortable I want it to
last a long time and I want just work
perfectly with everything that I'm doing
so like I said before the keyboard is
very comfortable to use there are some
Corsair keyboards out there that have
like a weird WASD configuration and
those are great for gaming but when
you're trying to type and do stuff like
that it becomes a major pain the button
I don't enjoy it whatsoever now with the
k-6 data RGB
I'm able to type and do my normal stuff
it's not totally perfect for I'd like to
be like a typing keyboard
I actually know if you guys remember
this but I like a Sai tech keyboard this
company when I had business but the
SciTech keyboards were unbelievable they
were just so spongy and nice to type on
it just felt like you were typing you
know on unlike unlike water I don't put
her Saigon soft pillows it was just so
nice and none of the really mechanical
keyboards that I've seen that have come
out actually do typing as well as that
but the k68 RGB it's still pretty cool
it's not the greatest thing like I said
for doing typing but it'll still work
for you no problem in game it functions
no problem whatsoever if you want to
like change all the lighting and do all
that stuff you can do all that through
the cue software so make sure that you
guys download the cue software I don't
believe that there's actually a CD
driver in the box you're gonna have to
hop on the internet to get that
particular you know driver if you don't
have the Internet well then I guess
you'll have to you know either pick it
off your phone or go to a friend's house
to get that but if you want to do all
the RGB lighting and stuff you're going
to have to download the cue software so
that's it folks - keyboards k68 standard
k68 RGB coming to market one in $89 one
at 119 dollars not a whole lot of
outlandish features just enough features
to keep you in game keep you comfortable
and be able to play your games without
issue
so I mark you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow if you guys are looking for a
keyboard like this hey we'll have a link
down there below that like button you
guys know what to do and if you're not
sub K I'd love this - you guys back here
