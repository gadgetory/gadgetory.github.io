ultimate office tour now everybody knows
the bathroom is the second office and
it's literally where all this shit
happens I mean come on we make all of
our shit in here you know you just need
simple stuff but I pad
you know I rig my PhD in a jam stick you
know and you're good to go no I'm just
screwing them around with you but shit
does happen here
what's up people
welcome back whoa turn the game back
alright so what's up folks welcome back
TECA tomorrow al Miller with your host
and today we're gonna show you guys
pretty much where we do all of our
digital music now we do have some amps
surrounding around the room and stuff
got a bunch of different hidden stuff
because we'll be doing a lot of the
other recording in some of their silent
rooms that were actually building but
right now everything we're doing we're
doing right here and you guys know we
make all the music for the channel one
of us comes up with some idea that
Roscoe's all contribute than the-- and
you guys hear all the music that we do
so right now let's check it out and
let's check out what's going on here a
ticket of our own how we make our music
so we'll just start off all the way over
the far left hand side of them work our
way around the room so let's start off
with a couple of the heads now the one
on top that's pretty much my favorite
head in the house that's the Lanie Iron
Heart I find myself playing this thing
pretty much daily that's you guys heard
in the beginning of the video as well I
love this thing it's 120 watt head 6l6
is all the way across I changed out all
the tubes in front all those 12ax7 and
now we're all really good tubes now when
I had it they start out with a bunch of
Ruby tubes inside of it but I change
those out to the gold tongue cells and
now this thing just sounds like a beast
underneath that we see the engl fireball
100 another total heavy metal head it's
famous for metal bands all around the
world this thing's a beast now
underneath that's the main cab we use
right now for during the according this
is the Marshall this is a 1960 vintage
it's got vintage 30s in them for those
bad boys and this thing sounds good with
pretty much any head that you hook up to
it I really love this cab a lot for
smaller recording and stuff we like
different sounds I've got a couple
different using Kettner's over here
these both have different speakers in
them once it's a single 12 the other
ones a two twelve but for different
people doing different sound and stuff
these come in quite handy above that you
guys can see I just have a few guitars
hanging on the rack I actually have
quite a few guitars up because a lot of
different people like to use different
stuff and I like to have a variety you
guys have been asking me to do a bit a
tour of like all my guitars and stuff so
I'll probably give that to you guys soon
so next up though let's check out the
rack where all of digital equipment is
in this rack you can see on top I've got
a monster Pro 2500 this is the power
conditioner everything plugs into this
keeps it all running nice and cool
underneath that for the direct
based up we have the SANS app this is
the tech21 this thing is an awesome
piece of equipment either in Iraq or
hooked to us under their app this thing
just adds incredible depth and tone to
what you're doing now the main thing is
the Apollo underneath that that's the
Apollo quad this thing's incredible the
preamps and everything on this all the
software all the plugins all the great
stuff that you can make this an
incredible tool for recording a digital
studio and in the live studio underneath
the Apollo is the audience a SP a AE now
this is an 8 channel preamp and this
thing's incredible this thing has
british technology all the way
underneath it has some of the ultimate
cleanest sound that you're ever going to
hear burr brown technologies inside of
it it's a really nice sounding thing
we're mainly using this though to mic up
all the drums and do live drums a couple
new singles are coming out or the first
time we're actually using a lot of live
drums a lot of the stuff we've done
before has been total programming but
now we're moving the new around we can
do both the digital drums and we can do
live drums at the same time now for
anybody out through is into the guitar
world you guys are going to recognize
this piece underneath here this is the
fractal axe FX 2 this thing has so many
incredible tones on it it's
mind-boggling for metal it's awesome for
cleaning it's awesome it just totally
rock and rolls across the spectrum it's
a little bit expensive but for in the
studio this is one of the absolute best
bass equipment I've ever come across
for my monitoring speakers out here I
have the KRK Rokit a to either
eight-inch speakers they're powered they
work really awesome they can not only be
flat but you can also change the sound
spectrum on them to get like a full
range type of sound as well now I know a
lot of my PC fans out there they get
pissed on they're like oh man you own a
fucking Mac I hate you but I gotta be
honest to you guys man I really love
logic for creating and doing music I
personally find that it's the most
useful tool of all my buddy John
Morrison from TLD he's been using this
thing for years he's like a master
wizard he can come over and like knock
out a song and like an hour and a half
of stuff so he's like an amazing person
and I've been learning and training and
learning stuff from him for like the
past few years and I'm finally getting
out on my own and doing stuff getting my
feet wet here in the studio now this is
obviously a 27 inch iMac it's a couple
years old nothing to all fancy it's got
16 gigabytes of RAM in it
you know mm I think I think it's a 2010
machine but you could actually use an
older machine I've also got Pro Tools
installed my bass player and my friend
who's playing paints under with me he's
gonna be working in our next studio
which by the way is gonna be called and
you like it
one foot production that's right yeah
hence my feet being cut off so you know
underneath my Mac I also have another
one of those little power converter
things those things work good from
Monster they keep everything running
good another thing that I use as well as
I use this little tiny little black box
that costs about 75 bucks online you get
them about 50 they're called a hum X and
I find if you place things things
properly a lot of the electronic noise
that you have in your studio you can get
rid of I'll actually have a link down
below where you guys can pick up a hum X
if you want trial and out but I think
that's actually a really good product
for keeping the hum the hum you guys
have heard in the background apology
yeah I forgot to turn this day standby
off on the absence pin I'm in the
background the whole time so apologies
all around if we keep going around the
room I've still got some more amps and
stuff that we're using because people
like amps I don't know what it is maybe
when you talk to a recording studio some
guy that basically the big thing he
wants to hear it's like what kind of
equipment you got what kind of amps you
got and by the way I do have regular
bass amps and stuff I've got some really
good MPEG stuff we'll take a tour we'll
show you guys all the clothes rooms
later this is pretty much one room we
have another room back behind me this is
gonna be the live room we'll have a
digital kit and the regular drum kit
back there we'll show you guys that
later but if we traverse around here
I've got an igniter vengeance I've also
got a JCM 2004 Marshall I've got a great
cabinet from Black Star the next that
I've got another Randle cab now the
Randle cab has some different speakers
in it it's got some other selections I
don't know exactly which ones that are
there open the back up but I know that
they're not exactly the same vintage 30s
that we usually use so that's pretty
much the studio tour for a day folks all
this equipment if you guys want to check
it out we'll have links down below where
you guys can buy this stuff you guys
have heard all the music that we make
it's pretty much been made off this
equipment for pretty much the last year
the Audient is a pretty new piece of
equipment the a SPAD we've just bought
in that recently that's an interface we
haven't actually used that and anything
but the Apollo
you've heard that the sansamp we've used
that up the butt and also the axe
effects well heck yeah we've used
lots of stuff paint cylinder album
before we did all live amps who did all
live everything but a lot of music for
my singles we've been doing we've been
doing all here in a digital studio so
I'm maverick thanks for watching Tekken
tomorrow this is a guitar that I
recently got and uh
one thing about it I want to just talk
about real quick as we'll be doing a
review about this is these brand new
Fishman fluence pickups and this is a
Fishman influenced modern kit right here
these things are pretty badass now for
you metalheads out there I don't know if
you're excited about this is me this
excited though
fuck God at me I'm just being honest on
metal head but check it out man my
contact at Fishman check this out it's
Kim Susi from unearthed and if I get the
Karman just a pause dress one second hey
can you can you hand me the guitar that
ESP uh hooked us up with over their
actions guitar like I told you guys I do
a lot of work forever tuned you guys
gotta see this guitar though it's pretty
badass no it's not in that one it's in
that case underneath it this is the Ken
Suzy model now for some reason when I
bought this it just had an 81 and 85
pickup in it I'm kind of burned out on
the 81 85 I'm just kind of like yeah
okay I've seen I pick up so many times
you don't I mean it's like trying to
look at the same girl in a porn magazine
for a thousand times after a while the
illusion is just gone you know I'm
saying but check this out so I changed
it out to a 57 66 these are pretty much
my favorite pickups but the people at
Fishman I'm sure will provide me with
the proper pickup to change out now this
guitar is awesome I love this guitar all
the seven-string stuff we're doing and
we do have some pretty awesome badass
song it's coming out just gotta tell you
guys that right now we're gonna have
like four singles coming out at one time
and for those people before we
participate in the music pack you guys
get those songs all for free and
actually by now all those packs have
pretty much gone out so by now pretty
much everybody has their stuff except I
think a guy in Australia and one of
their dudes so uh that's wrapped up it's
time to go back and make some more music
