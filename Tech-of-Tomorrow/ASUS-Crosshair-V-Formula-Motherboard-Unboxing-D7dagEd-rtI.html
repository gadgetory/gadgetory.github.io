Affairs here on the TECA tomorrow
YouTube channel am defense it's time for
you guys to shake rattle and rock and
roll the new 990 FX chips edits hit the
market and this is a great thing for you
guys because it supports the new
unlocked FX bulldozer processors and her
student be released all supports 32
gigabytes of ddr3 memory and dual
channel mode it also supports both the
latest Nvidia and AMD video cards in
both crossfire and SLI configurations
oh really cool stuff now the 990 FX
chipset isn't supposed to be really much
faster than 819 chipset as far as sheer
performance levels go but what it does
do is bring a lot of advanced features
over to the AMD platform so today we're
going to see what comes in the box of
this new Asus crossfader 5 formula
motherboard so I'm going to set this
down the table and we'll get refocused
on it put a cap right here you guys can
see it go ahead and hang it up here you
guys see all that now come on flip it
around real quick but you guys see the
back of the box can't want to probably
set a couple times for this so bear with
him okay now we're going to begin the
unboxing I'll go ahead and pop the cap
up here there's no type of plastic or
anything that you have to do on any of
the a zoos and boxing's you just pull it
out there'll be a couple folders inside
of here boxes in here wait we'll start
off like usual we'll start off with the
features so we're gonna go in to open
the box up here and I'm pulling stuff
out and setting it from the table so
first off we have the user's guide then
we have the crosshair five drivers @cv
and then we have a bunch of stickers for
all your hard drive cables this is so
you can label them out so you know where
they're at quite a lot of stuff in here
we have one two three if there's any
more we have one two three SATA cables
these are all for the new state of three
then we have an external USB power cable
for powering things up these
motherboards can actually
you can operate them through your iPhone
you can actually connect to computer and
operate it and shut it down all kinds of
cool stuff like that it's kind of really
cool this is the rear i/o by the way
didn't mention that and then we also
have let's take a look here I got two
different cables on a breaking out here
open them up out of the packages and
bring them over to you guys
okay this is a crossfire cable and then
we have an SLI cable I believe as well
sorry I don't mean to drag on with you
guys want to make sure you everything to
you guys correctly alright and then we
have an SLI cable let's have one of each
of those so far then we have a 3-way SLI
bridge connector go ahead and just set
that down then we have some instant
offsets here these are for setting up
the cables to your to your case
two over to your motherboard you got
that going on right there you also have
some quick ties right here this is for
doing cable management all that stuff a
couple other things in here guys give me
a second here got a sticker try to get
the sticker out so you can see it okay I
guess this is it
I'm going to set this stuff on top here
this is the sticker and last but not
least we have a Quick Start Guide we're
just trying to get that in here without
covering anything up and then we get the
cam pin just to zoom in on that and get
all nice shot of that you can maybe
backtrack as you guys can see all that
stuff this will be called the bundles
page on my written review so if I had a
written review you can see this as the
publish page so I'm gonna go to pull the
stuff off there so we can show you guys
the motherboard figure with me a second
guys I mean we really could at the heck
out of stuff and make it look
professional stop this that and the
other but I think you guys had pretty
much gotten used to our free-flowing
style that we do here hope you guys like
it okay now we're gonna check out the
motherboard itself by the way this is in
the normal cameraman this camp in Shane
we have a new camp and then yeah she has
a name
shame you looking guy who's behind the
camera today you guys can all say item
in the comment section I'm trying to get
accord out here already
alright
one thing I like two things alike it has
that new motherboard smell and the
motherboard is pretty heavy I can really
judge the motherboard maybe not by a
book on its color cover excuse me but
when I pick up a motherboard and it's
very very heavy you know that's a good
quality product so check this out we're
gonna start out right here we see
there's a nice heat sink running all the
way across the Northbridge this covers
it all the way down now a lot of great
features come with a zoo stuff you can
all Adid low C capacitors you get the
low ferrite chokes I mean excuse me the
Japanese capacitors a little ferrite
choke all quality components they also
use a military standard to make sure
that their boards are running great they
have a couple different powered options
here on board you have a standard molex
in case you need it it's kind of old
school but somebody might find that
abuse up here on top we have the 8 pin
power and over here we have the 24 pin
power you can see around the ZIF socket
there's plenty of area here formatting
up any kind of heatsink you want whether
it be aftermarket water or whatever I'm
gonna go around over here there's four
dimm slots for your memory go and just
flip the board sideways for a second get
it back in range four dimm slots for
your memory right now there are only
four gigabyte sticks available but soon
that will be eight gigabyte sticks
available then you'll be able to use 32
gigabytes of memory up on this board
here's some awesome nice features over
here you can see they're all really good
parts that are all inside of here we
have a little reset button on here as
well so in case you like have your board
a test station or something you just
want to reset it you can hit a button
right there it's very easily we're gonna
move on down here these are all the SATA
controllers all the SATA controllers on
board all our SATA 3 so they support the
six gigabit interface then we have right
here take a look here this is a this is
a ESA this six gigabyte connector right
here it's on the board right here little
red thing zoom in once again we're gonna
come over here this is the Southbridge
you can see it's completely covered by
its own heat sink
poking around more time giggle all the
stuff you have one two three to four of
your standard PCIe slots one of the PCI
1x slots and then one standard PCI slot
like I said this board supports 3-way
SLI and 3-way crossfire whichever way
also right down here we're gonna see
that there's a couple of things that
here we have power reset all that
stuff's down here these are also good
things for the overclocker this
motherboard has really been sound on it
as well has that extreme supreme sound
so it should be really good better than
maybe the Dolby standard as you can see
right here everything's easy identified
for you to hook up all of your cables
and everything to the motherboard will
flip around take a look at the rear i/o
here's a little stuff in there where are
you you can see it's got a combination
of stuff both USB to USB 3 you say to a
lot of good stuff there something around
show you guys the back of the board well
the full review of this coming in the
next few days but this was the unboxing
of this this is the asus crosshair 5
formula motherboard I'm over at Ferris
thanks for watching look for the full
review here soon I'm tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
