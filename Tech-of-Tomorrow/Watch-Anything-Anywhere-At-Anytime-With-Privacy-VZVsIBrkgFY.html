dredd no I'm not I'm just kidding around
in fact this isn't even my Judge Dredd
costume you guys are probably wondering
though Elric what is that contraption
that you are wearing on your head and
it's something very interesting
this is augmented reality in the product
that we're going to be looking at today
is a product from eyeglass and this is
their augmented reality theater that's
right and it's basically really walking
around with an IMAX theater on your head
it's also pretty comfortable now
I know many people out there know what
virtual reality is and they know what
their version is of augmented reality
usually augmented reality means you're
walking around in public and the glass
and everything that you're using you can
interact with those things now this
product is a little bit different and it
uses a basic form of AR so when you're
watching a movie and everything inside
here you can actually still see the
things around you if you focus now this
particular product is it good to come to
market at about $299 and to be out
probably February of 2019 and it's
actually really really nifty now
applications for AR are just staggering
and there are so many of the things that
they could actually do with this device
that as the future unrolls we're
probably going to see just all kinds of
different applications coming out using
this technology now like I said this is
the basic augmented reality but the the
it's really endless you could use AR for
medical stuff for building computers
there's just all kinds of ways that you
can use it but this is the basic format
and what it allows you to do is it
allows you to use any iPhone any Android
device anything that has the type II C
plug-in you can use this device and it
carries all the sound and everything
through the plug now currently the ones
that we're looking at they don't have a
headphone jack inside of them you'd
still have to use the headphone jack on
your phone but when the product rolls
out they're saying that there will be an
actual headphone jack on here and if you
don't want to mess that phone jack
whatsoever you can always hook up
through your phone to the Bluetooth and
listen to all your sounds that way now
what you're getting here though is
pretty true
beep picture basically a hundred and
twenty foot projector screen a hundred
and twenty foot projector screen was
super duper high-res this is basically
like watching a three K TV it's not
quite 4k it's a three K TV but right on
your head and the reason I really do
think this is pretty cool because if
your person who travels you do a lot of
commuting but you'd still like to be
able to watch your movies on the go and
do that this is the perfect product for
that really it's kind of like walking
around with having a little IMAX right
inside your pocket and this is really
really ultra lightweight as well it
weighs hardly nothing weighing in and
only a hundred and seventy grams I'm
sure that the design of this particular
one that we're looking at will probably
change from the one that we see when it
actually hits the market because the
products still in development but
everything about this is really really
nifty at first I thought that like
virtual reality that using these would
make me sick but I was able to watch a
movie through its entirety without
feeling any kind of nausea whatsoever so
if the movie streams in 2d you'll see a
2d movie look at the movie streams and
3d and support it you'll see that inside
of the glasses personally there are a
couple things that I think that would
make it even like totally over-the-top
more cool but we've talked about that
and they say that these will be coming
in other versions like I think would be
really cool as if when you were using
these if you answered your phone you
could actually see the person you're
talking to inside of the device I think
that would be really cool they're saying
that hey that might be a possible in the
future for now if someone does call you
you actually take the phone call on your
phone and this will still be going so
you can either just pause this and
answer your phone or just let it go if
you've already seen it before and then
answer your phone call all in all very
easy stuff also the comfort level is
kind of interesting and this particular
thing on top is something I've never
seen before but what it does is it
allows it to rest on your forehead
without making you uncomfortable
whatsoever and I think that's kind of
really neat now how far this company
pushes this technology I'm not really
sure of what they want to really do is
they want to build all the core
technology be able to sell you guys
their glasses but then hope other
companies
jump in and buy this core technology and
expand upon it for one thing you could
put a camera in the very front of this
device and say that you had somebody out
monitoring like a tiger or something
like out in the force you were
monitoring something you could actually
be able to go out and film and use that
and see it inside of here so that would
be kind of cool as well
also the very fact that if it had some
kind of recording device on it where you
could record the sounds around you and
turn them in your own augmented reality
thing that's also possible but right now
pretty much what this product is is like
I said you're walking around with a very
lightweight device that brings a full-on
3d theater to you now not every type of
3d is supported now there are some
things that are supportive it has side
by side technology which there a lot of
videos are formatted for you can
actually use this and see the full 3d
and the 3d works really nice
honestly it's even better than the IMAX
theater because instead of having their
glasses and it coming at you everything
is right inside of these glasses so it's
like really really close to your face
and you guys have probably been to an
IMAX theater that the images that are
coming with you they look pretty cool
but inside of these glasses the images
are a lot more solid formed and what I
mean by that is like some of them own a
flower into your face or throwing
something at you the image looks very
solid and very real throughout the
entire experience and that's just pretty
nifty so if you were able to get your
hands on a nice you know movie that they
made for IMAX that's 3d supported you'd
be able to watch that complete 3d
through these glasses now these
particular glasses aren't geared for
gaming these aren't for gaming these
particular ones like I said are strictly
for watching movies but it's very very
easy to operate all you do is install
their app simply connect the glasses get
them going and then you're up and going
watching your movie now the colors and
everything are very vibrant the detail
is very vibrant it's not quite the same
as my OLED TV but it is very very nice
especially for something that's just
sitting right on your face another
really nice thing about these glasses is
you
don't have to worry about the content
that you're watching being shown on your
phone everything that you watch will be
in complete privacy so if you want to
watch one of those adult films go for it
because this product uses reflective
technology in a way it's kind of like
looking at yourself in the mirror so if
you want to use this product with your
PC or actually surf the web you'll need
to go into the application and switch
the image around that way your text and
everything isn't showed backwards and
for the price range it's pretty cool
let's just face it a really good TV is
gonna cost you over a thousand dollars
and for somebody out there who like
lives in a dorm or doesn't have access
you know to a big-screen TV this product
would be really cool for them because
then they could watch all of their
movies like they're watching them at an
IMAX theater all for the price of $2.99
so in that particular factor I think
it's going to be a particular in the
market now how many people actually
adopt this technology and say hey wow I
love it I want to embrace it well we'll
have to see I guess I pulled a little
too hard and unplugged a little adapter
now to use it like I said all you need
to do it also works real quick let me
tell you this it works off an HDMI
connector so the plug does support audio
and everything else and through the USB
type-c connection or obviously if you're
using the Apple device is going to be a
different connection all of your audio
and everything will come to that
connection and maybe there's even a
chance that they can put the speaker or
little headphones right on the glasses
themselves so you wouldn't have to have
any type of external thing you guys have
seen other products out there that use
this type of thing so what I think would
be really nice is if they could actually
put a set of nice little ear speakers
right inside of here so they were just
either hanging in here sitting in here
and as soon as you put the glasses on
you just insert them into your ear then
you'd have the entire experience right
there in the glasses and using it simple
once you plug it in you simply go to the
app click on it you can go on YouTube if
any YouTube videos out there supports 3d
you can watch that movie fully immersed
in 3d and and like I said before it's
really easy to use so this is a
different type of augmented reality my
experience with augmented reality in the
past
have been basically you know you have
your phone you're walking around you're
looking at stuff and it basically shows
you an image overlaid on you know on
your reality hence the augmented reality
for the gaming type stuff I think it'll
be a different type of technology though
because in the gaming technology are
gonna need all kinds of sensors all
kinds of different things you can
recognize other players but this is
definitely getting the foot in the door
to having all that stuff just right
there on your face very comfortably
without wearing you down so if you folks
out there are really end augmented
reality and you're really end like
having a home theater that you could
take anywhere cuz just picture this
you're on a vacation
you're completely bored you're in the
mountains you've got your phone you've
downloaded a movie on there you can sit
and watch that movie at the top of a
mountain I mean literally you could be
at the top of Mount Everest and watch
your movie now the only caveat I see
whatsoever
is with streaming because if you do
stream movies you're subjected to
whatever and however speeds the
streaming is but when new 5g comes out
next year it's about a year out the
bandwidth rates gonna be so high you'll
be able to download such huge files that
that probably won't be a problem
whatsoever when somebody has a 5g phone
but for now if you download the movie
have it on your phone if you've got a
128 gigabyte SIM card in there you can
download a lot of movies so if you guys
want to see more information about this
particular product and this sounds
interesting to you I'll have a link
below where you guys can check it out if
you guys find this product really
interesting pay attention because the
Kickstarter will start within two to
three weeks so you can get these very
early but for now I think I'll jump back
in and continue watching transformers
