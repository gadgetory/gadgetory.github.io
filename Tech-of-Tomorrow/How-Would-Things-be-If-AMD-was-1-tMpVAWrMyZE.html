much the market has been like this Intel
Nvidia and then AMD with AMD
constantly competing against both these
guys and I've just raging battle that's
become bigger and bigger and bigger over
the years now a long time ago
AMD was just a company that made CPUs
and they made CPUs they always had to
contend with the giant Intel and another
thing you know Intel inside that
particular little logo has really put
the mindset of people that Intel is what
belongs inside of their computer for the
most part it's really a mind thing but
today's video I want to ask you guys
kind of a different question so we all
know that you know these guys have been
competing and I'll continue along is
like ATI was gobbled up for you old time
tickers out there you know I'm talking
about ATI was a great company I always
liked their video cards I was actually
more of a fan of ATI than I was of
nvidia until AMD bought them out and
changed things around now when they
bought ATI that's when they actually
became a competitor against two
different companies they became a
competitor not only against Intel but
they've also become a competitor against
Nvidia and probably for most people you
know this it's old hat now one of the
biggest problems that AMD is having is
the fact that they don't have the R&amp;amp;D
budget to go and compete with both of
these fronts and yet they keep trying
and it's very hard for them but I want
to pose a question for you guys what if
Andy wasn't the underdog
what if AMD was the number one company
let's just say AMD was number one they
ruled the entire market they had the
fastest best video cards and by the way
here we're not talking about pricing
because let me tell you something if AMD
had the absolute fastest video cards and
the absolute fastest CPUs I'm gonna say
that just like any corporation they're
going to be asking superior price
so if AMD was number one in the market
and they had the best of everything and
all their prices were really high let's
just say that the AMD will just make up
a card the made up 900 and the made up
900 was the absolute best video card on
the market by AMD but they were charging
an extraordinary price for this would
you guys be like oh my god
AMD is the bad guy would you guys be
like MD like mindless sheep and just be
like I buy a MD only because I've been
thinking about this quite a lot lately
because we all know the giant
corporations I've talked about this a
lot of times in the channel that giant
corporations are just inherently evil
they are they're out to make money and
they don't give a crap about anything
else they don't care about your feelings
they don't care if they hurt you they
don't care if they rob you they don't
care if they take your money they have a
board of directors who are saying hey
make us money make us money make us
money and they don't give a crap about
anything else so my big questions you
guys I'd love to hear you guys's
comments down below is if AMD was the
number one company do you think that
they're going to stay the way they are
now and always offer trying to offer
lower and lower and lower lower prices
and be like let's hug the market you
know what I mean and even though AMD has
become more competitive and we may see
in 2019 that these guys even make
another jump I don't think in 2019
they're gonna make the jump over both
Intel and AMD there's just no way you're
gonna be able to take your checker and
hop to companies with the budget they
have so that's probably just not gonna
happen but if by some miracle I think
that if AMD became the number one
company in the world when they had the
best of everything that they'd be just
like Intel and NVIDIA they'd be doing
everything in their power to secure the
market any way they could because let's
just face it like I said it corporations
out to make money and if you're not
making money that means you're going
downhill because there's either two ways
you're progressing you're stagnant or
you're going backwards
stagnant and backward sucks so they're
gonna have to go forward so if AMD was
the number one big bad boy in the block
and they could charge for their makeup
nine hundred car whatever the heck they
want it because as a gamer you're gonna
pay for the absolute best would that
really just kind of make them the same
as everybody else and this is what I'm
just really wondering that's going to
happen if in the future of some day if
AMD actually becomes and beats all these
companies and becomes number one and
everything are they gonna be like the
gracious company that are very saying
yeah it is the greatest price is there
user-friendly of these are they're
really nice guys because it seems to me
like a lot of the people out there
better strictly AMD fans it seems to me
like they kind of feel like AMD's like
Robin Hood you know I mean like AMD can
do no wrong AMD is this AMD is that I'm
gonna tell you guys Andy's a corporation
just like anybody else and probably they
may not do the most you know nastiest
stuff on the play board you know because
you know there's different kinds of
people who play chess who play cards
whatever everybody plays their game a
little different so maybe Nvidia right
now you know maybe they're not you know
the western-style card cheater that some
of the other guys might be but there's
no way even now that they're perfect and
that's kind of what trips me out a
little bit too is that people kind of
treat that as like hey you know these
guys are way better than everybody else
and you know what
III KMD I think they're great their
products have been getting better over
the last few years they've always had
really good pricing they have a definite
place on the market but if they were
number one and things were reversed and
they weren't you know the underdog like
they've been forever fighting to get up
I honestly feel like they'd be the same
as every other corporation out there now
time will tell if that happens you know
I mean but unfortunately for AMD they're
not only fighting and just having a
better product I know that you're
thinking wow you know AMD can come up
with this make-believe 900 card they're
automatically gonna take the mark I'm
gonna tell you right now
even if tomorrow Navi launches their new
CPUs launch and their products actually
are completely better than Intel and
NVIDIA unless they can get the rest of
the world market to wrap their heads
around this
it's not gonna really matter it will
take them at least a few years of doing
this so here's the thing tomorrow
AMD becomes number one and everything
for that moment in time boom
Intel Nvidia they become the underdogs
you know it might shake the market up a
little bit but people aren't going to
recognize AMD's name as a household name
as much as they do and it will take them
a few years to do that so unless AMD can
maintain the lead that they get you know
get in the lead and maintain it for a
long time it will really be hard for
them to even get to the level of Intel
and NVIDIA even if they make I'm telling
you right now the absolute best products
in the world across the board best video
cards best CPUs guess what at least for
a few years Intel and NVIDIA will keep
winning only because of the fact that
they have the name brand like I said
early video Intel Inside a lot of times
that I talk to anybody and they're not
really computer savvy the first thing
they say to me is oh it's got Intel
Inside first thing off I don't even hear
Nvidia and videos actually even not even
know anywhere well even known as Intel
Intel is the most well known company in
the world when it comes to PC stuff
period they make the CPUs they're like
Microsoft Microsoft is famous for
Windows they're known for that they're
the biggest in the world when you think
of CPUs most people their first thought
is hey Intel Inside and until AMD can
get the rest of the world to wrap their
mindset around the fact that hey it's
AMD inside now it won't even matter if
they make the best products unless they
can continually do so for a long period
of time now if AMD can actually jump up
and they can maintain this distance of
making better products than both Intel
and NVIDIA and they do it for five years
in a row they will definitely dominate
the market and they will be able to
dictate and charge whatever they want
just like Nvidia and Intel are doing now
we all know Nvidia's prices are bloated
as a motherfrakker right now no video
card that you're playing games on should
really be $1300 I just
I mean sure it's cool technology for
what it is but nobody after that I know
unless they're really like serious just
have to have the absolute best to make a
sacrifice
can't afford stuff like that so
hopefully AMD will never go down the
road like that whether it's like hey you
know what we can just charge you a bunch
of money because we can I hope they
never do that
but if they become number one what do
you think I mean they are a corporation
corporations are there to make money do
you think that AMD will be the nicest
person on the planet if they have a butt
ton of shareholders saying we need more
money because that's really what's going
on and that affects me and you lots of
ways leave your comments I always want
to hear what you guys have to say you
know today's video is pretty much what
if a and B was number one
would they be any different let me know
your thoughts I'm Eric you've been
watching teka tomorrow if you like what
you see in the channel hey please sub
and turn on notifications so sometimes
you can know I'm even making videos so
you let you guys know sometimes we'll be
back here for more tech in the channel
we got lots more things coming this week
so we'll see you back here on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
