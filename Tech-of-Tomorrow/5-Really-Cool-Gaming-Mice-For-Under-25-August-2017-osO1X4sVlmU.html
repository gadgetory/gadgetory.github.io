by the courser one pro gaming system get
your game on
what up tech fans welcome back once
again to the channel where today we've
brought you guys five gaming mice that's
right five of those bad boys for under
$25 now I notice a little bit of
controversy on what actually qualifies
for a gaming mouse well to me a gaming
mouse is anything that actually focuses
on things like gaming you know high
palling rate you know precision stuff
the type of reader that it has anything
that has to do with gaming you know cuz
a regular Mouse it doesn't worry about
you know how many dpi it has and that
kind of stuff people just grab the mouse
throw it down and start using it because
that's just irrelevant programmable
buttons the polling rate how much dpi
those things to me will actually qualify
a mouse for a gaming mouse and every
single one of these has one of those
features in it to actually qualify it
now if you guys disagree
leave your opinion down below because I
know a lot of people have kind of a
weird attitude on what they consider
Gaming Mouse so let's just get it out in
the open but with that said though let's
jump in and check out five gaming mice
for under $25 first up today is the U so
Z 7900 now this particular gaming mouse
features 4000 dpi
a thousand Hertz polling rate 20 G
acceleration 100 to 150 ion /s cursor
speed and an Avago sensor Omron micro
switches provide crisp firm clicks and a
special aluminum base as a heavier feel
during game playing there are 13
programmable buttons 5 salable memory
profiles each with a distinct light
color for quick identification and
depending on whether you like your mouse
to be heavy or light there's an eight
piece weight tuning set and there are
also 16 million LED color options on
this mouse which is pretty crazy and if
you don't like LED hey you can disable
it to your preference the Z 7900 also
looks pretty unique it has a really nice
design it's not reinventing the wheel
but it's still pretty nice it features
14 buttons a power button a breathing
light in five color modes and five side
buttons it also comes with a six foot
braided fiber cable with gold plated USB
connections and best of all the Z 7900
is on sale for $23.99 now this next
product is by a company called be storm
and they're actually claiming this as a
mechanical mouse because the name is
professional Gaming Mouse mechanical
eight button so that's kind of
interesting I've never heard I heard
somebody say professional gaming mouse
but this mouse does feature 3200 dpi and
eight programmable buttons the bee storm
is also very ergonomic and it fits
really nice under your palm you can also
game for a long time without suffering
fatigue and the DPI button lets you
easily cycle through your custom
settings
this mouse features a lightweight
aluminum chassis the bee storm right now

gaming experience the mouse's roller is

mouse itself is said to be able to last
up to 10 million clicks so if you're
looking for a gaming mouse where you can
control everything off the top of the
mouse has a really nice look and comes
into the market at under $20 then you
want to check out the luan G 70 because
it's definitely worth taking a look at
now the last Mouse on today's list is
actually pretty cool for one thing it's
completely ambidextrous that means that
no matter what hand you use you can use
this mouse so if you're a lefty you're
in if you're riding hey you're in as
well the Logitech G 300s features 9
programmable control buttons it has a
symmetrical compact shape a gaming great
optical sensor which tracks accurately
on a wide variety of services you don't

mouse pad or your desk and that's pretty
cool there are also three onboard memory
profiles and one thing really nice about
this mouse is its easy configuration
software you simply drag and drop
commands to the buttons to set up the
mouse exactly the way you want and one
thing to take mention of out of all the
mice that we showed you today this is
the lightest one of the bunch so if
