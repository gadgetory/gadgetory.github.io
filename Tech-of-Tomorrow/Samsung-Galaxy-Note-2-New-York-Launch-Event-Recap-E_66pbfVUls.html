stuff we saw endorsements by all kinds
of cool people and in fact LeBron James

his personal device as did many other
people and Kanye West showed up that's
right for all you people after who yeah

his gig he was awesome for fans of that
type of music it was a real real treat

Jonathan did because he stated the event
all night long but I was like in New
York City I'm like I'm seeing frickin
something so I myself I went and ate at
two different places I wouldn't eat it
the hell L guys there on fifty-third and
sixth street if anybody has their eat
there their food is really really good
there's like two carts across the street
from each other I took a picture of
nollie the cart but also a picture of
the food as well I got the special you

lamb half chicken with all kinds of cool
rice and stuff like that I really
enjoyed it i also got deed at ray's
pizza and then i got to walk around in
the downtown area what they call x
square so i did get to see a few things
