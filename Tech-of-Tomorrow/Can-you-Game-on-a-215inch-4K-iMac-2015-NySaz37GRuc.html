has just released their brand-new iMac a
21.5 inch thing that's supposed to be 4k
4096 by 23:04 resolution now this is you
know a $1,500 machine that's coming
straight out of the gates from these
guys now there are some things about
this product and I'm actually just
incredibly honestly fuckin just like wow
what is Apple thinking like I'll admit
it I have some Apple machines but this
particular machine I'm pissing on it
right out of the gate and let's talk
about why first of all 4k right okay so
this thing doesn't even have a dedicated
GPU it's using the GPU that's attached
to the CPU that's right you're using
Intel onboard 6200 graphics on this
thing and that's just like really crazy
none of the other imax that I own have a
cheap-ass video car like this they all
have a dedicated either ATI card or
nvidia card and then they're much better
i don't know what's going on with these
guys
plus a 5400 rpm hard drive is what this
thing fucking ships with like I haven't
bought a 5400 rpm hard drive for even an
enemy in years you know what I mean like
who buys 5400 rpm hard drives
nobody does I mean you wouldn't I
wouldn't now obviously yeah sure they'll
light upgrade to a one terabyte or two
terabyte fusion drive but just out of
the gate you get a processor that's like
3.1 gigahertz can overclock to like 3.6
for the turbo boost thing whatever eight
gigabytes of RAM thing expect at 1866 so
I mean that's okay you can upgrade to 16
gigabytes it's got the screen you know
it's obviously a nice screen but now
since you're only going to have the
embedded Intel graphics pushing all this
can this thing actually even play games
at all so we asked ourselves that
question so we're like okay so braaap
the bat okay it's we talked about that
4096 by 2304 if I tried to play I
believe any game in 4096 by 2304 other
than some kind of card game or poker
game I mean Phillies his machine Winkle
so we have to do everything at 1080p so
with that said though let's jump in and
let's check this out oh by the way yes
we did install windows on this machine
so we're testing within the Windows
environment on a Mac that's right if the
games we test in the Windows 10
environment are Metro last light
BioShock Infinite and battlefield 4 and
all the rest the tests that we're doing
are all done the latest OS X El Capitan
10.11 with that said then now let's jump
in and let's check out those games first
up we have battlefield 4 at its low
settings with 45.9 average frames per
second next up BioShock Infinite 1080p
DirectX 11 Ultra settings 18 average
frames per second ouch and then last of
the Windows 10 games is Metro last light
1080p DirectX 11 it's low settings with
31 average frames per second next up we
have Tomb Raider 1080p normal settings @
29.9 average frames per second now
that's almost a halfway decent next up
we have Cinebench r15 opengl score of 47
point 23 frames per second and a cpu
score of 568 CB and last but not least
we have Geekbench 3 64-bit with a single
core score of 3779
and a multi-core score of 12,000 670
alright folks so before I bounce out of
here I want to give a special shout to
the people over at Braintree payments
for making today's video possible even
the best mobile app will not work unless
you have the proper payment API and
that's where these folks come in to
solve all your problems this is where
brain trees V zero SDK comes in one
amazingly simple integration gives you
every way to pay it supports Android iOS
and JavaScript clients and it offers a
simple integration that you can do in
minutes
if this sounds good to you try it out
for yourself in the sandbox all you
gotta do is go WWE bring three payments
calm /t ot side everybody you guys can
see that obviously even though this is a
$1,500 machine this iMac will not play
games worth crap having a totally non
dedicated video card what the fuck are
you guys thinking over at Apple that's a
stupidest thing I've ever heard of
that's caveat number one that I'm like
can't go fuck off I mean obviously yeah
if you want to pay for that one terabyte
or two terabyte fusion drive you still
gotta cough up more money out of your
pocket and pay for the stuff which is
usually in the hundreds of dollars in
fact usually upgrading anything through
them is a major pain in the ass and big
dollars which is why we change out all
our own memory as much stuff as we can
and the 5400 rpm hard drive
once again seriously it's absolutely
dumb I don't know what you guys think
but I think that's just pretty stupid
stuff so for 1,500 bucks I don't know I
do not think this new 21.5 inch 4k iMac
has worth the money whatsoever I'd
rather pay a little bit more money and
get a way better iMac with a dedicated
video card and a better screen let me
know what you guys think down below I
know you guys don't really like Mac's
all that much anyways you know they have
their purposes for music and stuff and
that's what I like you know like usual
all this stuff will be down below like
button including the brain tree which to
me is kind of a no-brainer so if you
guys want to check out any of the stuff
just go down to the like button get sho
more information it will be there
I'm Elric you've been watching teka
tomorrow and we'll see you guys back
here for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
