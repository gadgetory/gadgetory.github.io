tomorrow we're covering all the biggest
games to come out this holiday season on
PC and today we're taking a look at one
of the most anticipated first-person
shooters to come out this year the most
recent edition in a series that's loved
for its focus on teamwork beautiful
destructible environments and
large-scale conflict battlefield 4
so it's finally here after a successful
multiplayer beta we finally have the
finished product and it has to be said
this game is absolutely gorgeous and not
nearly as intensive as we thought it
would be to give you just a sample of
how it runs we took a look at the
average frame rate on this level right
here the second stage Shanghai of the
single-player campaign indoors dark
outside but plenty of lighting and
objects flying through the air to test
things a bit running on our system which
includes a GTX 780 and i7 4770k
processor we saw an average frames per
second of 75.6 on ultra settings 100
10.9 on high and 170 3.5 on medium the
campaign feels a lot different from how
it was handled in battlefield 3 the
opening missions put you in a squad of
three or four guys and your teammates
show a lot more personality than they
did in three well the first two missions
have yet to put me in a vehicle other
than a driving getaway scene for plot
vehicles are used by enemies right away
including having you square off against
helicopters and tanks with explosives it
already feels a lot more compelling and
entertaining than 3 storyline which is
good thing considering how dry that one
was and hopefully maintains this energy
level throughout giving you a feeling of
actually wanting to play through all of
it now while the campaign so far has
been an improvement over Battlefield 3's
that is only a secondary component to
the game to what most people actually do
care about the multiplayer mode I've
only messed around a little bit in a
couple of matches i did a team
deathmatch for some shooting practice
that wasn't my favorite battlefield
experience but quickly got back in the
spirit of things with a conquest match
once again trying out the siege of
Shanghai map that we used back in beta
as well as a rush game on Zavod 311
stage destructibility is satisfying and
forces a change in tactics and
positioning vehicles supply on the map
so far has been enough four squads to
make use of them but not flood entire
teams so there's still ground units to
make use of aside from destructibility I
haven't seen too many new examples of
LEvolution as dice loves to call it
aside from what we saw back in the beta
on the siege of Shanghai map including
things like Road barriers and of course
the collapsible skyscraper I really only
hit the tip the iceberg in terms of
trying all the different new maps and
content of this game has to offer I've
only been three matches so there's a lot
more play time to go before I can really
give a full estimate on how things have
changed since bf3 I do have to say
though that from what little I have
played it's been a lot of fun and I'm
looking forward to more matches and even
towards finishing the campaign so i can
give you guys a full review as soon as
possible now
what you've seen so far is already
enough to convince you to want to grab
the game for yourself you can check out
a link in the description for pricing
and availability and while you're down
