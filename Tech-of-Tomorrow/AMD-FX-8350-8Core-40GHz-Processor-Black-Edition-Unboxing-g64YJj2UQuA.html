again to the Technodrome our YouTube
channel we bring you all the tech all
the time by now you should know me since
my name's on the top of the channel up
there and today we've got something
that's pretty cool now I know this has
been out for a little while but it's
still a very exciting and very relevant
product I'm talking about the AMD FX
8350 8 core CPU now this thing's under
$200 8 cores 4.0 gigahertz sixteen
megabytes of cache this thing is highly
overclockable and for people who are
looking for a solid gaming CPU I think
this is very very seriously one to take
a look at so I have the box back here
behind me I'm going to bring it up here
and just up the camera and see it I know
you a lot of you folks have already seen
it comes in the metal 10 flip it around
just real quick show you guys the back
here's the actual CPU on the side of the
box and on top we have a little bit of
the nomenclature so with that said let's
pop over the table and let's take this
thing out of the can so today is
actually an uncanny it's so uncanny here
at tech of tomorrow so like any good
uncanny will start done can this bad boy
so I'll take it right here in the back
make a little incision see I did that
very surgical like nice even cut you
know I'd make a million dollar surgeon
that's right I wouldn't so the cap here
and we see that right there it's like a
salt little metal cap there's like a
coffee tin actually here we go advanced
macro design AMD processor in dogs we're
in the can man so pop that out toss it
off to the side nothing too importante
there let's bring the rest of all the
stuff out of the can here well you got
the CPU and then obviously the heat sets
up all right so let's first off take a
look at the CPU you can see have the
f X thing right here in the CPU now I'm
going to go ahead and try to gently take
this out of here
so that the camera can get a really nice
shot of it so I'll go ahead and set this
down and let him readjust you guys can
see the top of the CPU so now you guys
can see here's the top of the CPU you
guys can see all the nomenclature now
one big difference between this and an
Intel CPU is well I'll flip to the
bottom the second arrow lets you guys
see all AMD CPUs still have pins coming
out of them
now Intel's reverse that the pins are on
the motherboard and the CPU has no pins
that's something different so now let's
go ahead and let's just flip this over
real quick and you guys can see through
the packaging all of the pins and that
is really the big difference as far as
the LGA packaging you know goes go ahead
and set that off to the side then last
but not least we have the cooling
solution that comes inside of it now I
most likely will not use this in my
build I'm planning on doing a water
cooling system with this one but at
least it does come with a fan it does
work so here's the AMD solution fan by
ABC as you can see that up there this
uses a locking system so basically you
clip one side on then the other side on
and then it locks with this clip right
here it's very easy and simple to use
you guys can see you have two copper
heat pipes coming out going into the
fins helping dissipate the heat away
from the CPU now I know this is just in
you know in box included thing but it
actually does work if you're not doing
any overclocking you're just a standard
guy who's going to use your system you
do not use I mean excuse me you do not
need to go out and buy yourself an
additional heatsink this one will work
just fine for you and you can see it's
already got all of the goo on there so
all your thermal paste is already on
there it's all I got to do is install it
and up and away you go get that back on
there so in the Box folks you get this
CPU and that's your goodness on the
the FX 8350 alright folks so there you
have it the new AMD FX 8350 processor
this thing is going to go into a build
that I'm making I got sapphire to kick
me down a card so I have a six gigabyte
card from them I'm going to take that
thing tear off the cooling get a water
block I'm going to water cool it and
this overclocked it and then have a
custom AMD system now I used to have one
before but I gave it to my son for his
birthday so I was like hmm I didn't have
a name B system anymore and I actually
like AMD gaming systems lot of you folks
out there all the time say oh L it
doesn't like AMD that's just not true
just traditionally I've gotten better
support from Intel than AMD so therefore
you see more of their products but now
I'm going out of my way
I've been selling some of my stuff off
and I'm buying my own products for
reviews and I bought this so with that
said you guys will be seeing more AMD
stuff I love AMD for gaming systems
don't get me wrong I think there's no
reason why you have to buy an Intel
processor if you're a gamer AMD will
suit you just fine and this is going to
be a really good gaming bill which I'm
going to bring to you folks so like
usual I hope you guys like the video hit
that like button if you're not
subscribed make sure you do so if you
missed anything or instant buying this
make sure you check out the link in the
description below
and we'll see you back here with more
tech tomorrow on tech o tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
