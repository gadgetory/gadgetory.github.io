again to the channel for those of you
who follow the channel you know that
just the other day we did a video
showing you how bad a G 4400 Intel CPU
actually gimped and bottlenecked your
video cards and you guys can see that
honestly with a $50 CPU it was gimping
stuff by at least 50% compared to the
latest I 5 or the latest 1600 X but
that's to be expected now some guys out
there make comments like oh man
parrying $1000 you know a GPU with a $50
CPU is crazy well for one thing neither
one of those video cards is $1000 I've
never seen a 1080 for $1000 and honestly
the Vegas 64 even that's most outrageous
wasn't $1000 so that was a little bit
over hype on you person who you are out
there and you know who you are I really
don't get you just a word on a piece of
paper but anyways we bring you that same
system today now this system comes to
market at around $400 with one
particular video card which is the 1050
ti card the system comes out to about
four hundred and thirty dollars and with
the equivalent thing on the AMT side
this system comes to actually less than
$400 so this system is a really really
entry-level system it's meant to be that
way though some things about it I'll get
into later I was I thought were you know
a little bit kind of a pain in the butt
to deal with building this system but
we'll jump into that so right now let's
see how the system does at 1080 gaming I
didn't do anything in 1440 or 4k kids
obviously this systems barely at the 400
marking point but with that said though
let's jump in let's check out that
system and see what it does and one
thing just of note yes you can buy some
higher G CPUs that will actually play
games a little bit better but I was
trying to really budget this and in my
first video it was all about that $50
CPU so that's just one thing I want to
take note though with that said though
let's jump in let's check out the system
let's check out those benchmarks and see
it through the day does a foreigner
dollar system really play games first up
let's check out this case now this case
is currently only $40 this is the
BitFenix mid tower case now this case
actually is quite nice for the price
range the only things about this
particular case that I wasn't really
thrilled about
is that cable management in the back was
really hard there's almost no room in
the back of this case to do cable
management but really what are you
expecting for a case that is 40 bucks I
mean it looks good it's ergonomic and
he'll the price is definitely right the
motherboard that we chose for this build
is also very very cost efficient it's
the gigabyte GA h1 10 M - a LGA 1151
motherboard this board comes to market
at about fifty four ninety-nine right
now it has a lot of features and one
thing cool about this motherboard is
that you could upgrade it to many
different CPUs or GPUs depending on your
budget goes in the future so you can put
this motherboard your system now it's
got a great price and then later off you
want to change the CPU or the GPU you'll
be good to go
the CPU well by now we should all know
what the CPU is but if you don't it's
the Intel G 4400 so three point three
gigahertz CPU very very entry-level CPU
like I said they do have some higher and
processors for more money that will play
games a little bit better so if you want
to get one of those CPUs and raise the
prices system you can do so but as is
this $50 CPU does a pretty decent job
for entry level gaming the memory inside
is the Kingston HyperX fury black this
is a 4 gigabyte 21 33 megahertz ddr4
stick its nine ECC and it's currently on
sale for $42.99 the hard drive that we
use in this build is also probably the
most bought hard drive for gamers around
the world this is the Western Digital
one terabyte black drive this drives
also on sale for $42 so it's a really
great deal for entry level gaming now
powering up this little beast of a
system is a power supply by EVGA it's 80
plus white certified it's 500 watts and
it's only $40 for this build we also
tested two different video cards that
way we could see things on the AMD side
of things and on the nvidia side of
things so on the nvidia side of things
we used a zou tech gtx 1050 TI this is a
four gigabyte video card that comes
overclocked right out of the box now
over on the AMD side of things we have a
562 gigabyte video card and both these
video cards really don't bottleneck the
cpu that much whatsoever seeing that
they're very low in an entry level cards
but with that said though let's now
then let's check out those benchmarks
and see how the system really does at
1080p gaming
all right folks so there you have a
system that costs right around $400 and
plays ten ATP's really really nicely now
obviously the Nvidia card is going to do
a little bit better it's a four gigabyte
card versus a two gigabyte card you just
have to make the choice in how you want
your system to be because if you get the
AMD card you're gonna be coming at the
market at about three hundred eighty
five dollars for the system and if you
go with the Nvidia card you're gonna be
just slightly over $400 but either way
you're right in the pocket at that four
hundred dollar mark you can obviously
choose some different memory I do
believe they have some super memory out
there for about ten dollars you could
probably not just a wee bit off the
price as well but you guys can see at
1080p gaming this system actually does
okay and if you don't have a whole lot
of money which I know many people out
there don't you're always looking for
the best system and one thing I like
about this system you guys talk about
this all the time is future proofing
well with this system you can change the
CPU out to lots of other CPUs you can
change the GPU out you can add more
memory you can add more hard drives
there's just all kinds of things that
you can do with this system to upgrade
it so you're not really stuck with this
system as you buy it's not like when you
go out and buy a Dell or something like
that and the system's there and you
can't take it apart change Jack diddly
in it you're just stuck with what you
have with this system you can buy it as
an entry level system pull that CPU out
sell it to one of your bros buy an
upgraded CPU and the same thing with the
video card and memory and everything
else so you can pretty much turn this
system into a full-blown really super
nice in gaming system as you get more
money in your pocket so at the end of
the day I have to say I really do like
the system for what it is I mean I tried
to get the price even lower but I know
it's really hard to knock those prices
down and for those people out there
saying oh hey man why didn't you include
Windows dude you can get a Windows key
online for 15 bucks all day long all
over the place just go on the internet
and type into Windows key and all kinds
of stuff will come up so you don't have
to worry about paying for expensive
things to get yourself in Windows 10 you
can download all the information to make
a CD for free pay for your code and you
are up and going so that's why I really
don't include Windows anymore in our
build because it's just too dang cheap
and most people honestly have access to
an operating system here through their
friend or online or somewhere so that's
not to mean of the pivoting Achilles
the entire deal like usual the folks at
the end of the day this system I think
is a thumbs up let me know what you guys
think and below that like button we'll
have more information for all these
parts you can build one yourself
change it around and do whatever you
like but hey thanks for watching I
appreciate you guys being here enjoy
yourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
