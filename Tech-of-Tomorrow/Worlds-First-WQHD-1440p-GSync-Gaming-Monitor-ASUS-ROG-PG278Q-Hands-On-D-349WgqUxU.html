Nick of Asus once again showing you more
of their technology now I don't know if
you guys know what's going on out there
but in videos come up with this new
g-sync technology
now this g-sync technology actually
locks your frame rates from your video
card to your monitor now gamers out
there you all know that when you lose
frame rates and everything that's when
you get blur that's when you get lag now
with these new products that they have
you're going to be eliminating that 100%
I do want to mention though that it does
require your video card so if you have a
really powerful video card obviously
you're going to get better frame rates
and if you're using a lower end video
card but the beauty of that is that
you'll get the full benefit of it though
if you don't lose any frame rates from
either end you're gonna kick ass so now
I'm gonna hand the microphone over to
Nick stop babbling let him tell us about
these new products sure so exactly like
you said this is our first g-sync
monitor that we're gonna release a lot
of the ones that haven't been announced
this week are all been 1080p this is
gonna be the world's first wqhd desync
monitors so this is 2560 by 1440
resolution does it hit the gamer g-spot
it does yet a 1 millisecond response
time you have up to 144 Hertz refresh
rate and the really great thing about
this it's gonna be available in April
for $7.99 and talk about the resolution
yes yeah that's that's the biggest
that's the biggest deal is Nvidia had
their in their press event they showed
off all their g6 monitors except for
this one because this is the world's
first wqhd the 2560 but it's a bad boy
right and this is what we want to do and
Bill so as you can see this is our first
ROG monitor we have some RG branding
here in the bottom corner we kept the
front very clean very thin bezel and
then the back if we can maybe turn it
around a little bit you can see that we
have the ROG styling so on the bottom
you get the coloring the coloring and on
the back it's kind of the same kind of
stealth jet styling that maybe some of
the ROG laptops have now I always think
this is like supposed to be like
is it Ferrari or like a Lamborghini kind
of style I don't know I we might do my
text aways all regular Mike hey that's
for Isaac no it's Lamborghini but you
guys can see this thing's really thin
it's really light and at 2560 by 14
40 gaming does take on a new aspect if
you've got a monitor that's going to
fully support that you're going to see
that in your gaming says products enemy
coming to market like Nick said about
$800 so when it first comes on it's
gonna be a bit pricey but you guys
expect that you get high end you pay
high end prices but actually shouldn't
be very much more than the 1080p
solutions which I've seen prices have
been announced in the six to seven oh
yeah for sure I've seen them to go from
1080p to wqhd at $7.99 should be a
pretty good proposition yeah I'm
definitely going to be getting one for
myself because when you're playing a
game and you're losing stuff especially
doing with the 3d glasses having your
frame rates locked in is going to be
very very important I myself personally
can't wait to get my hands on one and do
some testing so let's us know folks what
you guys think I know you guys have like
written it before it said all the G King
thing it's way too expensive but really
think about it don't think about it from
the money perspective think about it
from the gamers perspective and as a
technology matures it's going to get
cheaper so eventually you'll be able to
afford it so I'm Eric this is Nick from
a Zeus we'll see you guys back here on
tech you tomorrow with more text amazes
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
