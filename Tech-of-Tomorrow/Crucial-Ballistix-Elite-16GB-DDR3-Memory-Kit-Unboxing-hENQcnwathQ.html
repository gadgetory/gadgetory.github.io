welcome back to Tuesday on tech of
tomorrow I'm Ella Rick your host and
today I've got some really really
awesome memory from the people over at
crucial this is the new 1866 megahertz
Crucial Ballistix a leak that's right
it's free latest like you know I'm too
cool for school I'm just kidding
so anyways check out I've got four of my
head right here so your card trick I've
got them now pick a card any card I
guarantee you I can tell you what's card
that you think yeah which one do I pick
one all right you picked the Crucial
Ballistix 1866 elite so anyways folks
I'm just joking around here so check it
out they come in packages these are four
gigabytes each this is a 16 gigabyte kit
altogether 1866 megahertz like usual
what that means that's its XMP profile
so the first thing you want to do
whenever you get the memory this is you
put it in your machine you restart you
want to immediately go into the BIOS and
set your XMP profile you should have XMP
profile 1 or 2 or you can custom make it
don't just go in and overclock the
memory because it'll be overclocking
your system in most cases you might not
want to do that so let's go ahead and
take one out of the box anyway so got
one in my hand right here so in front of
it back of it but now let's see what it
really looks like because a lot of
things about memory these days -
especially for custom builders I just
want to say right off the bat the people
over at crucial when my tech camp team
Reynolds when he walked in the first
thing he did was jump on these things
and he started cutting them like a hawk
to its last meal he's like oh get more
and more of those they look really
really nice because they're black
neutral which means that you know the
color black is very easy most systems
you can put it in it goes with anything
also in the last video I said the color
negro which means black that is mean I'm
a racist some people out there get the
wackiest ideas man you know those are
just different ways to say color they
like Rosa you know
something else so don't trip man or
don't trip potato chip as they say in
the potato world here's the front of the
memory stick right here go ahead and pop
it out of its package I'll go ahead and
set this over the side I'll throw the
camera I'll spare his life today he's
been a good cameraman today see all the
heat pins on top make a sound ticket for
the microphone take a musical instrument
and just choke it around guys trying to
make more excitement to the dang thing
you know but there's a front here is the
back memory nowadays folks though is
really really more plug and play now
crucial is known to have very very
stable memory that's one of their big
things they've always had crucible istic
was one of the memory I used for years
because the first 10 years of my career
crucial was my main backer for memory
some were on the line we lost track and
I switched around but we've always loved
their products and we're glad to have
them back on the channel so that's it
folks thanks for watching this is the
unboxing and first look of the new
Crucial Ballistix elite it's a 16
gigabyte kit which consists of 4 4
gigabyte memory sticks it looks great
it's black neutral so it can go in any
build out there very easily and look
very appealing to the eye like I said
before don't just play in and do nothing
plug it in going to your BIOS and make
sure you enable your XMP profile piece
Adam we'll see you back here on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
