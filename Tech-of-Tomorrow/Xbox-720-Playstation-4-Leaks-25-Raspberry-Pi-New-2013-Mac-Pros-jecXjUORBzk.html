channel I'm el work your host and today
we're bringing you tech news on tech of
tomorrow it's been actually a really
busy week this week lots of things have
been announced so many that would take
multiple videos so we're going to break
them up but today we're going to bring
you four of the hottest stories now you
guys know about the Raspberry Pi the
model be for 35 bucks has been selling
like hotcakes around the world students
love it tinkerers love it people want to
get prototypes to market really fast
they love it and for 35 bucks hell you
know the price can't be beat so what's
going on now welp they're releasing a
new version that's right the model a the
model a is going to be 25 bucks and
already 15,000 units have been sold to
schools in the UK so that means 15,000
of those kids in the UK are going to be
getting these and this is actually
sponsored by Google so Google they've
seen this reserve pool of talent these
little kids and they're like hey what a
great way to get these kids
knowledgeable give them out by the way
Google why you doing at the UK come on
to America to our kids in the education
to we don't want to be a bunch of global
blabber blabber ins what people have
their get edumacated come on over here
so this thing's out really really cool
stuff tell me what you guys think 25
bucks the only drawback is now this is
going to curtail a lot of people's
projects no ethernet at all you get
lower power which is good for some
things but you also are sacrificing the
ethernet so if you guys like to check
out more details on this the link will
be in the description below where i've
wrote a full article up on this with
some more facts about this product next
up on the news console wars they're
about to begin first up playstation 4
it's been rumored that there's going to
be a playstation meeting on februari
20th where they're possibly going to be
releasing all the information about a
new playstation 4 now i wasn't able to
get a hold any leaked specs or anything
but it has
rumored that this is going to come out
on februari 20th will it I know if every
20 seconds my birthday so it'd be really
nice to get some great news like that
I've actually taken and use my
playstation 3 and I've replaced lots of
stuff Cameron he's bought me tons of
stuff he got me one of those Apple TVs
he got me a Roku I've used them all
they're all really cool but when it
comes down to it honestly my playstation
three plays most movies better I can go
on and do anything I want an Amazon I
can go and do it over on Netflix all my
games are on there too I think it's
pretty damn cool so tell me what you
guys think also once again have an
article over on TECA tomorrow calm make
sure you check out the link in the
description below now like I said what
would wars be without a competitor
that's right and the competitor this
time is Microsoft the giant of the
software kingdom now what's going on
with this well apparently they'll have
some brand new HD 7000 graphics and
stuff embedded in this new machine now
the specs have been leaked that's right
they've been leaked and soon this thing
should be hitting the shelves I heard
it's going to be released at e3 this
year so sometime in June we're gonna see
this now I know a lot of guys out there
are always going to say oh you know
console technology gets outdated but it
doesn't matter it's really cool and you
have a console to be able to play all
your stuff in a little box and be able
to get those same things so even if it's
like twice as good at last gen I'm
looking forward to seeing it now we have
all the specs have been linked over on
our website w WQ tomorrow come what you
guys can check all that out and give us
your opinions are you guys waiting for
this do you guys even give a crap about
this or do you feel that you know
console stuff is just for kids let me
know your opinion because we want to
hear them last but not least on tech
news today well check it out Mac Pro Wow
where in the hell is the mac pro bin
it's been years since we've seen a
release of a mac pro now I know them
from a lot of standpoints that Apple is
probably going will you know your
machine works it you know it does good
and a lot of ways that's true my mac pro
still does everything really good I
haven't updated anything on it except
for changing out SSDs in memory and it
still really does kick ass but the whole
thing is
with all these new emerging technologies
like thunderbolt and all this other
stuff the mac pro that i have is slowly
starting to get old i mean there are new
cpus which much much better do rendering
and can calculate all the stuff in your
machine to make it faster than the older
mac pro so a refresh is really really an
order apple the heck are you guys
thinking it's almost like you guys just
went to sleep on the mac pro what mac
pro we forgot there anyways the
good news is though is that it's been
told to a french company that yes there
will be a refresh on the mac pro now for
professionals out there this is going to
be really good news i know a lot of you
guys home use pc users you could really
give a rat's poop you know about that
but the thing is though for people like
me i use that computer all the time we
record all of music that you've ever
heard on either channel on our mac every
video you seen rendered has been
rendered on our mac it's a work horse
now i know people play games you don't
care about this and nor should you there
is no reason for it but if you're going
to run a professional recording studio a
professional media business you're going
to want to have the right equipment and
a Mac Pro refresh is just what the
doctor ordered for this kid so anyways
that's tech news here on tech Oh
