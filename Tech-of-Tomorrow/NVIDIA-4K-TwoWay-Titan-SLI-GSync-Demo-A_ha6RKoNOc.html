we are at the Nvidia booth with Vijay
from Nvidia who's going to show us some
of their latest g-sync technology now
all along the wall behind me we have
tons of our monitors from tons of
manufacturers making you guys's g-sync
products is that correct Vijay that's
right we're really excited that we've
got on display here six models of g-sync
powered monitors that we're going to be
available for sale in q2 so that's
amazing I know original you guys just
partnumber the one company now you see
many many companies right really
exciting to be able to get this new
technology out into the market and to
poor gamers who can see the benefits of
it so what are some of the different
resolutions and some of the different
companies and then as you have back here
that we're seeing right now we've got
1919 by by 10 resolution 24 inches and
27 inches Asus announced on Monday a
brand new monitor at 25 by 14 resolution
you have 27 inches yeah we saw that was
really nice new slick design looks looks
nice we've also got a 4k technology demo
of g-sync cuz that's the next thing wow
you know getting up in front and making
sure so is that this isn't we saw there
was powered by 4 Titans that's a set
that's an amazing one - well that's
separate from the g-sync one once down
here and it's
for K 3040 Wow please and there you know
powered by by a GC well let's move down
the way folks and let's see this 4k
technology in action
so I folks we've moved down the way to
for at cake technology and BJ wants you
guys to know that actually the 4k it is
actually flexible where your camera is
fixed so it's not going to film very
well so if you see it flickering the
background that's kind of normal for
filming we'll bring you guys the videos
showing you guys the technology in
action correct DJ absolutely yeah so
what we got going on back here what's
powering this alright so we've got on
the right hand side is a 31 inch 4k
monitor powered by GC is a technology
demo and on the left hand side is the
same Monica but it's not powered by GC
and what we can do is look at a side by
side to see the difference so right now
this side is running with vsync on and
we're outputting at 60 frames per second
from the GPU and things look pretty
normal that the problem is the games
don't output at 60 frames per second
constant know the changes I figured all
the pickups all the stuff you see
changes all the time so let's let's take
a look at what happens when we randomly
change the frame
on the monitor between 40 and 60
frames-per-second you can see this
stuttering it's subtle but you'll see it
right there
so what so what you can do is you can
turn off vsync and gamers do this
because they want the best possible
response time exactly
trouble is you get tearing them exactly
straight off so it's just horrible to
have such a beautiful monitor and see
this tenner exactly loss of framing so
geez think it totally works
whether it takes a video card directly
and make sure that none of the frame
rates drop out at all exactly you could
be doing this time so here we are with
the vsync off g-sync is not on you can
see the tearing and we'll just turn G
sake on and right away
it's so beautifully smooth there's no
Terry what I'm going to do is introduce
them well and something that a lot of
people understand too is that this
actually helps your eyes without all the
framerate drops and your eyes happen to
deal with all that stuff your eyes will
be able to look at this for a lot longer
time before getting weary and tired
right and a lot of our we have a lot of
enthusiasts gamers and
when they play away when they play with
jisuk they say it's an amazing
experience because they can focus on the
gameplay and they're not distracted by
tearing and stutter exactly it's gonna
make the whole entire experience bring
it up a level because for now on
whatever video card you have then
actually they're really the higher your
video card is to be even better
performance you're going to get all the
way across the board now even with your
monitor something previously not
available at all we're gonna give you a
demo with Visa Gong vsync off and with
g-sync on g-sync off so you guys can see
the difference is live on the screen
okay so we've got a little rectangle of
square up here red is vsync on all
righty orange vsync off all righty cream
cheese and tea sync enabled okay so we
can cycle through this during gameplay
and it's a great way to see begin so
here we are in this game
when it's a really simple scene like
this the GPU can output was 60 frames
per second relax refresh rate no club as
we scroll over into some complexity
notices stutter totally
yeah it's bouncing around looks horrible
really distracting in a game like this
so let's take a look at what happens
when going
he sing-off
Oh tearing whoo really Ted tearing
really bad terrorist and now with
juicing oh just you know what I don't
even notice this though but it's
actually clear the picture itself is
actually clear in definition so it's not
only helping with maintaining your frame
rates it also looks like it's helping
maintain the resolution all the time as
well because it's not it's not
stuttering and it's not tearing it so
when you have the stutter it's you know
you're seeing the same frame twice where
you should be seeing in other words
you're right it does look clear it just
looks awesome g-sync hits the g-spot of
the gamer
that's amazing I can't wait to get one
for me Zeus so here at the show we've
got six manufacturer so we've got
viewsonic you got AOC Phillips BenQ
under suits and there they've all
announced their monitors are on display
here and they say they'll be available
for purchase in q2 so Newegg is going to
have lots of stock all right well thank
you very much PJ totally appreciate your
time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
