back to channel glad to see you here now
a big question and everybody is mine
mine in fact a lot of times too is when
is it absolutely time for you to upgrade
now I know we all love to upgrade I wish
I had a better frickin truck better
guitar better clothes health the truth
the matter is we all want better but if
you have a PC when is it truly time
works like dammit man I don't have any
choice anymore you need to upgrade well
the first thing you need to look at
number one is does your PC at this
moment do what you want it to do I mean
is your PC at this moment doing all the
stuff you want to do can it play the
games you want can it do the processing
you want because if your computer right
now even though you want to upgrade it
still does everything that you want to
that's really not a time to upgrade one
of the easiest things you can always
upgrade in your computer though is
memory memory is a great upgrade all the
time and more remember you have the
better your system will do so if you're
going to do a an upgrade at any time
pretty much I would say memory is the
number one upgrade but beyond that when
do you really need to upgrade that
motherboard that's CPU and that video
card or even your monitor other stuff
well let's start off with your monitor
does the current monitor that you have
does it do everything that you want to
do when I'd say that does it actually do
the resolution that you want it to do so
do you have a monitor that's only like a
1080p monitor but you have a 4k card or
even lower you have 1080p you know video
card but you have a monitor that only
does like you know seven 60 or something
at that point when your video card
supersedes the power of your monitor
that's the time to upgrade your monitor
or if you're like me and you're getting
older sometimes having a faster refresh
rate eliminates all those headaches now
if you're playing with your gaming stuff
at 60 Hertz and you look up and you're
like damn man I have a frakkin
headache well that's because of you that
low refresh rate so at that point
usually have to make a choice do I want
to be sick when I'm playing my games or
do I want to upgrade so as far as the
monitor goes it's time to upgrade your
mater when your video card extends the
power of your model or it's actually
receiving you know if it can't no longer
take I'm sorry to get a little head of
myself if your monitor is not good
enough to work with your card it
definitely time to get monitor or if you
get headaches that to monitor so let's
jump there now your CPU the big thing
with a CPU and all the people out there
doing it is bottlenecking
with your video card so what you have to
do is you have to be find a friend or
some of your go look at videos online
and see wow man you know I've got this
old 85 CPU and it's really not cutting
anymore I notice of my friends using
this when I look online you know my
video cards are doing so much better on
this other CPU what's that point you
have to make a decision okay well is
this chipset this motherboard and stuff
is it actually working for me anymore
because if it's actually flagging down
your video card moment obviously it's
time to upgrade your motherboard and
chipset so that everything is working
together you want to really try to get
yourself a PCI 3.0 motherboard if you
can because then it doesn't matter if
you with 8 by 8 or 16 by 16 up people
out there going to say oh my god Ehlert
that's wrong but it's really not there's
only a 3% difference between the two and
that's not jack-shit so it's nothing to
whine about but if you're going to
upgrade your motherboard frikkin go all
the way to the end you know I mean get
yourself PCI 3.0 so that's when it's
time to upgrade your CPU when your CPU
is being bottlenecks by your video
recorder or does another thing too if
your CPU is just so old you feel it's
not processing stuff it's sluggish your
system is damaged now and times upgrade
that stuff and get yourself a new
motherboard new chipset and all the
other stuff now as far as the video card
goes well your video card like I said is
pretty much going to be in with what
your monitor can do and also we're going
to take into consideration what your CPU
can do not the evidence and CPU and you
have a video card and a video card isn't
playing the frames per second that you
like on screen at all let's just say
there's a certain game or certain things
you want to do you know regardless of
what it is written or that's you know
working with rendering whether it's you
know just doing general-purpose stuff if
your CPU is lagging and obviously it's
time to change it as well so that's that
as far as your power supply goes in your
system they have a thing out there on
the internet where it's called like a
power meter where you can check out like
all the different power things now if
you notice that your system is taking
more watt you know from your power
supply or like really really close like
if you you know 700 watt power supply
using 800 you know and 96 you know watts
of your power obviously it's going to be
time for you guys to go ahead and change
your power supply out we'll have a link
down below where you guys
check out that power meter so um what
check your own system out and see that
that's the time to do that now as far as
upgrading your overall whole system just
ditching your system off of the thing
when it's time to jazz and you finally
have your computer and you're noticing
that really all the things that you want
to do are just lagging sticking slowing
I just probably wants me on my Apple
iMac I want to play games I thought okay
cool you know my Apple iMac swipe had
this thing for years I try to play a
game it and I'm talking about a lulling
game and that was like so obviously
you know that's not a good gaming
experience you know and I think that
most of my viewers out there PC
master-race guys who play a lot of games
and they want the best for their gaming
so your whole experience is going to be
around that gaming experience and really
the general rule of thumb is if you were
unhappy at all with any of the
performance that you see on your
computer and I don't mean like you know
you're a guy who's getting you know 60
frames per second just because you want
to you know be bad actually go out
buying it a car that's a different type
of thing I'm talking about the need to
upgrade not the want it like I said the
very beginning of video all of us wants
upgrade we all want better stuff that's
natural but actually part of the whole
human genome is like like we're always
trying to do better succeed things look
we may or may not have went to the moon
even I mean so you know we're always
trying to expand our horizons but when
it comes time to doing your upgrade I
mean you have to just take a look at the
situation take a look at what you're
doing and also obviously a big factor
always is finance cash it really sucks
when you've got your system and
everything and something happens you
want to upgrade and you just can't
afford it whatsoever that really sucks
you got to save money but really those
are the general rules right there folks
if you're looking up here which you
should look for so for your monitor hey
if your monitors cooled your video card
if you're happy with the refresh rate
your card is great you're good to go on
your monitor as far as your CPU goes if
your CPU is not bottlenecking your GPU
and it's running fine for you but it's
probably not time to change that system
yet unless you just want to because you
want some things better you know like I
said you want something better you want
something faster and as far as your
video card goes hey if your video card
plays the games you're happy with the
games you play why upgrade I mean just
cuz you
down the street as a gtx 980ti doesn't
mean you have to have one just to keep
up there's no reason to keep up with the
Joneses when it comes to PC parts you
can't drive it around the street you
can't put your girl from the side of it
and like put it on your arms look badass
it sits in your house and the only way
you can do it is to become an Internet
crazy person and post pictures and to
look at my clicking PC it's better than
yours back anyways I'm at work
those are your tips and when it's time
for you to choose your upgrade you guys
might be wondering what's the system
back behind me that's right well this
system back behind me is the Rison
system that's right and that'll be
coming to you folks tomorrow so stay
tuned to t ot and we'll bring it to you
I mark you guys been watching the
channel hope you guys like this video if
so there's a like button down below you
know what to do with it we'll see you
guys back to the channel for risin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
