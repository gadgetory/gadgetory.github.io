Braintree payments the smarter way to
pay hey what's going everybody welcome
back to the channel we've got something
new for you folks a brand new monitor
from the people over at Samsung it's
curved
it features brand-new quantum technology
and overall it's really really cool so
with that said let's check it out
starting off the bottom we can see this
monitor features a curved base but
that's not what's really cool what's
really cool is the arm attached to it
it's meant for much more than gaming
because it can be placed and move pretty
much anywhere you want you can put your
monitor in portrait mode and it can go
to any height level that you need
whatsoever so people that are doing Wall
Street and that kind of stuff it's for
them as well as for gamers now the
screen itself nothing too spectacular I
can say just about the screen although
it's a curved screen that's pretty cool
all the technology is actually inside
the monitor the CFG 70 sports a 24 inch
screen with a resolution of 1920 by 1080
16 to 9 aspect ratio but what's really
cool is the one millisecond response
time
that's what gamers want to hear one
millisecond is pretty much instantaneous
the monitor features a brightness level
of 350 CD and the viewing angle is 178
degrees but honestly I've stood in all
kinds of different directions and I
think the viewing angle is actually even
better than this the static contrast
ratio is three thousand to one and even
though it's a 24 inch monitor it still
has the highest curvature rating of any
monitor on the market being 1800 are the
CFG 70 also is a color band support of
sixteen point seven million and the
power consumption is fifty-nine Watts on
the CFG 70 most gamers are familiar with
both G sync and freesync technology G
Singh is a technology from Nvidia and
free sync is from AMD and it costs
nothing it's usually built right into
your monitor one thing great about the
CFG 70
it also has free sync technology and a
few other things that we'll talk about
when we show you the display
but this is actually awesome so you have
144 Hertz of complete completely when I
mean say is completely means your screen
you cannot see the refresh rate
whatsoever it's just smooth sailing
through your games completely at 144
Hertz that means flicker free your eyes
don't get tired you can play your games
for a lot longer and with that quantum
dot technology for the color like I said
before the colors are going to be very
intense let's real quick though let's
check out the on-screen display menu now
the on-screen display menu you access it
from the back of the monitor it's pretty
easy to use you just click through the
buttons but you guys can see that the
screen gives you a lot of different
options for you to choose from but
what's really cool about the OSD when
you're scrolling through it is that you
can save everything on it and access it
by the three front game mode buttons
this is really cool because once
everything's stored all you got to do is
hit one of these three buttons and you
can choose whatever settings you're
comfortable with you could have one for
reading one for watching movies and one
for doing all your hardcore intense
killing and gaming the CFG 70 is also
wall mountable but I don't know if you'd
really want to mount a 24 inch curved
monitor on your wall I wouldn't quantum
dots are small particles 2 to 10
nanometers in size which equals about 50
atoms it's basically similar to an LED
except there it offers much more
realistic and more closely to nature
type of viewing so when you're looking
at the monitor it's going to look more
natural than you've seen in the old days
this technology is going to eliminate
things like dot pitch because the
density and all the quality that
pictures is going to be more lifelike
than you've ever seen before and if you
really want to know more about this
technology we'll have a link down below
to a site called trusty reviews where
they do a pretty good job of explaining
it for the simple man real quick let's
hear a word from our sponsor Braintree
payments Braintree is a code for easy
mobile payments maybe you're working on
the next Eber air B&amp;amp;B or github then why

learn more at Braintree payments calm /t
ot okay we've seen what the monitor
looks like we've talked about the specs
but what does it actually look like and
can you see a difference between using
the different modes well let's jump in
let's check it out and let's see if we
can like I said earlier folks this
monitor supports freesync technology and
we show you three different ways of
using it in this segment here you can
see what the monitor looks like with
free sync completely turned off
here you can see the standard engine of
freesync
and lastly here's what the freesync
ultimate engine
now obviously you guys can't see the
same clarity that we do through the
camera because that technology in the
camera doesn't allow it to capture the
same things that your eyes do but I can
tell you that being in front of the
monitor the screen is very very clear
you can stare at it for hours and it
doesn't hurt your eyes that 144 Hertz
refresh rate that is amazing it means it
basically there's no flicker whatsoever
flickering refresh rates are what causes
headaches and fatigue and when it's not
doing that if you're a serious gamer and
you want a game for a long time
this is where you want to be at now I
don't really feel that a 24-inch monitor
being curved really means Jack diddly
because it's not really in your
peripheral range that's a caveat about
this monitor plus the price it's $350
new you can find it used for about 300
dollars but still that's a high price
for a lot of gamers I'm Eric you guys
been watching techy tomorrow hope you
guys liked this product hope you guys
liked the vid hey there's a link down
below we'll have more information you
know what to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
