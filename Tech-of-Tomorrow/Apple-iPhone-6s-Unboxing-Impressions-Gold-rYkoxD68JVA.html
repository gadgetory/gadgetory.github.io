tomorrow we got something that a lot of
people have been waiting for and that is
the unboxing of the brand new iPhone 6s
got the white 64 gigabyte version right
here in front of me and you can see it
comes in a nice little box I framed to
wait in line quite a long time to get
this thing this morning so shout out to
my friend at TLD thank you very much
buddy so uh with that said though let me
get out my old trusty knife here and uh
let's begin the old unboxing process now
folks there are a lot of new features
with this new iPhone 6 it's got the new
a9 chip with 64-bit architecture it also
has an embedded m9 motion coprocessor so
this thing is made to be fast and made
to handle all of your technology so I'm
just going to take a couple slices with
the box here now this person also has a
4.7 inch screen so not much to that just
a plastic thing on the outside then
we'll just go ahead and begin taking it
apart piece by piece here we go right
here you can see this is the lovely 4.7
inch screen this thing measures in at
five point four four inches by two point
six four inches and is only 0.28 inch
thick which is 71 millimeters will have
the translated in both millimeters for
you guys out there for around the world
and the weight on this thing is five
point four ounce or 143 grams so go
ahead and just go ahead and take that
out of the box real quick on the first
side we see the silent switch and then
we see the volume control buttons we
spin around the top here you can see
where you put in the charger on the
other side it's just simple there's a
power on button and that's all that's on
that side I just hit the power on button
as you guys can see you soon I hit the
power on button well the little phone
she starts it going but we're not really
too worried about that folks we're here
just pretty much get away at the unbox
we'll get to all the real specs later so
let's continue on also inside the box
got a nice pair of headphones
the wall charging unit and the cable we
also have fallen omen klaich err on the
iPhone success including those lovely
Apple stickers that people love to stick
on their car another big thing about the
iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s plus that
these things are made with the 7000
series aluminum the strongest alloy they
said they've ever used in an iPhone the
iPhone 6s has a 4.7 inch retina HD 3d
touch display that features the
resolution of 1334 by 750 for video
recording you can do 4k video recording
and you can do it at 3840 by 2160 but
you can only do it at 30 frames per
second
1080p can be done at 30 or 60 frames per
second and 70 20 HD video can record at
30 frames per second as well which is
kind of weird
why would 720p at only 30 there's also a
FaceTime HD camera this is a 5 megapixel
camera features 720p HD recording has
retina flash and also on the front is
the new 12 megapixel iSight camera
alright so that's it folks I know it's a
really quick video a quick unboxing
we'll have all the specs and all that
stuff we still pretty much talked about
all the main specs the new 12 megapixel
camera the 3d touch that's some of the
main features about it the a9 processor
uses iOS 9 we talked about the iOS 9
I've actually but video coming up
talking about the best features of iOS 9
for now I need to go study a little bit
more on the phone play around fit so I
can actually bring you guys a real video
but I know there's a lot of fans out
there like what's coming in the box so
that's what comes in the box for colors
like I said including there's that new
rose gold so I don't know this one has
gold in the back and white on the front
so I guess is a white gold version model
I don't they actually call it that but
that's what I would call it myself but
these things are here people out there
going to Apple goodies I know you're
going to want to grab these things by
the buttload so I'm Eric thanks for
watching teka tomorrow next week we'll
have actually more on what this phone is
all about and how it competes I think I
got an iPhone 6 edge to run it again so
we'll see how they do and did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
