some new products and gave a couple of
bumps to a few of their old products
first off let's talk about though the
brand new MacBook 13.1 millimeters thick
the same super duper thin features a 12
inch screen this thing's actually pretty
amazing it only weighs two pounds let's
talk about some of those other specs
most Apple fans know that the Apple
retina display is something that's
actually quite nice now the new macbook
is the retina re-envision there's a 12
inch retina display with edge-to-edge
glass bring everything into focus with
over 3 million pixels text rendering has
never been clearer and photos will leap
right off the screen the new macbook has
a resolution of 23 0 for x 1440 and as
an aspect ratio of 16 by 10 this new
macbook has a full-size keyboard in the
fraction of the space and not only does
this keyboard pretty much take up the
entire space of your laptop it also
features a brand new type of touchpad as
well you can now use a force click to
enable new capabilities like quickly
looking up the definition of a word or
prevailing a file just by clicking and
continue to press on the trackpad and
underneath for sensors detect how much
pressure you're applying and give you a
new way to interact with your Mac you'll
now also experience hepat feedback so
what that means as you're using that
keyboard you'll actually feel something
in your finger making you know that you
actually did some things you'll go your
present will give you a little push back
saying hey you've accomplished this tax
or the task is being done now this thing
is obviously very very thin very
lightweight but it only has one port on
the entire computer and I know people
out there going to go what the hell only
one port and this is us bc is a lot of
ports all on one it's like vga its
display port it's you know a bunch from
all in one doesn't have anything you
know like thunder bolt or anything like
that on it but you do get that one
single port now this thing's also geared
obviously for wireless connectivity and
for those people who are looking you
know to take the thing on the run
everywhere this is so small and so white
obviously that's what it's going to be
geared for
maybe that's why they're not putting
many ports on it because I know myself
personally for working in stuff I don't
have a macbook pro just for the simple
fact that is more ports and I can access
more things with it one single port I
don't know that we'll have to you know
pan out in the future and see how it's
going to be now the 12 inch screen is
pretty incredible you guys can see it
goes all the way edge to edge just like
the keyboard and that's actually
something that is just new technology
from the guys at Apple all around
they've rien engine it's macbook pro so
it actually gets really long battery
life as well you get up to 10 hours of
watching movies and stuff that's right
10 hours of movie watching and nine
hours of web browsing so all in all
that's pretty decent battery lights me
might squawk at that but you know that's
not too bad and charging should be
really fast as well with their new
charging capabilities a whole new
battery whole new technology all the way
around so that's the big news that
really came out today they're releasing
their brand new macbook it's thinner
it's smaller it's lighter but it only
contains one damn port which has a/c in
it so i don't know if that's standing
for well I guess we'll see in the future
at the spring forward of it yesterday
there were also a few other things that
were announced now there'll be a bump
and technology on their macbook airs
you'll get new fifth generation
broadwell he processors now I think I
failed to mention this before I was
talking about the new macbook the new
macbook it's coming out it also features
well the brand-new broadwell a processor
so it has all that technology in there
it's got an HD 5300 graphics I probably
got to tell you about that as well sorry
about that my brain is trying to catch
up on everything but there'll be two new
things coming out with the macbook air
like I said you get new fit generation
processor and you'll also get the new
Thunderbolt 2 port for faster access and
transfer rates the Mac Pro will also get
a slight bump as well it'll feature the
new 5th generation intel processors and
it will also have that force touch pad
as well so you get that hectic
technology in there as well not too much
going on in the mac pro world but hey
it's still a small bump now i know some
people out there when I don't like Mac
but there's even more stuff Mac stuff
check it out these guys are coming I
guess isn't actually Mac it's just Apple
