exciting news today because check it out
now we're going to see the gold standard
except the video card that's right it's
a new gold standard people can snob
their nose into the air and be super it
each what card am I talking about well
I'm talking about the brand new card
from Nvidia coming out that's $24.99
that's right two thousand four hundred
and ninety-nine smack gurus now first
off though this cards not meant for
gaming that's what they said because
believe me I tried to get one and they
were like Elric you don't need that for
gaming but really I told him I did and I
could really use it for gaming but
anyways what card am I talking about
anyways well I'm talking about Titan
baby that's right Titan r-tx but the
nickname is but guess what oh the t-rex
but me I'm always a little bit more
worried about pterodactyls
because they scream and come out of the
sky but anyways this is going to be an
incredible competition card honestly
it's going to eat the competition up
that's probably why they're calling it a
t-rex because it's literally going to
eat the competition of this card is
going to be so powerful it's going to be
just in crazy crazy crazy
this card is not geared like I said for
gaming whatsoever this card is for you
know for deep learning and stuff like
that the specs are off the hook man you
guys can see take a look at the card it
looks pretty much you know like your
standard r-tx car it's got two fans it's
got a nice backplate to eight pin power
connections which you need to power this
card up but you guys can see the entire
card is gold so it's the gold standard
and this card looks pretty doggone cool
with that color I haven't seen you know
anybody's PC out there yet to be gold
but maybe now we'll see somebody do a
custom build that's all complete gold
that'll be crazy and were some Duckett's
now under the hood of this crazy card
are 576 Touring tensor courts providing
up to 130 teraflops of deep learning
performance 72 r/t cores delivering up
to 11 Giga rays per second of real time
rate racing performance 24 gigabytes of
high speed GD r6 with 672 gigabytes of
bad
and that's 2 times the memory of
previous generation Titan cards in
previous videos we actually showed you
guys performance in the brand-new sli
which is done through NV link well now
you can get a hundred gigabytes a second
through two of these cards and NV link
so that's gonna be incredible power
doing that type of SLI setup so if
you're some out there is making games
rendering stuff doing 3d all that kind
of stuff
this card is gonna be like the really
SuperDuper heavy hitter unless you're
gonna go into cards are gonna be like
$10,000 so for pretty much the
workstation area which is pretty much
geared for um it's gonna be a really
really crazy card as far as the other
specs go the new t-rex has four thousand
six hundred eight CUDA cores a 384 bit
memory interface it takes to a pen power
connectors like I said before to power
the card it has a TDP of two hundred and
eighty watts and a recommended power
supply of no less than six hundred and
fifty watts the base clock on this bad
boy is 1350 megahertz and it has a boost
clock of seventeen hundred and seventy
megahertz
some other things about this card is
they're saying that you can do 8k video
editing on this card I've even seen an
8k Mon or anything really out an 8k yet
but if you're somebody who is leaning
towards the future 8k is where it's
going to be at obviously because the
Nvidia is throwing this technology out
there and for you people out there that
are into VR VR glasses all that type of
stuff well there's also a new connection
called virtual link which will bring all
that new technology onto your desktop so
I'm more you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow the new t-rex is here will they
eat up all the other competition I guess
we're gonna have to wait and see it'll
be out later this month like I said 24
and 99 but if you're a person outfitter
wants the absolute best the best you
want the gold standard inside of your
workstation PC well then you might just
be one to check out this car just make
sure that you have an extra kidney and
extra liver an extra arm an extra leg or
you might just want to donate your soul
to Nvidia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
