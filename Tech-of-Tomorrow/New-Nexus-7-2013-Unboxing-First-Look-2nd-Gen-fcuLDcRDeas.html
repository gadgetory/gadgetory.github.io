back here once again on the channel I'm
elric and I'm glad to see you guys here
in tech of tomorrow now what are we
bringing you guys today well when the
google nexus 7 originally came out I
brought you guys reviews unboxing all
that stuff and now we actually have the
16 gigabyte second-generation one on the
table it's right here in front of us
we're gonna bring you guys the unboxing
and first look I just see with this
thing's all about so with that said
let's dive in all right my gear engadget
friends check it out like always we're
going to start off with the box you guys
can see here's the front of the box not
much to it some nice little colors will
flip it on the side you guys can see
it's clearly made by asus the back of
the box we can see it's the 16 gigabyte
model now they'll also have various LTE
models available as well but this one's
not one of those this is just the
standard and then here at the end is all
the nomenclature so if you guys were
actually looking to get this here's what
you can look for we'll all set that
information later down in the
description so now let's go ahead and
let's just take it out of the box a
little slider thing right here and
there's one little tab on here that I'm
going to need to make a cut of it's
right here so I got my trusty little
knife right here that's right it's a
switchblade don't make me go let's make
that quick little tab there and do that
to the knife on the side and begin
taking it out of the box so we're off
the bat we have the unit before we
actually get in the unit let's take a
look at the accessory pack underneath
here is going to be all the accessories
that come in here so we've got the
instructions on what to do tells you to
just basically just turn it on how to
use it you get the warranty and safety
book yeah you know what that is it's in
French you also get the charger once
again with the asus name clearly embed
or not they want to make sure that you
know that they made this thing then
here's the USB cable you have standard
USB to micro plugs into here and then
plugs into whatever you want to charge
it with and that's pretty much it for
the accessory so we'll go ahead and set
that off to the side and let's get to
the unit itself now this particular unit
features a Qualcomm s4 pro processor
that's rights 1.5 gigahertz it's a
quad-core
now jump to the back of the unit we can
see that we have a camera this is a 5
megapixel this is an auto focus on the
front we have a 1.2 but this one is
fixed focus so there's not much you can
do with that we can clearly see the
screen is features that corning gorilla
glass it's anti scratch resistant and
all that and it's actually got a
resolution of 1920 x 1200 so it's
actually a little higher than standard
HD pretty cool stuff now on the side
over here we have the power button the
volume control buttons so here on the
bottom we see where you connect the
power this is the microUSB we'll go
ahead and just insert that right there
so that's all you have to do to use that
you just plug that in plug it into your
charger and a way you guys go coupling
your coupling eat now this thing has a
39 50 mil at battery and you get 9 hours
of battery life actually with the unit
pretty cool stuff we also have a 3.5
millimeter audio jack and this unit also
has stereo speakers that are embedded in
it so you don't have to listen to it
through that you can actually listen to
it on the go let's go ahead and turn the
unit on now let me flip it back around
here go ahead and turn the power button
on right here and then we see it coming
to life now as far as the OS goes this
is running Android 4.3 jelly bean so
we're going to go ahead and set this
thing up and then jump back into it in a
minute the unit also has two gigabytes
of memory and it also has a built-in
microphone for connecting to all your
voice commands and all that type of
stuff which we can do right now we'll go
ahead and click into Google you can see
all the options here if it shows you all
that different stuff and we've got the
voice command right here go ahead and
click on that tech of tomorrow
alright folks so here we see the teco
tomorrow website all loaded up right

through and see all of our latest
articles including what I know your guys
are going to be very interested in which
is this one right here the $1,500 gaming
PC so here's that all loaded up you guys
can see we've got the videos and
everything all showing up nice and
clearly you guys can see the screen is
very very clear you can read the text
with no problem at all and if you like
you can actually switch the view and you
can switch it to this way if you like
depending on how you want to view things
I actually myself find a little bit
easier to view things when it's turned
sideways instead of portrait but that's
a matter of decision so there you have
it everything that comes in the box the
features and all the things that make up
the new google nexus 7 2nd generation
