we're here with mr. friends say hi
friend hello we're here with friend from
asking guitars and why are we here in
Los Angeles today well friend here is
going to install the evertune never tune
your guitar again bridge am i cool less
false standard writer that you guys can
see it's my beauty and this guy is going
to take it into his lovely shop back
here where the go cam and do the
insulation and we're going to bring that
folks to you and we noticed a little bit
different than our normal tech but it's
still brand new tech and for those guys
out there and never want to tune their
guitar again you're at the right place
so let's go and rock and roll
member
alright guys so check it out we're
wrapping our day up here at askin and
before we finished the day the inventor
of the product Cosmo Sully's actually
showed up and the man is right here so
how's it going man
great great it's great to be here I'm
glad I got to stop through and see you
guys and I'm glad Tech of tomorrow is
covering this so you were Julian from
these kochiya to fly out here and handle
some stuff out here so that's what we
got lucky enough to meet you right yes
it was synchronicity synchronicity has
happened to be out here and I'm glad I
was because it's been fun and I think
Tagum tomorrow's the first group that's
done such an original type of review of
this where there's the whole process
yeah it's gonna be very interesting as
we came out you know we met friend and
Friends like totally took the whole day
today which you guys will obviously see
in the video where he's taking the time
to tear the guitar apart everything off
it take all the time to mod the guitar
out to install it off the off the little
template they have and then complete the
process which now makes my Gibson Les
Paul Standard even more badass than it
was before well let's hope so I
appreciate it I think so too yeah I'm
excited to see yeah I'm really excited
videos I mean we've had a lot of good
videos but like I said none in this
format you guys will figure out one
thing is so awesome up this is a lot of
guitar players out there pound the crap
out of their strings and so with that in
mind one day he just had the idea about
this in his head of how could I make
this bigger and it's just grown and
grown and grown right yeah well so far
we're chugging along I mean it's a heavy
weight at first but it starts to
accelerate and this stuff now is
available worldwide right so anybody who
wants to get one of these could actually
purchase one worldwide right now correct
yes I mean most of the world is
obviously covered off of our website
we'll ship anywhere Europe is pretty
well covered
with other distributors out there and
anywhere that ESPs are sold we're now
you know we have an ESP model two models
the clips in horizon so ESP we know
you've got locked in who has some other
companies that you're like in current
negotiations to really hope to sleep
this product on in the future
well vgs was the first ones there a
European brand but they're locked in ESP
was the first u.s. name brand and we're
really happy about that
Washburn is set to come out with the
Signature Series this year and hopefully
some imports we will see I would hope to
see some on just respected names like
Ernie Ball maybe Ibanez Gibson maybe
great yeah I mean pretty much any guitar
coming that's making quality guitars
could benefit from having a never tune
model and we'd love to be there right on
so there you have it folks now we know
this isn't our normal type of tech but
you guys know we like to focus on all
the tech that's coming out and since
music ties in with all the stuff that we
do we thought you guys would really
really like that I want to send a
personal thanks out to mr. cosmos lilies
for setting us up with this and just
spending the time with us and a special
thank to friend for spending his day
installing it on the guitar peace out
and we'll see you guys later thanks
