hello and welcome back once again to
another edition of tech dub tomorrow I'm
gonna work your host and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the late 2013
Mac Pro versus the late 2010 Mac Pro now
some people out there gonna be like oh
hey it's Mac stuff you know we don't
really care but a lot of people out
there actually own this machine now mine
the old one it is the 2010 is the
quad-core 2.8 version the one that we're
testing against the new one it's 3.5 and
is the 6 core processor so there is some
differences there but a lot of people
out there actually do own this 2010
machine a lot of people have talked to
online everything you know people bought
this machine because it was what was
really the standard for the last few
years we've been using my recording
studio now for close to four years and
now the new one has come out now the new
one also has 1866 memory it's got 32
gigs of it mine's only got 16 gigs and
it's a lot slower memory now I also
upgraded mine now the new one it comes
to the 256 gigabyte PCI SSD I got one
from other world computing that's inside
this one over here and that's a 240
gigabyte PCIe SSD
I also upgraded my video card to the
latest EVGA gtx 680 at the time that was
a top-line thing that it could be the
new Mac Pro however comes with 2d 500s
now these things did not get recognized
in a couple of tests we just kind of
emitted those tests out of there because
we do think that would be very fair but
you guys will see that this little
machine is basically what a quarter of
the size of this one now I know that
kind of goes both ways obviously inside
this machine I can upgrade the out
of it internally I can even upgrade the
CPU a little bit farther if I want to I
could still push this machine a little
bit but look how big it is it's big its
bulky you can't really move it around
the new Mac Pro though when we hold a
trash can look how small it is I mean
you could literally unplug the thing so
it almost inside your camera bag and
take that wherever you're going now I
know obviously a monitor is not going to
be included in that but still quarter
the size twice as fast
runs a little bit warm but not so hot a
lot of people out there that's what I
mentioned say so you guys mention oh my
god it gets so hot no it doesn't get so
hot you could like fry an egg on it's
not like that at all obviously it gets
warm but this machine's virtually quiet
and also for people out there who are
just like you know looking like saying
hey maybe I would like to purchase this
new Mac Pro well now we're going to have
the scores so you can see them so even
though this is a comparison video
comparing the old 2010 to the new 2013
well you can still use these scores for
a reference point so let's go alright
folks so let's start off with the black
magic disk speed test
now the 2013 six core Mac Pro has a
write speed of eight hundred three
megabytes a second a read of 915
megabytes a second
the older 2010 for core Mac Pro had a
write speed of 300 point five megabytes
a second and a read of six hundred
seventeen point five megabytes a second
so you can see a vast improvement on
your disk speed test
next up Geekbench 3 64-bit a very
popular test many people use it
the 2013 six core Mac Pro had a single
core score of three thousand six hundred
and twelve and a multi-core score of
yeah get rid drop your pants
twenty thousand seven hundred and ten
holy SH the 2010 for core Mac Pro had a
single core score of two thousand one
hundred seventy nine and a multi-core
score of eight thousand five hundred and
twenty big landmark difference there as
well next up Lux mark version 2.1 of
this test
OpenCL performance which is something
that these new Mac pros are supposed to
really excel at
now the 2013 six core Mac Pro had a
score of three thousand one hundred and
ninety four K raised a second the 2010
for core Mac Pro got one thousand 32 K
raise a second that's a vast vast
improvement OpenCL performance if you're
somebody out there is doing a lot of
business rendering this is going to come
in very handy
next up Cinebench r15 the 2013 six core
Mac Pro in OpenGL gets a score of
seventy six point six seven frames per
second the two thousand four core Mac
Pro got a forty four point eight frames
per second the same test now in the CPU
test the 2013 got asked
or of 961 Seabee while the 2010 got a
score of 459 almost double the score in
that next up we have Unigine Valley one
point out now this is one of the tests
that actually did not see both the D 500
cards in the new Mac Pro and so in this
particular test we're not going to get
that true performance so but we've seen
a crossfire like we would if we were
using a regular gaming machine so for
gaming this might not be you know
absolutely you know end-all be-all
solution but for those people doing
OpenCL testing this thing's still going
to be kicking major ass the 2013 six
core Mac Pro has an extreme preset of
twenty-nine point four frames per second
and a score of twelve hundred and thirty
its maximum frames per second was fifty
one point four now on the other one the
2010 for core Mac Pro that has my EB GA
680 it had an extreme preset of forty
point nine frames per second and an
overall score of 17 ten and the maximum
frame per second sixty five point nine
like I said this is pretty much the only
test in here where we see the video card
in my older machine taking advantage of
it because it's not really geared right
now to take advantage of those 2d 500s
now the last test we did is more geared
for real-world uses this is pretty much
something that anybody could do at home
and this is the brand-new Final Cut 10
now what we did is yesterday's video of
the 290 exits you guys saw us do we
actually took that video and we
transferred it back and forth to get
these scores now the video that we
exported was 6 minutes and 29 seconds at
1080p now it took 5 minutes and 29
seconds to export this video on the 2013
6 quart Mac Pro now my 2010 it took much
longer 9 minutes 24 seconds now you guys
can clearly see that this is going to be
an advantage for people who actually
make money off their time because if
it's going to take you twice as long to
export your video that means twice as
long to be sitting around picking your
nose scratching your butt doing whatever
you're doing wasting that time so with
the new Mac Pro you can see that you're
going to cut your work load time in half
and that's going to save you some money
which is something a serious business
person always looks at now I know
everybody's going to ask
4k 4k 4k alright let's take a look at
the four case cause now the video we
used in this 4k video is two minutes
long it took five minutes and seven
seconds to export it on the 2013 6 core
Mac Pro and 9 minutes 20 seconds on the
4 core 2010 once again a serious
different in export times alright folks
so before I bounce header just want to
say that the video that we use in 4k is
by Blackmagic if you guys would like to
have access to that video we will have
it down there below like but in the
description we'll also have more
information about what's going on with
this video also before I totally get out
of here I want to give special thanks
once again to Hulu Plus for making this
video possible without their support hey
you guys might not have seen this video
today so I know many of you PC users out
there know what Hulu is but do you guys
really know what Hulu Plus is because
whoo plus is like a whole different
level Hulu Plus is like taking that
standard video card slap on the
watercooler on it and getting the
absolute most bang for your buck just
all kinds of content now with the
standard whoo
you can only watch it on your PC but
with Hulu Plus baby you can take that on
the go on your tablet on your phone with
Hulu Plus you can catch up on current
shows binge on old favorites or watch a
great movie
stream as many TV shows and movies as
you want anytime anywhere you can also
check out exclusive content including
Hulu originals like the wrong mans and
behind the mask best of all you can
watch all of this content and HD now I
know a lot of people always ask how can
you guys support the site well at this
time you can support the site and get
your guys a free extended trial period
just by going to Hulu Plus calm /t ot
where you can enjoy a plea plus for two
weeks so that's pretty much it folks
you guys can see that there are a lot of
differences between the late 2013 and
the late 2010 models mine's obviously
bigger a lot more expandability on the
inside now I have no Thunderbolt though
whatsoever I could buy a card and stick
it in there if I wanted to but I don't
have that right now this machine is
totally geared for having everything
through a daisy chain off of it if you
guys watch how I showed you guys the
unboxing and first look of it this thing
has
lots of expandability as far as that
stuff goes so that's the way it's meant
to be this one's not meant to be that
way now for me I run a recording studio
video editing studio everything works
fine on my Mac Pro I'm going to hold off
right now on upgrading because the four
thousand dollar price tag in this one
right now with me trying to get other
stuff is like mmm and this one's still
working but I will say that given the
opportunity and I had to cash I would
jump on this new product why well for
one thing look how small it is it
doesn't take up very much desk baek's
whatsoever
it looks awesome if you actually got
some tricked-out badass speakers I mean
your desktop could actually look pretty
futuristic with this thing or you know
you could have it so you have your
trashcan on your desktop and I'm just
playing but there you guys have it there
are a lot of significant differences
between the two machines the 2013 is
coming to market about four thousand
dollars you could probably pick up my
machine for about two grand with
everything I have in it so there are
some price differences but for those
people out there might be considering
either buying an older Mac or a newer
Mac or just considering buy a Mac we've
brought you the scores and the
information you know to make your buying
choice so I'm Miller we'll see you guys
back here on Tekken tomorrow see
