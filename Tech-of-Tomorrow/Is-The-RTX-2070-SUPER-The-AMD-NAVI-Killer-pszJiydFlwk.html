the information saying that the nabhi is
gonna be coming out and it's gonna be
$499 and that it can keep up with the
2070 well guess what Nvidia instantly
has to really something because they
don't really like the knee competition
so they now have released yes the super
cards for super men like me and you you
hardcore serious PC master-race demons
out there so now we're going to get
three super cards from Nvidia the 2070
super the 2060 super and in two weeks
the 2080 super now what exactly these
cards supposed to do well okay
the 2070 super card is supposed to
totally be faster than a 1080i it is
supposed to blow it completely out of
the water all I thought it was kind of
the point of the original 2070 but since
AMD says that Navia can compete with the
2070 they have to have something to say
no you cannot have that position and so
the 2070 super is what we're gonna be
checking out first today now the specs
as far as the technology goes a lot of
the things are exactly the same this
cards just overclocked more it does have
a few more cuda cores and stuff like
that so with that said let's first just
go ahead and open the box stuff up here
go ahead and pull the card out now being
that these cards all came from Nvidia
there's not gonna be a whole lot of
stuff in the box and I mean we got the
card itself obviously there is a little
bit of something in here so do you want
to use a DVI monitor there is a DVI to
display port adapter so you can just
plug this in and then use your DVI
monitor if you want to do that right
there then we've just got your basic you
know your users manuals and your how-to
blah blah blah I'm sure everybody who's
watching my videos knows how to install
a video card by now now the video card
itself visually wise this card actually
looks pretty doggone needed has two fans
on the front it's very very shiny you
can see it says our
TX 2070 super and it's kind of funny
because like a lot of people joke around
and they'll be like oh you know arc TX
means shiny stuff well guess what we'll
even the card is shiny as well now I
know the question on a lot of people's
minds is going to be okay I'll work well
how many cores you know did the 2070
have well as far as CUDA cores go there
were two thousand three hundred and four
on the 2070 there's two thousand five
hundred and sixty on the super as far as
sm cores go there were 36 on the 2070
and now there are 40 on the 2070 super
now the base clock of the 2070 was
fourteen hundred and ten megahertz the
base clock on the twenty seventy super
is sixteen hundred and five megahertz
the boost clock speed on the r-tx 2070
was sixteen hundred and twenty megahertz
while the boost clock speed on the
supercard is seventeen hundred and
seventeen megahertz
now as far as tensor flops we also see
an increase from the twenty seven we
actually see twelve more it goes from 60
on the twenty seventy to seventy two on
the twenty seventy super texture units
have also increased 144 on the twenty
seventy and 184 on the twenty seventy
super now the memory interface is the
same and it's actually been the same
with a ten seventy twenty seventy and
now the twenty seventy super that all of
them have had a 256-bit memory interface
now the other specs between the twenty
seventy and the twenty seventy super are
identical the only thing it's difference
is the max level one cache size which
went from two thousand three hundred and
four kilobytes to two thousand five
hundred 60 kilobytes the r-tx twenty
seventy and a TDP of 175 watts while the
super had a TDP of 215 watts so we're
seeing a bit of an increase there now
taking a further look at the card on the
side of the card you can see there's the
envy link which is located right here
and then down here is your power it
connections
it needs a single six pin in a single
8-pin connector make sure that your
power supply does have the right
connection so you don't have any
problems you don't plug in the card in
and getting up and going now the card
does have a very nice backplate got the
shiny little
go right there once again and this back
plate is really nice it covers the card
completely because the cooling
components in the card they do a great
job of dissipating the heat all the
heats caught up in the fans everything
inside of there and all the heating
vents and they're just executed out by
those fans and then blown out so this
card should run really cool and the
cooler the card actually runs the better
the boost is going to be so they just
place this little cap back on the side
here and we shall move to the rear i/o
now the connectivity on this card you're
gonna notice there's no DVI we talked
better that earlier you've got this
little you know a little plug right here
that plugs into the display port so you
have three display ports a single HDMI
port and you have a USB type-c now the
USB type-c currently is not really being
used for anything but as VR stuff
advances that's going to be the
connection that you could be hooking up
all your VR glasses and stuff and
hopefully the next generation of VR
stuff with these cards will be really
awesome
alright so that's what the card looks
like it's power requirements all of
those specs now let's jump in let's take
a look at the test system and then let's
check out the benchmarks and let's see
how much faster this new 2070 super card
is compared to the 2070 and the 1080 Ti
which is rumored to just blow completely
out of the water let's go now one thing
I really like about our new test system
is that it's completely open bench so
it's easy to put all the video cards and
take them on and off we've been using
systems that we built and obviously it's
a pain in the butt you guys can see this
new test system it looks really really
nice now the motherboard is the a Zeus
Maximus 10 Hero we're using an i7 8700 K
CPU we've got 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory we've got an SSD for our boot
drive and we've got a Seagate hard drive
for our major storage drive so this
thing's ready to rock and roll we've
also got a liquid cooler and we've got a
nice power supply that can handle single
card setups or SLI or crossfire we're
also running the latest anniversary
edition of Windows 10 plus all the
latest drivers that were currently
available at the time of this review now
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
check out the
benches
now all three of the cards that we
tested today ran at about the same
temperature the 2070 super and the 1080i
both ran at seventy three Celsius
centers full load and what's kind of
strange is a twenty seventy ran at
seventy four Celsius under full load
it's just one degree but it's kind of
strange so I have to say at the end of
the day I'm a little bit kind of the
confused because with the drivers that
we use do you guys can see that the
twenty seventy super really isn't
beating the 1080i it's really really
close like almost neck and neck but it's
not quite really beating it that's kind
of a little bit strange maybe it's
because the drivers we used I don't know
what to do further testing down the line
it is however faster though than the
twenty seventy and that's kind of what I
think they were kind of shooting for
because if the 499 car the knobby card
coming out from AMD is going to really
compete with that card they just want to
have a card period on the market that's
going to be at the same price and be
able to beat it and that's pretty much
what this card is about I mean they're
all really know you know great
outstanding new technical features now
I'll be make another video though soon
explaining how RT X though actually is
starting to take shape in the beginning
of RT X it was kind of forced out there
game developers kind of use it like as
an add-on but now they're actually
starting to develop games from the
ground up using RT X now these will be
fully fledged fully supported DirectX
games and the difference in those games
is going to be much more significant
than what you've seen previously we all
knew that it would take RT x a little
bit of time in the market to grow just
like physics and anything else but it is
actually starting to take hold and take
shape and if you've seen some of the
recent videos that have been out with RT
x on and RT x off the RT x technology
when used properly does look really
really nice now this card's coming to
market at $499 if that's the exact same
price that nabis coming to market well
it's going to win the only thing that
AMD can do at this point now is release
the card at 15 you know dollars less or
$100 less to be very competitive because
we all know obviously Nvidia is not
going to release
that's you know I'm not gonna beat that
this has been the tradition so like
usual one-up links down below so if you
guys want to get more information about
this card or purchase one we'll have
links down below for you guys to check
that out we'll also have links to our
music right now the new benchmark song
isn't available the old one is and we'll
have links to that's if you guys want to
check out the music and if you like to
support the channel there's a lot of
ways you can do it you can just try them
as I'm primed for free there's no money
there we also have a patreon site and if
you like what you seen you'd like to be
subbed hey we'd love to have another sub
but here at the channel and you got to
turn the notifications Abell and then
you know maybe we'll see you guys back
here on the channel I'm mark you guys
been watching ticking tomorrow peace out
we'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
