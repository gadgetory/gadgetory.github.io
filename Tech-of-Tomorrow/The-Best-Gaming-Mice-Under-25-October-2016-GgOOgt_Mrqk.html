calm /t ot gamers and yes I'd imagine if
you're watching this video that you're
obviously gamer looking for a budget
gaming mice now not all of us have big
bucks to afford the big buck mice and
for those of us on a budget having
something that's quite affordable is
quite awesome so today we're going to
start out with something called a habbit
HP ms6 72 now this is a very simple
wired mouse 2400 dpi seven soothing LED
colors six buttons it's actually the
latest model to the 2016 model but
what's best of all is this thing's on
sale right now for eight dollars and
ninety eight cents and that's just
amazing
you get precision control with four dpi
settings 800 1200 1600 2400 it's got an
ergonomic design fits pretty naturally
inside your hand as far as the design
features go the habits pretty simple on
the right hand side there's nothing but
a finger rest on the top you get two
control buttons on the right and left
and in the center you get a scroll
button that also doubles as a click and
then underneath that you get the DPI
button and as
change the DPI the colors actually
change on the mouse as well so it's a
multi-function button and on the left
hand side we get a simple thumb rest and
two more control buttons and that pretty
much wraps up the habit but if you got
to have it and you ain't got a lot of
money you can even get this on a Mickey
D's budget the tekneq Raptor gaming
mouse features 2,000 dpi six buttons and
it actually has extra weight for you
people who love an extra weighted Mouse
me personally I love a lot of weight my
mouse because I can feel it it's
actually in my hand the integrated 2000
dpi optimal Gaming sensor features three
different adjustable levels 600 1200 and
2,000 and it performs at a frame rate of
4000 frames per second to perform
flawlessly in your gaming environment
the design of the technic raptor is
pretty simple and easy it's kind of like
a lot of the other mice you see out
there it's pretty ergonomic though it'll
fit the medium-size hand no problem if
you have giant hands or really small
hands you might want to look for
something different but for those people
have a medium sized hand it fits in the
palm of your hand quite nicely
now as far as the designs go just like
the mouse we saw previously the right
hand contains nothing but a rest for
your hand in the center we once again
see two control buttons the center mouse
scrolling wheel also doubles once again
as a click button and then we see the
DPI control in the center just like most
mice and on the left hand side once
again we see a thumb rest and two
control buttons and on the bottom of the
mouse you can simply see the optical
sensor and that's really about all there
is the Technic Raptor gaming mouse but
the best thing of all is that it's also
on sale right now you can get this mouse
for only nine dollars and eighty nine
cents and that's definitely within
anybody's budget now this next Mouse is
kind of a strange little bit of an
animal now this is the X being XM three
to six wired USB Gaming Mouse with
rainbow breathing lights now this thing
features the a350 chip features 4000 dpi
six buttons and it's white and I got to
be honest with you
out of all the ones we looked at today
this is actually my favorite the colors
on and everything are really cool if you
guys like Tron type designer like that
futuristic thing this is actually
perfect for it a long time ago I built
the Tron system I'm going to actually
build my next Tron system and I'm going
to throw this mouse into the mix because
it looks so awesome
most of the gaming mice you'll see out
there are just completely plug and play
but this mouse allows you to install the
Avago a
8050 game engine and this actually helps
a performance quite a bit but for those
out there who don't like installing a
driver whatsoever this may be a cabbie
it for you if you don't have a CD player
or something like that but for me it was
pretty easy the XM three to six also has
4 adjustable dpi levels all the way from
500 up to 4000 and it has six buttons
for control but best of all I think that
it has a weight of 160 grams and this is
perfect for people out there like I said
who like a heavier Mouse in their hand
not only does the XM three to six have a
really cool look it also has some
excellent lighting effects you guys can
see on each side of the mouse there are
some mechanical wheels and these things
light up with a bunch of different
effects including breathing and stuff
like that so if you like a mouse that
looks good and has killer lighting
effects this is something to look at now
as far as the overall quality build to
the mouse it feels pretty solid it's not
actually as heavy as I'd like it to be I
wish it was just a little bit heavier
and then it'd be perfect for me but
beyond that it's pretty good design
overall there's nothing different about
the layout of the buttons on the X M
three to six it's pretty much just like
all the other mice you're going to see
out there the only difference is like I
said on the left hand and the right hand
side you're going to see a little
mechanical wheel that lights up as we
put the mouse on top we see two control
buttons on the left and right in the
center is a scroll wheel which also once
again doubles as a click below that we
see the adjustable dpi button and as we
flip it over the left hand side we once
again see the mechanical wheel to click
buttons and a thumb rest and as we flip
it over on its back hand side you guys
can see there are a couple slide pads
for smooth and easy tracking there's
also an on and off button and then you
guys see the sensor and that's pretty
much all there is to the XM three to six
but like I said this thing's on sale for
forty seven dollars off right now that's
seventy eight percent off and it's only
$12.99 so if you're looking for
something that's really cool different
the XM three to six just might be right
for you the YCC team Gaming Mouse is
something that looks very familiar to me
I know many you guys out there who've
been game you're gonna say hey I've seen
that before because this design has
actually been out for quite a while but
when it first came out these mice for
about a hundred and fifty dollars and
that's just why I this mouse is only
twenty three ninety-nine it has all
those same features as those big
expensive ones but in a much cheaper
package now this mouse features an
adjustable 4000 dpi 10 programmable but
that's right I said ten programmable
buttons and it's got the perfect hand
feel I don't know most mice out there
have a totally different feel to this if
you've ever used something like this
before you'll agree this thing's in a
league all of its own
the only thing is though is to use these
buttons on your PC you're going to have
to install the drivers that might be a
caveat to some to me it doesn't mean
anything
the tempo gramma buttons can be very
useful for taking control of your game
you can actually use the software to
assign programmable features to the
precision aim button that way you can
make that headshot
when it counts headshot you can also
customize your dpi settings there are
actually four usable definable dpi
settings up to four thousand and the DPI
button also lets you easily cycle
through your custom settings there are
also quite a few LED light effects now
some people may not care about these at
all but for people who do there's a
programmable LED light effect it
features 3 mode light effect standard
respiration and neon you can also change
the backlit of the mouse to anything you
want either blue green red purple etc
and the LED light can also be turned off
if you find it annoying there are 10
programmable buttons but actually only 9
of those buttons are for controlling
your end game experience the 10th one is
actually for controlling the lights now
the lad is as follows on the right hand
side no control just a finger rest as we
put the mouse on top on the right hand
side we see two of the mouse buttons one
on top one the silver on the bottom one
in the center as a scroll wheel the
adjustable dpi down below that then once
again we see two on the left hand side
and as we flip the mouse over to the
left hand side we can see the last three
the programmable buttons - down below
where your thumb rest goes and then one
located on the side right below the top
click button and on the bottom we see
the sensor and the on and off button for
the LED one thing you definitely don't
have to worry about with this mouse is
it breaking on you this thing's made of
a solid lightweight aluminum chassis
Xand its strong yet nimble at the same
time one thing different about the YCC
team Gaming Mouse is that it's
definitely for a bigger hand as it's
much bigger than any other mice that
we're looking at
today as far as durability and options I
have to say at the YCC team Gaming Mouse
is probably the best of the bunch at $24
it's definitely worth the money
this next mouse by IOGEAR offers
something unique that we haven't seen
today and that's an ambidextrous Gaming
Mouse so that means all you southpaw is
out there can use this mouse just as
well as those right-handed bastards and
this is the IOGEAR caliber gaming
symmetric like I said ambidextrous
Gaming Mouse the actual model number is
the GME 630 this thing has a very very
nice feel my eyes when I say that right
off the bat and of all the mice that are
here although I like some further looks
some for their features as far as just
fitting in the hand the most comfortable
this is a very nice product
now the caliber features an adjustable
4000 dpi optical sensor it also has nine
programmable buttons and it has its own
custom programmable software that you
can install on your PC to be up and
gaming it features a blue LED backlight
and it also features that breathing
effect kind of like Darth Vader light I
have you now the caliber also features a
64 K built in memory and has 125 500 and
a thousand adjustable report rate and it
also features a 6600 frame per second
frame rate which means you never have to
worry about your mouse keeping up with
your game the lighting effects in the
caliber are pretty simple you guys can
see it's just a simple blue lighting
design that's on the bottom the right
left hand side the design is also very
similar to most the other mice we've
seen today as far as the button layout
goes in the caliber you see two buttons
on the right hand side two buttons on
the left hand side on the top we see two
control buttons scroll wheel which also
doubles as a click and then below that
the adjustable dpi button and on the
bottom on the right hand side we see the
reporting rate button in the center we
see the sensor and best of all this
Mouse is only 24 and 95 and even though
we have this with the budget Gaming
Mouse I have to say that the IOGEAR
caliber is definitely not quite a budget
Gaming Mouse it's just a slightly cut
above like usual have all the
information about these mice down below
like button you guys know what to do
there and we'll see you guys back in the
channel for more videos more cool stuff
and even some giveaways so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
