nil-nil lamb
hey what's up very out there in YouTube
land it's me Elroy Pharisee latekka
tomorrow YouTube channel today i am a TC
Helicon to take a look at their new
voice live play effect what this does is
for you singers out there this is an
easy way for you guys just click a
button and get lots of effects I'm here
with Craig and he's going to give us a
quick demo of this great new product how
you doing great good man how are you I'm
doing pretty good excellent
so this thing is basically made for the
vocalists who just wants to have
everything simple on a one click button
thing right absolutely yeah it's got
seven effects in the box that you can
turn on or off that will save them
however you want so you can make it
sound exactly like the song you wanted
to some sound like name it the way you
want it so if it's your own original
song it can actually name it that way
and then when you want to get back to
it's just one click of the button to get
to it and all your up the graces so I
know like in the old days I've used some
of your stuff and it was like pretty
hard to program for I'm supposed to be
really easy so that even the average Joe
can walk up hit a button on it choose
what they want dial it in and save it
right exactly we made a lot of these
presets after songs and artists that
people already know so think right out
of the box there's a whole bunch of
tunes that they can go right to and
actually get the sound of a song they
know so like this we got American greedy
American Idiot by green area right so
you can go right into that now you're
saying we can get seven layers of sound
the one that's so seven different
effects you can mix so chorusing
modulation flange ignite kind of stuff
delay reverb harmony transducer which is
megaphone effects and stuff and a heart
tune of course which is the auto tune
alright so all the way from sounding
like a robot to sounding multiple voices
to everything right absolutely yeah and
then the harmonies in there of course
sound great you know what are you in a
three-part harmony is pretty pretty
sweet so inside the box I'm just going
to go back to all here inside the box
there's literally 235 presets right out
of the gate but of course sometimes you
want to sort through those in some sort
of way that you know make sense to you
so we set up the genre button
Jonas do we have in your lie the others
18 18 Jonathan and yes genre has a
selection within them as well right
exactly so each genre will then break
out into all the pop songs in the box
all this all this the the effects that
have say echo or r2 and you can actually
sort through them you can see so it as I
get down here if I just wanted all the
pretense of that harmony in them I'd
select that back out and then now you'll
see the numbers jump quite a bit because
it's just the ones that have harmony
that are associating with that
particular genre and that's all that I
see in them all we're looking at right
now these are all pretty much the rock
genre right these are the harmony ones
but there is a rock genre in there as
well yeah let's get a rock there it is
so yeah so you got walking on the Sun
you got Beverly Hills by Weezer you know
so like a lot of like a lot of fools so
that people are already using in the
industry
you guys are incorporated in a preset
there's somebody wanted you so they
could exactly and it's a great
jumping-off point you know for somebody
who has to use vocal effects before they
can kind of sound like the artist that
they like and that they know and then
modify their sound from there and then
save it with another total copycat are
these are close to what they're looking
for exactly what about the setup and
effects but let's talk about those ropes
sure so set up it's just all the basic
you know input/output all the setting
for there's a looper in here as well so
settings for how the looper works
basically just all your system settings
so with a looper thing little quick
break that's kind of like you could have
your own karaoke or like it you practice
vocal starter songs the looper is like
where you maybe do a beatbox with your
voice and then loop it over and over and
over again then add another layer of
vocals on top of that okay so you a
vocal layering actually through the
mushaf itself let's add a couple of
buttons here like that and then it goes
into loop mode and you can record the
loop so you'd be doing your beatbox
exactly and then you play it back and
it's gonna hey-hey-hey-hey and then
you'd add something else on top of that
and yeah yeah it's pretty neat so we got
Beverly Hills by Weezer that really
Hills by Weezer Beverly here what about
you know walking on the sand right well
King on the Sun I don't know what I'll
be walking on the Sun the man has got me
walking on the Sun on the Sun just a me
walking on the Sun what else we got in
here don't stand so close to me please
