gone through a lot of mouse pads in your
life as a gamer let's just face it when
you're a gamer mouse pads do not last
they get all flimsy they get dirty they
break apart you know I'm just tossing
those things in the trash can because
they're just not high quality made well
of course there's introduced something a
little bit different it's the MM 1000
and it's a lot different in many ways
first of all the surface of it is
completely made of a textured surface
that's made for picking up your sensor
and being accurate on its resolution so
that's something kind of different
there have been mouse pads in the past
that are similar to this but this is
their take on this type of thing now
what's kind of cool though is is it also
features Wireless key target
into the mouse pad plus all the
different types of USB so it doesn't
matter what type of device that you have
you'll be able to charge it one way or
another on the MM 1000 so with that said
though let's unbox it let's check it out
and see what it's all about on the front
of the box there's not much you guys
just see it has the nomenclature the MM
1000 I'm gonna go ahead and just pop the
cap on here and then we can see inside
right off the bat we can see the
accessories all the different adapters
everything right up here on top so you
get all three get these little things
out here all three little adapters one
two three and the dog is pushing me soon
as he's next to me he's finally waking
up so we get three adapters right there
I'm gonna go ahead and set those just
off to the side here and then we have
the mousepad
it's 70 pull this thing out of here all
right so there's the adapters
there's the mousepad there's the manual
more paperwork a warranty guy let me
pull stuff over here so you guys can see
it so all this stuff is all inside of
there and then we have the mousepad
itself now you guys can see this surface
is very very durable I mean honestly
this thing feels pretty pretty tough you
have a little plug over here on the back
right here this is where the USB is all
the key charging is actually built into
the mousepad itself so that's pretty
elegant
on the backside it's got a totally
non-slip pad so when it sticks on your
debts it's not gonna go move it around
and sliding on you you've got your power
cable with two different USB connections
one obviously to power the unit the
other for the USB pass-through cable so
that's pretty much it as far as going
and the use of it I haven't actually got
that far with it because I just want to
show you guys the unboxing and take a
first look but let's go ahead just peel
this tape off of here
and check that out
so VMM 1,000 is also a perfect match for
the brand-new k63 wireless mouse it's
very very durable so obviously this
particular mousepad is not going to
break on you it's gonna be pretty hard
to break and it should be pretty durable
as well it doesn't look like the pad
itself is actually removable because
it's just completely hard but the way
that's made it should last for years and
years and years the only thing might
ever break on you if possible would be
the cable but since this is a very high
quality braided cable I don't think
it'll be breaking on you anytime soon so
these things are about 80 bucks so if
you're looking for a mousepad that not
only has a very nice surface to capture
all of your tracking accurately has key
charging built-in and you can charge any
other device that has to do with USB
then hey the MM 1000 you might just want
to check it out I'm the Ark you guys
been watching tikka tomorrow like usual
the like button we will have a link to
hopefully somewhere you can buy this
thing or just check out more information
for yourself but honestly if you're just
looking for something that'll last a
long time even beyond this the charging
and all that stuff this is a lot better
than your standard mouse pad there's no
like foam or any that material to roll
up and like you know if sometimes you
get a mouse and mouse pad it's all
rolled up and you try to lay it down it
doesn't even really lay flat you'll
never have any type of problem
whatsoever with this I'm gonna be doing
a bunch of testing let me just get out a
camera here for a second I've got I'll
show it to you guys next but the next
video we'll be doing is going to be the
k63 and its entire wireless environment
so it involves a nice little things you
can sit inside your lap and put your
keyboard in it and from your mouse it
fits very comfortably on your lap so if
you want to have a completely wireless
gaming system for your living room it's
pretty awesome but
the next video but I want to try this
too and see how it tracks so peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
