tech o tomorrow you guys know me and you
guys can see right behind me I have the
latest greatest 21 inch iMac now this
thing features an i5 2.7 processor 640 m
graphics comes with 8 gigabytes of
memory installed which you can upgrade
just slightly and today we're gonna show
you guys a little bit something
different now we know that most people
who go out there and they buy IMAX and
stuff they're not true gamers we know
the people that buy the iMac some were
for productivity but that said still
some people like to have fun and play
games right I mean why not you can and
we are going to we've installed Windows
8 on this machine back behind us and
we're gonna be playing Borderlands 2 now
a lot of you guys have been following
the channel know that a long time ago I
had a little tiny AV a direct laptop it
was a total gaming laptop well pretty
much the specs are almost identical
beyond this really nice 1920 by 1080
screen they're really very much the same
I mean obviously this one came running
you know the iMac OS but beyond that
specs are really close so with that said
let's jump in now and let's play
Borderlands 2 and just see how it does
alright folks so here we are in game
Borderlands 2 one of the funnest damn
games I've played in years now we all
know like we said earlier that things
not really geared for playing games but
you can see we're getting on medium
settings on 1920 by 1080 about 20 24
frames per second
now if you set the settings down below
you'll get much fire now you guys know
this thing's not totally geared for
gaming but look we are gaming we're
bouncing around we're killing things you
can see it still looks good a lot of
people talk major and they go oh my
god anything under 30 frames per second
and then we've got to cry wolf but look
we're playing you guys can see it
there's not too much lag and while I'm
sitting in front of this thing killing
people I don't know is anything bad
about it no obviously any gamer worth
his salt is gonna go out and probably
build themselves their own system not
too many gamers unless they're really
new into the game will go line up just
buy a system built by somebody else but
with that said if you're somebody who
still wants the productivity of the Mac
OS and still be able to gain by
installing the Windows OS you can do
that very simply here this thing is also
very very lightweight and a lot of
differences between this one in previous
generations all the other ones when I
play games on them got hot as babe
now you guys don't want to say there
this one doesn't get hot at all I can
touch the back of the screen touch it
and everything stays remarkably cool so
that's a really good thing as well
alright so there you guys have it man
killing on Borderlands 2 on the new
21 inch iMac I mean it can be done you
know the resolution you know is OK the
graphics you know the frame rates
they're not the most ultimate in the
world but you guys know why that is so
let me hear your thoughts would you guys
like to see more gaming on this would
you guys like me to do some more stuff
like that let me know in your comments
below and see what you guys think I hope
you guys liked this video if so hit that
like button and show me some love
and also if you're not subscribed make
sure you do so because you guys know
that from now on every week we're gonna
have a surprise giveaway that's right
we're just gonna randomly pick one of
our fans and give them something cool so
with that said we'll see you back here
in TECO tomorrow tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
