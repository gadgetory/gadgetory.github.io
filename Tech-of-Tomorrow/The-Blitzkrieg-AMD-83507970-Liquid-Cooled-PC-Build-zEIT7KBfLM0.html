to tech of tomorrow I'm not a fair share
host so we bring you all the tech all
the time now in an effort to find out
more about AMD CPUs and really compare
them we went and we built a full-blown
AMD system that's sitting right behind
me and it's called the Blitzkrieg now
this thing's pretty cool you guys can
see it all comes in the brand new
thermal take a level-10 GT their
military green case this is on the
outside this thing's actually a pretty
cool system we've done slight mods to it
now I know some people when you watch
the video you're gonna combat and say oh
terrible camera management it's like huh
I'm gonna be completely honest with you
you can see the side of the case is on
here right well this is how it's gonna
be
do you see any cables because I'm gonna
defend that right now there's no reason
for me to spend six hours making all my
cables in my system disappear when I'm
putting the side-door on and can't see
them anyways I feel cable management is
just fine for this system you see in the
window everything's nice and clean when
it lights up Hey
to me that's clean but with that said
let's jump in and let's see what this
system is all about
all right folks so now let's delve in
right off the bat you can see that we're
using the level 10 GT military green
from the people over at thermaltake you
can see how long it's nice all on the
outside got some pretty funny stuff on
like a first-aid kit on the side door
that's pretty much a crack up I think
then we'll go across the top here you
guys you got USB 3.0 fan control you can
also change the colors of the case by
the little control on the top here as
well look here on the back of the case
you guys can see that we've done a
slight mod instead of having the
standard gigabyte rear i/o that
everything all colored we painted it
black to make it match with the military
theme of the bill so now as we jump
inside the case you guys can see there's
a bunch of black tubing and everything
running around the inside of the case
well this is all the cooling from the
people ad Swift tank
we're running there apogee drive -
that's the water block and pump this is
part of the h2o 220 elite system we're
also using the Komodo 7970 water block
to keep this system up and running cool
we're also using the gigabyte GA 990 FX
AUD 5 motherboard now as far as the CPU
goes we're using the new AMD 80 350 F X
this is an 8 core processor really well
priced and we're hoping to get some
great numbers with it we're running 16
gigabytes of the Kingston 2133 a hyper X
beast memory the video card even though
you can't see it it's a reference XFX
7970 and three gigabyte card being
cooled off by the Komodo the power
supply is also from thermal tank it's
the 750 watt Evo blue 2.0 at the very
top of the case you can see that we've
mounted the Swift up radiator the only
custom mod that we really had to do on
this particular part was drill a fill
hole on the top you don't have to do
this if you want to just go ahead and
refill it up but we like to completely
test the system drain it out put it in
and fill it again that's what we did
that does require a slight mod as far as
the hard drives we're using three hard
drives in this build the first hard
drive is the crucial m4 they're 256
gigabyte model I have this hooked up to
the controller that's off the AMD the
other two are 2 kingston 240 gigabyte
hyper x drives I have these drives in
raid 0 and I have them run
the second dairy Marvel controller I'm
also running an LG blu-ray / actually HD
combo drive it's an older one but I
still have some old movies so that's
what I'm using for the drive alright
folks so there you guys have it the
Blitzkrieg system like usual I know a
lot of people always like to leave cable
management comments I addressed that in
the intro and you guys can see once I
have the door closed you cannot see any
of that so why even complain at all
beyond that I'm very happy with this
system I've installed Windows 8 on it
and I've got to tell you this thing has
been playing every game I have thrown at
it with butter I'm gonna be bringing you
guys a series of videos as I play on
this machine game on this machine and
then compare it against the Intel
product to see if there actually is any
difference at all in true gaming like
usual I hope you guys like this video if
so show me that virtual love and hit
that like button and if you're not
subscribed please do so because we
always have cool stuff here on tech of
tomorrow see you guys back here on the
channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
