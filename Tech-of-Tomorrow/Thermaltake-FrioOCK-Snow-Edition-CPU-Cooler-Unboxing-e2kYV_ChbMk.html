the Sunday edition of tech of tomorrow
now usually we give you guys the
full-blown Sunday edition update though
we do something a little bit different
now so we're gonna do an unboxing the
product today and we're gonna look at
the thermal take this is the free o OC
case no Edition Gore pretty cool thing
but I'll give you guys weeks wrap up
anyways because the really important
things that happened well we reviewed
the latest maximus v extreme thunder
effects motherboard this thing is
totally decked out and has a really
great board you guys should check that
out also had a release of a new AMD card
coming out this is their new 7870 card
you guys aren't gonna want to miss that
those are pretty much the highlight so
the real excitement that happened in the
child this week but for now let's take a
look at this
Frio Ock features dual 133 millimeter
fans six six millimeter pipes and it'll
fit on any type of thing that Sarah's
out there so if you have an AMD board
you have an Intel board this thing will
fit on it's a multi socketed bad boy so
with that said let's jump in let's do
the unboxing let's check out the Frio
Ock snow edition alright folks like any
good unboxing I'm gonna actually just
show you the box so here we see it the
Frio Ock you can see 240 watts it's
pretty much for every CPU that's out
there here we see the thing where I
talked about earlier there's 230
millimeter fans six heat pipes fits any
socket that there is I'll flip it around
real quick to show you guys the back of
the box where talks about that stuff
smart thermal management system you guys
can see some pictures down here of it
but we're gonna show you that now here
are the actual specs you guys can see as
we go down the box beige is telling you
the overall stuff you guys all know what
coolers are so this just giving you some
specifics so with that said let's
actually take a look at the product cuz
that's what we're all here for so I
don't even need a knife in this unboxing
I really wish I did because they're fun
but on this way
you know just right here click and then
a pop and then we see right here we have
the accessory package so I'll spin the
box around so we get a better look at
that so we're out the bat you open it up
you have the accessory package which
obviously contains all the accessories
and mounting equipment and then the free
OC case no Edition the installation
guide and then further installation
guide in other languages so that way if
you're another country or something else
you'll still be able to see it last but
not least there's a little warranty
package now real quick I'm just going to
set this off to the side bang in here
let's just take a look at the accessory
package since we have it out here let's
see what all comes in this little bad
boy which is actually tucked in there
pretty tight like little sardines Oh
actually they've done this quite nicely
folks let's take a look up here on top
see a backplate and then check this out
everything else is actually in here
underneath the plastic cover
so everything's actually very very well
laid out here folks check that out
everything you needs all in there
including your thermal paste everything
simple to take out and begin the
installation process so let's go ahead
and we'll move that out of the way and
then let's take a look at the unit
itself I pull this thing out alright so
let's start off with this one we'll
start off at the bottom of the unit here
you guys can see they have no paste on
this they just have their seal right
here which you can see is completely
unbroken here are one two three four
five six these are the six millimeter
heat pipes that we talked about earlier
you can also see those already up into a
bunch of fins these also help to
dissipate the heat away from your CPU
now obviously these things white you
guys can see out into the snow edition
flip it around up here to the top flip
up so you guys get a better view there's
lights and stuff that actually light up
here are one of the fans these are a
hundred and thirty millimeter fans one
on this side and again another one on
the other side
around to show you guys that another
view angled view here the connection
it's all stuck inside of here two
different connections here right here is
your fan controller move it up and down
this will make your fan speed slow up
and slow down and then your pwm
connector right there now a lot of
people asked about cooling fans and the
differences amount a you guys aren't off
what I think is a big difference the big
rooms from is is how loud you got to be
I mean will this thing work efficiently
with the fans turned on low or do you
guys turn the fans on the full-blown to
make a lot of noise to cool it up those
are the main things
all right everybody so there you have it
the free oh oh ck I like to call it the
free och now you guys might be wondering
why there was no normal Sunday edition
well for one thing
Biff Baxter that mother just didn't show
up for work now you know it's a sad day
in hell when your alter ego doesn't even
show up for work I mean isn't that just
piss poor worth ethic I mean seriously
anyways folks check it out like I said
earlier a lot of difference between
these coolers is how loud do you really
have to turn up the fans for them to
cool efficiently in different countries
means different things if you go to
Germany I don't care how well it cools
it fits loud they're gonna give it a
thumbs down and say it stinks they like
everything to be silent now here in
America we like to overclock the holy
frak out of so for us we just want
to be the most efficient we care about
noise but noise level isn't the end-all
be-all for us and we do our reviews when
we do our testing so now I'm going to go
ahead and throw this in the test station
in the other room we'll see how it works
and we'll come back to it for that guys
I hope you guys liked the video hit that
