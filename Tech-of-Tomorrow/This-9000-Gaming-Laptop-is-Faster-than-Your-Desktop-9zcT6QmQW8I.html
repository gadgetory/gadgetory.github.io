we're back here on TECA tomorrow I'm
Eric your host and CES is on and there
is a lot of crazy stuff going on there
now even though I wasn't actually able
to go there because I've a cut in my
foot my homie Jon from TLD he has got me
some footage so this is going to be
pretty awesome so let's start off by
showing you some of the latest products
by Acer which are actually pretty
incredible in fact they have like you
know this seriously affordable laptop
it's just you know slightly under 10k ah
nah but this is the Acer X 21 predator
it's the world's first curved screen
monitor that's right man
a curved screen monitor let's check this
bad boy out because it's incredible
starting off it as a 21 inch screen now
the county of this though is that it
only has a 2560 by 1080 resolution now
obviously you get a 120 Hertz refresh
rate you get SLI from the built-in to
1080 cards and these 1080 cards are no
longer mobile versions these are
full-fledged 1080s with all the goodness
coming to you in SLI so what the hell
this monitor should at least add 1440 or
4k but nope it's only 1080 but the
design is incredible it has a mechanical
keyboard every individual key is RGB lit
which is really amazing the keypad also
doubles the trackpad all you do is
remove it and turn it upside down and
replace it and you can use it as two
different things now this also has G
sync technology which means that all of
your games are going to be running at
120 Hertz and it's going to be
crystal-clear so it's going to be pretty
crazy stuff for you gamers out through
11 video and I drew off the absolute
craziest best this is going to be what
it is although it's crazy price there
are five internal system fans nine heat
pipes four speakers two subwoofers and
getting crazy it has two power supplies
that's right this dang thing takes two
power supplies which means you've got to
find two wallets to power this bad boy I
don't think you're going to be using any
portable power here now obviously
something of this caliber is going to
weigh quite a bit this thing comes in
the market at just under 20 pounds
the power behind the predator is Intel
seventh generation Core i7 78 28 K
processor there's 64 gigabytes of ddr4
2400 memory and you can put up to four
512 gigabytes solid-state drives in raid
zero inside this system and an
additional drive as well that's totally
crazy and I don't know if any of you
folks ever got to see this before but
Toby I tracking is really incredible
stuff we got to experiment with it a lot
in the last couple of CES and the
technology behind it was just really
cool for people who have disabilities
and stuff like that this is going to
take this laptop over the top because
now can be used by regular folks as well
as disabled folks and that's just badass
the Acer predator X 21 really reads like
a gamer's dream book the 2560 by 1080
resolution I feel it for 10k you should
get better than that but with all those
options and the very fact I mean oh
that's a mistake or not but you can only
use up to 512 gigabyte SSD drives why
not one terabyte drives or even some of
the bigger ones so I'm kind of like a
little bit on the fence about those
things but beyond that you guys can see
the world's first curved screen features
just up the yin-yang if you've got the
cash and you want the absolute best well
this is it but how about if you've only
got about 1,200 bucks let's check out
the Acer Aspire 5 now this is the
updated version and it's got some pretty
cool features but it's a lot smaller and
a lot cheaper
the Nitro is ideal for graphics heavy
content creation editing or gaming now
depending on the model you get they'll
either include an nvidia geforce gtx
1060 or 1050 Ti both those are good
cards you can also get a seventh
generation Intel Core I processor and up
to 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory but what
I got to say to you guys this is really
funny you can get a 3840 by 2160 4k
model in the smaller one so you buy 10 K
you get 10 80 but if you buy for 1,200
bucks you get 4k let's check out their
latest monitor last year we saw a lot of
Acer predator monitors now we're going
to check out the Z 301 C T now the Acer
predator Z 301 C
it's an ultra-wide gaming monitor now
Acer claims that the Acer predator Z 301
CT display is the pinnacle of gaming
immersion and they have evidence to back
this up because they won the CES 2017
best of innovations award in the
computer peripherals category the specs
in the Z 301 however are really nice you
get a pixel resolution of 2560 by 1080 a
21-2 9 aspect ratio and 1800 are curved
screen 200 Hertz refresh rate with
Nvidia g-sync technology
Tobi eye tracking and a 4 millisecond
response time you also get an ergonomic
tilt and - justement up to 4.7 inches
and it also has 2 3 watt speakers all
built in so you don't have to do
anything else to get up and go alright
folks so there you have it our first
video of the coverage of CES 2017
featuring the latest products from Acer
I gotta say that monitoring 10k it looks
pretty incredible I ain't got the cash
the Z 301 that is going to be a really
nice monitor I can't wait to get my
hands and then have it right here in my
house to test and play with I think you
guys are gonna be waiting for that as
well and that notebook at $1,200 the
fact that you can get that in 4k but you
can't get the $10,000 won in 4k just not
computing with me I'm at work
you guys been watching teka tomorrow
we've got more information down below so
if you guys want to get even more
information about these products you can
check that out down there we're going to
be having CES coverage for the next few
days so stick around and we'll bring you
more stuff from this year's CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
