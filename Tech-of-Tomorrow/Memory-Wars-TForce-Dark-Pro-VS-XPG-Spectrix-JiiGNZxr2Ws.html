you guys back here once again now we all
know that memory prices have been very
stiff lately and most people when they
go out and buy memory I think they try
to just find the stuff that's the very
cheapest to stick inside of their
computer but other people go out and
spend a lot of money buying the very
fastest memory that there is now
is there really a big difference though
between buying the entry-level memory
and buying super duper high in memory I
mean is the speed performance at the end
of the day really worth your cash I mean
do you really want to go out and spend
the money on this stuff when we took two
sets of memory and took them
head-to-head the first one is the xpg
spectryx memory now this is set at 3000
megahertz ddr4 memory it's a 16 gigabyte
kit and also features RGB so if you're
into the flashing colors you might
really like this memory and it's only
about a hundred and eighty bucks so it's
still pretty decently priced now next to
that we have some totally different
memory now this is from the team group
people and this is their dart Pro memory
series and this stuff is set at three
thousand four hundred and sixty-six
megahertz
now both of these sets of memory do
contain the XMP memory profile but the
particular motherboard that we're using
this is the Asus this is their crosshair
Hero seven motherboard it does not
support XMP profiles and if you don't
know what an XMP profile is on MSI
motherboards on gigabyte motherboards on
most a lot of the other motherboards you
can go in and set an XMP profile this
automatically sets the memory to its
absolute best settings it's very easy
it's thoughtless and if you don't know
if you have XMP memory check it out and
make sure you go into your BIOS and make
sure you set your profile to XMP because
that will give you the best performance
that you're going to be able to get
on the crosshair hero seven however all
you do is go in and you set your target
memory speed so if you buy memory that's
three thousand four hundred six six
megahertz you just go in you easily set
the target speed to this and as long as
it's you know meant to run at that speed
it boots up runs no problem we had no
problem studying the first memory at
three thousand megahertz and then we
changed it out to the two other stuff we
changed to three thousand four hundred
sixty six megahertz and everything ran
without a problem at all now for you
fans who follow the channel you probably
saw the video that we did just a few
days ago this was the 8700 K versus the
brand new AMD risin this was the 2700 X
and you guys saw that they went almost
head-to-head and just about everything
that there was now that particular
system is the system that we're actually
using in today's video so if you guys
want to actually check out that system
and how it did we'll have a link down
there below where you guys can check
that out and see the system for yourself
but with that said in real-world testing
and just doing stuff we do here at a
bunch of different simulations and
testing and did some games let's see if
there really is a difference between
faster memory or just your standard
memory let's check it out
so the real question you have to ask
yourself at the end of the day after
seeing the test scores and everything is
is it worth it to spend like 50 or $100
more for faster memory because let's
just face it you may be getting 1 to 5%
performance gain if you're especially if
you're a gamer you guys can see there's
really no difference whatsoever now
there are instance instances excuse me
where faster memory definitely comes
into play say that you're a musician in
a recording studio and you're using all
kinds of virtual instruments so if
you're using all kinds of virtual
instruments you want the very fastest
memory that you can get because it
actually helps the sound quality come
through much cleaner without any warble
Nisour anything in it so having really
fast memory in that situation is good
also if you're someone who renders stuff
if you're gonna be rendering stuff all
day long and working with your computer
then yes definitely probably having some
faster memory even that small
performance advantage you're going to
get is going to be worth it overall in
the long run because it's going to be
saving you time but if you're a gamer I
would just suggest getting probably
unless you're going to be just
overclocking the total hell out of your
system now for an overclocker as well
yes and you want everything in your
system overclock then sure getting
faster memory is probably cool because
then you have your a whole system
overclock but if you're just a guy who
gets on his computer games like hell
lives through the day to have fun
probably your best bet is just getting
some standard memory because the
performance you know it you know
differences are really not that much and
let's just face it if you're a gamer you
want to save your money
for your video card first off then your
CPU and then maybe getting yourself a
giant SSD to store all that stuff on but
spending frivolous money on really fast
memory just to like say hey I have
faster memory and I really don't think
it makes you know too much difference
whatsoever you guys can see from the
tests that
we ran that only in certain really
instances is the memory going to really
show a performance gain and even if you
know if it does give you that
performance gain if you're not taking
advantage of that particular thing over
and over and over again to make it worth
your cash then really saving your money
to buy something else in your computer
is definitely the smarter move I'm Mel
look you guys been watching techo
tomorrow like usual we'll have links to
both these sets of memory down below
like I said before though we could not
find the particular memory that we were
talking about from the dark Pro that
currently right now I do not think is
available but we'll have something
similar down below for you to check out
so if you're just looking for
differences in speed you can do that and
like I did say before that xpg memory it
has LED flashing lights and looks pretty
cool as well so peace we'll see you guys
here in the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
