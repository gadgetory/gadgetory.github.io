here at now checking them all in star
Ackerman we're going to be taking a look
at two of the latest products from Ike a
multimedia this is there a loud and I
loud mini speakers now these things are
portable great for the person looking to
take their studio on the road so start
put some of the great things about these
new products well my loud is a Bluetooth
speaker and you say okay there's a lot
of Bluetooth speakers on the market well
this particular Bluetooth speaker is
really loud really loud musicians want
to hear things loud they're like it what
so we say go i loud or go home exactly
so you get two models too right this is
the big brother right well this is the
hi loud and that governments with 40
watts of power so it's it's loud runs on
batteries
it runs on a rechargeable ion battery or
you can do a DC power adapter in it is
more like a studio monitor it has a flat
frequency response so it's made for a
musician so so you can travel around
with it and actually I have more of a
true representation of the natural stone
wherever you go it's also blue through
speakers if you just really want to
listen with music with your phone that's
really loud from your kitchens here
whatever or like for musician filming
their own video they go buddy on the on
the set or whatever you want to get your
music you get this thing in here your
music and sing along to it right right
on and I think even great for video
editing
to have the true representation of the
sound rolling on the back of the unit
this is where it gets the best
you have an input here the high ORAC
circuitry is built into right here so
you can plug directly in with your
guitar or bass or a keyboard or vocal
solution yeah or your tonight dynamic
microphones direct in and then you can
have it a stage and so it also has its
own separate gain so you can control the
game you have bluetooth um are there any
kind of effects at all built-in if you
want them for vocal guitars it pretty
much just natural all the way around be
a direct impact you have to if you
really want to use it to the best of its
ability you would you know you would be
plugging you would be using it with one
of these iOS devices or your Android
device or something like that and making
the music come closer about here so in
theory it would be plugged into your IR
HD with your guitar into your iPad and
then go who to about two or even plug
your guitar into one of your effects and
then into this as well correct you can
do that as well all right now this thing
has a little brother as well let's go
take a look at that one all right so now
we've moved around the booth here and
now we have the I loud mini the little
brother to the iLab so start tell us a
little about the little brother but it's
just a little bit smaller more compact
and three times as powerful a full out
as loud as anything on the market at 12
watts it does just easily Bluetooth pair
right at the top and it will retail for
149 does it also have the same
connectivity as the Big Brother as far
as guitars and all so it's just straight
advice for listening to your music and
stuff like just a studio monitor
same frequency response so that same
great sound just with a little bit less
so okay so you people out there who want
to know more about Ike a multimedia get
starring them some love but make sure
