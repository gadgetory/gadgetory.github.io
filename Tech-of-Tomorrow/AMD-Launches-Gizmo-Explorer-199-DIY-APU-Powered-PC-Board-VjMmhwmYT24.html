one gigabyte of 1066 ddr3 all pretty
powerful stuff you also get say two
ports and other connections that you
would not get on the other little four

an entire batch of kid and tools to make
it a very robust thing for you to use I
mean for 199 bucks it's kind of a really
expensive toy you know for its kids I

this thing totally screwing around
pushing it to its limits seeing what it
can do it at one hundred and ninety-nine
