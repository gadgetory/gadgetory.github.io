i'm sure the vast majority of you are
aware the titanfall beta started this
past friday and while it was originally
planned to be a close to beta 3 out the
company decided you know what let's just
open this thing up and really stress
test the servers so as of saturday
evening it's been open for everyone and
if you haven't got the chance at you
really should hop on and try it because
honestly this is the most fun I've had
in fps in a long time now I'll tell you
why today on tech of tomorrow
now I know not everyone's going to agree
with me on this point but personally
I've just gotten really tired of the
modern military FPS trend that's been
going on the past couple of years now
that there haven't been some good ones
in the past or even recently it's just
that there's been so many of them back
to back every year or by early that are
very similar to one another there might
be better graphics and a couple new
features and some balance changes but
it's just been very much like playing
the same or very similar games every
year and I've been really craving for
something different out of a big-budget
FPS multiplayer game and if the beta is
any indication of how the final product
will be titanfall looks like it might
actually deliver on that promise now to
begin with let's talk about the core
mechanics of the game which places very
heavy emphasis on the balance between
having players fight each other either
as pilots or as Titans as well as having
to deal with AI enemies that really
serve more as cannon fodder for players
but they might actually be a useful
distraction or may even help support and
killing other players if they're being
very careless now as a pilot you're very
quick but more importantly very agile
thanks to use of freerunning and a
jetpack which lets you double jump which
is very important when dealing with
enemy Titans now as a pilot the load
outs are very familiar to most other FPS
games you have a primary weapon like an
assault rifle or shotgun a sidearm and
then some kind of heavy anti Titan
weapon news like a rocket launcher you
also have a pair of passive perks that
give you some kind of benefit a special
tactical ability that you can use on
cooldown such as active camo and
whatever kind of grenade you want to use
which are currently just frag grenades
and like an EMP style one now as a titan
on the other hand you're a lot more
menacing but also more cumbersome you
can cover a lot of ground thanks to your
large size but parts of the map will
also serve as an obstacle such as a
bridge getting in your way but you will
definitely be able to easily devastate
large numbers of regular ground troops
now while of course this is a beta and
not a finished version of the game and
I've only had some limited time with it
much less than i would spend on a full
review one of the things has become very
clear in the beta so far is that there's
a great balance of the dynamic between
having pilots fighting Titans while
Titans can easily dominate players that
are just standing around open spaces and
just not trying very hard pilots can
definitely fight back by making use of
freerunning hit-and-run tactics and just
teamwork giving them the ability to
easily take down a Titan if they know
what they're doing playing an either
style is a lot of fun the game also
gives you the option to get out of your
Titan and still fight as a pilot while
having it support you in the background
now as far as matches go the beta
currently offers two different maps and
three different match type
first off there's attrition which is the
closest thing to a traditional
deathmatch where players just keep
fighting one another and score points
for minyan pilot or titan kills and so
the losing side is forced to try and
retreat V an extract point then there's
hard point which is basically just a
three-point domination match and then
there's my personal favorite last Titan
standing which all players start off in
Titans death is permanent for the round
and the first team to wipe out all
opposing Titans wins overall I really
like the approach that respawn
entertainment is taken with some of the
mechanics for this game especially the
fact that something at Titan isn't a
kill streak but rather just something
that happens on a time to cool down that
everyone gets to make use of you're
always going to be able to summon a
Titan at least once or twice during a
match good performance is simply
rewarded by speeding up how often you
get one it doesn't bar them completely
controls and freerunning a really easy
to pick up you'll be surprised at just
how much ground you can cover once you
get the hang of running up walls and
going from rooftop to rooftop and
there's just this constant sense of
energy that's going on throughout the
match that's really insane I also really
like the addition of minions because it
fills up the map while still keeping an
emphasis on six versus six real players
and if you're a new player or still just
not that good yet they give you a target
that you can fire at and still speed up
something you're tight now the only
mechanic that I'm kind of on the fence
about right now our burn cards and what
this is is that whenever you win matches
or complete challenges every now and
then you'll be rewarded with burn cards
special items that can be used once per
match to give you some kind of insane
bonus some of them are kind of useful
such as getting a speed boost but others
can be outright crazy such as having
permanent cloaking for the match or
having access to a special antitype
weapon that normally isn't available to
regular players now on the one hand
what's cool about this is that it's a
random element and if you get to make
use of one of the really cool ones it's
really fun for you as a player on the
other hand it's a random element in a
game that is for the most part as far as
we can tell so far pretty balanced but
when you introduce a random element like
that it just throws all the balance out
the window which just might not appeal
to some of the more competitive minded
players now of course this can be easily
remedied by just having burn cards to be
a special optional feature to have in
some matches that you can turn on or off
that way if you're interested in them
you can use them but if you want to be
more balanced and fair and competitive
you can turn them off there's also this
little part of me that's really afraid
of the idea that while burn cards are
fairly easy to obtain just by playing
the game that they could also be
implemented as a form of micro
transaction by offering them as booster
packs for players to buy now respawn
entertainment has said that they aren't
planning
having any kind of microtransactions in
this game but weirder things have
happened between development and full
release and it just seems like be all
too simple to implement down the road so
other than burn cards which like I said
I'm not entirely against I'm just kind
of mixed feelings on right now I've been
really enjoying titanfall there's enough
familiar FPS mechanics to make it
playable but a lot more new ones and
refined ones that make it a much-needed
breath of fresh air also robots I have
to admit that I am easily won over by
having giant robots punch each other
it's just an easy selling point for me
the point is is if you haven't started
playing the beta just yet you need to
hop on and try it out for yourself right
now because it's completely worth it and
if you end up missing your chance to
you're just going to have to wait feel
the full release on March 11th and in
fact are playing it you're still kind of
on the fence about it just wait a little
longer because we'll bring your floor of
you shortly after release if you're not
a subscriber yet make sure you become
one so you don't miss out on that and if
you enjoyed this vid please make sure to
like it until next time I'm Kevin
protector tomorrow see
