things in the room like your friends

anybody you can actually use this to
target and shoot them you can see
there's like three missiles here on top
you can see this little got a little
Launchpad we're going on military on us

box I'm gonna grab my knife back here
whoo that's right and with my trusty
knife I'm going to go ahead and make a
mythical insertion here people don't try
this at home I am a doctor I'm qualified
to do this as I make the quick incision
you can see I incision it there was no
blood at all drawn what a professional
cut that was let me see you do that all

this little thing out you guys can see
when you get a close-up up here there
are three Phil missiles right here
that's right count them and read them
and weep three the base swivels it moves
I don't want to move it around too much

simple USB connection here's the bottom
of the unit I believe that you're going

batteries in it there's a little warning
down here for laser radiation because
