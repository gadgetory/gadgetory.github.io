again for many of us older gamers which
is me included doom was like one of the
very first games that ever sucked to me
in and made me really want to play games
I mean come on it was one of the very
first FPS games and it was cool now doom
is back but what's even cooler about
this is that you guys have been talking
about Vulcan technology for a long time
and now you're going to get to see doom
played on the Vulcan API to a tight next
room Vidya so this is really cool stuff
this video is six minutes of footage and
it's the very first uncompressed footage
of this that's ever been released to the
public at all using the GTX Vulcan
accelerated version of doom so that's
pretty cool stuff so for all you guys
out there wondering hey man what is
Vulkan API and what does it look like
here's doom for you let's kill boom it's
time for now the footage you guys are
checking out right now is doom running
at full speed with 120 degree field of
view it also gives you a really cool
look at how to emplace with a pc with
all its settings options cranked up the
full so let's do this
down
Olivia activated the hell away from
somewhere inside this facility I did
hope she can rise above their influence
I was wrong she proved to be weaker than
I thought she'd be
you
so what do you guys think bad ass right
hell yeah what's even better it's gonna
play much nicer with the 1080 I'm
network you've been watching TECA
tomorrow see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
