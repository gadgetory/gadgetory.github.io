back here on ticking tomorrow I milk
your host and we've got something really
really cool for you guys in our series
of system builds you guys request that
we bring you guys system bills all the
way from high end all the way down to
low in and we've been kicking them down
to the table so today's bill is going to
be the one thousand dollar bill so this
is in all the parts i have in front of
me comes to a thousand dollars and it
was actually a little bit tricky getting
all the parts together trying to bring
you guys a gaming system that could be
totally dedicated to gaming have strong
graphics and still fit within that
budget i really tried to stick most of
the money into the video card because
will open the gaming system the video
card and the hard drive they're pretty
much a real important elements if you
have a really cheap cpu it's going to
affect you but having a great great CPU
beyond having a mid-level cpu is not
going to affect your gaming experience
that much now I know you guys are always
going to have other questions so yes we
are bringing you guys other bills will
have the 750 dollar AMD build and the
five-hundred-dollar AMD bill coming up
soon but for now let's jump in and let's
talk about all the parts using this
build so let's start off with the case
we chose the inner max hoplite this bad
boy is white and comes to market at
about eighty dollars is a mid tower case
and has lots of nice features and is
cool to look at from the eye next up we
have the motherboard the biostar high
five z87 x3d motherboard this thing's
coming in mark about 160 dollars the
special things about this myth of water
it has really good audio on it and it's
actually won some awards from other
people out in the internet lately so you
guys might want to take a look at this
on your own for the cpu we've got the
Intel i5 4670k this thing comes to
market at about two hundred and thirty
nine dollars it actually didn't come
with a cooler inside of the box we could
have totally cheese it out and use that
and save some money but we figured
people wanted a little bit of
overclocking with that k so we want an
actual better one next up let's talk
about the video
art the sapphire hd7950 is a 3d good
bite video card coming to market about
two hundred and sixty dollars and this
three gigabyte bad boy is basically the
second highest card that you can get in
the AMD lineup as far as single card GPU
goes this thing will pretty much power
any game out there that is on the market
at no problem at 1080p as far as the
memory we chose 8 gigabytes of Kingston
Genesis memory this comes the market at
about seventy dollars for the cooler we
chose the thermaltake this is the NIACC
for cooler coming to market about fifty
dollars now this thing's really cool
because it doesn't have edges on it that
stick out covering your memory and stuff
so upgrading and doing stuff with this
cooler actually works very very easy for
the power supply we also have another
thermaltake product this is the TR to
600 watt power supply this comes in a
market about sixty dollars and this
thing can be used to power at least two
cards so if you want to upgrade this to
do a crossfire situation you'll have the
power to do it next up let's talk about
the storage for optical drive we have
the samsung drive this is a DVD RW it's
coming to market about twenty dollars
and for our storage drive we chose the
seagate barracuda one terabyte 7200 RPM
hard drive this came to market at
seventy dollars now i know some people
out there are going to say hey we could
have chose different drive but we were
really trying to focus on keeping this
at that thousand dollar limit because it
lets his face it if you only have a
thousand dollars that's it a penny's too
much mover alright folks so there you
have it the thousand-dollar bill now i
know that there are parts that can be
changed out use this use that but hey
you guys asked us to bring you these
bills so these the parts that we chose
and actually sticking within those
parameters gets kind of tricky because
something goes up in price the budget
goes up you're outside of that budget i
try to get this thing to be totally
geared towards playing games hence the
high-end video card now also if any of
you folks out there are interested in
buying this all the parts will be listed
down there in the description button
down below that like button which I know
you guys are going to hit to make sure
that you show us you appreciate us also
I know some people are going to say hey
it doesn't
with Windows I know it doesn't people
can't agree on which version of windows
they want to get and honestly most of
you guys pirate it anyway it's not that
I support that but you just do it and
you can get a code on line from people
from anywhere to ten to twenty five
dollars for any OS you want to get we're
focusing on the system itself so if you
guys aren't sub the channel there'll be
a button back here makes you hit that
will have follow up videos there first
will be our in-house tech Anthony
Reynolds bringing you guys a full-blown
time-lapse build then we'll have the
performance video and then well
something I know you guys are going to
like so stay tuned to tech tomorrow
we'll see you guys back here on the
channel
will you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
