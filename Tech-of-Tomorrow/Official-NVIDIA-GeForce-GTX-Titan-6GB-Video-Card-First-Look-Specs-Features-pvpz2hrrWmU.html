about to get a kick to the face from
Nvidia why is that well yesterday
morning on expert reviews it was leaked
that there's going to be the new gtx
titan now i don't know why this thing
was pulled but we were lucky enough to
get our hands on all the slides and all
this stuff and bring the information to
EU now I know everybody's been waiting
for quite a long time core clock is at
eight hundred and thirty six megahertz
with a boost of 876 now this thing's
gonna be pretty cool six gigabytes of
gddr5 a 384-bit memory interface and
it's supposed to have 4.5 gigaflops of
computing power that's right that's
pretty dang incredible so what do you
guys think about this I know we've all
been waiting for a refresh from Nvidia
is this thing going to be the thing that
kicks ass on everything out there now
this is all but official things may
change but I'm really thinking that
they're not going to change due to the
fact there's a reason why this stuff got
yanked off that website but if you guys
want to see a lot more information check
out the link below so anyways folks if
you guys want me to get my hands on this
card and do a full review make sure you
guys hit that like button so I can
inspire to get that card either for me
or from Nvidia or whoever the heck I can
get it from out there we'll try to get
it here on tech of tomorrow so I'd
appreciate that so all you guys got to
do go down check out the link in
description below where I've got a bunch
more information some pics and just some
really cool facts about this new card so
that's about it folks go check out the
Titan over on techo tomorrow we'll see
you back here on tech of tomorrow hasta
