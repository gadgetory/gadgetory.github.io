by Blink home security hey what's going
on fellow youtubers Tech fans now I know
that many of the people out there who
work on computers and play around
computers they know exactly what SLI and
crossfire is and for those people out
there this video probably won't be that
much use to you but for those people out
there still coming and a new to computer
stuff I still get the question every day
what is SLI what is crossfire why when
how is there a reason why do I want to
do this and what the heck is it so ok so
let's just jump right in SLI and
crossfire are pretty much the same exact
type of technology they're allowing you
to take two cards the same caliber run
them together and when games are
supported it they actually make
performance a lot better you can see
usually between 5 and 15 frames per
second depending on what game and how
the scaling goes really the bottom line
it depends on the scaling so is
crossfire or SLI is it for you well the
first thing you want to do before you
even consider going out and buying a
second card and doing this is you need
to take a look at the games that you
play if you're a big-time steam user and
you use a lot of older games chances are
that many of the games that you're
playing will be supported either by
crossfire or by SLI now real quick one
thing I want to state is as far as the
technology goes at this point there are
some cooler things about the crossfire
technology than SLI SLI for one thing
still requires a bridge and even though
Nvidia is stepped up their game quite a
bit and they have these really really
fast bridges if you don't have the
proper bridge though you're totally
screwed with an AMD crossfire
configuration you don't have to worry
about that whatsoever everything's done
through motherboard there are no more
cables no more bridges no more anything
whatsoever and I have to say that on AMD
side that's a positive note for them and
I like that fact quite a bit now the
first thing that you want to do like I
said though is go take a look at all of
the games that you play go look find out
if they are supported by crossfire or
SLI now a lot of people ask can I mix
the cards up well you cannot mix the
cards up per se as like saying using a
GTX 10-7
with like a gtx 1080 like that's not
going to work you're not going to be
able to use an Rx for AV with an Rx for
60 I mean I know there are some quick
fixes out there that allow these type of
things to do but you're not going to get
the proper and the best performance at
all that you're going to get now another
question people always ask is well what
about using more than two cards because
I see guys out there they're building
these systems with four cards three
cards well Nvidia and AMD will if you
know trapped in a room with God and have
to admit it will tell you that anything
beyond two cards is pretty much a waste
of money it's just show show show show
show it's pretty much like having a v8
engine inside of a Volkswagen inside of
a parking lot that fits 10 cars like
there's just nothing you can do with it
whatsoever so make sure that you always
have the matching cards now does the
brand matter clock speeds that doesn't
really matter like I have two cards over
here from two different manufacturers
these cars will work together great and
crossfire again on this side I have two
of them video cards these also work
together so the manufacturer doesn't
matter you don't have to worry about if
you have an msi card you know if you
want to go buy a gigabyte card will they
work together they will work together
sometimes you can go inside of the BIOS
and you can change all the clocks and
everything to match you can overclock
them to match just be careful in the
overclocking because I have found out
when overclocking cards in sli or
crossfire that's really when you start
getting a lot of glitches technology's
kind of already like pushed to the
bleeding edge another thing stuttering
screen tearing and all that stuff they
now have free sync and gsync technology
so if you look at a monitor of that type
of calendar excuse me that type of
calendar that type of caliber you won't
have to worry about that whatsoever all
those things are fixed with all that
technology so if you get a minor that's
g-sync for these guys obviously when
you're in game you're not going to see
any screen tear and you're not going to
see anything all those problems are
eliminated the same thing on the AMD
side of things now if you want these
cards though and you play like a lot of
like RPG games and stuff like that the
look down type of games I haven't really
seen too much of any grand performance
on those type of games but if you're
typing play if you excuse me if you're
playing the type of games that are
first-person shooters the new Skyrim is
coming out I hope to god they're going
to have a
for that in both crossfire and SLI
because in like that when you're
running all these major effects and all
these major you know basically eye candy
beautiful beautiful stuff you want to be
able to do it and get that card now
another question is always ask and I
just need to just you know reiterate
this once again if you can afford to buy
the most baddest-ass card because you've
got the budget to do it the absolute
best performance that you can always get
is going to be from a single card the
best card so if you can get your hands
on you know the Titan X or XP as people
call it these days and that's not the
correct nomenclature if you can get a
Pascal you know Titan X obviously if
that's the card you can afford you want
to get that card by itself but if you're
not that kind of person and you find
yourself in a situation you're looking
through everything you're going wow man
I have one card and there's just all
these games that I'm seeing our
crossfire and SLI supported yeah you
should probably definitely take a look
at hopping on the bandwagon and getting
yourself a second card so I hope that
answers any questions if you guys have
more questions you guys can put them
down below because I love to answer your
guys questions now real quick before I
bounce out of here though I just want to
give another quick shout out to the
people over at blink for making my house
a safe place even if you're not tech
savvy the blink home security system is
the easiest thing in the world to set up
and get going believe me anyone can do
it the blink home security camera works
in both the iOS and Android environment
it's a simple process of downloading
installing the app and then connecting
to your home Wi-Fi system and after that
you're up and going and since the blink
home security camera is wireless they
can be set up anywhere for your monitor
off your smart device the app is also
very user friendly and you can take
pictures and do live viewing right from
your phone there's also the motion
detection feature and what this does as
soon as it senses movement it starts
recording but what's best of all is you
can set up the recording time to be as
long or as short as you want it to be
another feature that blink offers is the
ability for multiple family members to
download and use the app at the same
time which means that everybody in your
family can share that same convenience
of knowing that your home is secure if
you
looking for the easiest and most
ergonomic home security system you can
get your hands on the blink security
cameras start off at $99 and you can use
up to ten of them simultaneously for the
ultimate in home security
all right everybody so I hope for those
people out there who are new to the game
that this sums up all your ranches now
you know what it is you know what SLI is
you know what crossfire is it's
basically two cards of the same caliber
from the same type of company that's all
you need to really know if it supports
your games and you play many many older
games you may really find yourself in a
situation where you want to crossfire or
SLI your cards if you're only playing
the latest greatest games and you only
play that game one time through an SLI
crossfire might not be for you that's
all I'm saying like usual though I'll
have some links down below where we have
some cool card combinations if you're
looking to do some pricey or budget type
of slis
will have some information down below
I'm mark you guys been watching tech in
tomorrow I know if you guys can see back
behind me but we now have our complete
to VR system set up so I think I'll go
and do some VR ninja see ya
Matt off we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
