once again I've been telling you guys
for a while we're gonna start having
these gleam giveaways and guess what
what we've got our first one rolling out
and our first one we're gonna be giving
away a really nice product and the
people over at creative in fact creative
has sponsored an entire month of
giveaways so every week now you can come
back to our channel and check in and
we're gonna have a brand new gleam
giveaway but we're giving away first
though is a brand new Sound Blaster x85
sound card now this is a really really
nice sound card for you guys who follow
the channel we did a video a while back
saying hey our sound cards even dead and
this product is actually a very nice
product it's very quiet produces sound
really really well and let's just face
it some of the onboard sound on some of
the boards is just crap obviously if
you're buying a super-duper high-end
gaming motherboard yes those sound cards
are probably going to be good they're
gonna have discreet audio with nice caps
and all that good stuff but mininum are
just really cheap real tech things that
they stick on a board a lot of these AC
eight hundreds and all these little
cheap low end chipsets they throw on
boards they're not very good yes they
will suit your needs and they'll play
your audio for playing games but if you
want something a little bit better and
something that doesn't use any other
resources up at all having a nice
discreet sound card can be very nice
so this contest is going to be really
really easy to do all you have to do is
follow the links that we'll have there
down below the like button and it'll
lead you over to our gleam page with all
the information about entering this
contest so you guys have asked for this
it's has been getting more and more
popular all the time and the biggest
reason I'm doing is because you guys
said that's what you guys would prefer
you guys said that was really the most
fair most straight-up way of doing
giveaways so we've listed now I want to
tell you guys something really weird
that I'm kind of angry about I told you
guys before that I was working with this
guy named Joseph fermentor max and that
we were gonna have all these products
from inter max sponsoring us well I
don't know what happened to inter max
but none of the products that we were
promised for review for the giveaway or
anything ever showed up and the last I
heard is this guy Joe quit the company
well I received kind of an email
yesterday that said that pretty much
everybody in the marketing departments
both here and abroad
in the marketing printer max have quit
now I don't know if this is true or if
they all got fired or what's going on
but there is some serious stuff going on
over at inter Max and if I were you
right now I would probably avoid buying
inter Max products because let's just
face it if you lose your entire PR staff
and there's no one there to help promote
your company who's really gonna be in
the background to support you because
let's just face it when you call up a
company it's not the owner who's gonna
be answering the phone it's gonna be
somebody from a support team and if your
company doesn't have a support team bull
then guess what you're gonna get really
really crappy support one thing really
cool about Eugene from creative he has
always kept his word with me I even kind
of put the dude in situation last year
or somebody took something from us and I
didn't have to give back and the guy was
a totally good sport about it all and
he's still constantly supporting the
channel let's get rid of mr. buddy the
dogs since he's getting feisty so this
is it first
sorry for this is it folks our very
first gleam giveaway we're gonna have a
brand new one every week I think I'll
try to make it in the future to have it
every Friday I think that might be the
best thing for us to do so because fries
are kind of a slow two anyway so I think
every Friday from now on we're going to
have a new gleam giveaway for you folks
and this really makes it a lot easier
for me as well because the companies
themselves once you guys win the prize
they can send it to you directly I don't
have to worry about them paying for the
shipping to me then me paying for the
shipping to you out of my pocket and all
that other stuff so now the companies
that are giving the prize away will
actually ship the prizes to you and this
will be much better for everybody all
around so hey we'd love to see you guys
back on the channel we love to give you
stuff and our first giveaway is a very
very nice sound card or two if you've
always wanted to have a really nice
sound card here is your chance because
we've got one up for grabs make sure you
check out everything down below that
like button if you do like the button if
you do like the button if you do like
the video please click the button and
like I said before we always love to see
you back here on the channel I want to
see your comments and if you really do
like what you see hey sub and we'll see
you back here again on teka tomorrow
peace out everybody thanks for being a
fan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
