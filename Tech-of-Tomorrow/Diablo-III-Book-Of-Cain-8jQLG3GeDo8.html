and I mean for people out there who like
to read a lot of people don't they just
like to play the game but for those who
like to read and get into it this is
like pretty much I think like the
ultimate game companion I mean think
about it if you're into reading and you
go and you read the book and you feel
the story through the book by the time
the game gets released you're gonna be
all jazzed out it's like you know if you
read Lord of the Rings then you knew
Lord of the Rings was coming out in a
game you'd be like damn I want to play
that and so that's kinda like what all
this is about it's to draw you into the
story let you know more about the game
and what it's all about and that way
when it comes out you're a part of it
so now let's jump in and let's just
actually take a look at what this is I'm
not gonna go all the way through it but
I'm just gonna show you some of the cool
stuffs in this new Diablo 3 book of Cain
ok so check it out there's like a little
label on here I'm gonna go ahead and
just pull this little label off so you

wrapping label so check out the cover
design of the book it's really awesome
lots of detail the back nice detail as
well going to go ahead please a book I'm
gonna open it up right at the back we
can see it says take heed and bear
witness to the truths that lie within
for they are the last legacy of the
horror game and so this story begins and
takes you to the book you know Diablo 3
book of Cain text by Flint dial inside
edition's books st. Gabriel California a
local there right down the street from
here ok thank you dude basically the
book just starts off
this character Leia from everything I
did see online she's gonna be one of the
main characters of the book and it
starts out I guess by explaining who she
is and then it just goes to the book and
it begins the dawn on you and the dragon
it starts explaining things about the
characters all through it's like a
history lesson about the Diablo series
the burning of hell's rums of evil
basically a bunch of different chapters
in here the Prime Evils
that sounds cool like the primeval like
pine you don't like TV show Diablo the
Lord of Terror explains all that really
cool stuff though Wow the lord of
destruction and ball also from sorry hey
you know you guys just seen the guy who
they've even made fun of him they want
to know if he was Ben Wa balls that was
pretty funny I thought so just this
wasn't just really cool though I mean if
you don't care about the Diablo universe
at all I mean you're not going to give a
rat's ass about this I understand that
but for people who really do dig this I
mean I'm into it I like the series and I
like to read so this is cool by the time
the game comes out I'm gonna go ahead
and read to this whole thing burial the
Lord of flies I mean this thing's just
cool it's just chock-full of all kinds
of stuff it explains all the different
characters the character classes who
they are what's happened I know you guys
don't want to see the whole thing I'm
just trying to flip it through and just
give you guys you know some some cool
stuff about it modern history the
darkening of Tristram I mean just all
kinds of cool stuff all the way around
