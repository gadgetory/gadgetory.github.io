hewlett-packard hello again everybody
eldercare once again on teka tomorrow if
you find yourself in need of an all one
printer that'll solve all of your single
office or home office needs the brand
new HP officejet pro 8740 will do it in
a snap let's check it out when you first
get the officejet pro 8740 you'll see it
comes in a pretty large box but as we
open the box up the first things you
will see are the ink cartridges the
power cable and a standard film jet
cable you'll also see it there's two cds
within the box first off is a driver and
installation CD it has the drivers for
both your PC and your Mac and the other
CD is the reader√≠s pro 14 for HP you'll
also see in the Box various coupons for
HP's instant ink ready program we'll
talk about that a little bit later in
the video
next is the 8740 itself and amazingly
enough even though it weighs 40 pounds
it only comes in two pieces
so first off we're going to remove the
base and then set that on the table and
then lastly I'll remove the top and set
up very simple you simply set it on top
of the base and you're ready to go so
now that we have the 8740 out of the box
and plugged in next up is the simple
setup now setting up the printer
includes installing the for separating
cartridges loading the paper tray and
then the last step you simply download
and install HP's all-in-one remote app
which allows you to set up your printer
to your Wi-Fi now you guys can see the
8740 also comes with an additional paper
tray for storage up to 250 sheets of
legal size paper navigating to the setup
procedure is very easily done to the
included 4.3 inch touch screen located
at the front of the 8740 if you're
comfortable using a smartphone you'll be
right at home with HP's 4.3 inch touch
screen now this is the command center of
a 8740 everything is done within this
4.3 inch window all your things from
setting up jobs scheduling even
installing apps and using those are all
right here with the met 4.3 inch area
the HP 8740 offers a space-saving new
design which preserves office real
estate mean that doesn't take up a large
area to do a lot of
work now inside powering the 8740 is a
1.2 gigahertz processor and you also get
512 megabytes of installed memory the
officejet pro offers all the things that
you'd expect in an all-in-one printer
copy scan fax and print but it also
offers something very unique and this is
simple mobile printing operating in
controlling the 8740 the mobile app has
never been simple you can do things like
print scan copy capture documents or
even check your ink levels all through
the app right here in your hand another
cool thing about the mobile app is that
anywhere you're at you can take a
picture and have it printed on your
printer
so say you see some really cool piece of
art that you got to have just want to
have it make it a screensaver or
something you can take a picture send it
to your printer and save the information
you're at some crazy restaurant you see
a nice menu you want to have it hey take
a picture print you've got it all right
in the power of your hand
the 8740 is also NFC and Wi-Fi direct
capable letting you print what you need
without having to connect to any network
now HP's ink comes in high yield
cartridges and you can actually print up
to 2,000 pages per month per cartridge
other features include business class
speed for fast printing which means you
can print 24 pages per minute black or
20 pages per minute color the HP
Officejet Pro allows the device to
handle two sheets of paper at the same
time delivering ultra fast to side
printing up to 20 pages per minute black
or 17 pages per minute color which
believe it or not is almost as fast as
single page printing and another cool
feature about the 8740 is when you print
your documents they no longer fall to
the floor there's a built-in tray that
keeps your documents on the printer and
for security reasons all your documents
are printed upside down to keep pesky
eyes from viewing what you're doing you
can also scan to or print from any USB
device you can easily print Adobe PDF
files Microsoft Word and PowerPoint
files directly from a USB Drive using
the HP Officejet Pro 8740
you can easily scan files directly to
the USB to your email to network folders
or to the cloud with HP's pre-loaded
business apps
you also get essential security and
management features the HP Officejet Pro
8740 offers businesses the ultimate
fleet control and seamless management
but probably the absolute biggest
feature of the Officejet Pro 8740 is its
low cost of operation I mean let's just
face at the end of the day saving money
is the top on anyone's list and with the
8740 you can actually print your pages
at 50 percent less than a laser printer
that's right I said it 50 percent than a
laser printer that means it's very cost
effective and HP has a lot of different
ways to save you money on ink so you
never run out of ink either HP's instant
ink is an ink replacement system that
gives customers the ability to save up
to 50% on ink cost while also ensuring
that you never run out of ink this
program also allows users to print a
predefined amount of pages and a flat
monthly cost and best of all all this
comes in the mail so you never have to
leave your home and there are no annual
fees currently there are three different
plans based on pages printed and you
have the ability to change or cancel in
sitting without a fee these plans start
at $2.99 a month for 50 pages $4.99 a
month for 100 pages and $9.99 for 300
pages so all right folks there you have
it everything you need to know about the
brand new HP officejet pro 8740 now the
big features about this all-in-one
printer are its low cost of operation
and its great features for using mobile
printing I know you guys have seen a lot
of all one printers in the past but this
one's geared like I said for the soho
environment that's like single office
home office if you don't have a whole
lot of money to invest this is the
perfect product for you
the 8740 is going to hit the market on
April 1st on their website it'll be
available other places later on and this
thing is coming to market at $399 so if
you're looking for a low cost all one
solution that can solve all your
problems
