design even as a little flap up here so

about $60 folks so if you're looking for
a nice little gaming mouse I think
you're gonna like this so first off let
me just open the box up and just show
you guys the box up here I think it's
nice and simple up there not too much
for that
you guys can see all that design I'm
gonna show you guys the back where it
says the corsair raptor m/45 gaming
mouse but basically the three major
features are the 5000 DPI adjustable you
know your guys are gonna like that also
as a thousand megahertz pull right I
don't know beyond that let's actually
hop in now let's take a look at and talk
about a little bit further over here on
the table
what's operate alright so now we have
this bad boy out in the table got my
trusty little blade nice little swap
blade there I'm gonna go ahead see the
box with two little trusty little cuts
right here make it nice and simple then
we'll go ahead and just pop that top
open do that do that kind of little flap
there you guys can see the entire thing
slides out nice and perfectly we'll set
that off to the side here is the
internal packaging completely plastic
you guys can see it's all black service
it's got a nice actual smooth type of
surface you guys can see the buttons all
on top there we're gonna go ahead and
keep pulling it out of here I just love
these things a lot of times I try to
take my SATA boxes I don't know what I
designed it just totally like ripping
the box like me and mice we don't we
don't have a good history of getting it
out nicely but look this one actually is
going to be cooperative look at this no
ripping no tearing it can take the Elric
unboxing and
walk away being a solid box okay that
says something you know cuz usually I
try to go into these things badges and
obtain the total crap out of them every
time over and over and over again this
one I don't think I'm gonna have that
problem with all right then
check it out I got the mouse out here's
the mouse nope that almost caught him
there a little piece but actually drew
up a little piece ripped off so I didn't
get away completely without destroying
something so here we go Corsair Raptor
m45 this is a little instruction guide
Quick Start Guide gonna tell you all
kinds of different stuff and different
languages all that good stuff some
people probably won't even look at that
at all here's the warranty guide some
people may not look at that at all
here's what people are really wanting to
look at so in my hand it feels really
nice don't even screw around I know you
guys are gonna play with that right
there because in my hand it feels really
nice yeah well it just does so they're
from my tie by hand this is actually the
very perfect size and everything else
some of them are higher some of them are
lower and flatter this particular one
right here it feels very comfortable you
guys can see we have buttons here on the
side buttons on top the usual suspects
nothing on this side lighting on the
bottom all the adjustable weights you
can take these things out and put them
in to your specifications so you like it
really heavy I like my mouse to have as
much weight as possible for those type
of people you're gonna like this just as
well there is the little reader right
there so that is where your little laser
is going to be here's the cable and
let's see how long it actually is go
ahead and write ooh get this little
thing here nada okay there we go so it's
connected now you guys tell see it's a
braided cable bring it up to the camera
and get pretty close to that it's a
totally braided cable all the way down
and so I think it's about six feet looks
like it's about a six foot cable so you
got the six foot cable all that stuff
this is the mouse itself pretty cool
stuff
very pretty simple elegant like I said
seven buttons you can program thousand
megahertz and the polling rate on off
this is your style of Mouse it's my
style I like it I think you're going to
like it
here's the USB plug in
nothing too fancy just easy and simple
one thing though before I bounce out of
here want to give special thanks to

don't have time to sit and read books
all the time but you still like the
information on audible.com allows you to
actually listen to the books now Ironman
is a book by Tony autumn from Black
Sabbath and it's really cool I don't
really have a whole lot of time to read
but this is just something cool ironmen
talks about the very beginnings of Black
Sabbath you know all their drugs their
debauchery all the crazy things that
they did to become Black Sabbath and
Rolling Stone actually called these guys
the Beatles of heavy metal and I kind of
agree with that Black Sabbath to me is
the birth of true heavy metal and being
able to listen to the book the
audible.com is actually really cool if

of my fans out there are totally into

Raptor m/45 communal market about 60
bucks it's got some pretty cool features

feels good in my hand like I said this
type of product um different people at
different size hands so for me this is
perfect everything fits just perfect my
fingers aren't hanging off of it I can
hit the side buttons without a problem

opinions I have what I consider to be
like kind of short fingers little stubby
ones I don't have really long fingers
high even play guitar I have no freaking
idea because my fingers are like
