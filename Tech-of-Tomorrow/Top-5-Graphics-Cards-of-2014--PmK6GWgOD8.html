shall now be known tater tots
my name is Paul I usually do videos over
on my youtube channel youtube.com slash
Paul's hardware but Elric hit me up
because as you probably are aware he's
been having some medical issues lately
involving unfortunately the amputation
of part of his foot guess that means
I'll need to rethink my Christmas gift
for him but anyway today's video is
going to be about some technology since
I know that's what you guys are into
we're gonna be going over the top 5 GPUs
or graphics cards of 2014 coming in at
number 5 we have AMD r9 270x this is the
reference design right here this card
okay technically came out late in 2013
but it's still one of AMD's top cards
and that's why I wanted to include it
actually what AMD has done with this
card is they've drastically reduced the
price over time which means this is a
much better bang for your buck than it
used to be it comes in at less than $200
features 1280 stream processors you get
two gigs of gddr5 memory which is going
to be great for those of you gaming at
1080 and if you want something that's
probably a little bit better than the
reference design of this card I'd say go
with MSI gaming version of the r9 270x
that when we get you overclocked out of
the box of 1120 megahertz it's like a 78
70 on the crack coming in at number 4 we
have AMD's r9 280x and the version of
that that I have right here is an
excellent one this is sapphires toxic
version with the triple x cooler on it
basically what you're getting with the
280 X which yes was also released in
2013 but it's still a great card is all
of the benefits of last year's AMD
flagship for less than 300 bucks this
thing has been as little as 275 right
around the holidays at least so keep
your eye out for it still an excellent
card especially for those of you gaming
at 1080p we're coming in at number 3 we
have the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 now I
don't have a specific recommendation for
which of these cards you might be
interested in let's talk about what's
good about the 970 in general it's gonna
run you about 330 to 380 dollars for a
graphics card based on this GPU but the
benefits are it's based on videos new
Maxwell architecture which is extremely
power efficient and with the 9
seventy you basically get about
eighty-five to ninety percent of the
performance of the 984 much less dollars
so that's fantastic I've been working
with the EVGA GeForce GTX 970 I've also
heard good things from Ulrich about
ZOTAC GeForce GTX 970 this is the like
Omega version here that's super
overbuilt also heard good things about
the asus strix version of the GTX 970 so
I'm sure any of these graphics cards
would be an excellent choice for you
guys especially if you're considering
going beyond 1080 gaming number two on
this list we're moving back to AMD for
this I don't have a visual aid so let's
see if we can do some quick
post-production effects the AMD r9 295x2
when the 295x2 was $1,500 it was a cool
top-end card that not very many people
were able to afford when they made it
$1,000 people like wow that's actually a
pretty good deal it was beating Nvidia's
version of that card which was the gtx
titan z when they made it like 650 or
700 bucks like it was right around Black
Friday I was like that is amazing a
fantastic deal sure you got a deal with
a little bit of extra power requirements
and you might need to upgrade your power
supply but the amount of simple graph
graphics horsepower that you get with r9
295x2 especially if you can get it for
around 700 to 750 bucks like it is right
now fantastic deal and an amazing bang
for the buck and the number one GPU of
2014 big surprise the NVIDIA GeForce GTX
980 this is EVGA Zwerg that I have right
here if you've been living under a rock
this year let me explain what makes the
GTX 980 such an awesome GPU first off
it's in videos new Maxwell architecture
even though I'm video wasn't able to
actually shrink down their process size
they were still able with this new
architecture to make this GPU more
powerful to last last generation while
consuming much less actual wattage from
the wall that means the cards are going
to run quieter they're not going to
generate as much heat that will
dissipate into the rest of your system
and it also means these things for
overclocking are absolutely amazing that
goes for the 970 as well which is based
on essentially the same GPU
it's also got 4 gigabytes of gddr5
memory which is great if you're looking
at high resolution gaming like 1440 or
4k and also have you heard of
sinc well it's a method of frame rate
control between the graphics card and
the monitor and it makes things buttery
smooth if you haven't tried it yet you
should try it as soon as you can and
once you have tried it it's really
difficult to go back in fact I think
2015 is going to be the year of g-sync
as well as well as free sync which is
AMD side but if you want that technology
right now you've got to go with NVIDIA
and I think the GTX 980 is the best
graphics card for your money if you want
to do jisuk if you want a specific
recommendation for a GTX 980 I've been
working with EVGA geforce gtx 980 which
i think does a fantastic job we also
have a so tax version of the GTX 980
right here just as with the 970 the
Strix is also a great option if you're
looking at Asus although that's not one
that I've tried personally if you want
one that I've tried personally that's a
really high-end 9 80 gigabytes version
of this card is insanely over built it
feels like a block of copper and like
you could take it and just just slug
someone the side of the head with it not
that I've ever tried them and that's all
those are our top 5 graphics cards for
2014 let us know in the comments what
you guys think of our picks let us know
which graphics cards you think were the
best choice this year did we make the
right call I don't have no idea
I'm really good but don't forget guys
I'm filling in for Elric's because he's
dealing with some medical issues right
now so don't forget to blow off that
like button for him show him your
support because he was just telling me
earlier how much it means to him and how
much of a lift he gets when he sees your
comments as well as your likes on this
videos also if you get a chance to don't
forget to check out my channel it's
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware we'll
see you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
