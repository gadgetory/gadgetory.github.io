fans now we've all seen a lot of six
gigabyte 1060 cards floating around the
market and they had different scores
varying between them and now we're
actually going to take a look at
something different though same card
though but with only three gigabytes of
RAM or like the ladies say he's just got
wee bit of a smaller meter you know but
everything pretty much about this card
is the same as its six big of my
brother's so let's just first jump in
you guys can see the box in the content
it's not a whole lot of stuff is going
on here it's an entry level card you get
what you need and that's pretty much it
on the top of the card you guys can see
there's a single fan with the EVGA logo
and obviously you know telling you that
it's a 1060 card it's completely black
on the bottom you guys can see the PCI
slot featuring a single 6 pin power
connector and obviously with these cards
there's no sli whatsoever
like you guys have seen in our previous
videos you guys can use a protein low
end power supply we were using like a
foreign 50 watt power supply and the car
was working just fine in our system on
the back ok no back plate I know I don't
really like that you guys probably don't
either but like I said again this is a
very entry-level card as far as all the
specs and everything I know you guys
have seen hundreds of videos on the 1060
all the other specs are the same the
only difference between this and it's
bigger brother is the amount of RAM one
has three gigabytes etdr v one has six
goodbye to ddr5 beyond that all the
specs are completely identical and in
the rear i/o we can see there's a single
dual link DVI port three display ports
and an HDMI 2.0 port so for those of you
wondering hey how does this card size up
well as far as how long the card is it's
6.8 inches and it's height is basically
4.3 inches and like usual it features a
dual slot design the total power draw
the car is 120 watts and NVIDIA
recommends that you use a minimum of a
foreigner watt power supply out of the
box the card features a 1500 and six
megahertz base clock and a 1700 eight
megahertz boost clock but with our card
we were actually seeing the boost speed
at 1822 megahertz so that's pretty damn
killer for an entry-level car that's
only 109
$9.00 so with that said let's jump in
really quick let's take a look at our
test system for you guys who follow the
channel you know we have an i7 6700 K we
keep it in turbo mode at 4.4 gigahertz
and for the motherboard we have the ads
rock Z 170 m OC formula for the memory
16 gigabytes of ddr4 supplied by g.skill
and this is their rip jaw and real quick
before we rock out to the benchmark song
I just want to talk about the temp salon
people say I don't ever talk about those
but we do you sometimes just don't watch
the video you just ask the question but
anyways the temps in this card we were
running at that 1822 megahertz we were
seeing about 80 Celsius on the car now
with that said let's rock out to the
benchmark song and see what the big
difference is between the three gigabyte
version and the six gigabyte version
it's just a wee amount she said let's
rock
all right Tech fans so there you guys
can see it now the only real caveat I
see about the card is it only as a
single fan it is running pretty hot at
80 Celsius you know not a whole lot of
throttling was totally going on yet but
still running at that hot you're not
going to be able to get too much more
you know overclocking Headroom beyond
that for a car that's 199 dollars you
guys can see the three gigabyte version
it's almost up there with the six
gigabyte version so if you're looking to
save just a little bit of money get an
entry level card you're maybe a person
who plays a lot of RPG games you're not
totally super ly heavily into the first
person shooter stuff this might be the
absolute perfect card for you not that
saying that doesn't play those
first-person shooter games but there are
some of the other cards that do play
them just like I said a wee bit better
I'm Ellie you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow like user will have everything
down below that like button which hope
people Jackie Chan style on and we'll
see you guys back here on teka tomorrow
so if you like this card hey check it
down below you can get more information
or you get the cash get that card in
hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
