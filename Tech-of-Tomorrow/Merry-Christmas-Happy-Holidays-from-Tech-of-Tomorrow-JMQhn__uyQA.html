guys here you guys know what day it is
it's Christmas Day whoa presents under
the tree and we're getting ready to
unwrap them all so everybody can be a
happy camper but we want to wish you
guys our friends family and our peers
out there and all the other tech sites a
very merry merry christmas and happy
holidays it's been a pretty good year
for us even though a couple have been
really sick we've still been trudging on
throughout the year getting things done
hopefully next year hopefully none of
this will be sick both me and Jonathan
this year suffered bad medical problems
and we're still kicking so we're like
5050 but hey that's a whole nother deal
today mean by the dog my family we're
going to sit down have some dinner with
some family and friends and enjoy our
food hope you guys are all doing the
same out there now one thing that just
keeps bringing brought up over and over
again and my email box keeps flooding is
how do you know if you won the contest
and I keep going like this because
honestly I mean I've made it so simple
so I'm gonna explain this again to you
guys the 25 days of christmas giveaway
in the video when you're watching the
video there's a little box down there
it's called the description box I told
everybody plainly and clearly we will be
announcing the winners inside the
description box I've got about 375
emails all asking the same question how
do i know if i won my prize well
obviously if you didn't take the time to
watch the video and you were just too
lazy to even do that then you would know
that all you needed to do was look in
the description box of the 25 days of
christmas video and that's how you find
out if you've won now to claim your
prize it's very simple when you go to
the thing you go to about my site on the
page it's little buttons is about click
on that button it'll take your google
page which says send message honestly I
feel like if you don't even know this
about you two but all you're not you
know very YouTube savvy at all you're
very rookie
because this is a common thing sending
somebody a message so you go to 25 days
of christmas you see my name Wow Bob
Smith i won you go you send me a message
from the winning account not from your
sisters account not from your mom's
account or Ted's from down the street
I'm not going to accept that and by the
way if you send me a message and saying
oh i see that i won my prize how do i
claim it I'm just going to disqualify
you because I've just explained to you
very simply how to claim your prize now
all these prize would be going out
probably a day or two after Christmas
we're going to mail them all out to
everybody and we have lots of great
things including the grand prize today
on Christmas Day so you're going to want
to make sure you bought back over that
video in fact i'll have a guy put a link
back here so you guys can bot back or
that video and see if you've won we've
got 25 winners including the grand prize
winner today on Christmas Day so there
it is folks we're giving me lots of
stuff in fact we have a giant giveaway
going on we got a kind of way after CES
and sorry my voice is still kind of
going because i'm not totally over my
strep pneumonia but i'm getting there
we'll have even more stuff coming for
you guys we love you we're going to be
here next year even stronger than ever
for you we're gonna have lots of stuff
lots of giveaways lots of great content

welcomes and a big hug from all of us
