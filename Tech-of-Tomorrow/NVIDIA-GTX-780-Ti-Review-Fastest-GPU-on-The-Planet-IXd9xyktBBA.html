tomorrow where its launch day of the new
gtx 780 Ti is it the world's fastest
single GPU card in the world let's find
out
it is launch day of the new NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 780 Ti now you guys all know
that 290x has been out it beat the 780
pretty much across the board it was
kicking its butt but what always happens
when AMD kicks butt NVIDIA well NVIDIA
gets their together and just comes
out with something else this time it's
the new 780 Ti
now most Nvidia fans all know that this
card is pretty much just a 780 with
everything unlocked probably the card
that we should have seen a long time ago
but since AMD fumbled so much in the
game
Nvidia just chilled out and was like hey
why release this card when we don't have
to but as you can see when the day
arrived that AMD finally beat them at
the table they just really quickly
released something else which means they
did not do any R&amp;amp;D they basically have
it sitting on a shelf or they just had
to like basically no just open something
up in the card and baboom they've
unlocked it so with that said let's
first jump in and let's just take a look
at the card physically so I had the card
right here in my hand
it's 10.5 inches long you know a real
lady pleaser
they're still featuring they're cooling
on this which you guys know from other
series of card works very very well and
a lot of people actually say that this
is very appealing to the eye as well so
not only is the card efficient people
like the way it looks and for reference
card that's really rare now this thing
looks really nice PCI 3.0 interface you
got a couple of different things over
here on the side for your power 6 pin 8
pin back of the card completely black
PCB so you got up here on the top to SLI
fingers triple SLI supported let's flip
it around real quick take a look at the
Ruhr REO 2 DV is dvi-i DVID single
DisplayPort single HDMI port now let's
talk about some of the actual specs of
the car beyond the looks so let's start
off with the cuda cores now you guys
have all heard this is the unlocked
version with 2880 unlocked cuda cores
also features 240 texture units
forty-eight rap units now the reference
card has a base clock speed of 875
megahertz and a boost clock of 928
megahertz the memory clock speed is at
7,000 megahertz and is actually the
fastest memory on any video card on the
market to date the card also features 3
gigabytes is super fast gddr5 memory
with a 384 bit memory interface it also
has a total memory bandwidth of 336
gigabytes per second nvidia recommends a
600 watt power supply be used with this
and the total TDP of the card is 250
watts it also has a thermal threshold of
95 Celsius now we will get back and
reiterate a little bit more about the
subject of heat later on in the video
but I just want to say right now that
when a cards running at that high of a
temperature there's not much flexibility
to do with that and when the card from
AMD was run an uber mode it's pretty
much kind of the same thing as having
their card overclocked but we'll get a
little bit to that later let's right now
talk about the test station we're using
the ASUS Maximus hero motherboard this
is an LGA 1150 motherboard we're also
using the i7 4770k CPU we're using a
cooler master cooler on top of the dang
thing and we've got 32 gigabytes
that's right 32 gigabytes of high-speed
memory from the people over at patriot
is their viper extreme stuff we're also
using a sandesh 240 gigabyte SSD as the
boot drive and a Western Digital 1
terabyte black drive which we feel is a
pretty common system for people to have
out there we used to have a higher-end
system but we asked you folks what you
thought and you guys said this was
pretty much the type of system that most
of the high-end enthusiast users would
have so we stuck with it so with that
said now let's bounce in and let's see
how the performance is of this brand-new
Senay
video
so they're you guys see if the
performance differences between the
780ti and the new AMD r9 290x now
something I do want to say Rock the bat
though we ran the r9 290x in its uber
mode and we did that for a reason we
didn't feel that any gamer worth his
salt was really gonna go out and spend
five hundred forty nine dollars and then
run that card and quiet mode why would
you you're a gamer you want your games
to run as fast as possible now with that
said in uber mode the card does run
pretty damn close though to the TI card
but there's something about that the ti
card essentially the way we ran it is
pretty much walking because it's ran its
default state its default boost clock we
didn't go and change anything nothing at
all about it now when you're running the
AMD clock in Ober mode it's pretty much
that carbon it's overclocked type state
running down the road so you can pretty
much picture it you know nvidia is
walking AMD is running and they're
running and they're still behind the TI
and i think that's a pretty fair
assessment of the situation now let's
talk about the heat eighty-two celsius
is what we were seeing on the nvidia
card while we were seeing 94 95 96 all
over the place with the AMD card
depending on the test we were running so
that cards already running very very hot
now i know a lot of AMD fans out there
gonna go say hey you know there's gonna
be better cooling all this stuff but one
thing you can't change regardless of the
cooling you're putting in the card that
cards already running you guys have said
it yourself in your comments at 95 c
meant to be ran at 95 c so where's the
actual threshold of that card like i
talked about in the nvidia card this has
a threshold right around there
but the cards running at 82 right now so
that means i still have 13 degrees of
Celsius that i can screw with before
this cards running as hot as the AMD
card every test that we ran right now
was with the 780ti right out of its box
right with a virgin driver nothing
overclocked Wooper modem the AMD
is overclocked it's like an overclocked
state you know uber mode there's a
reason they call it goober mode it's not
because it runs slow so with that said
there are some positive things though to
the AMD card in one particular battle
there is nothing that Nvidia can do I'm
sorry buddy you just lose this battle
altogether and that's the price battle
one hundred and fifty nine dollars
pretty big difference now you might be
able to get it before you know a little
bit less than that
you know if you look around shop but
pretty much one hundred and fifty to one
hundred and fifty nine dollar difference
in the cost of the cards so if somebody
out there you know your sole thing out
there is you don't care about
performance you're just looking for as
much performance as you can get in this
limited budget well then if a hundred
fifty bucks that big of a deal to you
then the AMD card is surely the card for
you but if you're a pure enthusiast and
all you care about is performance you
don't give a crap who makes the card
which is pretty much how I am you guys
say that I'm a MIDI a fanboy it's not
that I compare the cards exactly how
they are when AMD has a really good
product we're like hey AMD had a great
product if they were a product that runs
hot and it makes a little bit noise
we're gonna make fun of it we're not
trying to insult AMD we're just poking
some fun at them and when NVIDIA has
done it we've poked fun at them as well
so one last thing though before we
bounce out of here mantou we've all
heard about it is it going you seriously
change the dynamic of the game well
we're going to see but for now the 780ti
is the kick-ass King of the Ring in the
single GPU ramp
the facts are there there's no disputing
it anyways do you guys have different
comments you want to say down below
especially about how he ran the car if
you guys felt that we should have ran
the card in quiet mode and you think
that's a really important thing let us
know we can always go back and run it
again we just didn't really think that
any of you guys being uber gamers would
run your card in quiet mode so down
there will like but in the description
if you guys want any more information
when I check out the written review it
will be down there and hope you guys hit
the like button like that and last but
not least if you're not subscribed to
the channel and you want to see all the
stuff that's going on here we have all
kinds of cool stuff coming up we've got
Christmas giveaways we've got Christmas
catalogs hey the holiday seems upon us
and that means great stuff for you guys
I know it we'll see you guys later go
back to do some more testing on a 70
we're gonna over bad boy and
we'll see where those from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
