here on the ticket of our youtube
channel elric paris that's me has some
questions for you guys now we've been
doing a lot of different testing with
SLI and now we're doing triple s a lion
I really want to know what you guys
think about the testing because we need
a lot of testing on the 7680 x 1440 and
I got seemed like really a lot of
negative opinions so as I'm going to
testing I want to ask you guys what you
think and I'm actually going to be
giving so random prize 16 gigabytes of
kingston ddr memory just to a random
person or four answer these questions
what I really want to know from all you
guys's what is the most important
resolutions because I want to go this
way I only want to test it really two
resolutions that I think are important
to you 1920 x 1080 p and also 2560 x
1440 now I've done a lot of tests for
the 2560 by 1600 but it doesn't seem
like very many people out there actually
have a 30-inch monitor and as these 27
inch high resolution monitors start
lowering in price because as you guys
seen this video once before you can get
these Wanderers now from your five
hundred bucks so I think that makes it
pretty affordable tell me what you guys
think first of all is 2560 by 1600
testing relevant at all please give me
your opinion also you guys think that
the 2560 x 1440 is little room because I
feel that it does and lastly I know you
guys like the 1920 x 1080 so I'm sure to
see a bunch of comments on that your
opinion counts I'm always trying to make
the channel better and bring the test
that you guys want to see so please you
guys know I kick down and watch this
 to you so come on give me your
answers below and let me know how I can
help you in my reviews see you guys back
here in Peca tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
