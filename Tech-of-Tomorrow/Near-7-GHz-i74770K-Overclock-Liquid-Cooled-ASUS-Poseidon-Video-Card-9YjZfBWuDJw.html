makers of the XP GV 220 800 megahertz
gaming memory glad to see you guys back
here once again on tech damar we're
bringing you all the tech all the time
now last week over in Taipei Taiwan they
had the giant supercomputer show called
copy decks and at that show a lot of
things were announced and a lot of
overclocking and crazy just
happened over there now
Zeus happened announced a couple of
brand new products that they're going to
be releasing to the market first of all
we're talking about the new Maximus 6
that's right this is the Maximus 6
formula version and it's totally geared
towards water cooling it actually has a
connection on the board and a heatsink
that can be used either for standard
cooling or for using liquid cooling
which is really cool it keeps all of
your MOSFETs and all that stuff running
cool on your board now at that same time
they also announced another product
called the Poseidon so you guys can get
on the Poseidon Adventure and it's
supposed to be a whole new series of
video cards that's going to also feature
liquid cooling so you'll be able to take
this thing and run your loop through
your board through your video card all
using strictly Asus components now as
far as exactly which cards are going to
be made we don't know that for certain
but we do know that it is going to be a
700 series card also check this out
overclocking on an Asus board that was a
team of went around just basically from
booth to booth overclocking and
these guys were able to overclock the
new Haswell to 6.8 gigahertz and they
also hit another world record having the
DRAM speed to 4.1 gigahertz that's
supposed to be like one of the fastest
record speeds of all time so for those
folks out there who are really into this
stuff and who'd like to get more details
