me because I bought this damn thing on
Amazon for 44 bucks
hey what's going on everybody welcome
back to tech of tomorrow today I've got
an unboxing and first look of a product
that I actually bought myself on Amazon
because I didn't see on the reviewers
list and I said hey this products under
50 bucks and it looks like a pretty
decent gaming mouse now this product is
from rocket this is their Cova plus
mouse this thing like I said is under 50
bucks I paid forty four dollars
Amazon Prime got free shipping it was
here like in two days now when those
guys ship it out an Amazon Prime I
pretty much like it quite a bit they do
a good job on shipping I've bought in a
lot of other mice when I got things you
guys it seemed like the ones I got from
China and stuff and they come all
squished up cramped up these guys take
time to package it up nicely and make
sure that I can get it for you folks for
a good unboxing so I'm gonna take my
little trusty knife I just slit right
there on the side and we shall pull this
out and then we show through this the
cameraman now here it is the Rockette
this is the Cova plus a lot of things
are on it
3200 dpi easy shift v-shape macros now
these guys say v-shape because they say
it's basically for a left-handed or
right-handed person I know some people
out there say they don't like those mice
I don't really know why it's just a
design it's not that much dimmer than
anything else you can also switch all
the colors on this make it whatever
color you want to cool stuff
flip it around so did you guys see the
back of the box it's actually a pretty
cool box is that as far as box go so now
I'm making the camera to readjust and
let's hop over the table let's see
what's actually inside of this bad boy
alright folks so you guys already saw
the box kind of so we won't really go
too much over it in a rate this thing
has 9 programmable buttons on it though
I will get and open the flap right here
you guys can see inside has all the
different stuff but the program buttons
over here so let's see how we get this
bad boy
out of the box though so does it unbox
every time I get headphones or I get
mice there's always something just a
little bit different about how they
unbox so here we go up here I've got a
couple little decisions to make pop that
open pop the top open all right then so
we hit the box out of the way inside all
the stuff that's inside right here what
all is in here
so we basically get a credit card this
has a number on the bottom I'm going to
cover some of them burrs you can't see
them is how you register your product
and everything it's like a little credit
cards kind of cool quick installation
guide the rocket Cova plus driver and
rocket stuff so this actually has a
driver and this right here I've turned
the computer on actually over here
behind me I currently have a mouse
hooked up but I'm going to remove this
one and I'm going to actually hook up
this one and show you folks how it works
in here so kind of mixing things up a
little bit here may under the old mouse
and get ready for this one so the
background is going to push out now
looks like this whole plastic piece is
going to come apart
alright then we're going to pull the
mouse out of its plastic housing and I
will have the cabman refocus on this
area very closely so you guys can get
very much close-ups of the product so
here on the side we have our first set
of buttons buttons here Center button
additional buttons here it's going to
light up over here maybe light up in the
center as well and I do believe it
lights up here so we have these two two
on this side two on this side two on top
and the scroll button and this feels
pretty comfortable my hand it's not
actually too big or too small
it's pretty much a very good size so
let's go ahead and let's take it out of
the package here and I will go ahead and
plug it into my system so now that I've
plugged it in you can see it's
flickering a bunch of different colors
you'll be able to change it and set it
to whatever colors you want all the
drivers everything have already been
installed so it goes from the different
colors from red green darker green I
like that now it looks really cool I
think back to some blues and here's the
bottom of the mouse alright folks thanks
for watching I hope you liked the video
if you did please make sure to hit the
like button now for my first impressions
I think this is going to be a really
good product like I said before it's
under $50 I bought it off Amazon you
might be able to find it for cheaper if
you look around they have sales it seems
to me like though it will fit anybody's
hand it's got a very very nice rubber
surface on it like some of the newer
casing laptops that are coming out I
really like that a lot it feels good in
the hand it's comfortable I don't think
that even if I use this thing for a long
time it's going to be you know making my
hand sore whatsoever I like the fact
that you can change all the lights once
you install the driver saw
where you can custom program the buttons
to do whatever you want in whatever
games you want now like they said they
had nine programmable buttons so you
have two four six I don't know where
they're actually getting a total of nine
buttons on here but that'll be seen when
I go ahead and install the software I
think from first impressions that $450
I think the rocket has a very solid
product in the way of this Copa plus
we'll see you back here on tech Oh
tomorrow as I use this mouse in some
gaming B's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
