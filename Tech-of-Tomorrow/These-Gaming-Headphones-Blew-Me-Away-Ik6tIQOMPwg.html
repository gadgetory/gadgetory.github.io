back once again to the channel Elric
here with buddy the dog bringing you
guys a brand new review of some
headphones from the people at audio
technica and we're actually using the
microphones in the ag-1 X right now as
we're talking so with the intro
everything that you're hearing is off
this microphone and we'll show you a
little bit later on the game have this
super cardioid condenser microphone
works really well keeps out all the
outside sound and makes it really great
for talking in-game we're just using to
dictate stuff so with that said let's
jump in and let's check out the details
in these headphones and see at the end
of the day with you be willing to spend
that $300 that these suckers cost
alright folks so here we have them in my
hand the ag-1 X the latest thing from
Audio Technica now right off the bat
these guys say that these are isolation
headphones and I got to say it does work
that way because if you're playing your
game and musics on it's really hard to
hear anybody even yelling in the
background at you when Jesus is playing
the game and I was trying to hit him I
had to actually physically hit him to
get him to realize I was talking to him
when I put the headphones on and I
turned the music on and somebody's
yelling at me at the same time I
couldn't hear it either and I the same
thing happened to me so I want to you
know get that right out there now these
things are totally designed according to
them for gaming but I'm gonna tell you
right the bat before even delved into
the video that these things are actually
much more than just gaming headphones
and at least they don't try to tell you
that they're 5.1 7.1 and throw that
 at you and try to you know cop
into that game these are just great 2.1
headphones I say 2.1 because the bass is
all reproduced inside here with the 53
millimeter drivers now inside of each of
these things is a 53 millimeter driver
and the 53 millimeter driver is actually
add an angle you guys can see that and
that brings the sound reproduction to
your ears a little bit different that
when it's straight out and like I said
before the bass is actually inside of
here so all the airflow goes inside of
the cups and then comes out to the
drivers giving you extreme bass in fact
that of almost all the gaming headphones
I've ever seen the bass on these is like
ba-ba-ba-boom and you guys can see as I
sit here and twist the freaking frack
out of these things they are very and I
mean very flexible when you put them on
your head
honestly you can barely even feel them
at all these two cups right here they
kind of grab the way
love the headphone and so when they're
sitting on your head all you really kind
of feel is just those two things sitting
in your head extremely lightweight
now they feature a closed back dynamic
design and what that is that means that
this entire thing surrounds your ear
when you put them on you're completely
enclosed and that's kind of where the
isolation comes in
now many headphones out there that we've
tested and senior you guys see they have
a little button it says Oh turn on the
isolation okay it's like a mechanical
little kind of bullcrap trick these
aren't isolation in that way whatsoever
these are isolation is that when you put
these damn things on they cup your
frakkin ears and you can't hear anything
outside of what's going on and let's the
volumes off and that's pretty cool one
thing I got to really talk about to the
microphone super cardioid directional
microphone now you guys who are
musicians out there and stuff you know
what that means that means that this
microphone only picks up what's being
directed into it so it doesn't matter if
you've got sounds in the background
going on a fan going on this won't pick
it up and it only engages when you talk
into it that's one of the absolute best
features and the fact that you can move
it around the goosenecks completely
flexible in any direction just makes it
a very flexible tool for when you're in
your game and you want to talk to people
live now me myself I'm kind of new to
going in there and talking a lot of crap
my son's good at it Jesus is good at
they've been do it there are newer
generation I you just play my game keep
my mouth shut and still sometimes you
know type something in there you know
like a guy's thanks but I admit the
microphone is a lot a lot easier now we
talked about sound reproduction the 53
millimeter driver that's inside of these
things produces a wide variety of
frequencies five Hertz all of it to
thirty five thousand Hertz I mean that's
major flexibility and the fact that that
are only really you know 2.1 headphones
or 2.0 if you want to really be
SuperDuper technical none of that fake
crap like they do the five point one
seven point once you guys all go do
they're not true yeah they don't even
waste their time doing that and there's
no thing that comes in because they
don't do that
these can double not only is your gaming
headphones you can take them right into
your recording studio and I have the 80
hm 50 headphones I've been using them
for a very long time I say like almost
my entire life music because it seems
like I've had the
things forever in one form or another
and they work really nice very flat
these really really SuperDuper nice now
here you guys can see some shots geez in
game he's playing around he's going
around in that to overwatch game and
kicking some ass in there and talking
and it seems to work really great we
heard no complaints about whatsoever and
you guys saw in the intro that we use
that as well and we'll use it again so
the microphone on here is very high
quality so I know a lot of people just
go oh man I know audio yeah but these
cover a lot of ground they just do it
it's really hard for me to like talk
about him as a trainer dog because I
know $300 is like a lot of money for
people to have headphones you know real
quick though let's see how the audio
sounds just through a microphone and see
what you guys think so let's do a little
rocking and talking right now and let's
check out some music real quick
both of the input cables are also
gold-plated so they're gonna get great
sounds even better than copper even
better than silver it's gold and to
control these headphones it's very
simple you have a control right here so
you can troll your audio volume mic on
and off and all that right from this now
one thing about this though is that this
is probably what breaks the most on
almost all gaming headphones and
headphones that have these things
because for some reason these pieces go
bad now we'll see how long these last
but hopefully it won't be the caveat and
you know they Cleese he'll like I've
seen it a lot of other brands hopefully
we don't see that you also get a 20-foot
extension cable so if you're playing ps4
games Xbox or whatever you can plug
right in also you know it works with all
your smart phone device and all that
stuff I guess even with the new Apple
phone if you get an adapter many people
buy things strictly on looks now if
you're one of those people that does
that you're gonna really like the looks
of these cans because you can see
they're really beautiful and it does
seem like the theme these days almost
everywhere is black and red black and
red AMD Aizu safaris they all share the
black and red color scheme and guess
what so do these the red on here though
is actually pretty badass as you guys
can see in a close-up shot this red is
badass I actually want to paint one of
my guitars this color whatever scarlet
red color it is it is freakin badass and
I want to paint a guitar the same color
to make it match as far as the comfort
level goes the pads that go around your
ears are as soft as a baby's butt you
know I'm saying they're just really soft
and when you put them on your ears
you get no I don't want to call it like
maybe a friction burn or not a friction
burn but friction irritation finish them
you know in gaming for a long time you
don't get that whatsoever never at all
is there any kind of discomfort so
comfort level on these things is
actually really nice the design is cool
you don't have to worry about putting it
you know on the on the wrong side
because look it simply tells you right
and left so you don't have to screw up
that makes your life much simpler but I
just gotta say overall folks I know that
you guys are freaking on the price but
there's just some pretty badass
headphones
all right so there you have it the AG 1x
headphones and people over at Audio
Technica and I have to say though that
for gaming if you're just going out
there looking for strictly a set of
gaming headphones I honestly think that
$300 is a lot of frickin money I mean it
just is but there's something I gotta
say like all of my life practically at
least for the last few years since I've
been doing stuff for music I've been
using the 8 ehm fifty headphones and
those things work really good you know
let me see what the heck I did with them
I had them here so I usually use these
and these things are about a hundred and
sixty-nine dollars and they're really
good they sound great these headphones
though for doing audio mixdown I'm gonna
tell you they sound better I was quite
shocked so not only are these headphones
good for doing the gaming the microphone
is actually really excellent friend game
if your person doesn't want to go out
and spend a whole bunch of money buying
two different sets of high-end
headphones these are good now for true
audio files that people will go out and
buy my Kitaj amps and all that
you'd laugh at all these headphones
you'd be like because the headphones
you're wanting you're like you're gonna
being like sixteen hundred bucks but
let's be face it most of us don't have
that kind of money we'd have to be like
you know rich which I'm not either
so well I gotta say at the end of the
day if you've only got $300 and you want
to have headphones that can do both
great gaming and work inside your audio
studio you don't want to spend any more
money these are very very excellent I
give them editor's choice
however for pure gaming $300 no unless
you're just like the uber gamer who's
got extra money to throw around you're
like yeah it I can buy whatever I
want you might want to look at something
else but like I said if you're a person
who likes entry-level audiophile stuff
stuff that has really nice sound quality
now these are 50 ohm headphones like
some of the audio files out there would
probably want to use a headphone
amplifier using these I would just
suggest just plugging them in anything
but one thing cool about these that I
think is cool for gamers though is that
though things you can do is you can play
with your ps4 it doesn't advertise that
you can play with the Xbox one but I'm
gonna imagine if you can use your ps4
you can use your Xbox one I guess just a
Microsoft didn't want to pay for that
advertisement on the packaging so for PC
Xbox you know ps4 these things are great
they complete 20 foot long cord all the
talking and game and stuff is really
good you're gonna really like that
aspect about it
these are very good headphones I just
don't think at the end of day like I
said people are gonna pay $300 from
unless they got the money but if you're
doing two things at once like I said
doing audio and using them for gaming
they're definitely a solid win we'll
have links down below I want to hear
your guys's comments like always and
what you guys have to say about it I
know it's very hard to totally reproduce
the audio things and bring it to you but
we tried doing this you saw earlier in
the video we put a microphone in let you
hear it and it's just very very clear as
far as music wise like in the studio
right like I said the a th M 50s they're
really nice they're kind of more flat
these ones have a big huge cyst sound it
just when you put these headphones on if
you can go out and try them anywhere
you'll see that these things have just a
huge big amount of sound inside of the
cans that makes it very very nice
so I mark you guys have been watching
techo tomorrow hope you like this vid
there's a like button you know what to
do if you like it if not hey leave a
comment tell me why you did and we'll
try to improve and we'll see you guys
back from the channel for more vids and
just like the intro hey all this audio
was recorded through this mic base</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
