again on TECA tomorrow now first up we
checked out the founders edition GT X
1080 card and it was pretty badass and
in fact the new driver made it even more
badass now let's check out one of the
first non founders edition cards that's
right this is the g1 gaming edition from
the people over at gigabyte featuring a
lot of cool so let's unbox as bad
as motherfrakker ok so like any unboxing
obviously we're gonna have to check out
first off the box you guys says it's the
gigabyte g1 gaming edition of the GT X
1080 gonna be awesome stuff there
wouldn't forced cooling RGB spectrum you
can change all the colors on it and this
is the overclocked version because they
have two different versions on this
particular one and we'll talk about that
in a second because they actually have
one that's called in gaming mode and
another one's called overclock mode a
little strange but ok so the final box
nothing there side of the box just once
again we just see the nomenclature of
the card the back of the box is just
talking about the wind force 3x cooling
system you guys are familiar with
gigabyte you guys know this is an
awesome cooling system make sure that
all that he is being dissipated away
from your GPU so you can overclock and
game like a motherfrakker
so obviously 16.8 million customizable
color lighting which means obviously the
RGB theme you can change all the colors
and I know there's gonna be some people
out there are gonna say they want 16.9
or they're not happy and for those I'm
sorry and then once again we just set
the GPU gauntlet sorting which means
that when they pick these cards out they
use the best components they even have
the rear i/o here but we'll talk about
that later side of the box you guys can
see all the nomenclature of the card all
its model number and all that good stuff
cuz gigabyte loves to have long numbers
for their cards and that's pretty much
it so we'll pop the cap here I think it
to what you guys want to see is the card
itself and this is the first non
founders Edition card that we've seen
here at Tekken tomorrow so things are a
little bit different still a lot of this
things the same 8 gigabytes of memory to
infinity 6 bit memory bus GDR 5 X memory
in fact so that's really cool so let's
check out what comes
content of the Raven any really extra
content in here it goes awful light um
yeah okay um nope awfully light in the
loafers as far as extra equipment goes
there but we do have the driver CD which
is obviously important then we have a
quick guide for graphics cards cuz I
guess there's gonna be somebody out
there who's never had one before this is
gonna tell you how to put it in and all
that stuff so out of the way it goes now
like I said the overclocking mode
features a 1721 megahertz base clock and
a boost clock of eighteen hundred and
sixteen megahertz now the in gaming mode
is a little bit different it features a
base clock of sixteen hundred and ninety
five megahertz and a boost clock of
eighteen hundred and thirty five
megahertz and the memory clock in the g1
gaming Edition is ten thousand and ten
megahertz pretty fast so we can sear up
the back we've got three nice fans you
guys can see all of the aluminium heat
fins underneath there and then once
again we see that copper heat pipe
running off of the car you can't totally
see it's prevalent but down here the
insertion slot for your PC I just flip
it to the side let you guys take a look
at the card take a look at the back of
the card with the rear of the card
rather then we'll flip it around over
here now the gigabyte thing this lights
up you can change all the lighting like
we said requires a single eight pin
power connector 500 watts of the power
supply that they recommend but they said
the draw is only about 165 watts so
you're probably gonna be pretty good you
guys can once again see a little bit of
the heat and on the reference cards I
know they said it was 150 but sometimes
in the card to suck a lot of juice it
does change a little bit and then we'll
go to the back right here now we all
love this the solid backplate I wish
every card in the market has it gigabyte
looks badass you can see right down here
we have the two sli fingers and then
lastly we'll take a look at the
connections of the card single DVI three
display ports and a single HDMI
connector you can hook up four monitors
which is pretty awesome so those people
who like doing surround vision and all
that stuff you'll be able to do it with
this card and all that VR stuff
everything is obviously going to be here
as well now as far as how the card sizes
up it has a height of 42 millimeters a
length of 286 millimeters and a width of
a
hundred and fifteen millimeters just
slightly bigger than a founders edition
card will also give that to you in
inches for us folks here in America so
alright I know it's kind of a quick
video but there you guys have a quick
unboxing of the brand new g1 gaming
edition gtx 1080 so it's up to you do
you want a Founders edition what do you
want an unfair news edition baby alright
well give me a couple days and that we
will have all the scores now a friend of
mine you might want to check out his
website his name is Mark poppin and he
has this cool website and it's called
Babel tech reviews off a link down below
and he's actually a guy's gonna be
working with me and doing all my testing
for now on so I can free myself up to
just have creative ideas now this guy
just loves the test like to the end
of the earth so be expecting like
another 25 games you know with this card
and got another 1070 coming so I'm gonna
have 1070 SLI and 1080 SLI for you guys
next week so stay tuned by the way you
want more information about this car or
even this card check out that link down
below that like button if you like the
way this card looks you know what to do
on that like button Bruce Lee the
out of it I'm Network even watch the
