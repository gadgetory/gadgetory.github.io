welcome once again to tech Audemar where
we're bringing you all the tech all the
time so what's going on today well today
we're cranking out some news for you
folks top story of the day a leaked
slide from Intel showing the new skylake
platform now what a skylake well sky
lake is a few generations off but it's a
Zeon based platform features all kinds
of new stuff superfast pci lanes say to
express ddr4 just all kinds of killer
technology that's going to make
everything obviously much much faster
now like usual we have the full blown
story on this over on our website which
we'll get into a little bit later next
story up android phone users I'm one I
use the Galaxy Note 2 but it seems like
ninety-nine percent of the people out to
have an android phone are prone to get a
malicious attack now that's really crazy
but it seems like the galaxy s4 for some
reason seems to be immune to this I
don't really know why now a lot of
people out there they always bitch at
Apple for having a closed system but
this is the reason why because now if
you have your phone you get hacked your
phone can become a break and you're
totally screwed with that expensive ass
phone now being unusable so what do you
guys think about this I think that's
totally crazy and I sure the hell hope
my phone doesn't get act you guys want
to check out the full article and
everything like usual the link will be
down below so last story of the day
features around Apple phones and you
guys know that Apple phones usually have
a very high dollar price tag attached to
them and it seems like they're trying to
make a phone that's more affordable but
in doing so it also looks like they made
a plastic piece of junk these things are
really weird sue apple haters out there
we invite you to bring forth the hate
today
because I mean I'm kind of hating on
these things you guys can see these
things they come in multi colors neon
colors like what are we doing having a
beach party with these things they look
like they're very cheap probably not
well made and will probably break an art
worth the money that they're costing but
like usual we have the full story on
this so basically everything that we've
talked about the newseum processors the
brand new stuff that's coming about
about these phones all the stories will
be over on our website wewt cube
tomorrow so you guys can check out the
link down below like button where
everything will be there and while
you're down by the like button you can
go ahead and give it a comfy chop and
