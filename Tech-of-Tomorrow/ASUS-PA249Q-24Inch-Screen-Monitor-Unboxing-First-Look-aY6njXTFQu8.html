advanced is what you'll get into this
monitor has lots of control here on the
front you guys can see everything's very
easy to access right here on the
right-hand side of the front panel off
your power to other things we'll go
ahead and flip the monitor to the side
you guys can see the monitor is very
thin says designed by Asus in Taiwan
right here on the side now let's take a
look at the monitors connectivity like
this thing has connectivity for almost
any type of connection we're gonna start
from left hand side we see the power
button then we see the power cable then
we're going to switch over to the right
hand side where we see the display port
the HDMI the DVI standard VGA sound and
then the USB uplink cable now let's move
on and let's go take a look at some of
the parts of the monitor right here on
the side you guys can see are the four
USB connectivity ports so it has
high-speed USB 3.0 now let's actually
talk about some of the very unique
features about this monitor so now let's
talk about some of the features that we
didn't talk about why we're just showing
you guys the monitor the monitor is a
sixteen by ten aspect ratio
it has 0.27 dot pitch six millisecond
response time has seven splendid modes
for color temperature modes it also
features a very wide color gamut and
reproduces 99% of the Adobe RGB color
space with this technology the colors
seen in photos will be reproduced
faithfully and consistently in a way
that cannot otherwise be on monitors
with just an S RGB color space the
monitor also features 10-bit color for
smoother gradiation
the p24 9q offers 10 bit display color
for over 1 billion on-screen colors and
support for 12 bit internal lookup table
the LUT which gives smoother gradients
and a more natural transition between
color hues the monitor comes
calibrated right out of the box this has
been done to minimize the color
difference to Delta e of less than three
ensuring precise reading of color input
and guarantees excellent color fidelity
it also features a next-generation aah
IPS advanced high performance in-plane
switching display technology this is
made for superior color technology a
brighter image from increased backlight
transmission and lower power consumption
each PA 2 4 9 Q also features a
brightness rated at 350 cd2 m2 and an
8,000 to one a smart contrast ratio for
enhanced image contrast the PA 2 4 9 q
has a 5-way navigation key that acts as
a joystick and it also gives access to
the Kwik Fit virtual scale function
along with all the other OSD functions
and settings
you also get picture in picture and
picture by picture technology this
allows users to view images from
different signals in almost every way
they want p IP and PHP lets users view
images from different signals and lets
them switch between the maned and p IP
course including audio easily a deuce
also includes the Kwik Fit virtual scale
function which is included in the PA 2
for 9q this allows users to have review
photos and documents on screen their
actual sizes prior to printing it can be
activated via a hotkey on the monitor
and uses a guide to accurately view and
edit photos

background colors for users to choose

mean the PA 2 for 9qe has a lot of
features and it's not just for your
average gamer guide this monitor is
meant for the Soho or business user who
has to rely on color accuracy being the
most important thing about their monitor
with all the features that are built

type of people who are going to be using
it to edit photos edit videos and really
have to have color matching as an
important aspect of their day for a
gamer it's overkill because this monitor
cost about five hundred and nine dollars
but if you're somebody who needs as
important features and you don't want to
have any kind of sacrifice this mono
really a kick-ass product for those type
of people so we'll see you later
