once again back on TECA tomorrow so if
you guys happen to miss it we unbox EBG
A's FTW edition card of the GT X 1080
and it had some killer stuff if you guys
happen to miss that video you guys can
check that out right here and check that
it before you view this video because
today we're here to talk to you about
how this car performs and how well this
card overclocks so let's jump in right
now let's check out the test system then
let's check out those benchmarks and
talk about how this car does and
standard benches and how it does
overclocked time to rock
ok so currently we're still using the
same test system that we're using before
but we are upgrading like I said to its
entire skylake system but unfortunately
transferring getting all those 25 games
and everything together takes a little
bit of time then with back-to-back stuff
going on it just takes time real quick
however Before we jump into those
benches I want to talk a little bit
about the memory overclock and a
standard overclocking now we were
testing the founders edition card we
were able to hit 300 plus megahertz on
the memory and every game scaled and
played very well however with the FTW
card there were a few games that we had
actually scaled back that wouldn't even
handle anything over a hundred megahertz
now as far as the standard overclocking
goes we've said this card has an 1860
megahertz overclock right out of the box
we were able to get 55 megahertz above
that with no problem with absolutely
zero throttling and this remained it's
77 Celsius constantly and it was in a
room that was 80 degrees ambient
temperature so in a hot room this thing
still kept the card running nice and
cool and it wasn't running with a bunch
of loud fan noise but with that said
let's rock out to the benchmark and
check those benches rock
and real quick folks before I bounce out
of here I want to give a special
shout-out to Braintree for making
today's video possible even the best
mobile app will not work unless you have
the proper payment API and that's where
these folks come in to solve all your
problems this is where brain trees V
zero SDK comes in one amazingly simple
integration gives you every way to pay
it supports Android iOS and JavaScript
clients and it offers a simple
integration that you can do in minutes
if this sounds good to you try it out
for yourself in the sandbox all you
gotta do is go www.bringtheneat.com
forward slash t OT so there you have it
folks the EVGA FTW edition of the gtx
1080
now like I said this card comes right
out of the box overclocked at eighteen
sixty megahertz so do you folks out
there who don't want to mess that
whatsoever you guys can see that's a
pretty decent and stable boost but if
you want to push it even further you're
seeing we're getting stable fifty five
megahertz above that across the board
with no throttling so that's pretty good
plus I gotta say the card doesn't run
really loud either you're not hearing
like this completely like windmill type
thing going on with a cards running so
that's good no more the SuperDuper loud
things going on to keep your card
running cool so this card runs great it
seems like the cooling technology on
it's doing a solid job and at the end of
the day for those folks out there who
don't want a Founders edition card and
want something different Hey the FTW
might be just what you're looking for
now the last thing before I bounce out
of here friend of mine mark he does all
the benches guys a benchmark maniac if
you guys want to see full on written
review with all the stuff more in-depth
all of the link down below to his
channel where you guys can check out his
written review of this card as well I'm
Mel
you've been watching teka tomorrow we'll
be back here for more killer gaming
coming up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
