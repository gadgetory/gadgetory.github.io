the channel I'm Eric welcome back to
tech of tomorrow where we bring you all
the tech all the frak end time so what
kind of tech are we looking at today
well today we're gonna be unboxing and
taking a look at a brand new product by
the people over at gigabyte this is the
avea osmium mechanical gaming keyboard
has cherry brown switches and has white
backlit keys this thing's gonna be
really cool it's a total mechanical
keyboard so you know it's gonna be way
more heavy-duty other keyboards membrane
space ones they break very easily the
mechanical ones are much more durable so
you guys can see we have the box right
here we have the label we've got the
keyboard we've got the name now let's
flip it around the side nothing too much
to see there but I know everybody likes
to see it all so we're gonna go and just
pop that up right there where you guys
can see some of the more features Cherry
MX brown key fours 45 grams durability
50 million keystrokes USB ports USB 3.0
and USB 2.0 as well audio jacks earphone
and microphone backlit white
report rate 1000 Hertz it's got a cable
that says it's 2 meters and it's braided
it also has some accessories which are
spare key caps key pullers and the usual
is manual
already then all that's good stuff so
let's flip it around let's take a look
at the back of the box now all this
stuff back here are the features so we
have the superior Cherry MX mechanical
key switch technology supports USB 3.0
or SuperSpeed via the motherboard
absolute anti-ghosting multi key user
capability means you can hit the keys as
many times you want and nothing's going
to happen it's gonna keep going and
recognizing them says it has 18 karat
gold plated connectors so Flavor Flav
can wear this shiz Nick around his neck
and act like he's the man 5 macro
programmable keys dynamic volume and
backlit illumination control full-size
wrist rest ultra stable non-slick rubber
feet stands macro profile switch you can
see him down you got 1 2 3 4 or 5 of
them we have the ghost macro engine
that's their programming that's a
software you're gonna put in there helps
to all this stuff and then we see all
the accessories
so the back of the box is pretty damn
well fleshed out with all the features
alright folks so now that we've seen all
that stuff let's begin the unboxing I've
got my trusty little sword here we're
gonna go ahead and zoom into this and
let you see that pop a little overkill
what the heck huh
boom alright so what that pop yep
pop cap cap and begin to pull this thing
out it was actually kind of hard to find
an area we could even do the unboxing
because in all honesty this is big
that's what she said so let's start off
by uh you know breaking the bottom of it
off the other you so here we'll start
off here is the wrist rest full-featured
big and thick that's what she said keep
going what do we got here we've got
their gigabyte features book just
basically shows you all the instructions
all the stuff how to install the
profiles how to hook it up all those
different things your profiles all that
good stuffs right inside there so now we
see the accessories here is the key
remover and here go all of the extra
keys let me go ahead and pull these out
of here one by one so you folks can
check them out we'll get them up here so
check this out here's extra key number
one extra key number two BAM ultra key
number three and number four flame own
Johnny so go ahead and get those out of
the way and let's take the keyboard out
out
pop it up now I'm surprised I don't see
the driver CD in here it's kind of
strange so I guess you're going to draw
download that off the internet because I
do not see that so
let's reposition alright folks so let's
start off on the left hand side of the
keyboard start off we can see the Escape
key then we begin all of our f keys up
here on top you can see all of your
program with macro Keys you have
illumination and volume control right
here by these two buttons right here
very nice and ergonomic the keys are all
Cherry MX brown like they said so they
have a little bit of clique to them so
far I'm just feeling it feel very
responsive let's go ahead and put the
bottom on to it and take a look at the
wrist rest so the wrist rest just kind
of pops into place like that and then we
have the wrist rest set on there here
over here we see via via logo we have
the num lock caps lock scroll lock let's
turn the keyboard to the side on the
side of the keyboard we see USB 3.0 now
I just want to mention though this works
off your computer so you're gonna have
to make sure that you plug this into a
USB 3.0 on your motherboard to use the
capabilities of this you also get your
headphones and a mic input all right
here on the side of the keyboard let's
flip it around so you guys the back side
on the back side of the keyboard we see
another single USB 2.0 connector on the
other side we have nothing but the logo
so you've got the logo sitting right
there looking cool here's the back of
the keyboard and here's the very back of
it we'll just show you guys that now
there are a couple of different things
here one on each side as well as ones on
the front to raise the whole keyboard up
so that's totally different anything
else I've seen before you usually only
get these these are something new also
let's take a very very close look at the
cable now this is
not your ordinary cable by any means you
guys can see this cable is very thickly
braided all the way through high quality
components very heavy-duty even
everything that comes is covered from
the factory you guys can see everything
is covered so when you want to use it
you just unplug it make that little
puppy mill as if I get the microphone to
catch that just for shits and giggles
there but that's all the connections so
this thing's gonna be a hundred and
twenty nine dollars you guys can see it
actually looks very very nice the wrist
rest seems very comfortable you get all
of the extra keys and the key remover
all four hundred and twenty-nine bucks
totally mechanical complete everything
you need all in a single mechanical
keyboard so I hope you guys like this
this is basically the unboxing and first
look I'll have to plug it in and see
what the rest of the stuff is later but
for now this has been it so thanks for
watching glad to see you guys background

video and like more stuff like this hit
that like button and show me that you
love me you know I love you with that
