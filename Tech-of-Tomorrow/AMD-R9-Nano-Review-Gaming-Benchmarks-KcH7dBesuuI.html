enthusiasts welcome to TECA tomorrow's
twist on the r9 nano from AMD
Hey what's going on Tech fans welcome
back TECA tomorrow I know that many of
my viewers are going hey Elric what
happened to this original video well
after seeing lower you guys's comments
down below about the temperatures I got
very concerned and we do things a little
different around here we separate people
so that no one can actually cheat on
anything all the testing of all my cards
is done independently and the scores are
given to me that way I can never achieve
the scores fudge the scores anything
else everything is done accurately well
unfortunately with the original review
we put up yesterday well those scores
were wrong so I decided just to go ahead
and pull the video and start from
scratch so with that said though here it
is man the r9 nano six inches long fort
is high and an inch and a half thick
this thing's made for many PCs and you
guys are gonna see for a card this size
it's actually pretty incredible now
there are three different versions about
this card and so we'll talk about that
there's a standard who the standard fury
card that card is an air-cooled card has
normal clock speeds and is geared for
you know the pretty much enthusiast
gamer but not for the killer extreme guy
this guy the r9 nano it's made for many
systems and made to be running very
quietly and very cool now
the people over to AMD actually designed
all the cooling features of this
particular card to make it run really
cool now even though the temperatures
before we're wrong you guys will still
see for what it is you guys all know
these chipsets run pretty dang hot Fiji
HBM a lot of hot stuff there now this
thing still has 4096 stream processors
and all the other features of both the
fury and the fury X now the fury X we
reviewed that one that's the
water-cooled version of the car that's
the super EXTREME and to be quite honest
with you it's not really that much
longer than this card it's really not I
think it's maybe like seven something
inches but still for a small card this
size the only thing that this card is
gonna have I think going against at all
will maybe be the price but what that
said let's jump in let's check out those
scores on our test system by the way
guys we haven't jumped in the DirectX 12
system yet because we'll just face it
what is there action
the singularity we've got one directx12
test so we're not really going there as
soon as there's stuff on the market that
we can actually test with we'll jump to
that but for now we're still using our
standard old Windows 7 test that we love
and it works for us so uh let's go let's
check out those benchmarks what I know
it to you are really important
all right folks oh there you guys have
it the benchmark song Rock gallon and
all the scores now something I didn't
talk about earlier I probably should
have talked about just real quickly
there are three display ports and a
standard HDMI port and we'll talk about
that now in the actual conclusion now as
far as building a mini PC goes this card
has a lot of power for a six inch card
now we test at the 14 40 and 4k and you
guys can just see that you know a 4
gigabyte card just isn't really cutting
the mustard as far as like running these
huge type of resolutions just not enough
so 1080p gaming that will however you
guys can see from the scores it's going
to do actually totally amazing so I
would say for person out there you're an
AMD fan you're looking for a very
powerful card you want something you can
build in a mini PC this is a great card
now something I think would have been
even more incredible as though is if
they could have actually made this card
half-height if this could have been a
half high card it could have fit in so
many more cases and it would have been
just amazing for building mini pcs
across the board
great stuff now I know a lot of people
are saying hey you know HTPC well
there's some things about this that will
kind of make it be a drawback for doing
an HTP see I feel with the technology
that's in this card there are two major
drawbacks that I see that make this not
so appealing in the future for doing an
HTP see first off h.265 does not support
4k streaming of encoded media so if you
have a 4k TV and you're hoping you're
going to stream like Netflix Internet
stuff through 4k the car will not do it
currently the way that it is also with
the HDMI technology where it's at it'll
only do 30 frames per second no matter
what TV you use so you need to think
about these things now me personally as
a person when to build an HTP see I'm
learning the highest frame rates the
highest everything I can get I don't
want limitations on 4k or anything like
that now I have to add those HBM is some
pretty incredible memory the thing is
though is that it's kind of ahead of its
time I think that would've been really
cool if they could have mixed feety
along with ddr5 they could have upped
the memory in the card
you'd have had no issues on anything
there's something I want to talk about I
was trying to run shadows of Mordor and
I had multi monitors going I was trying
to have a good time but the framebuffer
just kept overloading over and over and
over again making it look like crap so I
wasn't really too happy with that
particular aspect either so this card
has a lot of good in it
there's a few negatives it's a four
gigabyte card that's 645 dollars I know
many people that they're gonna swear
they're gonna go what the hell wrecked
like that's incredible
HBM is the problem very low yields very
expensive maybe if you listen AMD you
guys will go back use Fiji put ddr5 and
just come out with some badass total
cards do you guys don't always have to
you know beat Nvidia every single thing
sometimes you guys just target on what
you guys do good and just totally
 kick ass on it and team red as
it is man the r9 series is amazing Fiji
is amazing
HBM ahead of its time the prices get
lower and better yields then hey it'll
be better stuff for now though this is
the most powerful cards you can get in
six inch form factor I mean it is sorry
not form factor but six inch card excuse
me you want a car that's only the size
of PCI slot you want to have
superpower this is a great card for that
and one last thing before I bounce out
of here guys the yesterday when we post
this video you guys saw that I had it up
it was 37 well actually that score was
wrong it's actually 73 is the full temp
under load it's still it's still not bad
at all but not anything like I thought
yesterday so I apologize to all my
people out there please forgive me I was
given the wrong information and even
when I checked on it I was told that
information was a correct information
until finally when I kept asking I was
told there was actually an error we
wrote the number down wrong so it's a
human error but hey we would did the
entire video for your folks I hope you
appreciate it like usual all the
information you guys want to buy this
card find out more information it'll be
down there below that like button
hopefully you guys do be the kind and
style on it and I hope the guys and with
that last one
Fleur there I hope to see you guys back
on the chanter so if you like what you
see and yeah like what's going on
subscribe I had surgery last week I'm
still a little bit what good or bad as
you guys can well see the surgery went
completely successful I should be back
to my old self
we'll be uploading much more videos I
should be
everything should be good so I apologize
to all my pans for the time lapses in
videos and for everything else it's just
been a struggle lately but I love you
folks thanks for watching Tecna tomorrow
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
