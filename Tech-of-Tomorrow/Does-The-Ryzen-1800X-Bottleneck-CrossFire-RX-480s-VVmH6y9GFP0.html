again to the channel for what you know
it more text this time we're going to be
checking out crossfire for 80s in the
1800 X system that's right this is the
rising phoenix system if you guys missed
that we'll have a link down below you
guys can check that out but it's a
pretty nice system eighteen hundred
dollars for an eighteen X system lots of
nice parts the video cards that we
originally use in it is obviously the rx
forty but now we're going to bring the
rx 40 in crossfire to you fans that's
what we're wondering hey how does it
actually work so without any more
talking let's jump right in
like I said folks if you want to see
more details about our test system it is
our rising phoenix system and we'll have
a link down below where you guys can
check out more if you want to like usual
we always use the very latest drivers
that we can get our hands on we use
Windows 10 patched so that's the test
system of the software we use now let's
jump in let's rock out to the benchmark
song and let's check out how does the
1800 X and we'll crossfire with two for
ATS let's rock
now you guys can see that the four
indian cross fires very very well in
most games we see at least double the
performance in a few we see a little bit
less performance ash the singularity
it really wasn't really doing that good
hit man you guys can see in 1080p it
took a hit but in 4k it just blossomed
so just like SLI crossfire has it's good
points and it's bad point but what I'm
seeing from just the minimalistic amount
of testing that we've done is that
crossfire seems to be catching up with
SLI quite a bit now there was a
difference in the CPU temp by 10 degrees
using crossfire cards we had an idle of
34 Celsius but this time our under load
was 53 Celsius we were using the card by
itself the CPU itself was only getting
43 Celsius so there is definitely a heat
exchange difference when using two cards
now you guys can see there actually were
a few differences though in the way the
cards ran on how cool they were the top
card obviously ran cooler than the
bottom card because the bottom card ran
at 36 Celsius an idle and 84 Celsius
under full load and the top card ran at
27 Celsius on their idle and 64 Celsius
under full load so you guys can see
there is the difference between the two
cards one thing will folks to take quick
note if we did use two different cards
for our crossfire configuration we use
one card from XFX and we use one card
from power color and that is the red
devil that we use in most of our videos
we just set all the speeds at the same
speed so that both cards matched we had
no issues whatsoever in our testing all
right Tech fans so I know that's a
really quick video this was pretty
snappy I know that it was but all we're
really trying to get you guys is the
point that these cards run really well
in this system now we have lots of other
stuff coming all of our Intel testing is
being done we'll bring those results to
you we have crossfire other stuff coming
in we have to 1080 eyes that we're going
to be doing in the fly mode we have to
Tenet's we're going to do an SLI mode
I'm trying to get a hold of 972 testing
so just hang on folks we got lots and
lots of more testing coming with the
rides and stuff and now that the risin 5
is going to be here in about a week well
we'll have even more testing for that
but I'm Elric you guys been watching
Tech tomorrow thanks for sticking around
like usual more information will be down
below that like button and we'll see you
guys back here for more tech
on Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
