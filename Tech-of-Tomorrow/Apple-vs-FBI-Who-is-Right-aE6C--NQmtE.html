Braintree hey what's up everybody elric
here today there is great news for
gamers around the world and bat news is
Vulcan it's finally here and the one
point no driver is now out so at this
point right now you guys are going okay
volkan is that like some good but nope
what Vulcan is is Vulcan is basically
the successor to open GL OpenGL has been
around for years but now there's gonna
be more tools and more powerful stuff to
make all of your games play much better
without taking a strain on your hardware
and that's a really cool thing so when
you work from your Android all the way
up to your PC so it doesn't really
matter with your console peasant a pc
master race guy or a phone guy Vulcans
going to have something for you folks
now in its current form Vulcan only is
supported by intel and nvidia graphics
chipsets and even though it's based off
AMD's mantle technology for some reason
AMD only has a beta driver available at
this time but that's still a large
spectrum and a great amount of platforms
to cover from this new API in the mobile
segment Qualcomm is announcing that its
flagship Snapdragon 820 processor will
be the first to play nice with Vulcan
and more specifically the audrina 530
GPU will be able to take advantage of
both the framework and compute features
which means that technologies that need
to really tap into GPU will now be able
to do so another way that I feel that
Vulcan is bringing something positive to
the table is Microsoft is pretty much
moved on like they always have so
they're focusing on the future with
their DirectX 12 and their Windows 10
and all that but with Vulcan you'll be
able to get access to doing all of the
older platforms and older software as
well so that means it's like you're a
person who doesn't want to upgrade their
old software book will be able to still
tap in and make things that make it more
efficient and also just like when
DirectX 12 first came out there was only
one game that supported that was ashes
of the singularity and right now the
only game being supported by Vulcan is
the Talos principle which we released
really soon on Steam
so the bottom line about Vulcan folks is
this the ability to do low-level
programming at the GPU level now right
that will just clarify that what that
means is that they'll be able to take
advantage of all the technology inside
of your GPU which won't have to allow
and relying on the rest of the hardware
system to make your games play well and
Vulcan works across a vast amount of
platforms it works with linux it works
with android windows 7 windows 8.1 and
10 so you guys have older systems and
stuff it'll be able to take care of all
that stuff for you so Vulcan and does
have a lot of potential at this time and
for all you campers out there that have
been waiting for Vulcan your day hath
arrived don't be illogical next up is
something crazy the FBI wants to hack
your iphone that's right they want to be
able to have the ability to actually get
in and backdoor your iPhone so right now
I don't know if you guys folks know this
but if you lose your password it's
really hard to get in to any of your
Apple devices especially your iphone now
criminals out there obviously you can
take your phone and wipe it out but that
erases all your information so with the
FBI is saying is that since there's been
a lot of stuff going on including these
latest attacks in San Bernardino they
want to be able to take your phone not
your phone particular but a criminal's
phone and they want a backdoor into that
phone so they can retrieve the
information now I understand the FBI's
point I understand it completely if they
have criminals and they're trying to get
that information on them that can put
this person away and get the evidence
they want to be able to get it off their
phones so they have incriminating stuff
but the only thing is is this i know you
guys will probably agree with me here so
we do this we say okay it's cool Apple
you know the people in cupertino they
bow down and they say okay wig they give
it to the FBI the FBI is successful to
getting fucked and leaking information
just like anybody else that we're
Snowden stretch so basically you know
information can be leaked so what
happens if yeah you know me go ahead and
they make this and then the FBI somehow
or another goes oh gee whiz we don't
know how it got leaked and now all these
criminals out
have away in your phone that means that
no longer will you have any kind of
protection someone steals your iPhone
they know the back door of it they can
backdoor it e bay it and totally fuck
you around so I don't know I personally
I can see where the FBI wants this and I
can honestly see where the FBI could
help them but it's a very very tricky
very sticky situation and it's very very
dangerous I think that Apple's really
like going holy shit what do we do here
because in honesty I think that a lot of
their fans and a lot of people worldwide
will have a very negative social opinion
about this I really do I want to hear
what you guys think down below do you
guys think though that the federal
government should have a back door to
any of your iDevices I personally I
don't think they should because if they
get it there's such a good chance that
anybody else could get it a spy could
sell it to the Soviet so they could sell
it to China they could sell it to
anybody and you'd all be totally screwed
so I personally him against that let me
hear what you guys think down below but
at this time man it's true the FBI wants
to hack your iphone now this last story
of the day for those people that are a
little bit older you guys will totally
understand what I'm talking about but
when I was a kid there was this thing by
Mattel called the creepy crawler kid and
you can basically make yourself a bunch
of creepy little words arms and legs and
weird stuff at all this pup you know for
kids and it was really cool and kind of
gross and Counting you and the girls ago
ah but anyways it was cool as a kid you
folks out there that i'm talking about
it was a really cool thing so now mattel
is completely revamping their thing
maker with you know a really cool and it
makes everything at home now for kids
who like to make stuff and for parents
want to keep their kids busy this is
going to be a really killer product I
mean he'll be able to make stuff on it
and have fun at home with this machine
now it's three hundred bucks I nope
don't throw it at me I didn't make this
thing but I'm just saying it's really
cool I mean so if you guys know like you
know you know Sidney rich fuck you can
go over to his house and check it out
and play on his stuff but I know that
for a lot of people it's really
expensive but for those people who do
have money though and want to keep their
kids entertained
or just for something to screw around
with and have fun for the older
generation I hope you guys know what I'm
talking about so basically the thing
maker is a 3d printing machine for kids
that's what it is but it's not only
limited to making one thing it comes to
this own app which allows children to
design and make their own toys directly
in this 3d printer now if you guys know
3d printer prices out there go anywhere
from like this price all the way up to
much more a 3d printer is not really you
know a cheap thing but think about this
if you want to keep your kids busy keep
their imagination going and you want to
just have something really cool in the
houses even you would screw up their
kids I mean think about it 3d printing
school you could sit there and play with
your kids forever burn oculus god I hope
I'm saying that right now because I love
your brother but sometimes sometimes
people that's how you say it dude I know
that you have played a lot with your
kids I know there's a lot of other guys
out there we play with their kids and
for you guys out there with kids of that
age I think it would be something really
special the caveat obviously is that the
price is that you know $300 that's
pricey a lot of people in countries that
aren't doing well financially can't
afford this hopefully they'll be cheaper
but it is a very nice toy know before
you guys anything I'm not pay anything
by Mattel but as a kid it brings me a
fond memory to think about that because
it was something really cool and if I
would have the chance to get my kids
this I would have saved money work with
my wife and got them one because I just
think would be really fun and really
interesting stuff and before we wrap up
today's video I want to give a special
shout-out to the people over at
braintree for make in today's video
