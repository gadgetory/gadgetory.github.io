my release video on the brand new LG V
30 phone why do you guys thought it was
review or wondering why I wasn't beating
it up but it wasn't a review whatsoever
it was just a first look of the phone I
had a thing for about a day literally
not even 24 hours I mean to bring the
video to the table will be having the
scores and all the other stuff in the
future but we were talking about
yesterday is what about if you're a
person who you know you're either drunk
or just so messed up you know was going
up and you left your phone in your pants
and decided that you were gonna go ahead
and you know take your little V 30 for a
spin in the washing machine so they
claim that it's waterproof up to 30
minutes so why not let's throw this
thing in my washer back here behind me
there are things going here and let's
toss the phone in the washing machine
for 20 minutes and let's see how it does
on the washing machine test kind of
crazy but hey
let's see what happens
alright so there you guys have it about
25 minutes inside of a washing machine
and well v30 s working just fine even
after the water test it's kind of crazy
I can still scroll so everything and
yeah the phone is a completely utterly
up and working everything is working on
it not a problem whatsoever with the
phone after being in the washing machine
for almost a half an hour so that means
not only was it submerged it was
agitated from the agitator so not only
has been water broken in it's been
agitated it's still not angry with me
see it's coming on it's got a nice big
smile on his face so I have to say at
the end of the day you don't really have
to worry about the v30 getting ruined by
it you know water so if you accidentally
jump into a pool you maybe even fall
into the ocean with it as long as it's
not you know below 1.5 meters for over a
half an hour I have to say that it's
honestly going to pass the water tests
now my question for you guys is I want
to do an interesting drop test so I'm
gonna have a poll and I want you guys to
tell me in the comments below what you
guys would like to see in a drop test
and I know people have took them up in
planes and all that kind of stuff but
none that's just like realistic so I'd
like to have a drop test
that's real world style and still
something that might happen so down
below let me have all of your ideas and
all that stuff and I'd greatly
appreciate it and we'll bring that video
to you as well but you guys can see man
the LGV 30 it holds up to what it says 1
it specs one one one one it specs no on
its specs I wasn't trying to say it to a
Spanish person one like one in a million
restaurants no wasn't trying to say that
but it's still working it's good to go
so I'd say they didn't lie in that
aspect whatsoever now we just need to do
the drop test and see if those 14
military spec tests that they ran can
match up to our real-world testing I'm
Network hope you guys are having a
wonderful weekend here in America it's
Labor Day and so we're all chillin we'll
see you guys back on the channel for
more tech real soon beast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
