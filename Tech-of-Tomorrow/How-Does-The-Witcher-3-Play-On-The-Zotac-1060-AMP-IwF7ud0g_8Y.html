once again to techyv tomorrow or today
we're going to be showing you guys some
awesome game footage of the game witcher
3 which is very popular around the world
and it's an absolutely fun game to play
now a lot of people out there don't have
a lot of money they're always looking
for a budget entry-level card to play
their games on so today we're going to
show you some footage from the GTX amp
Edition 1060 from the people over at
ZOTAC so with that said though let's
jump in and let's check out the witcher
3 and i'm just gonna say right up front
the hair works thing it may affect
testing during AMD testing but for our
testing we saw that you know the hair
works on to the hair works off on an
nvidia card really doesn't change the
score very much whatsoever so with that
said though let's jump in let's check
out 1080 footage and 1440 footage and
see how well it plays on an overclocked
out-of-the-box GTX 1063 folks who follow
the channel you have seen our test
system before it is the Icarus it
features an i5 processor so it's right
like in the middle of all the processes
out there so it's not a high-end system
it's not a low-end system it's a nice
button system that lots of people can't
afford first up let's check out that
footage in 1080p
as you guys can see gameplay is pretty
damn smooth as we go around kicking ass
around the game everything looks
visually beautiful cards not running hot
there's a low sound in the room while
we're playing the game I cannot hear the
card like playing so loud and you guys
obviously you know are not hearing the
car being really loud so the fan even
once turned up isn't like a blazing
lawnmower
got my oil you
-
Eternal Father for Texas
so to keep it
it's also
I don't know more please
rain makes the city even more dreary
know what a freak
and see any help
teachers more cautious than I thought
can't get too close they just could
adjust the composition where they
Oh
grunts by here
begging to be healthy this
he sends something gotta stay further
back
oh damn this weather double-size
wanna smack wanna smack Oh
which is
more cautious than I thought can't get
too close
God let even you into the city
there's a draft should be an exit here
Klug wouldn't have sent us here if there
wasn't must be a lever on this wall that
will open super PAC
free city of new that released it means
something the very reasons only mages
came here after the massacre clock
meaning thought they'd be safe from
we're out of its Reapers
instead they jumped out of the frying
pan in the fog but now the grad stands
on top of a mountain a coin and winning
homes how I use me oh come on
six months isn't that long it's not like
I'm senile but you do have a history of
amnesia
I've recovered my memory completely good
that should stop people from taking
advantage of you
someone's been taking advantage of me I
have for one
I've never even intimated we need to
hurry
ah
I'll cover half the space you take the
other half look for evidence of rat
activity mm-hmm thing is I know what
evidence of Manticore activity looks
like but rodents
Jerald we both rather be somewhere else
I'd rather be sitting in a World Council
meeting but they killed my king
look the crevices and droppings once we
place this incense what then I'll cast a
spell and the rats will leave you can't
do that without sprinkling incense don't
really feel up to looking for rat shit
stop whining
think I plucked every all in there all
right you get ready for some magic
fireworks once I activate the incense
we'll have
Wow
yes
and traffic control if not for you we
need to find Brandon now let's check out
more gameplay only at 14:40 for those of
you with a bigger monitor bigger is
better I've heard in some corners
troopers were already committed
stop go away leave it
alright time to check the Attic put it
down please
plus blood don't spill it please
where the next rooms blocked
strange stuff a doll drawing shows it
lying in a cradle maybe I should find
one
please ask blood don't spit please
another masterpiece and heaven and a
blackened great know Joey a riddle saw
an oven in the cellar maybe I'll find
another clue there stop leave it
oh god damn this is my shot fakes
civilization why don't you think you are
Isis olena scabbard
the black ones are tracing gorillas
around a kid when he woods novigrad safe
rate here time our vaccine
Oh
now one shoe
boys
suppose
cost you double
maybe there
Oh
I never come back yes stinking studies
OHS we walk it was too late to surrender
reminds me of a piece of war yeah yeah
was like she never left
Oh told you this poison
ah ha ha I'd note from a grateful Muse
from the finest vineyards every last one
who knows the fruit of the fruit of the
vine like dandelion hmm this the loot he
got from the elves of dole Befana Hey
must have been an agreed rush to leave
it behind
well don't just stand there read we
might learn something
well how long you gonna make
all right Tech fans so there you have it
you guys can see with hair works off at
1080 it's getting about 60 frames per
second so that's pretty awesome
and at 1440 it drops down to about half
that at 30 cents you get that extra
pixels on your screen but at the end of
the day if you're looking for a killer
card to play all your games on the amp
edition is a pretty badass card if you
guys saw swear you did the superclocked
version from EVGA this is pretty much
right up there maybe even a wee bit
faster we have the full review coming
for this card we'll have a link down
below if you want to check out more
information about this card right now
but that's it well guys see you left
we'll see you guys back here on Tekken
tomorrow with more vids and uh we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
