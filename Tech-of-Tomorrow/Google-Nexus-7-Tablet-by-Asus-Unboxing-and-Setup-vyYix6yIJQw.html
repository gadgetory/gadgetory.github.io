description below but we had a white
google nexus 7 in here before that a
friend of mine had it was a developer
type cat now we have the regular one
here in the house now that everybody's
gonna gonna order it so if you were out
there and you ordered this thing this is
the one that you would get i have in the
box back here behind me not a lot to
this i don't know if you guys notice but
the things totally geared towards google
you know using all their products all
their applications all that stuff it's
two hundred dollars there now available
everywhere they use all kinds of
different apps including the kindle app
for reading books you know all kinds of
good s'mizza ting so let me go ahead I
mean boxes aren't all that exciting to
you guys I know that over this channel
you guys on all thrilled about boxes and
you guys always ask all the time what's
the difference between this channel and
motherboards I dark well motherboards
org is my corporate partner channel and
this channel is the channel like you
with my buddy jesus so you ask me the
difference is what this channel has no
corporate sponsors this is our just go
go go have fun channel so we'll take the
thing out set it down over here got the
box right here there are two seals on
the box so let me show you the sale why
I look for the same left us tonight here
she is so now we're going to cut the
seal with the sale right here along the
edge oh you know what might be easier
packs you get a better grip do it like
this one quick incision another quick
incision I'm a doctor don't try this at
home and with
so a little thing out here try to get
the box out and the other video I don't
if you guys watch it but as soon as I
actually took the top box off of the
product that my friend had I broke it
that's right right off the bat I broke
it because I had dropped it out of the
box and it went back together and work
forever but I kind of broke it all right
now I got the seals off we'll go ahead
and take it make sure we're not going to
drop it on the ground very carefully
okay so let's hit the Cameron to resume
down here and you guys stop staring
staring at the crotch just knock it off
pay attention to the Nexus 7 this
video's about it I know I'm sexy but
just watch it so here you go this is it
no its glory if you guys want all the
features i will have the camera and put
all those in there as we're going to
show you this so we can shoot it while
the features that are on there you guys
known as a high-resolution screen just
go ahead we're going to take the plastic
off now really the only from this and
the other one is that the other one had
a white background and the only
difference between this one and when we
showed you previously is that this point
it has a black matte finish on the back
nipple have white you can see that it's
clearly made by a sous like they're in
the bottom of our favorite companies out
there for hardware here's the front
there are connections on it for
connecting and charging and your
headphones down here at the bottom you
guys can see those very clearly
look around the side here we have two
more buttons one is returning the unit
on figure out which one real quick see
if I can power the ended up yes i can so
here here's the unit powering up for its
first time in action dun-dun-duh camera
not to tell me when it's actually done
because i can't see it you see it better
than me not by x-ray vision like
spider-man I could see it but I can nope
we're at the welcome screen so let me go
over here and it's saying english united
states currently that still is the most
common language I say currently because
it could change in any day now but for
right now it's still English so we're
going to hit a little welcome button now
we have the select Wi-Fi the camera is a
good angle in this you can see
motherboards that org is in there so the
very first thing I'm going to do is set
up my Wi-Fi I'll enter the password now
we are connecting give it a second here
this tablet is connecting to Wi-Fi got
google so all right then i have my
google account so i'm going to log into
that now real quick here i shall skip
that because you get into wait so they
want me to obviously get my google
account like right off the bat so i'm
trying to get out of it just to show you
guys now that's going to give me a thing
for google location it's and skip past
that this tablet belongs to so i can put
my name in here just ate seem I'm
bridging my tablet to me mr. like Ferris
actually this is kind of a more of an
unboxing it's an unboxing is showing you
guys you know highly basically to set
the thing up when you first get it
keyboard also guys very easy to use much
better than any other phone I've ever
put my fingers on we're in I mean on
yeah something like that so get past
that Google services I'm just going to
go past that setup setup is now complete
it's going to buff on that now it's
going to make me sign to my account to
do most stuff I can still surf the
internet though hit the search bar no
thanks and I want to sign in anything
yet has voice activation of here so I
can search for stuff the best porn in
the world oh I'm sorry Oh wrong time
wrong time wait back back back sorry
just kidding but it does a little
microphone button over here and about
the microphone button how many miles to
the moon well I guess I don't have it
set up for voice recognition or some not
to mess with it more but usually you can
actually talk into this thing and it
will give you a voice response I don't
know why it's not doing it now who is
the president of the United States nope
it tells me Barack Obama but it won't
say it so Optimus with that so here's
this part of the folks you guys have
seen it I gave you the setup it was very
easy very quickly so i basically unboxed
it it's logged into my network and i'm
up using the nexus 7 with then basically
you know a minute min and a half very
simple to use after you do that you can
go and login down
kinds of programs and it's pretty cool
right now if you add a credit card to
your account they instantly give you
twenty dollars to spend in their store
