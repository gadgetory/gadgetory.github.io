Gaming Mouse and is it any good for you
I don't know let's see
so check this folks the people over at
etekcity have this mouse called a
scrolling Gaming Mouse now when I first
heard this thing I was like wow what the
heck did management send me like a
vertical Gaming Mouse like what's the
different wean a vertical game Mouse and
I gotta admit my first thought I kind of
scoffed a little bit of bad I was like
okay you know cool looks cool but
whatever does it really work but I have
to say that after using it and for the
amazing price of only $15 it's on sale
for right now this is actually a really
dynamic product now everyday use of a
mouse involves you moving your wrist
back and forth back and forth back and
forth till eventually there's two points
on your wrist that gets sore now when
you're using a vertical gaming mouse
though this stress is eliminated because
it's a lot more natural it's actually
just like having your hand sitting on a
desk and naturally moving it back and
forth
now the etekcity this scrolling thing
features six buttons and an automatic
DPI changing button on the top of it now
the button layout is kind of like this
the first two buttons are located on the
left hand side then on top we have the
adjustable dpi button now the adjustable
dpi is like this you can change it from
six hundred to a thousand to sixteen
hundred and although I think many people
out there saying oh man hey that's low
dpi it's not gonna help me for gaming
trust me
this mouse works completely different
than other mice and it really works and
actually the lower the dpi I found to
actually be better for this particular
Mouse and as you guys can see when I
turn to 1600 the mouse is just flying
all over the screen with little or no
effort whatsoever and on the right hand
side we see on the top the etekcity logo
the left control button the right
control button and the scroll wheel
which also doubles as another button and
located in the bottom we can see the
laser tracker and here we've got a
school shot where you guys can actually
see the laser shooting on the desk now
another thing about this mouse is that
it comes with this kind of a foot rest
or hand rest on it me personally I found
it a lot more comfortable to just simply
remove this it's very easy just take it
off the bottom and throw at the camera
just like that hey you probably hear I
hit it right in the chest like a
bull's-eye I'm good
alright folks so that's pretty much what
the mouse looks like the button
configuration and all that stuff I want
to say also that it's just completely
plug and play it works in both the Mac
and a PC so regardless what your wiener
you want to play around with this mouse
will work for you now I guess at the
beginning when I first got the etekcity
scroll endurance I was like okay you
know what if you guys sent me its $15
miles this thing's not gonna be that
great in gaming but you want to know
something it actually does work pretty
solid and gave me across the board now
the laser sometimes does to me seem like
it's not the most totally accurate thing
in the planet but like I said before you
actually have to set the DPI kind of low
otherwise the mouse is all over the
place which is kind of different a lot
of people may disagree with this but I
really like this thing set right in the
middle use it this thing at a thousand
you're getting the perfect balance
between speed and slowness it works
great for scrolling the internet great
for doing games and for $15 I don't know
I have to say I think this thing is a
solid thumbs up here in Tekken tomorrow
it's very inexpensive very easy on your
body its ergonomics its guns remove the
bottom little thing there the cable
cable is a little bit kind of flimsy I
don't know something greatest cable in
the world it's not braided or anything
like that but then again think about it
you're paying $15 um this particular one
in my hand gonna be honest with you
folks I'm going to give it to my mom I
think she will absolutely love this this
is one thing I want to really really
talk about folks if you're someone out
there and you're having wrist problems
or you have carpal tunnel all that kind
of stuff from the regular mouse this
mouse will definitely work much better
for you on the real I know you guys
probably think in a while you know it's
low price but you know what it's a
little priced because hey it's not a lot
to it but it works so that's what I'm
gonna say about it I mean I really don't
know you know what I'll tell you guys I
mean $15 a very low price I can keep
saying that over and over and over and
probably on like a broken record but
it's just so true a lot of people just
spend that on one meal so if you want
something to work you want something
that will not wear your hand off six
buttons very very urban
it grips almost like an exercise machine
then I think the etekcity scroll
endurance is something you're going to
want to check out I'm going to actually
include this on my next rounder product
when I do the best of bounces under $25
I will definitely be including this bad
boy in there so I'm Eric even watching
Tekken tomorrow we'll see you guys back
here in the channel for more interesting
stuff next week would you guys like to
see some kind of like crazy

stuff leave a comment down below because
we were thinking about going out getting

usual all the information will be down
