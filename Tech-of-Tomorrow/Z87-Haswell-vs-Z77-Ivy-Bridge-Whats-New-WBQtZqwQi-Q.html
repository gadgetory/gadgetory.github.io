back once again to another edition of
tech of tomorrow you guys can see that I
have mr. Asus JJ here with me and what
is he doing here
well you guys unless you've been like on
another planet all know that heads will
is getting ready to be released and
today we're going to tell you the
differences between the z87 and z77
platforms so I'm gonna hand the
microphone over JJ and he's gonna rock
and roll all this information for you
folks oh what's going on man what's up
that's good to see it's been a little
bit since I last yeah I thought you like
disappeared on us or something nah man
definitely not so like you said you know
it's a really exciting time you know
within the component industry we've got
a brand new chipset brand new CPU coming
along with that chipset I know that we
always got a lot of questions when
chipset CP launches is that how is this
different from the last generation right
what differentiates it yeah you know
what what kind of improvements are we
gonna see what kind of changes are going
to see you know should I buy this other
chipset that might be on the market you
know and things like that so like you
noted we already might now have on the
market z77 and we also have x79 for the
ultra high-end space right so z87 is
just a replacement for the z77 chipset
we're gonna have two SKUs pretty much
just like the previous generation where
we're gonna have a 4770k and a 4670 case
so k denotes it's an overclocking part
so that means it's an enthusiast
oriented part and that pretty much
replaces your previous 3770k and
actually we're gonna see a lot of
differences actually and overclocking
with this as well correct we'll get into
some other videos but there are some big
differences in overclocking a few people
out there who like to overclock right
yeah I mean I think there's gonna be
factors to evaluate I think total
frequency is actually pretty similar but
there are going to definitely be
considerations as far as how you work
with the platform that are gonna be
different than a previous generation so
you know for a lot of the basic things
when we take a look at the the
motherboard side there's not gonna be a
lot of things that jump out either that
are going to be different you know if we
take a look at let's say connectivity
first up most people you know remember
that there was six ports that were
natively provided by z77 and then if a
motherboard vendor decided to put any
more on like this board where we have 10
ports that was done through additional
controllers no change here z87 is still
going to be six ports but Intel's done
something great and they've updated all
the PCH ports to be sad a 60 capable so
that means inherently compared to the
generation when you only had two they're
now getting six now will your board
still incorporate the as media chipset
as well to include additional ports yes
so of course you know we always have
enthusiasts we have people that love
storage you want to be able to do more
so we're going to be able to continue to
support having boards that have as much
as 10 ports on them so you have more
than enough connectivity for everything
you need to do and you like storage in
your motherboard does it make you order
I suppose in some way for people out
there they love to store their photos
their pictures the games or whatever it
might be so for us if you just got to
make it happen for them in terms of USB
3 connectivity there's been a little bit
of a change as well previous generation
you had four ports of course you know
for our more feature-rich boards we had
even more ports than that through adding
through secondary controllers or things
along those lines
this generation Intel officially gives
you six ports that are based on the
chipset so you're getting an improvement
boasting SATA and in USB now does that
mean you that you'll have a choice
between running dual and triple channel
memory does it translate like that or
just the availability of ports just just
in terms of ports but that's a great
point if we go over to the memory side
of things we're still talking about a
dual channel platform as opposed to
let's say quad channel which is going to
be on next 79 so x 79 is still going to
give you significantly more flexibility
at putting in more memory and having a
higher total bandwidth and let's just
make clear the audience this is not
geared to replace X 79 at all correct
correct I mean in terms you know if we
just lay that out right now at the end
of the day X 79 is gonna have more piece
a lanes it's going to have more memory
bandwidth more memory density the CPUs
themselves are gonna have more cash and
more cores so if you're still looking
for kind of the outright highest end
platform with most connectivity and most
expansion it's generally gonna be the X
mu9 platform z87
and Haswell are the fourth generation
core series processors are still going
to be awesome and they're gonna serve
probably most of you guys great in terms
of what you're looking to do but you
know x79 still definitely has its place
in the market and it's not going
anywhere right so you're still dealing
with the dual channel enabled board the
official memory support has gone to be
higher than what it was previously a lot
of our boards in the previous generation
will qualified up to 2800
for this generation we have
qualification up to 29 33 now is that
going to be through an XMP setting you
know like always there's official memory
support that's sanctioned by the CPU
which is up to 1600 and anything greater
than that will
ten potentially be varied by the cpu
quality so most of the cpu is actually
we found over 75 percent can hold up to
2800 memory speeds even in four dimm
configurations but there are going to be
other considerations to keep in mind and
we'll talk about the network locking but
you know definitely memory is going to
continue to be you know pretty
straightforward no changes here ddr3
just like it was before you're gonna be
able to take your previous generation
kits if you want them and roll them over
to here so pretty much everything that
you have right now if you had a Sandy
border Ivy Bridge setup you could take
everything but your CPU and transfer
onto your board that's a great point to
make though is that physically the
socket is going to be pretty much the
same in terms of the dimensions and
requirement for any guys that are using
current generation CPU heatsink like
water coolers all that type of stuff
everything does another yeah you could
you could have a closed-loop water
cooling solution you could have a full
water block or you could just have a
regular you know a fan fan and heatsink
combination and it will work so you
don't have to worry about that there's
any change or requirement for you to go
out and buy a new heatsink your old
heatsink will work entirely okay you
know there'll be some differences in
terms of thermals but you know we'll
talk that's actually pretty good for an
upgrade path a lot of times you know
upgrade paths you got to go out and buy
all-new everything with this you just
have to buy your board your CPU all the
rest of your parts will transfer over
and continue to work it will save you
money as an upgrade path agreed the last
point will probably be that the CPU
itself is a little bit different in
terms of the previous generation intel
has gone ahead and actually integrated
what's called the IVR so the IVR is
pretty much the power regulation or the
power management technology that used to
sit externally outside the motherboard
and it's now been fully integrated
inside the CPU now looks another for
signal Jake since you're saying that how
does that actually affect the CPU since
all technology being taken from the
board and the CPU is not going to cause
some additional heat inside the CPU as
well there are some changes in terms of
how the CPU responds and you know I
think for the most part that's stock
performance it's not going to be really
a big change there is a little bit
difference in the TDP the previous
generation was 77 watts this generation
is 84 watts but it's pretty close I
think we're more consideration comes in
a place how you work in terms of
overclocking in the platform and you
know we'll talk about in the
overclocking video but you know us as a
motherboard vendor that still doesn't
change the requirements to have
good quality power design and power
implementation so all the things like
you know your your cut your inductors or
your chokes you know your capacitors
your MOSFETs your drivers that's still
the power delivery components those
don't go anyway they'll still have to be
on the motherboard it's just the
controller chip so for years if you guys
watch the videos that we've done we've
always talked about Asus leading with
digital power design they've pretty much
taken that digital power design and
incorporate it inside the CPU so guys
with all those features that you guys
have had on your boards before all that
stuff is now actually incorporated
inside a lot of it you know there's a
little bit of an Intel twist on some of
it but a large degree of the amount of
flexibility in tuning that we've offered
because of a digital design is now
inherently consistent on any one of the
boards that will support this can I ask
you a question oh Jenny how does that
actually translate though to the
end-user like so a guy out there who
doesn't know much about computers is all
like how does that translate over to
them by moving all that technology onto
the GPU and not being on the board I
mean how does it actually work for the
news well the end user notice anything
at all really different or that's just a
technology change I think it's gonna be
pretty transparent especially if you've
been using our boards it's not gonna
feel inherently different because you're
gonna see so much of the same type of
options all in the house yeah you know I
mean hopefully you guys are gonna be
taking a look at our product but you
know if you're looking at competitors
you know it's probably more I believe
just a lot of the competitors to be
honest because they're gonna get a
better quality experience in terms of
the consistency on power regulation
power management options as opposed to
maybe the older designs that they were
using in the past alright so if anything
there's more consistency there but in
terms of the board design as a whole for
this platform there are still things
that us as a motherboard vendor have to
do and we'll talk about that when we
cover more of our board design
did you guys kidnap Mitas yeah we'll
talk about that when we get the board
design cuz definitely we've got an
entire you guys don't see all the blue
is gone and the gold is in so I'm
thinking that these guys kidnapped Midas
and had them put the Midas touch on all
the reports but for the most part I
think that gives you a pretty good
update you know otherwise pretty
straightforward in terms that the
chipset is an improvement in every
single way to the previous generation
platform there's nothing that got
reduced down in terms of functionality
they only maybe other thing that
sometimes you guys might be wondering
about is the graphics performance for
the most part the most advanced form of
the graphics architecture that the
fourth-generation core series processors
bring to the table is
only going to be specific to the mobile
space or you know tablets or small
form-factor type solutions for this
generation you're going to have an
improvement but it's gonna be pretty
close to what Ivybridge graphics
performance was although we get the
village who now drive three digital
displays plus higher resolution support
for even upcoming 4k technology so I
think that wraps up most of what we have
that's new to z87 and the new Haswell or
fourth-generation series processors yeah
so stay tuned folks because we're
actually gonna have lots of more videos
with JJ as we actually go over
individually a lot of these products
talk about some of the overclocking and
actually some really cool systems so I
know Eric thanked JJ from azuz for
coming to being our guest today and
we've got lots more stuff coming for you
guys here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
