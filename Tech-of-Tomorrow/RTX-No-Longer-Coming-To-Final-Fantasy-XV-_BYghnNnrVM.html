another kick in the proverbial balls of
Nvidia that's right
if you guys happen to catch yesterday's
video where I showed you that r-tx
really kills the performance in
battlefield 5 something I really wasn't
expecting at all but now right after
that we get more bad news on the r-tx
front this time on final fantasy 15 so
check it out
the main guy the main producer at Final
Fantasy has left the company and it
seems like now everything that has to do
with r-tx an Nvidia is kind of out the
window now they do have DL ss6 MD I've
got DL that says support but only in a
benchmark it's not actually in the game
so for people out there who really
wanted to see you know exactly you know
what all this great stuff you know
surrounding touring and all that was
going to do on Final Fantasy 15 well
guess what you're in for a major letdown
because unless something seriously
changed in the company it seems right
now that even though we had all that
good news the other day about hey
multiple games coming out and November
they're gonna support it battlefield 5
Colossus you know all these great games
Wolfenstein 2 we're gonna support it I
mean hopefully Wolfenstein 2 will still
get the sport it's supposed to get with
the shading and all that stuff we'll
have to see his time floats by but right
now it's just crazy now Final Fantasy
has been around a long time I mean
obviously you run Final Fantasy 15 so
you imagine probably maybe two you maybe
possibly three years in between games
that's a lot of time to be making that
game and I'm sure that a lot of people
out there who are you know I'm sitting
around going hey I want to see what my
brand-new 20 atti or 20 80 or 2070
actually did in this game well now
you're going to be sorely disappointed
because you're not going to get to see
it whatsoever and honestly it was really
disappointing for me to see the
performance dips in battlefield 5
honestly I mean if you guys happen to
miss the video I'll have a link down
below you can check it out but really
man the bottom line was that 4k getting
about 30 frames per second less and on
1080 I cut 60 frames less with r-tx on
which really makes no sense whatsoever
you'd think it
or K it'd be the bigger hit but no it's
kind of in Reverse at 4k it's actually
doing better it's probably not getting
bottleneck whatsoever and that's the
reason why it's doing that
but so far RTX you know performance
seems like it's a performance killer so
I mean how many people out there maybe
at the end of the day will even really
care you know if Final Fantasy 15 even
gets you know the DL SS in RTX support
if it doesn't get it who knows that
people even care I'd like to know your
guys's opinion so please leave a comment
down below I know that so far what we've
seen from RT X has been pretty much a
disappointment across the board but who
knows maybe some people are still like
really hoping like I am I always try to
keep the positive side of things and
hope for the best with you know whatever
company's being out there I hope for the
best but sometimes things just they she
hope for don't happen so all the poll
let me hear what you guys think do you
guys think that Final Fantasy 15 not
getting r-tx not getting any BLS support
is a big deal or do you really simply
don't care whatsoever and you just think
that RT X is hype and that it doesn't
matter whatsoever this is a pretty quick
video today though but I just thought it
was kind of relevant you know to people
out there who are waiting around going
hey I have this brand new you know RT X
card and gee I'd like to be able to play
some games and see what it does well
we've kind of seen what it does so far
and so far it's been unimpressive so I'm
not really too worried about any of my
games having RT X are not having RT X
it's not really in my bonnet in my hat
right now I don't really care I'm fine
with the games I'm playing and a party X
to the surface well at least there was
you know some more frame rates in the
2080 I but that's really about it I'm
lrq been watching Tekken tomorrow we'll
have more tech for you tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
