tomorrow we're covering all the biggest
PC games to come out this holiday season
and today we're bringing our full review
of Batman Arkham origins from the guys
at WB games Montreal which is the same
team responsible for making the Arkham
City remake for the Wii U not the
original two games which is made by
rocksteady now does this fact hold it
back from being as good as the others
let's go ahead and find out
so to begin with this game is extremely
buggy the games been out for a little
over two weeks now and it seems as
though for every bug they fix about two
more get discovered or created in their
place
these bugs have varied from minor
inconveniences and odd events to
situations that require you to reload
you're safe because you can't make
progress or in some extreme cases that
have been reported The Lost game
progress I myself had to reload save
points repeatedly mainly due to some of
the fight events not triggering properly
like needing to interrogate a gang
member and the options simply not
prompting now of course problems like
this can be fixed over time but a
botched launch like this does mean that
you're better off waiting to see all the
bugs fixed rather than jump ahead and
spend your money now now once you get a
chance to actually play the game because
the bugs are fixed or you just work your
way through it right now and hope for no
major problems to show up you'll find
that it's actually a really solid Batman
game visually it's nice and smooth with
a decently detailed albeit barren City
now in our system which includes a gtx
780 and an i7 4770k processor running on
the settings you see here we got average
frame rates of 70.8 and 80.2 with
physics on and off on 2560 by 1440 and
on 1920 by 1080 we got average frame
rates of 92 and 124 it's pretty obvious
that WB games Montreal took the approach
of if it's not broke don't fix it as
this game has a lot in common with
Arkham City including reusing a lot of
the same areas on the map albeit
slightly redesigned since its earlier in
the timeline as well as we're using a
lot of the same combat mechanics and
gadgets from the earlier games the
free-flow combat system works the same
as it did in Arkham City though there
are a few new enemies that force you to
adjust your tactics a bit including
martial artists that can also
counter-attack or just big bruiser
enemies that you have to dodge the
system itself is extremely fluid and
still one of the most standout aspects
of the game's design offering a stylish
combat system that relies heavily on
built up momentum and skilled timing of
button presses with a good deal of
situational awareness one new gimmick I
really liked was the updated Detective
Mode which has you're not only analyzing
clues but also recreating crime scenes
which makes the whole activity a lot
more interactive and there's a number of
main story and side quests that revolve
around its use storyline wise this game
takes place before the first two and
only one year into Bruce Wayne's time as
The Dark Knight now I really think WB
games did a great job on this because
they did a really good job of respecting
a lot of Batman tropes and conventions
while still doing enough distinct and
unique things to make it their own you
know
because it's so early in Batman's career
a number of familiar setting pieces have
yet to be established and you see how
they develop over the course of origin
story line with the current time showing
Alfred constantly disapproving of
Bruce's career choice the populist
thinking he's a myth and the police
force in its entirety being a lot more
corrupt and directly opposed to Batman's
actions they did a solid job writing the
story and while it's a bit slow and weak
at first once you hit the game's
midpoint it's able to stand almost
toe-to-toe with Arkham City's now well
the story itself is interesting and the
game's level designs are very
reminiscent of Arkham City's one place
where I feel like this one really fell
short in comparison is its boss battles
while still fun and in some cases quite
challenging a lot of them rely a lot
more on simple mastery of the games free
flow combat system rather than require
more unique tactics or gadgets like in
Arkham City only two of them in fact
really worked that much differently when
compared to just fighting regular tough
enemies in comparison to Arkham City
which had a lot of really flavorful boss
fights like Solomon Grundy mr. freeze or
Clayface the game is still a lot of fun
despite this it's just one of those
things that I feel really heavily
impacts how memorable the overall
experience is when so much time has
passed since playing now the one big
change in new addition to Batman Arkham
origins is the multiplayer mode which is
developed by Splash Damage the same guys
behind brink and enemy territory quake
Wars as well as a few other shooters and
multiplayer modes in this mode players
fight as a member of one of three teams
two teams of three that consist of gang
members loyal to Bane or Joker and one
team of two consisting of Batman and
Robin
the two gangs feud by wiping each other
out with limited reinforcements as well
as a territory control mechanic that
helps increase and recover more
reinforcements over time while this is
happening the Batman and Robin players
stalk both teams and try to scare both
away by feeling an intimidation meter
which is accomplished by mixing up
different forms of knockouts getting
killed lowers this meter and rewards the
game responsible with an immediate
additional reinforcement when playing
multiple matches in a row players take
turns being randomly selected for who
gets to be the heroes people can opt out
and whoever was playing heroes before
are automatically excluded for the next
match both games play very similarly at
first but feature different special
gadgets and one of the most fun aspects
of this game-mode is once the match has
come so far
teams can fight over getting to summon
their respective boss allowing one lucky
player to turn into the melee powerhouse
that is Bane or the more long-range
Joker this match type is actually pretty
fun though I feel like it needs to offer
a better tutorial for playing as the
heroes
especially since tactics don't work
exactly the same as they do in the
single-player it also feels like heroes
end up having the Tempur time due to
their smaller numbers and the fact that
the Raptors aren't nearly as safe as
they are in the single-player game
because human players actually know to
look up I also have to applaud the
game's customization options as there
are a lot of different detailed choices
for how your character looks and there
are some pretty silly Batman and Robin
options like looking like you're from
the animated series the only thing that
really bothered me with the
customization system is that it doesn't
make entire sense to me for the two
different gangs to level at different
rates since so many abilities are shared
between them it's a fun side distraction
of a mode nothing that's gonna stay in
the limelight particularly long but it
could take on having a 3-way multiplayer
mode featuring heroes and villains and
worth at least trying if you're already
grabbing the game for the single-player
I would like to note though that the
multiplayer mode does also have its good
share of bugs just like the
single-player including some systems
being completely incapable of playing
them right now until future patches come
overall batman arkham origins does a
great job of living up to its
predecessor with the only thing holding
it back right now is its current lack of
stability the game is totally worth
playing
it's just that currently as the pc
version goes you're better off waiting
to all the bugs are fixed or until you
can find it on sale well that was our
review of Batman Arkham origins if you
guys want to grab the game for yourself
