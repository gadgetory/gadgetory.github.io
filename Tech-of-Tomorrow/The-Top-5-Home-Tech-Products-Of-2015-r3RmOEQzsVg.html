thank all of you folks just right off
the bat though for falling along and I
love giving you guys all that great
stuff now the end of the deer is drawing
to a close it's getting near the end of
the year and so with that I thought I'd
bring you guys what I thought were some
of the totally cool products for smart
home so pretty much this video will be
well I consider to be the top five smart
home products that you can get may start
all the way by basically at your front
door all the way through your kitchen
and actually all the way into your
bedroom so pretty much with this
technology all of your life can be
monitored filmed paid attention to
pretty much through your smart device
your iPhone your Android phone your
tablet whatever you got that supports
these type of things you can monitor
them from your house so the first thing
we're going to check out is a product
for the people over at motor roll this
is the focus 73b and this is a really
cool thing because it's a camera that
mounts outside your door that you can
totally operate and control like I said
off your smart device so let's real
quick let's check out this device now
right off the bat I'm going to address
the elephant in room you guys are going
out work why did you not install stuff
okay I'm gonna tell you I did install
this stuff basically you guys know I had
to move I was able to get my lease
extended a few more months before I get
my new house so all of these products
least most of them will be installed
over there but I still want you guys to
see them because they're from 2015 now
this is this little bad boy right here
let me just go ahead look quick for you
guys in to do kind of a quick little
unboxing so you guys can check it out
now if this thing works off your home
Wi-Fi pretty much like all these type of
devices do some of them don't actually
use your Wi-Fi but this is one of the
ones that does and then everything is
actually inside the box and we just real
quickly take a pop here get rid of the
box right here is inside of here all
your instruction manuals and everything
are right here this thing's very simple
and easy to install as well you don't
have to have any kind of degree or
anything like that to install it I'm
just trying to figure
when all the stuff is it's been a couple
days actually looked at it see what's
inside of here okay here's all your
wiring your cabling and all that stuff
that's all we get in here all your power
stuff all the screws amount of your wall
all your redhead anchors and all that
stuff they're all here as well now all
of this stuff I will say as far as these
products that go outside your home the
first tour this in their product from
door bird these things all require a
little bit of knowledge on how to
install stuff if you're somebody who's
not familiar at all with using tools
whatsoever you're going to need a friend
or somebody who does to help you install
these things I just want to be honest
they all have on their boxes easy
installation okay yeah if you're a
person who is your way around a hammer
and electricity and that kind of stuff
sure it's easy but what if you're not
one of those people so if you're not one
of those people I want to be very
upfront with you that you will need to
have that done and some help with that
um luckily I have Anthony Reynolds hey
you know him he builds our systems hope
he's also my guy for electronic and all
the other stuff no you get this little
thing out of carton the really cool
things about this though are that you
can view it through this Hubble system
at 720p and very space-age looking a
little sidearm here it's all sealed up
with plastic and everything right here
I'll go ahead just take this stuff off
so you guys can see real quick it's nice
and beautiful and new now with this it's
cool i like it you can move it around so
you can pretty much be anywhere away
from your home and if you're having one
of those really paranoid moments you can
simply get on your device hop on it take
a look through this and you can move it
tilt it spin it around and where you set
it in your front yard you'll pretty much
have a full view of that entire area
that you can control you want to zoom
into something you can completely zoom
into it you want to back out move it
around all of that can be done through
this thing so the focus 73 is really
cool for doing all that monitoring stuff
that you like to do so if you take
vacations and you're paranoid you can
put this in also you can use multiple of
these which means if you'd like to go
around your house and mount a few of
these for total complete security in and
outside of your house you can use a
bunch of these devices together and be
able to
monitor them all through your smart
device so that's pretty cool stuff you
don't have to go out and pay for you
know one of those systems that install
you not to pay for a box to do it
through your computer these are things
to consider with this product cuz you
know most of the home systems you have
to buy this big system it has a box it
looks up your monitor your monitor to
that with this you don't need any of
that type of stuff at all once its
installed you hooked up to your Wi-Fi
your up and good to go and wherever
you're out in the road or wherever you
can access your Wi-Fi you can access
these and monitor your entire home
through this product I gotta say this is
one of the definitely top five in my
book this thing's badass I can't wait
till I get moved I have four more of
these our whole house is going to be
completely monitored up where any of us
can look at it and watch our home from
far now let's check out number two which
is kind of in the same type of realm as
this use your Wi-Fi and all that and
that is the door bird doorbell so while
we're still outside let's talk about the
door bird doorbell now this product is
also one of the products that you
install an app and can be monitored
through your smart device and this one
is pretty much a smart doorbell you can
film everything for the little camera
right here and this thing actually
doesn't need a whole lot of requirements
to work and one of the great things
about this is compared to its
competitors the ring and otherwise it
actually has a lot to offer if you guys
want to see a total head-to-head
comparison we'll have a link down below
so we don't think bore you guys with
feature to feature things but trust me
out of all the products out there this
one has the most feature wise set of all
of them it uses all the existing
electricity in your house as well so you
have to worry about batteries or any
type of thing like that one of the main
things that they say is that this is not
a gadget this is a smart home device and
so therefore they don't want any messy
batteries that's for your gadgets this
is a smart home device straight up so
the saying they're pretty serious about
that now this thing is pretty cool
because it mounts wherever you want it
to be and it can work off all the
electronical components inside your home
it comes with all the stuff back here as
well sort of me to turn my head on you
guys but back here in the box here you
have instruction manuals quick start
guides all that kind of stuff and like I
said before if you have no experience
whatsoever even though it says simple
instructions it's not going to be simple
if you've never done it before get
somebody to help you
do it it's worth the time and effort to
do it but with that said though all the
stuff to do it is in here like i said
the redheads complete all your different
electronic devices um this thing can
also be also worldwide product anywhere
in the world you can buy this particular
product and install it it comes with all
the different electronic components all
the different plugs so matter what kind
of electricity if you have this can use
it as well so basically what you do is
you install this device anywhere on your
door and your friend or whoever want it
to be you install their application it
meets up to it it works with your
internal Wi-Fi system just like that
when we talked about before and you can
monitor everything at your front door
with this so if somebody comes up they
ring your doorbell whatever you're not
home it'll film them show them coming up
to your door and like in fact if you use
the proctor we talked about previously
it can monitor all of your grounds but
this product can work pretty well with
it as well because this come on under
all that area right there at your front
door depending on how you mount it and
how you have it set up you can have that
entire area also covered so you can you
know have coverage no matter where
you're going so if you're person who
wants to know who's coming to your front
door what's going on at my front door
you can use this plus you can talk to
people through it so if somebody comes
your front door you're in the back of
the house and you can't get there you
can say hey hold on a minute I'm in the
back of the house I'll come there and be
there in a minute if you're not at home
and you're somewhere else it can give
you an alert you can also talk to those
people and say hey I'm not home right
now please leave my package or whatever
this can be great for family stuff as
well say that all of a sudden you know
your cousin Bob comes from out of town
you don't know he's coming but he's at
your front door all of a sudden you can
tell Bob hey you know what I have a
secret key or whatever or if you have
other products like we've talked about
in the past with your door locks you can
use that type of smart device to
actually allow them to enter the house
so this device is really cool and can
work with a bunch of other devices in
your home for just continual monitoring
so it's really cool it's very well made
it's rain resistant doesn't matter what
kind of weather is out there it's not
going to affect it whatsoever it's very
very heavy duty I can't even stressed
you guys how heavy-duty it actually is
you know you guys can see it's got a
very simple layout hey it is what it is
for you people out there who have home
to do all like do monitoring stuff
you're into that total smart home type
stuff
hey the door bird is something you might
think about I know why younger audiences
go on okay I'll wreck like I don't have
a home like you know what's this to me
and believe me I completely realize this
guy's that for you guys this particular
product margins probably your guys are
going yeah okay whatever but now let's
get past the stuff that's monitoring the
outside of your home and let's step
inside the home and let's see what we
can do on smart devices inside okay so
we have all that equipment for
monitoring the house check out the door
now you'd think that you know at that
point that you'd be soundly sleeping
like a princess well if not you can
really find out with this next product
and this is a bluetooth product to the
people over at sleep face now this
thing's pretty cool this is the rest on
smart sleep monitor that's right smart
sleep monitors like I said if you want
to know how you sleep and what you're
doing why you sleep this thing's pretty
cool products a bluetooth product that
basically you put it underneath your
mattress you install the app on your
phone and then all you do is basically
turn the thing on by flipping this
little thing around right here you do a
360 switch and in altum the green light
comes on and it's on now this thing
monitors a bunch of different things
while you're sleeping it monitors your
sleep cycle your heart rate your
respiratory rate and your body movements
so it'll tell you all those things and
how many times you're moving around at
night so you can know how much sleep
you're actually getting you can be like
wow I laid down for eight hours but I
only slept for 3 i'm actually one of
these people i have one a hell of a time
going to sleep both my shoulders are
damaged for an accident so every time I
roll around night my shoulders pop so
I'm actually interested in seeing how
well this thing actually works and um I
will have a follow up video to let you
guys know what these products this is
just telling you what they are as I get
moved and move things around we'll have
other videos featuring these product and
showing you what they are because I'm
really interested in see exactly what
this does even if it's only just like a
brief video just touching over these
products again I want to show you guys
how well they work so like I said this
product is very simple to use you simply
install the app get it set up turn the
product on by turning into 360 like I
said put underneath your mattress and
bam you should know at that point the
next day
well you're sleeping so that you can try
different things and try to get your
sleep level to a better place plus the
fact that it monitors all those things
you can see how your help is doing by
that like you're falling asleep and all
of a sudden you've got huge heart rates
going on all that kind of stuff you guys
want to you know go to a doctor and
check out your health and that might
apply to me as well so why we're still
in the house check out this next product
now this one is interesting because it
brings you food so we've got the house
secure we can see how we're sleeping but
what if we want some herbs to make our
food tasty this is the clicking grow
smart herb garden now this doesn't
require any type of app it doesn't
require do you install anything on your
phone doesn't require anything
whatsoever except for some very easy
simple steps you simply take this
product out of its box you guys can see
that it comes with all the stuff
necessary to plant your three plants now
this particular one that I got came with
three single basal ones so all three in
here are basil so if you like basil
which I do this will come in handy but
there's also interchangeable ones that
you can use for getting different types
of herb gardens going and pretty much
once you make the initial investment of
getting this particular product all you
have to buy is a little refill cubes and
you can constantly have a herb garden
growing in your kitchen that's
completely it's actually very simple
elegant and nice all you do is you take
the three pots out you add water in the
seeds you plug it in and boom you're up
and going and miraculously within a few
days these things are actually up and
growing you guys can see they have a
little tiny plastic cover that actually
keeps the plant nice and warm so as the
heated lights going on to it it not only
keeps those seeds warm it keeps the
entire environment and they're nice and
warm and Khushi so that it has a chance
to pop and go ahead and produce those
basil plants very very fast like I said
within a very few days I had plants come
up I think that we did these things and
within three days we already had them
popped up and they've actually grown to
about this big now so this is a pretty
cool product and if you want some that's
very easy you can have a garden that I'm
serious I don't care if you have the
worst green thumb in the world this
thing does it all
all the nutrients everything you need
are completely within the packet you
don't have to do anything but add water
water it your plants going to grow up
you pick it eat it put in some more
cartridges move along and you can like I
said have constantly year-round herb
garden in your kitchen and you could buy
a few of these and have quite a bit
going so if you want to have something
look really cool and have a lot of
different fresh stuff think about it you
can have it all in there in your kitchen
never have to go outside don't we're
about getting your hands dirty none of
that stuff if you want simple you want
elegant and you want something that
works the click and grow it don't mess
around now last but not least is
something by the folks over at key
ingredient this is the basically their
key ingredient hd+ tablet which runs off
a really trippy thing it actually runs
off a custom amazon app the entire thing
runs through this and it's kind of
trippy HD screen 2043 x 1536 nice
resolution there it's 10 inch screen
this thing's totally geared though to
help those people who were in the
kitchen I don't know about you I
personally don't spend a lot of time in
the kitchen I spend some time there but
I know that people out there doin last
year this was actually my mom's favorite
Christmas gift and it wasn't even the HD
version it was the previous version they
didn't have this really awesome stamp
they have now now it comes you know with
this option of this really killer
incredible stand that's a heavy-duty
keeps his thing going makes you can spin
it around any way you want to look at it
so this thing is for the person who
spends a lot of time in the kitchen it
has options for music you could put SD
cards in it you can put storage on it so
you can have all your music on there or
mm-hmm you can actually upload all of
your own recipes and all of these things
and share with recipes all with people
all over the world now that's something
cool so not only do you have the access
to be able to get all these different
types of recipes you can actually upload
all your own and share them with a bunch
of different groups and people so if
you're were those people who's totally
in your kitchen this might be the smart
product for you because it's not only a
standard tablet that will let you surf
the web do that kind of stuff you can
also purchased up for the Amazons
door and like I said you can get all
those recipes and drink stuff so if
you're person who's like running a bar
something like this as well and say your
person who's just like running an
amateur bar and you want to know how to
do all these different drink recipes
well with this particular tablet you
have access to all that stuff so you
want to know how to make a rum and
raisin coke or whatever is I'm kind of
checked Daniels wild the funky funky to
foot you know drink you can find all
that with this tablet and since the fact
that does double as a standard tablet
it's pretty cool like you could be in
your kitchen listen to your favorite
type of music and all that stuff while
you're in there you could actually go on
there you could watch like news or
whatever on whatever you want to do on
the internet you know or just sit there
and use it as your tablet and your thing
for all of your recipes drinks and all
that kind of stuff and for those of you
guys out there who really tech savvy
this thing features an eight megapixel
front camera a 13 megapixel rear camera
features Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 has an
8 core 2.1 gigahertz processor 2
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal flash storage and all of the
preloaded apps which are the key
ingredients recipe unit the conversion
tool and the kitchen timer so I have to
say the tech specs on this one are much
better than the previous generation this
is actually a pretty good standard
tablet and the last thing I haven't
talked about yet is if you have kids
there's one thing that I think all kids
that I've ever seen have in common they
like games and since this is a tablet
you can install some games on here and
you can have your kids playing games
while you're doing your kitchen stuff so
you can keep the kids entertained in
your kitchen while you're doing all your
stuff so it's not only for you it can be
for your kids as well and since it comes
off the stand and can be moved anywhere
around the house he can double as your
device and your kids device so if you
have a younger kid well just like simple
games and once it keep his mind occupied
they can use this thing and then when
you eating in the kitchen you can move
it in there set it in your stand and
make it become all yours so that's
pretty much it folks these products i
consider to be pretty much the top five
smart home products that I've seen
there's been all kinds of they've had
this year lights and all that kind of
stuff we showed you guys some views on
those but then lights are cool but I
don't know these ones to me are ones i
think anybody could use knowing how well
you
sleep being able to do things in your
kitchen monitoring your home knowing
what is going on your home those things
to me are all very important features I
don't know what you guys think let me
