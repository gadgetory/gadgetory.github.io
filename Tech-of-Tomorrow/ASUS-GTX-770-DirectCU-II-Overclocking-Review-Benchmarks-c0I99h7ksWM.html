back here once again on launch day of
the new NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 and right
here to my right I have the asus version
of the card this is their direct cu2 GTX
770 now a lot of you guys are going to
ask exactly what that is
well the CU is the symbol for copper and
direct CU means direct to copper so what
you're getting is you're getting the
heatsink is going directly up against
the GPU if it's going out into the heat
fins then into the heat pipes and then
being blown away keeping the card really
really cool now one thing to take note
of GPU boost 2.0 heavily relies on how
cool the card runs and with that said we
have brought you in videos showing the
overclocking capabilities right out of
the box of this card now we have the
full blown review of this if you guys
want to check that out you guys can see
that right here on the screen behind me
but this video we're dedicating solely
to overclocking the card because we
thought the results were actually worth
talking about so with that said let's
jump in as most people know whenever you
buy one of these cards from Asus they
usually come overclocked right out of
the box and this card is actually no
exception the base speed on this clock
is a thousand thirty-nine megahertz and
the boost clock is eleven hundred and
eleven megahertz but we were able to get
significantly better overclocking using
GPU tweak we actually set the card at
twelve hundred and fifty megahertz but
because the card ran so much cooler we
were actually able to achieve a twelve
hundred ninety-three megahertz boost
which is simply incredible and we did
this all without increasing any voltages
whatsoever which is a totally completely
safe way to overclock one thing that we
did change however was the actual fan
speed we kept the fan speed at 70% for
all of our testing and this seemed to
work out very well for us now you could
probably cut this back a little bit it
would increase the temperature of the
card but would actually reduct on the
noise but truly the most significant
thing about this is this the reference
card was running at 80 Celsius this card
runs overclocked at 71 Celsius now that
translates into a lot
more cooler of a card and like we said
before the cooler the card the better
the boost speed now the direct copper
cooling actually offers some very unique
things for one thing it offers five
unique points of contact and this has
120 percent better dissipation than your
standard card there's also a lot of
things that have to do with keeping dust
out of your card so less dust means less
clutter means that everything is going
to actually run cooler and more
efficiently in the long run Durex use
been around quite a while and the Oh
even the number designates like day
wrecks see you two or three designates
how many actual fans are on the cooling
so with that said folks it's time to
jump into the benchmark song and a rock
out
so there you guys have it now a couple
of things to mention now with this
overclock we saw the card getting
between 3 &amp;amp; 6 frames per second better
but actually with this it actually beats
the 7970 gigahertz addition card making
it very very fast now it doesn't quite
beat thee 780 but it does get actually
awfully kickass scores when it's
overclocked like this but the most
important thing overall is the
temperatures you guys can see that even
this thing overclocked and everything
else it's still running so much cooler
than a reference based card so if you
guys would like any information about
this you guys can check this out in the
link in the description below but I feel
that for this card only being 10 dollars
more than a reference based card this
card is a seriously editor's choice
especially in the overclocking
department it's pretty much maxing out
what GPU tweak will even allow before I
hop out of here and move on with my day
I know a lot of you guys always asked
for SLI performance I'm glad to tell you
folks that we actually have that here
for you guys today you guys can check
that out in the screen back here behind
me like I said down below that like
button is the description you guys can
check out all the details down there as
well and while you're down there just
make sure you go ahead and punch the
crap out of that like button letting us
know that you like this style of video
and you appreciate us I'm Elric make
sure your sub the channel and we'll see
you guys back here on Tec them tomorrow
for more tech good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
