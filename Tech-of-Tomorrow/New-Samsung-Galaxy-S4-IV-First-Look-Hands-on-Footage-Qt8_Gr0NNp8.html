arrived or has it anyways Samsung
through their event in New York City
they did it in Times Square and they did
it with some style because they did it
at the radio city music hall now it
seems to me though a lot of the rumors
that we had heard up until the point of
this execution have all been true and
even though this announcement has come
out it kind of reminds me the Sony
Playstation 4 launch where you know they
said oh hey we have this but um well we
don't maybe not have this well you guys
will see later but anyways let's see
what actually did happen in the event
because we had our man Jonathan Morrison
live at the scene you got to see the
hands on demo so let's jump in and let's
check out that footage we sent our man
on the spot Jonathan Morrison out to New
York to cover the Samsung event that was
allocated and hosted in New York City's
very own Radio City Music Hall as you
can see the hall is absolutely gorgeous
and happens to be perfect for revealing
samsung's the next big thing right off
the bat Samsung spokesman came on stage
and started comparing the s4 to how much
better it was than its predecessors you
can see it's pretty much the same size
as the s3 other than a minor with
difference and weight change of 103
grams from the previous s3 is 132 grams
also the phone is slightly taller and a
bit thinner at just seven point nine
millimeters thick they've also up to
display to a full 5-inch 1080p Super
AMOLED display with 441 pixel density
that gives a display a truly crisper
result the screen can be comparable to
our recently reviewed Sony Zed but
surpasses its display quality with its
crisper vivid more saturated color one
of the really cool features about the
new s4 is its camera one of the biggest
upgrades to the phone is its hallmarks
camera quality the phones loaded with
the new 13 megapixel rear facing camera
and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera as
well now here's where it actually starts
to get interesting though the processor
hmm the processor still hasn't been
officially announced at the moment but
speculations have pointed to either a
Samsung Exynos 5 octa-core CPU or a
Qualcomm Snapdragon now the model also
comes with two gigabytes of RAM and it
also comes with 16
32 or 64 gigabytes of internal storage
and you can also expand it with a micro
SD card as far as cool features the s4
comes with some really unique features
where it lets you just scroll through
web pages or photos without even
touching the phone no it's not the
rumored I scrolling thing but you can
use your hand and not actually touching
it by just swiping your hand across the
screen another really cool feature is
the dual screen photo taking where you
can see how both the rear and
front-facing cameras are projecting
without even switching between them
alright folks so there you have it it
happened it happened in New York City
you guys saw it but it still leaves some
questions as there is some doubt if
these are actually the final specs as
far as the CPU goes if you guys look
around the internet you start reading
articles they contradict each other all
over and I'm talking about even some of
the top competing sites now the verge
they probably have the information it's
going to stick they say these processes
are most likely what is going to
actually be in the phones when they come
out but like the sony launched there's
still questions whether this will be the
final specifications all in all though
pretty cool stuff I'm looking forward to
seeing it reviewing it for samsung the
screen from what i heard is really
awesome and I'm really looking forward
to taking a look at that screen in
person and seeing how cool it really is
so hopefully when the launch comes I'll
be able to make that event and won't be
up my their job but until then hope you
guys liked that video if so make sure
you hit that like button shown that you
appreciate these videos they're not
subscribed please make sure you
subscribe to Tycho tomorrow so you never
miss out on any of the video coolness
we're doing here peace out my brothers
and sisters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
