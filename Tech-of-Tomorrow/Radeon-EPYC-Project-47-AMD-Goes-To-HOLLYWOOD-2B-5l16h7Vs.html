channel yesterday I told you guys about
all the great new things that are coming
out from AMD we got the prices on the RX
Vega we got threatened for pricing all
kinds of killer information about AMD on
the workstation and desktop platform but
what about over on the server platform
well right now a and B is something
going on called project 47 now project
47 is based on invent XP series
massively parallel computing platforms a
whole lot of words and one thing right
but what that is is pretty much the
biggest and most craziest system you're
ever going to see it's taking a bunch of
different servers link them all up and
just having crazy huge amounts of power
that's right
project 47 boasts one petaflop sub
computer power at full 32-bit precision
delivering a stunning 30 gigaflops of
what this demonstrates the most dramatic
computing efficiency ever seen before it
features more cores more threads compute
units IO lanes and memory channels in
use at one time in any other similarly
configured system in the entire world
and this has never been done ever before
each one of the servers in project 47 is
made to be used in series which means
they're made to be used together which
we J hook one up book another one up
hook another one up hook another one up
and also each one of these machines
features an epic 70601 processor they
all have 128 pci lanes and you can use
for vega cards all at the same time now
to bring project 47 to market and they
have it have the absolute best
technology under the hood they've been
working very closely with samsung to
bring the brand-new HBM to memory to the
market now this is great memory it's
going to be SuperDuper fast
it also features ECS and error
correction so this stuff can run
SuperDuper fast without failing overall
though the entire goal of project 47 is
to bring you guys the absolute best
computing power and also at the best per
dollar ratio that you can get which
means that your per dollar performance
is going to be phenomenal and like
nothing you've ever seen before now in
cohen junction with this there's also
something else going on AMD is going
Hollywood that's right baby
AMD is going to have a studio in
Hollywood where they're going to be
working
a lot of different companies and using
their technology in combination with
making awesome movies and videos so all
you people out there including youtubers
like me this guy with two thumbs is very
very interested in what's going on right
now now we can get great serves at great
prices get great filming stuff tell man
it looks like AMD is like all over the
place so once again it's AMD unleashed
like usual if you guys want to see more
information about what I talked about
we'll have links down below you can
check out more for yourself and dig in
deeper to what's going on at AMD</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
