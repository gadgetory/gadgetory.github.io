for club clothing this guy to save 15
bucks and her t ot at the checkout I'm
here and you're here so that makes this
our time here on TECA tomorrow why are
we all here today we'll check this out
lately we doin doing a bunch a bunch of
system lunch you guys have in my crotch
you guys a video a few weeks back with
my green system I talked about change in
the parts and doing all the cables while
I thought that maybe Anthony just come
to my house in the weekend and knock
that out but unfortunately since we have
the metro build going on we got the blue
build going on we've actually got some
killer AMD frickin bills coming on going
on for you guys I was stuck actually
without a system at all no system at all
it means I'm stranded so I was like yeah
let's just build me a system so we
looked around the house and I had a lot
of cool parts flying around from all my
cool sponsors which a thank you guys I
love all of you I don't want to miss
anybody out so let's talk about all the
parts that are used in the system now
first off Silverstone makes some awesome
cases if I'm not gonna paint the case a
lot of times I head over to Silverstone
because their cases just look really
good they're basic black
they don't really you know they're not
to me the kind of case you might not
really paint too much but leave them the
way they are is really awesome
now the raven 3 is really an excellent
case it looks nice has USB 3.0
accessibility all around it I like the
way the motherboard mounts upwards so
that you can access everything by the
top panel totally different than most
cases that you see out there so that's
the case but what's actually inside the
case alright so its first of all let's
talk about the CPU which is obviously
the brain and the power does a socket
2011 cpu from Intel it's the 39 60 X
extreme that's right now this bad boy
can actually overclock extremely well
and I'll be bringing you guys some
videos later on and show you some specs
and stuff but right now it's just keep
going with the system for the
motherboard I had a really killer Asus
when lying around that I wanted to use
this is the rampage for now this thing's
an awesome suck at mm with a motherboard
it's rog series which means you know
it's got all the killer all the
motherboard all based on overclocking
ease of access programming setting
things up you guys all know rog makes
awesome awesome stuff now the video card
is awesome as well now this is a
platinum style bad boy from the people
over at a Zeus
this thing is their 780ti matrix
platinum now this thing is completely
geared for overclocking and the reason I
didn't actually take this card and tear
it apart and pour a water cooler on it
is because I want to see how it actually
dude just the way it was and I didn't
really want to clog my system up and
spend it you know just a ton of
time trying to build it I actually want
to get this system built in a day so I
left the card the way it is and I like
it it actually looks really good and it
matches the system as far as cooling the
CPU though I use them really good run
from people over at Coolermaster this is
the Neptune 2 ATL this thing's an
awesome has two fans a radiator it's all
in one fits really nicely inside the
case you guys see we have the radiator
mounted there on the bottom and also why
we're down there let's just talk about
it there's two fans that came with this
unit we left those the same the rest of
the system fans though I changed out to
cooler master ones these are the jet
flow 120 s they light up they're silent
and they move a lot of air through the
system making sure the air flow
throughout the entire system is going
really good for memory I wanted
something that was really fast right out
of the box like it just slap a quick XMP
profile on and then move ahead King said
had just the stuff I was looking for
HyperX quad channel 16 gigabyte 24
hundred megahertz kit now this thing's
totally geared for being fast you just
hit that XMP profiling you're in like
Flynn now I also use for my fan control
I use as a killer lamp Tron controller
this thing lights up and told like bulb
like stuff and it's just really neat it
looks kind of steampunk even lit up you
guys will check that out it actually
looks very steampunk ish
I actually thought with CD player in
there as well because for some reason I
couldn't find my windows on a damn USB
stick so once again I stuck a desu CD
player in there and away the day went
now this system is pretty much fleshed
out for the boot drive I got an a data
SP 600 there's a 256 gigabyte Drive SSD
I use that for the boot drive as far as
the media storage goes I used two of the
same drives these are the Kingston
HyperX 3k ones these are the four inner
80 gigabyte bad boys I used one for
origin and one for steam it seems to
work out very well for me these are mine
directly on to the back of the case and
was actually pretty cool the way that he
did this only one of the drives are
action
that was designed to hold the SSD both
these others were custom done by Anthony
and it looks pretty cool and all these
cables back here they might look a
little bit cluttered to you but as soon
as you put on the back of the case you
can't see them and one thing to really
take note of what the Silverstone cases
look at how much room there is for cable
management there's clearly almost two
inches here in the back for you to put
your cables in this is just something
amazing about the raven 3 now obviously
all of these components are gonna have
to be powered right I mean I don't have
like you know just a couple little
hamsters aren't thing running around in
there to create power so I had to get a
power supply now recently the people
over at Corsair have released a
brand-new series of power supplies and
actually the day the power supply came
in from Rick I was able to adapt them to
throw it in there's a brand new 750 watt
power supply from these guys you guys
will see all these parts in addition
down below that like button so
everything that I've talked about will
be down there also for you folks out
