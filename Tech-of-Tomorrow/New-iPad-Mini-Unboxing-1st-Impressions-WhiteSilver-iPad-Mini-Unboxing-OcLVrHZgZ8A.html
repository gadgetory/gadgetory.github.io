to tech of tomorrow now it's Friday
night and it's actually the second video
of the day in case you miss it check out
the dr dre video where I tell you guys
the truth about his new headphones now
today I should be out having fun like
everybody else but instead you guys all
know launch day ipad mini hit the
shelves and that said i have the white
silver edition for you guys to check out
also if you guys missed it we had this
total like joke thing last week where i
had a fake one that we're giving away
you guys missed that you're going to
want to check that out as well so now
i've got the box right here in my hand
not much to the outside the box so just
the box here the box in the back or
tells you the nomenclature and that's
pretty much all the wrist of the box
action so now let's move over the table
and let's dissect this thing alright
everybody so we're not going to bore you
with the box anymore so we'll go ahead
and start the unboxing now one thing
unusual about this compared to the other
ones in the market is the price this one
being 329 it's going to be hard for
Apple to justify the price on that but
we'll go ahead and try to see why
they're doing that so let's go ahead and
remove the unit from the box you guys
see it's got its anti-static plastic
thing all around and this is the white
silver version you guys can see it's got
the white front 7.9 inch screen it's got
a 5 megapixel rear camera the front
camera is just the type that has the HD
for the facetime nothing spectacular
there but now the camera on here though
shoots in full HD and from what I've
heard from my friends I haven't had a
chance to test that yet but we're going
to do the testing of it I heard the
camera and the gaming on this are
actually very very well so you guys can
see we have the silver buttons on the
side here to control your volume now
down here we have the Lightning port
then right up above that we have the
home button basically you slide to
engage the unit get it all over with all
your apps on there so you guys can see
the 7.9 inch screen got a lot
viewing area there now as far as comfort
goes an ergonomic Billy you guys saw
before I said I really like the Nexus 7
i'll actually do a comparison but this
one does fit pretty comfortably in my
hand it's actually between this and the
kindle fire it's like right there in
between them so all the apps are on here
we're not going to really go too much in
that that's a whole nother video today
we're just doing the unboxing but i just
want to make sure you guys don't miss
anything here's the back here we have
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the
microphone and the sleep/wake button now
from there you guys have all seen this
let's continue on and let's take a look
at the actual content in the box so
right here we've got a little thing this
should have our little startup guide and
all that stuff inside of it i'll go
ahead just poke at for you folks the
bling we have the ipad mini tells all
little stuff about it go ahead just set
that down ipad info couple of stickers
right there got that next up we have the
lightning to USB charging cable and then
the five watt plug extension so that's
pretty much it folks i'm just going to
set all this down the table so you guys
can see all of it this is everything
that comes in the box of the white
silver ipad mini coming to market at
about 3 29 so hey guys thank you guys
for watching I totally appreciate that
spent my friday night doing this for you

coming up with this i'm going to have

borderlands for iOS then i might have a
