it to you today sapphire
7750 this here is the silent series you

kick you ass that's right but that's it
is the new seven series of cards and
people over the AMD this is the Sapphire
this is their super silent version whoo
let's take a look inside
a lot I say I say I say I say here is
the box and we'll see what comes inside
of it you guys all know this cards based
off a 20 nanometer process
it's the latest 7 Series cards we've
brought you a lot of reviews on all the
series that have been coming out will
have this one in a few days right now
we're just checking out what comes in
the box you know it's got a gigabyte of
gddr5 it supports the new PCI 3.0 all
that good stuff
as soon as Ivy Bridge gets here we'll be
able to check that out here's the back
of the box
lots of logos and stuff on there pop the
end cap nice and simply nice and easy go
ahead and remove it from outside the box
a little sound to fix
oh look at that
upside down boxing alright so there's
what else is in the box
here's all this stuff we would want to
go flying all over the place we'll start
off so here we've got the sapphire drive
installation CD and the case badge so
the first thing in the box set that on
over here then we've got the sapphire
graphics quick installation guide
telling you how to install your card
possibly if you don't know toss that off
the side then we get the Sapphire so
like club thing this is where you're
gonna register your card and make sure
that you can get all those benefits that
come from actually owning this card good
stuff
toss it off the side sapphire is known
to come with a lot of goodies so real
quick I'm just gonna move the card out
of the way so we can take a look at some
of the goodies not a lot of goodies in
this one is that really all the goodies
that are in there I mean check the box
yeah pretty light on the packaging on
this one because I guess there's not
gonna be much requirements we have a
single HDMI connector and a DVI to VGA
connector that's really pretty much it
for that so this is supposed to be a
silent card so let's check it out nice
self ret package you bust this thing out
so we'll start off we'll show you guys
the back side you can see all the heat
rating fins are all the way across the
top here here's your PCI insertion thing
now one thing to take note of on this
card it will not work in any type of
crossfire configuration there is no
finger on top for this also there's a
little warning on top here probably tell
you not to burn your hands that sounds
kind of crazy do things a little
differently right now put Brown show you
guys 0l single DVI hdmi displayport nice
and simple there on the back show you
the side now this is a completely
passive cooling solution there are no
active parts on it whatsoever which
means zero noise hence being the
ultimate silent series card we've got a
little sticker right here covering full
sapphire logo pull it off so you guys
can see the car looks really nice and
for a lot of people out there who's
looking for silent pcs this is gonna be
one of the cards are gonna be seriously
taking a look at now the set
750 is an entry-level card it's going to
be probably around $100 range so it's a
very good price card the only drawbacks
128-bit memory interface that's gonna
like suck ass probably on really high
res and multi monitors but if you're
just playing standard games on normal
monitor you should be just okay so
that's it this is the unboxing of the
sapphire ultimate silent 7750 I'm at our
first roast and I'll see you back at
backer pocket here later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
