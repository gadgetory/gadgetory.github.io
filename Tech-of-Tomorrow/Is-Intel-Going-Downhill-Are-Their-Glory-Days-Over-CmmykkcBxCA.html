guys back here again so here's where
we'll be talking about today Intel at
one point was the biggest and most
baddest CPU company in the entire world
nobody could touch them no matter how
hard they try and believe me there have
been a few different companies other
than AMD there's been C ryx and a few
others in the past that have tried to
keep up with Intel and compete but
they've always failed but here's the
thing Intel for a long time was
absolutely the company that everybody
went to where they were building servers
where they're building their bet top and
gaming machines everybody turned to
Intel and Intel had lots and lots and
lots of glory days obviously they've had
a few hiccups few lawsuits and stuff
like that because that's just how
corporate companies go and with all
these different kinds of trade
agreements and contracts and all the
technology you know that they own it
just gets really confusing with a lot of
that stuff and obviously Intel's done a
few shady things in the past as well but
now my thought is this our Intel glory
days completely over because in the last
few years we've seen Intel just step on
their dick quite a bit releasing process
that were substandard to this latest
issue which is really the crazy thing is
on right as this year began it was
discovered that there was an issue with
Intel CPUs there was security
vulnerability and there was an Intel
patch that came out and this was
supposed to be to fix the security
vulnerabilities on their CPU but when it
was installed all of a sudden people
system started restarting shutting down
just doing all kinds of crazy weird
stuff the Microsoft basically stepped up
and said hey don't install this crap
it's going to make your system run like
crap now AMD on the other hand we all
know that AMD is really trying to swing
a big bat and come at Intel and all
kinds of ways and in all honesty in the
last few years
AMD has closed the gap both with Nvidia
and with Intel as far as performance
goes in the old days it was basically
like you know if you got an AMD CPU it
was going to be a lot slower
than an Intel CPU and that sister Dame
defense and get mad there were a couple
times I admit in the past where AMD did
have a CPU that was faster than an Intel
CPU and he was the first have 64-bit
support from Microsoft and all that
stuff but generally Intel was always the
top dog now another problem with Intel
as well is Francois not gonna name his
last name you guys who know him you know
who he is he was the engineer and the
face and the brains behind so many of
Intel CPU launches is crazy and guess
what he left the company last year so
friends wah left the company we've got
the CEO at the beginning of the year
selling billions of dollars of his stock
off that to me brings up serious red
flags like what is going on over at
Intel if a guy is selling his stock
doesn't that mean that he thinks in his
brain that the company's going to go
down and that's how I take that I mean
if if Jesus the cabmen worked an ice
cream company and he owned stock in it
and all of a sudden he was dumping all
of his stock I would be thinking that
hey the ice cream company's about to
melt right because if you selling all
your stock you're you they're advancing
and making money for the companies you
know expanding your stocks of split well
you're selling it because you want to
just get the frak out of it and get your
cash real quick and that's what it seems
like now AMD the only thing about AMD
that kind of in my opinion kind of kills
in the hype everything up just so much
and then a lot of times they don't just
don't deliver on that hype but to me
Intel's glory days are most likely over
like I said AMD has almost closed the
gap performance wise and a lot of
different things with their latest CPUs
I'm sure they're gonna have newer CPUs
coming out here in 2018 that are gonna
close the gap even further so when that
happens will Intel even really be the
best anymore and if they're not the best
anymore
how will they maintain their position as
you know the king of the hill and get
their glory they just won't be able to
any more at all and that's just kind of
crazy I admit most of my systems that I
built for people are usually Intel based
systems it because a lot of my friends
are fanatics about PCs their PC
master-race they don't want anything
that they feel has subpar performance
whatsoever so there
going to buy and until CPU and all kinds
of people these days are doing D living
and all kinds of crazy CPUs that believe
me back in the day when I started D
letting is CP wasn't even like really
thought of like taking the top off the
CPU and messing around that that's just
some crazy stuff you know and it just is
I would buy personally I don't know if
I'd really do that or not I mean I guess
for overclocking and stuff it's kind of
cool like the pencil trick a long time
ago with AMD I did the pencil trick when
was able to overclock a CPU but that was
like a lot simpler stuff nowadays
actually cutting off the top of your CPU
and changing it around that's a little
crazy and with all the problems that
these Intel CPUs are having lately it
just seems kind of weird because then
till in the past sometimes had little
issues with their stuff but it just
seems like more and more as we go down
the road we see Intel making more
mistakes we see more mistakes we see
more bad stuff so I really feel like I
don't know if you guys agree and I want
to hear your pins really point of all
these videos do you guys also think that
Intel's glory days are over and that in
2018 AMD will totally close the gap 100%
in the cpu market I don't know if they
will in the GPU market and videos got
volta coming out so that might change
the playing field we'll just have to
wait and see even though I know AMD has
stuff up their sleeve but for me friends
while leaving min guy CEO selling off
his stock these are all red flags that
tell me that Intel is having not only
problems publicly but probably
internally as well I'm Eric you guys
been watching Tekken tomorrow we'll see
you guys back in and for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
