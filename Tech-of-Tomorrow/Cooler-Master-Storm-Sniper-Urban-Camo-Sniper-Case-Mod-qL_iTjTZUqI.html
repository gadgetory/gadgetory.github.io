battlefield 3 is about to hit the market
and as your sergeant I want you to be
prepared that said we're going to take a
look at a custom-built system by our
in-house tech Thrasher - Anthony
Reynolds called the camo
sniper mod I've brought the bullets I've
got the gun and now let's take a look at
this radical modded case
now today we're just freestyling that
guys we're actually in my backyard we
taught me y'all crazy
so check it out this is the total sniper
mod system for my friend Anthony
Reynolds he built this bad boy up he
took it up to the g-force land won
himself some free prizes for his lovely
little decorations here I believe that
Bill Owens is responsible for the paint
job on the outside here looks really
really nice so first off we'll start I'm
just gonna show it to you guys you guys
can see use a side here I'm gonna go you
didn't treat you guys the front he's got
this thing all decked out you guys can
see all kinds of cool stuff in here
meters all kinds of nifty good stuff all
modified out with sniper mods this is
really excellent stuff you guys should
know the case it's a sniper case you
guys should recognize that from some of
other unboxings so you guys can see all
this I flip it up through Harris did you
guys see the total top of it really cool
stuff now see the side yeah this thing's
completely water cooled as well liquid
cooled custom swift tech design with all
their new white stuff it's really cool
you can see in the back they have like
hose and stuff I'm catching on all the
camel here pretty funny but you can see
back here they have stuff for liquid
cooling to go out but they actually
didn't use that they did their own
custom design which we'll get to in a
second here so you just try to lift this
thing up
well actually picking the entire camo
net or having the table fall over which
I think it may do here this is
interesting I think my tables falling
over here all right there we go
ivory balance a table magically guys
like that now they can just unhook the
case it'll be good to go okay
bat in two out of three now I'm gonna
pull this thing around here guys this is
most weird thing I've ever done hey what
the heck check out the inside this thing
is awesome
total custom modded swift tech cooling
two gtx 570s
thousand watt cooler master power supply
cooler master powered we've got the
gigabyte sniper board back here got an
Intel 950 on there 12 gigabytes of RAM
that's the sniper Ram pretty cool stuff
from GC
now Anthony did a really custom job on
this he sent this out this is actually
the SSD so this is a custom SSD holder
pretty awesome says right on there
sniper that's s3 mod yeah that's how
auntie would say it he'd be like yeah
it's awesome radical man so check this
out this thing is just really cool now

battlefield 3 oh well yeah I will and
totally decked out now system like this

or seven hundred dollars the
modification on this was a few hundred
dollars the other modification was a few
hundred dollars but if you're somebody
