tomorrow where it's pump today and the
middle of the week and what do we got
going on for you guys today well today
we've got something from simple audio
now this company is bigger actually over
in Scottish in the European region but
they're now breaking to America with a
brand-new speaker line now these
speakers are aptly named listen that's
the name of the product and they kind of
have a very very niche market because
they're kind of like right on the
borderland of falling into audio file
and being more like a home or desktop
speaker but these things have total
portability they're made to go in any
room in your house or take with you
anywhere you want and they have great
connectivity through bluetooth so if
you're out walking around you've got
whatever kind of iPhone Samsung device
whatever you have you can connect to
these things and listen to them and
there's all kinds of technology that
actually goes behind them some of the
basic specs are though they have a
3-inch mid-range speaker that actually
has rare-earth magnetics and these
things are gonna sound really good
because the magnetics that are on the
bottom of the subwoofer are actually
going to sound very good because they're
very heavily weighted I haven't actually
had a chance to do listen to these
things as of yet but right now let's go
ahead and unbox take a look at them and
see more what's about these listen
speakers alright folks so like every
unbox when we got to show you well the
box and these are pretty new so it's not
you've seen a whole bunch of these
anywhere simple audio the listen stereo
speakers with Bluetooth great sound
beautifully designed you guys can see
right here they even look clean on the
box you guys can see with the
connectivity they're not gonna spend a
whole lot of time I'm gonna flip it
around the back to show you guys the
back I think these things look really
cool though I think when you guys see
them accidentally pull them out of the
box you're gonna be even more impressed
what else we got going on here nothing
much you guys just see simple side of
the box nothing there inside of this
side you'll love the way your music
sounds and then here's we're gonna
remove the product I don't know if I'm
going to need a knife I may need a knife
we shall see if no I guess I don't so
I'll go ahead and just pop that little
cap off and then I shall talk through a
box bra all right
so hmm very green here maybe these guys
like Nvidia very green here so we got
the big s on the thing there that
doesn't sound for suit men that's first
simple let's go ahead and put the cap
very very well packaged these are very
strong this even kind of feels kind of
like some of the guitar cases I have
very well made at least you know if
they're getting shipped out to you
they're not going to be breaking in the
shipping so we're off the bat and
picking it up pretty lightweight we see
a single connectivity cord here this is
obviously probably going to go to the
other speaker doesn't look like a USB or
anything like that then we got this one
the speaker actually is a little bit
heavier it has another connectivity wire
here let's see which one this particular
one is yeah this one looks like it
connects to the other one will actually
probably get to that and that's it I
think was there anything else in the box
yes there is what else we got ah okay so
that's it for inside the box folks move
it out let's just start off right now
you hear the box is collapsing in the
background let's take a look at the
remote control let me open this bad boy
up and get it into the camera range all
right that was fun hey did you guys see
that one that was most interesting
unboxing ever it almost hit me and then
well you know where that's all right
that was kind of funny I gotta laugh my
ass off on that one so here we go an
exciting unboxing there here is the
remote control all the controls are on
there flip it on the back you see that
has a little stands for you to set it
down when you pull this out it's
obviously going to activate it I'll just
go ahead and activate it I don't it's
gonna show us any lighting on the front
or anything nope it doesn't but
obviously now the battery's been engaged
so it should work so moving on now we'll
open up this other accessory box here
it's a nice little green box right here
with a nice piece of tape on it let's go
ahead and just rip that out of there
here we see the power connector kind of
like you see on a lot of laptops
I think Sony PlayStation had one of
these type of plugs as well pretty
simple
hence the name simple
here's the rest of the power and then
another one so here we get our USB
connectivity get the little micro USB
right there normally USB so it's
obviously you know USB 2.0 it's not USB
3.0 no blue connectivity simple white
connectivity there 3.5 millimeter
connector Jack with gold-plated ends on
both ends the power brick II and a
little connectivity wire that's all this
goodie stuff so now let's take a look at
the speakers now some people might claim
that having DSP makes them out of the
audiophile field now these things do
have a separate DSP though for each
speaker which is kind of unique so we'll
just start off with this one right here
very elegant and its design you guys can
see that the color spectrum on it makes
it very much like high-end audio from
the late 70s it's got a very nice
tabletop glass like top on the side we
have connectivity and one thing really
cool about this is you can actually use
a sub woofer out so if you buy yourself
a little portable subwoofer and you want
to get that full range of sound like say
you're an audio engineer and you're like
travel around a lot but you still want
to have you know the ship speakers you
can go ahead and take these and hook a
subwoofer up and then you can get that
full sound spectrum of both getting the
bass and these as well not that these
don't have pretty good bass but having a
subwoofer always changes it a lot flip
it around one more side here in the
front we can also see that there are
headphone line in so if you want to put
something up and use it through there or
if the year 3.5 milimeter connection now
one thing that's also cool about these
is if these things are running through
bluetooth and all of a sudden you feel
like you want to use something else and
you plug this in as soon as you plug
this in the speaker's will actually stop
until you unplug or disconnect the other
device so that's kind of interesting I
don't know how much would be relevant
and again but it's still kind of
something interesting
these things have all kinds of different
technology inside of them it's like
really too much me to go all the
technology like in the unboxing because
there's a lot to this they may be named
simple tech but the technology behind
them is not simple so let's go ahead
this is the left speaker actually let me
clarify that as well this is the right
speaker and now this is the left speaker
the design is pretty much some of the
same less connectivity though obvious
end this one you just have the speaker
connectivity right here we see the
speaker out so this other speaker is
going to connect right through this just
gonna plug that bad boy in that's all
you got to do to connect the two
speakers you can also see back there I
unplug this the rest of the connectivity
as well here is the mini USB and here's
your power connectivity right there as
well alright guys so that's pretty much
for the unboxing now these things are 80
watts RMS they're separated like I said
for the power each different speaker has
its own digital driver have their own
DSP built in no matter how loud you get
the speaker's they have their own built
in compression which means on the fly no
matter how well they are they eliminate
clipping distortion all that kind of
thing making sure that your sound either
days sounds really good now like I said
before some people claim that true audio
files want to hear a more natural sound
but there are some benefits to having
the DSP as well so those folks in the
market for a really nice set of desktop
speakers that they can use anywhere
inside of their house which i think is
cool with great connectivity for all
that type of information check out the
link down there below where we'll have a
link over to our website where i'll have
the initial specs and everything for
these speakers so you guys can see all
of that type of stuff and what they're
about and then I'll get in to do them
the full review test them again to their
speakers then come back and if you guys
would like to see a video review let us
know below hit that like button and
leave a comment below saying what you
guys would like to hear that in a type
of review now my thing is we don't do a
whole lot of speakers because the audio
source means a lot so these speakers
could be the absolute best speakers in
the world but if you have a crappy audio
source or you're listening to a crappy
it's gonna be translated to you as crap
so if you're walking down the road
listen you're a phone you're gonna go
yeah those speakers sound like
I don't hear anything about them so for
us it's really kind of hard to bring you
guys a video but we're willing to work
with you so if you guys have ideas let
them hear it down below in the comment
section i'm Elric peace out we'll see
you guys back here and taking tomorrow
