going on here at Tech in tomorrow now
you guys all know that a few weeks back
and video rumored they'd have some new
GPUs well now AMD the rumors are
surrounding their camp and this time
it's with the brand-new risin 7 mm
Series CPUs now so far what we think
we're actually seeing is a 2700 or a
2700 X CPU not exactly sure because the
graphs and stuff that are floating
around right now are honestly they're a
little bit ambiguous like I can't you
know put my thumb of approval and say
hey these are actually real results but
there's this website that's out there
and they've released these results that
are rumored to be you know the latest
CPU coming from AMD now here are a bunch
of different graphs that they showed on
their website it shows the different
various aspects of the CPU although it's
shown as future CPU it doesn't actually
show you what exact CPU it is because
obviously it's under NDA and who knows
if honestly this is even it but from
these scores what you guys can see if
these CPUs come out and this is a 2700
or 27 X CPU these things are really
kicking some serious butt even beating
the top-of-the-line Intel CPU which we
know that comes to market at a lot of
money and B usually doesn't have CPUs
there to off the hook
they've had him a couple times over a
thousand dollars but I think that was
more just to like you know just a poke
in the side there earlier than anything
else so if AMD can actually have a new
2700 or 27x CPU and come out and kick
out a lot of butt and beat Intel I know
that a lot of people out there going to
be very stoked plus from what I'm
reading they'll still stay on the same a
m4 platform which means you want to buy
a new motherboard you won't have to buy
a new memory you'll have to do any of
that stuff you can use your pre-existing
board your pre-existing memory slap that
CPU in and be up and going
so that's it right now folks not a lot
out whether these you know benchmarks
that we're seeing have any accuracy or
any truth I don't know but the rumor
mill is what it is and the rumor now is
AMD risin 7 mm to P use coming to market
pretty soon honestly I hope they come
out and they kick a lot of butt like
they're showing that would be just
amazing and if the
as correct as well that will be even
better
AMD guys I know you guys are really
waiting cuz you guys always want an AMD
to come ahead beat the competition beat
Nvidia beat until just beat everybody up
team AMD well AMD has made radical
strides in the last few years now the
only thing I can see on the GPU side of
things with video cards that people just
aren't making enough of what's out there
the shortage of video cards right now is
got insane I've heard rumors that these
companies are doing this stuff on
purpose just to get prices to you know
fly off the hand and that's just
ridiculous so hopefully though AMD's
rides in 7 2000 series CPUs hopefully
they'll hit the market pretty soon will
they be as fast as they're rumored to be
the heck if I know
but hey the future will tell when it
gets here you know all happen on the
table for you like usual I'll have a
link down below to the information I
showed you guys in this video make sure
you hit that like button if you did and
hey if you like what you see and you
want to be subbed I'd love to see you
guys back out here peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
