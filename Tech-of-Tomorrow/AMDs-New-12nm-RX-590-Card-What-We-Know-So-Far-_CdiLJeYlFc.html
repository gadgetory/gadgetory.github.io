for AMD fans the news is kind of a mixed
bag even though we're probably not gonna
see Navi til probably second or third
quarter of next year on November 15th at
least right around November 15th we are
going to see a brand new AMD 590 card to
hit the market now even though that
doesn't sound like really really
exciting news what's really exciting
about it is it's going to be the very
first GPU that's based on the 12
nanometer process so regardless of
anything else whether it's a slight
polaris refresh or anything else the
good news is that AMD is the very first
company in the world to hit the 12
nanometer process on their video cards
so you're gonna see all the company's
sapphire XFX all those giant card
companies in the middle of November
you're gonna see this brand new 590
being launched so what I've heard so far
though is that aspect wise it's probably
not going to be that much different
meaning that it's not gonna be like a
whole whole lot faster apply be a little
bit faster um the exact memory
configuration haven't actually got that
because it's under under NDA so I
haven't actually seen that information
but I knew know that the cards are
coming they're going to be based on the
12 nanometer process and they will have
suppose
the new cooling apparatus so we're
thinking you know smaller die better
yield which you know should come across
as better pricing to all of you AMD fans
out there and for gamers in general who
want a card that's affordable because we
all know that right now unless you want
to get into the 2070 the higher end
cards from Nvidia are very very
expensive so as long as the card is
though a little bit faster its
affordable and the biggest thing of all
is that it's available and not sucked up
by a bunch of miners around the world
you know eating all the cards up so that
you know true gamers kind of get screwed
in it to pay a higher price tag it will
be great you know even though it's a
polaris refresh and it's you know not
you know the greatest you know new chip
it's not knobby it's nothing you know
extremely radical the very fact that AMD
was the first person to the market to
bring the 12 nanometer process is still
an achievement and shows that AMD is
starting to be a little bit competitive
now on the GPU side of things I've said
this before it doesn't really seem like
to me AMD's putting their full full
effort into it now I know a lot of the
fans out there sent me emails saying hey
you know they've moved certain guys from
certain departments here they are in
every word you know to make sure that
the GPU department is doing better and I
really hope that they are because when
AMD doesn't release new cards and new
technology it really leaves Nvidia just
to kick back sit on their laurels and do
absolutely nothing and trust me even
though I know that sucks if it was you
and it was me
we do the exact same thing I mean if I
have a white car and all of my white
cars are selling and they're selling
good why would I need to introduce a
blue a red car you know I mean it's a
matter of the numbers game it's like
sure okay we could release them but if
there's no reason to and you're still
making a lot of profit especially in
older technology well then hey what the
heck now I have seen video card prices
drop quite a bit you can get a lot of
the older series from Nvidia now a lot
of those cards have actually dropped
under $500 you can even find if you look
around at 1080 I it'll be used probably
but you can find one for under $500
which is a really good deal so if you're
not into RT X that's cool but in the AMD
theit side of things you know I was
really hoping that we would have seen
their actual new chipsets this year
by CES but that seems to not be the case
so what we're going to be getting is
we're going to be giving a brand-new 590
12 nanometer process it's probably going
to be about a hundred to maybe two
hundred megahertz faster which isn't a
whole lot it still will give it a boost
but hopefully with the new cooling
apparatus and a smaller die we're gonna
see more cards available on the market
which I mean they're gonna be more
affordable and more available to gamers
out there which is really what's the
most important thing it doesn't really
matter how good or bad a card is to the
cards so overpriced that you can't
afford it it's just like a pipe dream
and all of us know you know you don't
want to sit around and pipe dream too
much you know you want to actually live
in reality and get yourself a video card
so for all those people out there who've
been waiting for AMD to do anything
whatsoever well guess what your day is
about to arrive around November 15th
like I said the new five 90s will hit
the market twelve nanometer prices like
I've repeatedly said the first to the
market on this new cooling apparatus
which hopefully will keep the cards
running a lot cooler and hopefully
everything will be available in the
market so that you guys can buy the card
at a good price and get your game on
I'm Miller you guys been watching tikka
tomorrow thanks for watching for AMD
fans out there hey at least there's a
little bit of sunshine at the end of the
tunnel
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
