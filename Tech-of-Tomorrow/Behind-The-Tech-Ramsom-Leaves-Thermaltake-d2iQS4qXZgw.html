probably a once-in-a-lifetime edition of
behind the tech on tech of tomorrow now
why are we doing a behind the tech well
because shits happened now i'm sitting
here with my brother ransom coy you guys
might recognize the face he's been the
evangelist for the last seven years for
thermaltake he's been lots of my videos
you guys have seen with me at CES lots
of stuff well what's happened is well
you're not going to see Ramson anymore
at thermaltake that's right hence the
video you saw ramson has left
thermaltake and he is moved on and i
know that a lot of my tech friends out
there are all speculating what happened
what happened what happened so I figured
you know hey man Wes Bob old and Shannon
all you guys out there there's lots more
of you guys I love all you guys by the
way you know you guys want to know so
rants is going to tell his own tail so
ransom what's up man you're no longer a
tier the old thermaltake building I'm no
longer at thermaltake but I move on
right i gave myself an opportunity we
had a good run for seven years love the
company a lot be a great brand we became
friends to all the friends in the
industry to the community and it's like
inception on all those different things
that you can see but in the end with
your support I have what I am today and
I want to thank you to all those people
that I have me and there's so many that
i want to thank you okay and to me the
last word to you would be sometimes give
yourself a chance to look for better
opportunity you never know where you
will go somehow your son get be more
happier until then you can contact me
with my email down below Graham some koi
@ gmail.com or you can google search it
you can find me easily on Google on
google the man so rental middle section
so cuz I mean everybody's dying to know
out there if there was really if you're
just gonna strike it up like one just
big reason why you left there
take what would you just strike it up to
cuz there's always like the straw that
breaks the camel's back well I guess
I'll direction have been apart mainly
it's just you know something that you're
doing for so many years and you're not
tired of it but you lose a little
passion you want something new something
more exciting you know you want to grow
a company I'm ready to work and grow the
company so i guess in that ex back i'm
looking to you know keep going like
punching i'm a hundred so i would read
it on then wait for my food to get to me
on my table and i would hope you would
do the same there you go so how about
like politics well i'll leave politics
religion on aside but you can judge I
thought you believed in hardware I
believe in highway a lot um I'm a geeky
person somehow I've steel will stay in
industry okay with your support today I
thank you again yeah I don't really
think that you're not going to be
somewhere else like very quickly I mean
what do you guys think I mean I I think
that ransom is going to be somewhere
probably by the next time I do a video
he'll be working somewhere so by the way
you know if you're a company out there
you guys have known that like JJ Branson
is one of the premier personalities
that's actually in the industry there
are some people that do their job
they're back behind the scene you never
meet them you never see them and then
there are people like JJ and ransom who
always have their face out there they're
willing to come here do videos interact
with you you know to be honest II folks
I asked every one of the frakkin people
out there to come and be here to do
their product but only very few will
actually show up ransoms one of them
like I said JJ is another so for all you
guys out there my tech friends out there
all the sites everything you guys now
know ransoms moved on I know you guys
are dying to know if you really want to
know if you guys need to get something
you can contact
right isn't champion man now so Shannon
Rob now is the contact so if you guys
are actually wondering he's the guy now
you guys out there like I said looking
for some ease of personality this might
be your guy so i say let the bid wars
begin and i wish you the absolute best
of luck thank you all right thank you
know we love you dude we love you all
right man we'll see you guys all later
back here on TECA tomorrow we hope you
like this video this is a very personal
video that we brought out to you folks
let you guys know what's going on behind
the tech so peace out we'll see you guys
back here later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
