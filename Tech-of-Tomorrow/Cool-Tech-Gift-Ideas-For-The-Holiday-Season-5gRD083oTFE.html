that Christmas Hanukkah all that stuff
is going on right now it's the holiday
season and today's video is actually
sponsored by all of these companies that
you see here all these companies are
actually companies that are from
overseas and they all wanted me to show
the writings before Christmas so you
guys could have a chance to check them
out so I just wanted to have total
transparent is what you know that these
companies paid for me to show you these
items now once again I'm not trying to
be a Salesman I know a lot of people
mistake that may think I'm just like
giving all this good but honestly I like
trying to talk positive about things I
don't like being like the total negative
guy but next year I'm really gonna be
changing my style in fact this is
probably the last of this exact style
video ever see on the channel because
we're not gonna do that stuff anymore
if you guys follow the channel you guys
know there's been some changes I lost my
major corporate sponsor so pretty much
it's just me and the camera and on our
own now with no sponsor so it's
basically like walking a tightrope
without a net but let me tell you
something we're not going anywhere
regardless of whether we lost some
finances or anything else we aren't
going any freaking where we're gonna be
here running Tekken tomorrow and doing a
lot of changes to make the videos more
appealing to you folks but with that
said though let's jump in and let's
check out these products and just what
the heck they are the first item our
list is something very different
honestly I think this is actually a
really cool product just on its own it's
an HD camera made by New West but what
it really is it's a borescope for
Android and it's actually three things
in one it's a mirror it's a hook it's a
magnet it works right off your phone if
you lose like a part in your system this
thing can be really nifty to use you
just insert the cable and on that cable
is a camera so you can see everything
that's going on if you lose a part and
you need to magnetically touch it you
can use the magnet part grab your screw
and pull it out of there the best thing
about this HD camera is that you can
look underneath the door you can look
inside of a PC anywhere where you can't
actually see what's going on but it has
a really small space for you insert the
cable you can be able to check things
out I know first somebody this might be
like ah whatever but for me being a
computer guy this works really cool like
I said if you're building your computer
and you need to see something inside it
that you can actually see cuz a low
light or you lose a part this is the
perfect thing for that also many other
uses I'm sure that you guys can find for
it it's very reasonably priced and even
though this product is kind of a niche
item I know there's some people out
there who can
find great use for this really for under
20 bucks this is a really nice product
like I said it's got all kinds of
different uses and what you do with that
pay that's up to you over the last few
years there have been so many Bluetooth
speakers that have come out it is just
mind-boggling
but this company called tri bit they
wanted me to show you two of their
products do you guys have know they're
available the first is this Bluetooth
speaker and the second is a nice pair of
earbuds now this particular Bluetooth
unit is called the tribe it X algo
portable bluetooth wireless speaker with
two six watt drivers rich bass says 24
hours of play time off the battery and
it is waterproof that's right I didn't
say what a resistant it's actually
waterproof it has a 66 foot bluetooth
range and a built-in mic for home
beach party travel and you can even use
this doggone thing in your shower now
the sound inside of it is actually
really quality sound it's very very loud
you actually get stereo right inside of
a single unit so that's nice as well and
if you're looking for some that you not
to worry about it dropping in the pool
or getting it broke this might be a
really nice unit to look at not very
many of these products are actually
completely waterproof and that is one
thing however I think is nice about this
unit the fact that you could be out in
the rain in the shower that makes it
very versatile so it's really worth the
cash next up is the TripIt X free color
in your wireless headphones now you guys
have seen a lot of different products on
the site these are actually pretty cool
over because they're made totally for a
person who works out and they're under
$30.00 the tribe it X free color
wireless headphones offer 10 hours of
battery life they also have a mic for
talking the phone and doing all that
stuff
they also have a waterproof nano coating
a magnetic connection HD stereo noise
cancelling and like I said before these
things are totally made for the gym
working out running and all that type of
stuff all the controls are conveniently
located on the cable itself so don't
have to worry about touching your
headphones or anything to mess around
with it everything's located on the wire
so if you want to answer your phone you
want to put your music forward or the
past song you can do all that simply
from the controller on the wire inside
the box you get the headphones
themselves you get the users manual you
got a nice little carry bag to carry
them around in and inside that carry bag
are various different sizes of earbuds
to fit any
and you also get the USB charging cable
everything you need to get up and going
and like I said before this product
comes to market at $30 so you get a
really nice set of bluetooth headphones
for $30 you can use it the gym running
around all that good stuff so if you're
looking for something that's not gonna
break the bank and if you litter gets
broke you're not gonna cry over $30 and
they also sound a pretty doggone nice
are you looking for an LED desk lamp to
light up your desk let's check out the
Blitz with BW LT one the LT one also
comes in two different colors you can
get it in black or white it also
features a four-seam mode smart control
panel we get the options of read study
relax sleep or a timer which means you
can time in and make it turn off
automatically
it also features five step brightness
and dimming control the lt1 is also UV
and flicker free so you can have hours
of use without getting a headache this
lamp also has a rotation feature of 270
degrees
and it also conveniently has a USB
charging port so you can charge up your
phone or other devices there's not a
whole lot of tech specs to a desk lamp
but if you're looking for something that
looks really elegant has nice features
hey you might just want to check this
one out and put it on your desk are you
one of those folks out there who likes
to capture every moment of their life
taking selfies using the phone on your
camera and all that stuff well this
product might just be for you you guys
all have heard of the GoPro write the
GoPro you take it around everywhere
people on their motorcycles water skiing
everything people use the GoPro to film
their adventures well the product that
we're gonna look at today is by DB power
and it's a 4k action cam that actually
works completely underwater that's right
so not only can you use it on your
motorcycle hiking all that stuff you can
dive into the ocean and have absolutely
no worries about this camera breaking
the DB power n five features 5x zoom it
also features is Wi-Fi and you can go up
to 98 feet underwater that's right 98
feet under the water and still have this
camera totally working features 170
degree wide angle lens including two
rechargeable batteries and 17 different
accessories all in the box in my opinion
one of the nicest things about the n5 is
its waterproof case now this waterproof
case can allow you to dive into the
ocean up to 30 meters and film perfectly
clear HD movie so that means if you're
swimming
pool or diving in the ocean Hey up to 30
meters you'll have absolutely no
problems at all
and for people out there who do that I
think that's really cool I was thinking
about making a funny video like making a
shower and singing and using the camera
inside there I could also like mix it
with that waterproof speaker to have my
music going as well so it could be a
pretty fun thing as well so for those
people out there who are looking for a
camera that's really durable features
full 4k other shooting options include
2.7 at 30 frames per second 1080p at 60
frames per second and 720p at 120 frames
per second the zoom feature in this
camera is very easy to use you can go
from 1x all the way to 5x to use nice
controls right on the side simply go up
or down and the adjustment is simple vn5
also comes with a micro SD slot so you
can use up to a 64 gigabyte class 10
card inside of it to save all of your
fun the bottom line this is a 4k
affordable action cameras you can take
anywhere you want to go underwater on
top of a mountain everywhere and it
comes in a market for under $70 and if
you happen to have a GoPro check it out
all the accessories will work with that
as well so this next Prendick is for
those people looking for home security
this is the wise camera it's a 720 HD
camera that actually features sound as
well as picture it can be used on its
own as a standalone product or it can be
used with their proprietary software to
monitor any room in your house or the
outside of your house depending on how
you want to use it it's very small it's
very inconspicuous and really the only
thing that I have to say about it is
probably negative is the price about $85
but other than that its simplicity
itself
it shakes hands with your phone with
absolutely no problem so you can be off
in about or anywhere you want to be and
you can still monitor what's going on
with this camera for those people out
there who have like a baby or you have a
business and you want to monitor your
employees this is actually the perfect
little product because I can just sit on
the shelf be inconspicuous and film
everything at 720p so that you can check
it out and know what's going on
sometimes this is a very important thing
it just depends on what you're doing in
your life like for me I have a few areas
in my house where I have more of my
valuable stuff in those areas and each
one I have a cam similar to this
watching what's going on in my house I
just hop in my phone log into the
program and I can see what's going on
anywhere in my house and this product is
very similar to what I'm using so like I
said if you
want something to monitor what's going
on your house or outside and something
ants conspicuous this might be something
you guys want to look at I also could
not find the exact brand even though
these guys sent it to me
I found another brand which is OEM but
it's the exact same product as this just
by a different manufacturer let's just
face it a lot of people om products for
a bunch of different companies and
they're all exactly the same you guys
know I'm talking about we've seen like
10 different mices that have all been
the same thing all by different
companies and this is the same thing
this company has their version of this
camera and if it's something you need
then it's something you want to check
out if it's something just like ant
whatsoever then hey you don't have to
use it but if you're into home security
and you want something small something
that can't just be blaring out hey I'm a
camera hey check this out it might just
be for you alright tech fan so there you
have it a bunch of products from across
the sea and like I said the very
