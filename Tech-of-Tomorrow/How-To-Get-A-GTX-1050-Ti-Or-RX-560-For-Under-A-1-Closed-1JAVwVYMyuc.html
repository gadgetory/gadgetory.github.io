alright so hats off to our sponsor if
you guys are interested and checking
this thing out we will have a link down
below so what's today's video all about
we know that the industry has gotten
very expensive on video cards it's
getting really hard to get anything if
you want super high end video cards
we're talking about price in the $1,200
range like the other day I actually saw
a Vegas 64 selling first $1300 we'll
actually be bringing you a full review
of that card we tested it with 30 games
so be on the lookout for that
but today we're actually going to be
giving you guys two different video
cards that's right not one but two
different video cards the first the
zotac gtx 1050 TI very very nice card
nice entry-level car they'll play all
the games at 1080p nicely and best of
all and guess what one of you lucky zat
winners out there from around the world
or here at home this could be your car
now the next
now the next card is an Asus rx 562
gigabyte card and that card is right
here so I don't if you guys have ever
seen these cards before but just so you
know what you'll be getting let's say
let's show you what you'll be getting
something a little different here that
we haven't ever really done so let's
just actually show you what you'll be
getting in case you're wondering so in
this particular box you'll get the card
itself a couple of old manuals there's
no actual driver because they you know
everybody gets their drivers off the
internet and then here's what the card
itself looks like it's actually a very
small card so if you guys are wondering
hey will fit in my system I got a small
system definitely this card will fit in
it a very nice card simple all around
but hey that's it so if you're wondering
what you're going to win this is it
something different right put that right
all right and in the other box this card
the Arctic's I go over here and pop the
cap on this little bad boy you can see
it as well just in case for some reason
you have it now this part is a little
bit larger card in the Box in here you
actually do get a driver CV and you do
get a little speed setup so it blows you
out there don't know what you're doing
there you go and by the way this card is
a brand new part I just got it from u8
the other day so - fan design a little
bit longer than the other card but still
a nice card I Oh about the same the back
of it so those are the two prizes so I
know the next question is going to be
okay well how are we going to do this
well in the future after this particular
video my girlfriend Shan she's gonna be
doing everything for us when we got a
lot of nice stuff coming up working with
inner max a Zeus just lots of companies
we're gonna be doing a lot of gleam
giveaways in fact probably next month
we'll have a few a month what's even
better is that this will all be done and
be given away from the company so I
won't even have to be involved I'll be
able to pick the winner all you guys
gotta do is do your part and those
products will be sent directly out to
you guys so it's gonna work out
absolutely great
I'm gonna be able to give you guys just
all kinds of tons of from the
sponsors so you guys are gonna get just
lots and lots of stuff from us
on tech of tomorrow and I know lately
I've been doing a lot of personal videos
and we said we're changing our videos
around and doing stuff getting back to
our PC roots but all the testing and
everything that has to be done and I'm
trying to launch a website and all this
stuff right now and get that done it
takes a lot of time and you guys who
follow the channel you know I've had a
lot of health issues I've been really
sick my blood pressure my blood sugar
everything I had a hole in my foot so
like we're getting our stuff together so
please bear with us so now you're
wondering how can I win these cards or
it shut the frak up and just tell us how
to win okay
so here's how you gotta win okay we're
gonna be giving these cards away over on
Twitter not for those that Google oh I
hate Twitter I don't want to use Twitter

have to do anything there you can simply
go over there do it and enter the
contest and we were randomly picked the
winner so it doesn't matter I don't go

an absolutely free lunch and in order to
do this to that's why I have a sponsored
video because I get so many sponsors
videos so that I can afford to give this
stuff to you and then we all work it out

shipping money and you get your good

silly minors out there and getting your
