beautiful day here in rising today the
pleasure planet and I'm here to that day
to bring you an unboxing beautiful
planet beautiful product now today I'm
look at the Luxor to h4 now they call it
an iPad holder but i think that they
call it an iPad holder that's mortars
like g√°vea attention since ipad is like
the big product this thing is really
just a tablet holder of any type it's
adjustable and if you guys don't know
this company they're part of thermal
take their weather off the visions they
make all the really like high
inexpensive cases iphone stuff all their
like cell phone covers all that stuff
but anyways so let's check this out
we're going to unbox it today and i got
my little touch pad out and we'll see
how it works with it so
look at the top here looks I gotta get a
couple little things here didn't even
bring a trusty knife here today I can't
believe it folks no knife but ah I do
have a trusty screwdriver luckily out
here that's a shouldn't even be out here
but yet here it is I'm using my trusty
screwdriver I'm going to a slice their
slice over there is that going to work
it looks like it's going to folks don't
try this at home and for those others
visiting ryzza please enjoy your stay
I'm gonna go ahead just go crazy and rip
it because I don't care about this thing
cuz i'm just gonna use it anyways we're
gonna give it to a friend of mine new
needs it more than I do so anyways pop
tops off you can actually probably do a
better job and nicer job in boxing it to
me I just kind of touring here cuz I'm a
madman here I'm gonna pull it out give
her the box off the side that inside
here you can see how it's all stuffed
inside of here nice and cozy isn't it
cozy yeah blow holy crap hey it's not my
fault gravity's a little bit different
here than I'm planet earth and that was
a gravity 5 thing but that's I'm
sticking to my story and that's how it
all right this little thing pops off
I've got a luxa2 uniquely you oh you're
so unique baby all right get that down
then here's the unit itself and it's
that kind of like stuck inside hearing a
thing so I can pull it out and ah ok get
the other way here right the bat you
guys can see it's all metal it actually
looks a lot a lot a lot a lot like
anywhere the Mac products you might see
it looks like the bottom of an imac the
bottom of a cinema display so I think
the guy's a thermaltake are trying to
jump on that bandwagon yes they are but
so what you get basically is you get the
box you get this little unit which is
very adjustable look it's like a monster
I'm going to come and get you and eat
you all right maybe not but here so
check it out I've got my pad right here
let's see how this thing works
so you set it in here I get this really
SuperDuper adjustable how you want it to
be I guess you want to put it sideways
you can do that let's see if it's
totally sideways no won't fit totally
site oh yeah okay well my math I
guess it will go sideways doesn't feel
very sturdy let me change it back now I
had it originally this way felt a lot
better and put that back on there yeah
that feels a lot more sturdy right there
so basis of you in a room a good turn my
little thing on you in your room you can
see the pad you see it's on and so like
a lot of times you're kicking back in
your desk like I like to read a lot
listen to music so you just have the
thing right here in front of you it's
adjustable you can move it around it
does actually move to a lot more
positions you can even bring it down
further these things go right here you
can set it there and have all four sides
grip to let me show you that this is
okay i just noticed something to you can
lock it so now it's kind of in a locking
position see whoo even the gravity and
rise it can't suck the bad boy out of
this thing so the age for it's actually
pretty cool this is just the unboxing
but you guys can see it works and that's
about it so I'm just coming to you guys
live here from risin I'll see you guys
back on planet Earth from my next
shooting and well I guess we'll just
we'll see you then right hasta luego</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
