brought to you and sponsored by add
guard now if you're a person who uses an
Android phone and you hate seeing apps
that are getting filled with AD after ad
and you wish all those things were
completely gone and away whoops in
today's video may just be for you now ad
guard is more than just a powerful tool
for removing ads it's also very
customizable and it'll actually help you
remove ads from other apps and browsers
so it enough to worry about anything at
all if you really hate seeing ads you
might want to check out today's video
and one thing you might find really nice
is that it works on both rooted and
unrooted devices so if you've modified
your phone don't worry you'll still be
in like Flynn now this is possible
because AD guard can work in VPN mode
meaning all your traffic goes through a
VPN server installed on your device
making filtering faster and more secure
and because of the local VPN no data is
transmitted to any third-party servers
sorry my Russian friends nyet
now one drawback is that you usually
can't run to VPN apps at the same time
on an Android device so if you wanted to
run another VPN app you can set ad guard
torn in proxy mode and let any other app
use the VPN now I don't know about you
guys but I like keeping things simple
and once you guys go and download the
app from their website it's very simple
to install and use which I like a lot
now you guys can see the home screen
it's pretty simplistic right it just has
a little power button to turn on and off
add guard it also shows the data saved
how many ads have been blocked and for
premium users how many threats have been
blocked as well now one thing I think
you guys are really gonna like about ad
guard is how many filtering options they
give you while still keeping everything
simple and easy to use every app the ad
guard finds in your device comes with a
plethora of options including ad
blocking mobile and Wi-Fi data access
there are even options to turn off your
mobile and Wi-Fi data even when your
screen is turned off it also shows a
little graph of all the mobile and or
Wi-Fi traffic for that app which you can
choose to see for the day the past month
or for eternity now apart from these
filtering options
you also get an endless amount of
options to customize the ad guard app
itself from basic options like auto
updating and extra filters to more
advanced options such as HTTP filtering
and proxy settings they also include a
filter log so you can see everything
that's been blocked and you guys can
choose what is safe and what's not now
you guys might be saying to yourself ah
this looks ok but does it really work
honestly as soon as I installed a guard
I saw a difference right away it blocked
all of the ads in my apps and some if
not all the ads in my Chrome browser and
with custom settings I'm sure I could
set it so no ad got through anywhere
add Guard has monthly programs starting
out as low as 83 cents for mobile users
or have all your devices covered for two
dollars and eight cents a month so
seriously if you're seeing way too many
ads on your Android phone or other
device you should seriously check out ad
guard now we'll have a link below for
30% off and these guys also have options
for a lot of different things for your
Android for your Mac for your PC even
for your iPhone and we'll have that
information down below so thanks for
watching taken tomorrow we'll see you
guys back on the channel for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
