welcome back once again detective
tomorrow now I don't know about you guys
but I am a fanatic when it comes to doom
I've been playing so long that I
honestly used to play with John Carmack
and the gang back when id first want
guess it kind of shows my age too a
little bit but hey I've been around the
block so today we're up on our gaming
test room you guys have said you know no
we're boring backgrounds well we've been
trying to clean this place up and get it
all nice and we're still not there but
hey we're up in our gaming room we've
got a couple systems back here this one
over here that you guys can probably
barely see that was our Tron system I
guess you guys can't see a camera shake
it has had a hell nel but anyways back
here behind me I have our on switcher
completely redoing and then we have the
test system that we're using today which
is the Mirror's Edge down below if you
guys follow the channel you guys saw
that now in my hand is an RX 460 now
this is a complete file in addition from
the people over at ex effects you can
get this card I've seen it as low as 119
bucks online up to about 139 depending
on the vendor now today's video is is
can this card actually play doom at
proper settings at 1080p and 1440 so
actually these videos brought you guys
in 1080p at 60 frames per second so with
that said though let's really quick take
a look at the specs of our Mirror's Edge
system now this system features a really
nice i7 processor it's got lots of parts
to nuts that are pretty high grade I
figured we test it off on this system
first and then later on if you guys
thought that was unfair
we tested another AMD type system as
soon as RISM gets there I'll be buying
that CPU and I'll be buying a whole
system built around that we'll try that
in that as well but with that said you
guys can see this is a pretty beefy
system we'll have a link down below if
you guys want to check out the full
review of that system because I was
pretty proud of it and I think you guys
will like it alright so that's the test
system real quick though Before we jump
into testing I want to tell you guys
that we are using the Vulcan engine
that's what we're doing for all the
testing everything is at 1080p and 1440
since we see a whole lot of comments
from you guys the gamer about recording
software and how it diminishes the
frames per second we decided to skip
that altogether and just record the raw
footage through our camera
hope you like it so let's check out doom
and do some freaking killing so here you
guys can see the game settings that
we're using why we're doing the testing
now first up we're going to have the
game at 1080p so let's get in let's kill
at 10 a
in God
Wow
you
so alright man at 1920 by 1080 you can
see cards doing very well now let's see
that same card in 1440 you guys can see
that the frame rates in 1440 actually
dropped by quite a good margin it does
take a lot more from the card to produce
that much graphic ability on your screen
but still the cards doing okay for such
a low price card what do you guys think
I want to see your comment below
Oh
you
you
alright so there you guys have it doom
on Vulcan on a card that's less than one
hundred and thirty nine bucks that's
seriously entry level gaming you guys
can see this card does pretty good in
1080p 1440 and kind of moons not the
best but hey like I said this card is
really on the cheap we did a complete
crossfire video about a week ago and you
guys can see that this thing scales
extremely extremely well one of the best
absolute cards I've seen for taking
advantage of that technology so like
usual download that like button love all
the information about this card if you
want to get one for yourself or just see
more information we got more vids coming
so stay tuned to tech up tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
