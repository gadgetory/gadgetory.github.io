Tech fans Elric here on TECA tomorrow
now you guys all know that AMD has
launched all their new CPUs they're a 8
they are a 10 all that which is a
complete all-in-one apu we've talked
about this before accelerated graphics
you know everything all built in one
will that's what this whole entire new
series of motherboards from AMD is about
now today we're gonna do the unboxing
and overview of the new biostar hi-fi a
85w now the big thing about this
motherboard is obviously there HiFi
sound so we talked about this before
other reviews if not make sure you look
in the link in description below we can
take you back to that we talked about
that but basically the high five sound
this motherboard it's not quite at the
same level as the extreme stuff that you
see on Asus motherboards but it is
better than any of the other Joe average
sound that's out there and that's really
one of the biggest features about this
board so with that said let's just take
a look at the box I'll bring it up here
to the cameramen so you guys can see
that on the back of the box they have a
lot of their own stuff they're smart
here hi find hi-5 power hi-fi amp dual
link DVI Windows 8 compatible alright
folks so we don't waste any more time in
the box we'll just go ahead and we'll
open it up right off the bat we have the
manual for the hi-fi a75 and the high
five
a 85w all contained in here drivers CD
go ahead and set that off to the side
take it quick flip just through their
manual
not too much they're just talks about
all the different stuff suck at FM - for
AMD a-series easy series processor AMD a
85 is the chipset so I'll go ahead and
close it up here's the rear i/o here are
few SATA cables one bundle of astoria
tore those bad boys there get that out
of the way or you this and then we'll
take out the packaging and guess and see
it's all in a completely sealed package
I'm going to go ahead and break the seal
and devirginized it that's right as the
first one to have my hands on who me
even as I'm starting to pull the tape
off I can smell that fresh motherboard
smell oh I love fresh electronics they
smell clean all right so let's pop this
thing out get the box out of the way
hopefully not knock anything over and
then we'll go ahead and set this board
down so that way we can start taking a
look at it so we'll start off over here
you can see here's the first four pin
power connector located right there here
you can see all the components the choke
and everything with their pure old hi-fi
they actually leave these pretty well
and open hopefully they don't get very
hot here's the socket plenty of room
around here for using any of the
aftermarket water cooling or other stuff
the CPU fan header is right here located
above it which is very good fan header
one should be as close to there as
possible and that's actually a very good
location for channels dual channel ddr3
memory works of a 2400 plus depending on
what member you get and what it has for
its XMP profiles so down here we have
the 24 pin power go back over here we
see system fan 2 so the first pounds up
here second fans located there
go ahead and move down we'll take a look
at what's going on here now this board
will support just standard stuff
it is PCI Express 2.0 and not PCI
Express 3.0 not going to get that here
but you do have 1/2 of the PCIe 1x slots
and then we have 1/2 of the other PCIe
slots to standard PCI slots over here we
have a little bio star logo and their
cooler now I'm going to flip it around
to the side real quick here
you guys can see SATA 6 gigabits a
second all the way across there's two
four six eight eight all together SATA
ports so that's a lot of support there
we have their panel light right here
this displays different lights and
Latinos will go along with the
motherboard now it's gonna be very hard
to see down here but they do have their
reset switch and their power switch
located right down here on the bottom
everything's color-coded completely
across right here so that when you're
plugging your cables from your case it's
easy to read and plug in you have USB
floppy another system fan located here
you have a chassis intrusion audio and
then let's move around here and let's
take a look at the puro
HiFi so we'll start off right here the
puro high-five they're all amp here you
can see all of their hi-fi caps and
their resistors you can see all that
very closely right here on the board you
can also see that it's segregated quite
a bit away from the other electronics so
that should help quite a bit with noise
interference so you should get pretty
clear sound off of that let me just real
quick flip it around show you guys the
back of the motherboard
a lot of people don't ever do that but
here's the back of the motherboard you
see doesn't backplate for some cooling
kit you're gonna have to
this and change that out and then last
but not least let's take a look at the
rear i/o so we'll start off over here
first off we have the standard ps2
keyboard port two standard USB 2.0 ports
HDMI port VGA port DVI port here is your
LAN 2 more USB 2.0 ports two USB 3.0
ports and then finally our 7.1 audio but
it's strictly through this strictly
analog if you want to get any type of
digital audio at all you're gonna have
to go through the HDMI connection which
also limits your graphics to 1920 by
1080 alright folks so that pretty much
just wraps it up now I'm gonna be
throwing this board in the test station
along with a few of the other ones that
I got in here and doing the testing with
that 810 process where I got in so I
hope you guys liked the video if you
seem a little jumpy today I am I didn't
get actually any sleep last night I
don't know why so today I'm just like
would it follow the sleep I feel nervous
and jittery the whole entire day so
forgive me but anyways I hope you guys
liked the video still this motherboard
is very very well priced for you guys
looking for an entry-level motherboard
that actually has above-average sound
this is good
and it also fares well in the
overclocking arena a lot of people don't
know this because Biostar in the past
had some will just say rather unsavory
entry-level motherboards which kind of
killed them but they've changed a lot in
the past few years and they have lots of
other boards that are actually very well
made that do well in overclocking well
and sound and have very very fair price
points don't be discouraged these guys
are a good company and these series of
boards are solid check it out in the
link below or if you want to buy all
these for yourself you can check that
out over on Amazon make sure you hit
that like button if you're not sub make
sure you do so because we always have
crazy going on here on the channel
and I'll see you guys later on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
