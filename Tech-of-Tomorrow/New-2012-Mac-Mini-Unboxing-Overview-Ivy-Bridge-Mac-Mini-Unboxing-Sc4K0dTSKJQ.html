tech of tomorrow I'm our host by now you
guys should know me now last week there
was a brand new release and a bunch of
stuff came out from the people over at
Apple you guys may have missed that if
you did make sure you check it out in
the link below and that said I have the
brand new mac mini that's right this
thing's 599 dollars comes with a dual
core 2.5 gigahertz processor 4 gigabytes
of ram HD 4000 graphics just like it's
simple intel graphics and this thing is
pretty much a macbook pro without the
keyboard and without the monitor it
comes in the market like i said at five
hundred and ninety-nine dollars if you
want to upgrade to a quad-core that one
comes in 2.3 and it's seven hundred and
ninety-nine dollars so that said let's
jump in and let's do the unboxing and
check out this new mac mini let's go
alright folks so we'll start out like
usual with the outside the box we see
the mac mini not to be miss confused
with macaroni and cheese see a picture
but right here on the front spinning
around will show you guys the back the
back place it explains hang right here
I'm going to go over anyways see your
headphone microphone SD all USB 3.0 yet
hdmi you've got 800 firewire you've also
got Thunderbolt you've got your land and
your power and you guys will see that
all inside of the box but let's go so
spin this thing around so actually all
you gotta do is just slide it out of the
box like so down right here get this
thing out of here pull it out the box
pretty heavy-duty actually um this is
pretty funny if you guys missed the
unboxing I did the little uh little
apple TV this actually seemed like an
apple TV this a little bit bigger so all
the way around guys can see it's very
thin show you guys the bottom now here
on the bottom with this you can spin
your hand like this and you can very
much open this up easily where you can
change out your memory and everything
now you can upgrade the video which
something we're going to say is a bummer
but this thing's pretty much meant to be
just a machine for checking your email
doing your generic stuff like that it's
not meant to be a powerhouse in any way
shape or form that's not what this is
about being a 509 dollar so let's spin
around here Brooks show you guys r io at
the power button power connection button
your land firewire HDMI Thunderbolt USB
3.0 and then we have VSD and then we
have audio N and audio out so that's
pretty much the tour of Little Mac Mini
itself let's check out the rest the
content that comes in the box so I'll go
ahead just move little mini Mac out of
the way here's what it looks like inside
the box folks
I'm gonna pull this out right here this
is the hello quick start guide hello and
now shuffling through here you can see
inside of here they're supposed to be
some other stuff I think they're
supposed to be actually some stickers in
here up so here we have in the back here
so you get to Mac little stickers these
go great in the back your truck or in a
window they just self apply and they're
clear we'll get past that then we have
the DVI to HDMI connector right here the
power cable which i'm i am going to
bother taking oh jeez you guys know what
that is so the park plugs into that part
we showed you before bring a little bad
boy over in case some people ever get
confused on how it works well this
little piece right here it plugs into
right there simplicity itself so that's
pretty much it folks i hope you guys
like this video if you did make sure you
hit that like button i always appreciate
that if you're not sub please do so so
you don't miss anything now this thing's
the mac mini i'm a little hungry so i'm
just wondering if i can take a bite out
of it nope I guess not doesn't taste as
good as it looks so anyways folks we'll
see you back here on tech of tomorrow
tomorrow the day before
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
