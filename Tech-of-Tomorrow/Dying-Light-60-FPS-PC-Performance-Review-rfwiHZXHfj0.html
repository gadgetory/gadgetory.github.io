us a new benchmark video and this time
we're looking at the cooperative
freerunning zombie basher that is known
as dying light and we're running it on
our usual test system which includes a
GTX 780 and an i7 4770k processor that
has been overclocked now this game
doesn't use traditional preset graphics
settings of low medium high but instead
goes for a simplified version which just
simply says best quality best
performance and balanced now just taking
a quick look at the options for the
graphics settings it's pretty easy to
tell that this game was designed for
console in mind and doesn't give very
many in-depth options for PC users and
when I first started it I have to say I
was pleasantly surprised by how high the
framerate was running at the best
quality settings seeing it hit as high
as 95 frames per second but sadly that
didn't hold up very true during the
actual core part of the game so let's
take a look at that right
so as you can see not the most stellar
performance but not all that bad either
the game does have some great visuals
good details fantastic draw distance and
a lot of really good looking particle
effects but it's absolutely killer to
low-end pcs I mean when you look at the
difference between the best quality and
best performance we're only seeing a
difference of about 15 frames per second
on average during daytime which for a
low-end PC it's going to be a much
bigger hit it is worth noting that there
have been fan-made patches which do give
you additional graphic setting options
which does make the game a lot
friendlier to lower NPC's allowing you
do two things like turn off the games
film grain effect however a recent patch
actually disabled these mods though
according to the dev team this was an
accident and they're working on a quick
fix right now to make graphic mods
available once again so if you're
running on a lower NPC and you want this
game you might want to wait for that
patch to come out first now as for the
actual game itself it's one of the
better free roam zombie co-op
experiences that I've had fun combat and
crafting a great experience system and
most importantly the ability to dropkick
zombies left and right the story itself
is on the weaker side big surprise for
free roam zombie game I know but the cop
aspects have been really enjoyable if
what little you've seen here is already
grabbing your attention we do have a
link posted down below if you want to
pick the game up also while you guys are
