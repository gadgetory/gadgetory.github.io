you guys doing welcome back once again
to the channel I'm Miller to your host
and today we're going to be building the
system that we talked about over on my
new a TV show called docks corner so
over on that channel I talked about a
slash hackintosh slash PC and this is
basically the build you guys can see
there's all kinds of parts out here on
the table we have tons of stuff PCIe
boot drive water cooling lots of cool
stuff dual SSD drives white power supply
Y cables all across the table as you can
see these all come via the lovely people
that are over there at silverstone
they've provided these we also have
sponsors from kingston from gigabyte we
have lots of sponsors in this awesome
build so what are we gonna do today well
today we're gonna just basically give
you guys a bill blog we're not gonna
give you guys a how-to installation
guide type thing but we're gonna
basically show you in steps what we're
doing first we're gonna put the CPU in
the cooler onto the motherboard then
we'll put the motherboard into the case
then we'll assemble and just do it in
steps and as we do it until the system
is done we're gonna make a compilation
and at the end of the video that'll be
what this is so this video will be
basically us building this system which
you guys can see next week on Doc's
corner on new atv we're gonna be working
together doing videos now so we're a
little co-production here so this is the
system like always you know guys any of
these parts that you guys want to check
out will be listed in the description
below and with that said we're gonna go
in and do part one as we install first
the CPU and the water cooler onto the
motherboard which you can see right here
is one by gigabyte and then we're just
gonna show you more and more as the days
go on or actually is today it goes on so
we're doing today but anyways let's go
and let's start building this thing
alright everybody so check it out
so right now we have the motherboard
here we've installed the i7 3770 CPU
this is the water 2.0 pro for the people
over at thermaltake this thing was very
easy to install I know a lot of people
out there go my god water cooling it's
going to kill me but actually it's
honestly easier than air cooling you
want to challenge me on that go out and
buy an air cooler
go buy water cool that is one of those
really cheap pup in penguins actually
these type of things are much simpler
put it back bracket on ply your thermal
paste four screws in mounts simple and
done you're talking about 15 to 20
minutes so this is step one we've got
this on here now we're gonna go inside
start getting the crease rate and move
the rest of the parts in and then we'll
give you an update as we go along
alright everybody so check it out
continuing on with our dual boot system
now so far we have mounted the
motherboard inside the system the water
cooler everything's inside there we've
also mounted all the drives which just
push out my button on the side here so
we have both the HyperX drives those are
the two drives here on top and one thing
cool about this is all the wiring is
actually done internally and actually
back on the rear side of the case I have
to worry about any wire
whatsoever just easy money all the way
got the 2 2 terabyte drives installed
the last two drives and I've still have
an extra drive bay down here in case I
want to get crazy so let me put these
things back in here and as we are going
and looking and discovering things about
the build I discovered that that OCZ
PCIe SSD is not going to be working very
well with the Mac OS so we've decided to
forgo using that and we're going to try
something a little bit different this
time so once I put all these things back
in here I'll go ahead and just make sure
this all lock you guys and you'll all
make a little click sound I'm gonna go
ahead and use this a data this is a
little ms 8 128 gigabyte Drive I'm gonna
go ahead and stall that and install the
memory right now so you guys can see
some live action stuff so with that said
I'm gonna get up right now by the way
all the cabling that we're using is by
silverstone thanks very much mr. juan
over there and we appreciate that so
we're gonna move all this stuff out of
the way and i'm gonna go ahead and take
the system now and set it down inside of
here alright everybody so here we have
what we're gonna put the memory in
here's the memory that we're gonna be
using this is our kingston 16x HyperX
what we usually use Kingston some of my
favorite stuff you go ahead and break
the seal right here
let's check this out HyperX beast
matching pair so I'm going to come down
here now into the case open up a couple
slots of my memory now these are only
two sticks so I'm going to put one as
close as I can to my CPU just go in
there match up the slot take the memory
simply push it down click easy money
take the second stick bring in the third
stick down and there's the memory you
guys you see we're using white cables
water coolers in now we're going to
continue along the bill and we'll bring
you an update in just a couple minutes
alright folks so next up we're going to
install the MSA to drive onto the skin
of my motherboard so don't wants to get
do a little mini unboxing right here as
I take this package out here this time
you're actually brain you'd see it this
is a 128 gigabyte a data mm SATA go
ahead pop that on this little box right
there you guys can see it's a simple
insertion so I'm gonna bring it down
into the motherboard right here match
the two holes up and then voila it plugs
in and then you just pop it in just like
you do laptop memory so easy going now
they've got 128 gigabyte boot tribe
that's mounted onto the motherboard see
you in a minute okay folks so we're
continuing along in the day now I know
to you folks it just seems like a couple
of minutes but actually you have two
rounds of text but you're all day long
getting this thing yeah now check out
we've got the video card installed got
the basic power PI installed
everything's really good to go now we're
gonna do the final touches of getting
all the cables and everything taken care
of then we get all the cable management
so it looks perfectly totally utterly
cool and clean then we'll be going on
and doing the software now all in all
this is taken probably about four and a
half hours to do taking the time to make
sure everything's done completely right
one thing I want to say with the water
core thing once again these type of
things a lot simpler than buying a kit
because you don't have to pretest
prefilled check for leaks these things
are Daren
not the leak and everything and if it
does leak whop you're gonna be getting
your money those people they'll take
care of it but it won't leak so that's
pretty much it let's go ahead and let's
finish the system up and then we'll show
you guys the final bill before we do the
software see in a few okay folks so here
we are at the end of the day the
system's completely built now it's gonna
come the interesting part installing the
different parts of software so we know
it's possible there's just some tricky
ways to go about doing it one thing I'm
not quite sure but I'll be able to use
this keyboard in both the Mac and the PC
system I may not be able to do that I
may have to actually have a Macintosh
keyboard and mouse to be able to use
wolven hackintosh versions of the system
that I don't know I will find out
because I'm now going to take the X
effort and install the different types
of software luckily I have Mac stuff
around so that won't be a problem at all
I'm gonna try just using this so the
first thing I'm probably gonna do
startup I have the two drives in there
so I'm gonna use each one of those
drives I think now as the primary drive
so we have those two SSDs we talked
about I'm gonna use one for the Mac one
for the PC and for right now until we
figure out the mod I'm just gonna go
into the BIOS and a little BIOS and I'll
make one the boot disable the other and
that way there won't be any problems and
it'll be clean and easy to do so with
that said make sure you guys check it
out he goes on new egg I'm gonna have my
video going up on this as well but you
guys don't want to make sure you miss
that also if you're having an interest
of purchasing this type of system all
the links will be down below in the
description or everything inside the
system you can buy at new egg I think
currently though the UGK might be out of
stock but you can buy these parts
separately so you can build yourself a
system pretty much exactly the same as
here so that's pretty much it folks we
thank you guys for watching peace out
much thanks to our tech Anthea Reynolds
man he's the guy who always
helps us do these things you guys know I
have really bad died be so if I shake
like crap and if I try to build most of
this I'd probably break
but that's why you got good friends
right so peace out make sure you guys
hit that like button and like that video
here's buddy the doggy does know you
love ya if you don't hit the like button
he'll be sad and feel like you don't
love him and not to break his heart you
want to make sure you do so that said
also be subscribed because the 100k
contest is about to come to a head and
