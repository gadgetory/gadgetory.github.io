tech of tomorrow those you that caught
us yesterday saw that we did a first our
impressions of Splinter Cell blacklist
and while I was at it I picked up
another big title that came out they've
been really looking forward to so get
ready to see the beginnings of one of
the Fallas raunchiest most hilarious
games we've been looking forward to this
year Saints Row 4
so Saints Row 4 is taking the changes
that we started to see in saints row the
third and has taken them to a whole
different level basically throwing away
any notion that the game is just a
slightly wacky urge ETA competitor but
instead something completely of its own
design basically the first hour is all
you really need to gather the fact that
this game is completely insane and does
its best to make sure the plot and
activities of the game are as incoherent
as possible to begin with we have a nice
little mission to save the world
followed by becoming president then
aliens invade then a personal hell in
the form of basically Pleasantville and
right back to the free roam sandbox game
we know sort of instead of just relying
on cars and guns and all the other
things were used to in the franchise
Saints Row 4 takes things a step further
in the direction of the weird by
basically turning the setting into the
matrix and giving players the power to
break the rules with superpowers to
begin with have only obtained the powers
of super speed and jumping but those
alone have already reshaped the way the
games played and how exploration is
handled with these powers players find
new activities like time trials and
tower climbing along with some classic
favorites like throwing yourself into
traffic as much as possible now I'd like
to note that for the first hour of
gameplay I chose to just take the
default character design to save time
and get you guys this footage and my
thoughts but it must be mentioned that
the character creator in this one is
just as robust and psychotic as it was
in 3 and I plan to make full use of it
next because I hadn't done that first
well I'd still be making my character as
we speak I'd also like to point out one
my favorite little jokes amongst the
character creation options the voice
options with three male ones three
female ones and deserving his own named
category nolan north for those of you
that are fans of uncharted and the
recent deadpool game and this game is
not shy about flexing the voice talent
behind it and I'd have to say my
personal favorite new addition to the
supporting cast would have to be Keith
David playing well vice-president Keith
David now the fact is I've only played
for about an hour and there's already
too many different things to talk about
I haven't even scratched the surface yet
talking about weapon car and clothing
options the actual plot or at least what
madness stands for plot and the plethora
of gaming parodies and pop-culture jokes
that already seem innumerable so to
really see how it compares to its
predecessor and how it stands overall
it's a full game I'm gonna just spend
the next couple of weeks just really
losing myself in it and probably calling
into sick work a few times
sorry Jarnell Rick you guys didn't hear
