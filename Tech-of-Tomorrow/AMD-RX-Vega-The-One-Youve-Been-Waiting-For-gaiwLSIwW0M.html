30th at SIGGRAPH we're finally going to
get the vega card that we've all been
waiting for that's right the RX Vega
gaming editions now from what we've seen
so far the specs are pretty much very
similar to the FE Edition only thing is
though it's 30 megahertz faster and as 8
gigabytes of HBM to memory so that's
pretty cool looking like the base clock
speed of this cards we've got sixteen
hundred and thirty megahertz now I saw a
Sun sight out there they actually had
the card having a base clock of 1800 and
over if it's doing 1800 and stuff that's
really pushing a 1080i and from what
we're seeing it will not be a 1080i so
it's not going to be the 1080i killer
but it is beating the 1080 by 15% in 3d
marks that's right we're seeing 3d marks
of a score of over 31,000 using the
brand new RX Vega gaming edition if this
comes to be true well that's going to be
killer because it's going to be beating
the 10a now the things that we'd talk
about here though are price versus
performance so we see that the RX Vega
is coming out we're going to see the
gaming edition is going to be released
at SIGGRAPH but what is its price point
going to be so it's going to be some of
the issues now is price point and power
consumption and noise those will be some
of the issues that really come up and we
see the card get launched now we still
see the card is made with that blue and
gold theme I don't know if they're
planning on just keeping this and
they're doing this and changing from
their commercial of black and red stoves
they've been doing forever in a day I
mean originally if you guys are MV fans
you know that AMD started off as green
and black pretty much almost the same
colors of Nvidia and the only reason
they really change is well let's just
think about it back in the day and video
made video cards AMD made CPUs they
weren't in the video card business so it
didn't matter if they could have the
same colors they weren't competitive
whatsoever they worked together just
fine but then with the purchase of ATI
well all of a sudden the color scheme
changed to black and red and now it
looks like they're changing it to blue
and gold now check out this screenshot
right here it shows you all different
variants that are out right now from AMD
you guys can see there's also two
different variants of the RX Vega coming
out they'll have two different SKUs
beyond this one maybe
see more than that but only time can
tell but for now we can see that the AMD
rx Vega gaming Edition is looking like
it's going to beat a 10-8 now we have to
take this also with a grain of salt oh
absolutely for one thing is a synthetic
test we don't know the environment we
don't know the card we don't know if
there's you know a golden sample they
pick was actually know that the fastest
one that they were produced off the line
none of those things we don't actually
know at this point but we do know is
there's going to be a few more models
being released so you'll see two
different variants beyond this gaming
Edition at this point at SIGGRAPH
they're going to announce this and it
should be crazy stuff across the board I
can't wait and I know that you AMD fans
out there cannot wait honestly I really
hope the card comes to market at cheaper
than a 1080 but faster that will help
AMD quite a bit now if the card comes
out and it gets launched and it's exam
price as a 1080i but only getting today
performance me personally like I told
you before I don't play the fanboy game
I'm not a fan but I'm not just going to
buy something from a company just
because it has a name I'll never do that
the card comes out and it cost as much
as a 1080i and as a performance of a
1080 I'm not going to be interested in
buying it but if AMD can come with a
solution that's cheaper and faster than
the 1080 definitely I'm in like Flynn
and I want to get those cards because
that will be awesome hopefully we're
going to see some improvement in DirectX
12 but safe with crossfire because right
now it's pretty much a dead issue but I
love to crossfire these cards and see
what we can get out of it but they're
probably just had to be done with older
games so there you have it folks
RX Vega gaming Edition hitting the
market man just an incredible card eight
gigabytes of that HBM to memory so you
know it's going to be really really
SuperDuper fast and you guys can see the
memory bandwidth is just incredible 484
gigabytes a second that's just
incredible stuff so you know it's going
to be very fast once again we see a 2048
memory bus so that's just incredible
nobody else has anything like that in
the market and I'll be honest with you
AMD has a lot of great ideas that always
look great but I don't know if you guys
remember RAM bus memory a long time ago
from Mendel and told reduces stuff
called Rambis memory it was SuperDuper
fast it was supposed to be the greatest
thing in the world
but the only thing was is that using the
memory was like trying to take a giant
bus and then make a sharp curve well
that's not going to happen a giant butts
gonna have to go way out and do it stuff
so the way the memory actually end up
working it wasn't as fast as everybody
thought it was going to be because AMD
has all these great things that on paper
just looked absolutely amazing
but for years we've been hearing hey
it's going to be our year last year we
heard hey in 2017 we're going to take on
the world it's not happening yet I'm
still waiting for it I know you guys are
we'll also have links to the Articles
that we got this information for this
video down below so we'll see you guys
back here in TECO tomorrow for more Tech
and remember the weekends coming and
it's going to be crazy it's going to be
Amazon Day on Sunday the 11th which
means lots of killer deals and also a
lot of people been asking me about these
speakers right here for these are the
can - why you force and these things
sound incredible I'll make sure the link
down below like button so you guys can
check them out if you hear them you're
going to be going like holy crap because
they're even louder than the sound box
which I thought was going to be pretty
incredible but these things are super
loud super bassy and super high-end all
at the same time actually a great set of
speakers for companies I know not too
many people know who the heck they are
so many ways
peace-out we'll see you guys back in the
channel for more news tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
