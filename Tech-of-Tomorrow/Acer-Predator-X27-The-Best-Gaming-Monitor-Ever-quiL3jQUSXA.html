something I didn't know was gonna be in
this big of a box and I definitely
wasn't ready to start filming yet I'm on
my casual clothes on shave and
everything but I was just chilling on my
living room waiting for this package to
arrive and so it's a big giant box and
I'm really hoping that it is where I've
been bugging and bugging them about if
you guys followed us at CES of 2018 they
actually showed off some crazy killer
monitor giant huge monitors featuring
g-sync technology and everything these
were amazing and well products have been
rolling out of smaller versions that I'm
really hoping that sits in this box so
uh let's check it out and let's see if
it is what I think it is if it is this
is probably going to be one of the most
radical products that we've ever seen
around here that's more packing material
on here let's throw the night at the
camera man no I'm just kidding talk to
the side okay packing material a big
giant piece of memory foam which could
be used actually as sound material in a
wall and I think I actually will keep
that and use it for that because that's
actually a nice piece for that get that
out of the way oh we oh wow this looks
like cat piss inside the box oh let's
see here oh yes so yes it is what I
thought it was going to be let me see if
I can get it out of here and find the
handles oh here we go whoa look what
don't fall forward with not having any
feet makes it difficult let's get this
out of the way actually even more of
that packing foam in there and that
stuff's honestly great for insulation
for especially if like sound boarding
and stuff like that so check this out
man
so this is it folks I've been waiting
for this since CES this is an incredible
monitor the Acer predator X 2727 pure
inches of awesome gaming goodness so
with that said though let's actually
check out what this monitor is all about
and why it just may be the best monitor
ever made for gaming over the years I
have seen a lot of monitors here in our
lab I mean lots of different monitors
lots of different specs lots of
different features but today's product
that we're going to be checking out is
probably the absolute best gaming
monitor hands-down and the fact that it
does 99% RGB as well which is for Adobe
means it almost has the exact same
colors matching up to everything that
Adobe does so if you're an artist and
you do that kind of stuff it's gonna
work perfectly for you as well so I want
to start out saying that even though
this is the most awesome gaming monitor
a lot of the features of this monitor
will translate over into the
professional workspace because for one
thing this monitor is not for the meek
when it comes to pricing not at all in
fact I was almost going to title the
video the most expensive monitor ever
made but I'm sure it's probably been a
few more monitors are more expensive but
this baby this is the brand-new Predator
X 27 that's right
4k gaming at 144 Hertz yeah I said it 4k
gaming at a hundred and forty-four Hertz
monitor features G sync with HDR
technology and it's the brand new HDR 10
technology now some games that around
the market like Far Cry 5 they actually
support this right in the game so when
you're inside the game go into the
settings and you can change it and when
you turn the HDR on it's just amazing
now regular monitors have a different
type of technology in them as well you
folks who follow the channel I did it a
monitor review a while back it was on
quantum dot technology well the X 27
also features quantum dot technology
which is the very
best that you can get pretty much in the
panel now it's an IPS panel for
milliseconds response time but the pixel
density is a little tiny little nano
little nano pixels everywhere so that if
you were an old-school monitor you're
probably looking at a pencil density
about 0.2 4 which means that
everything's going to be closer together
and denser which makes the picture just
look more natural let's just face it you
know the bigger the pixel space
everything the more blotchy the more
weird it looks you know the denser the
pixel density the more your pictures are
going to look real now HDR technology
especially HDR 10 this is the latest HDR
high dynamic range and what it basically
does in this particular monitor there's
384 places that are being lit so an HDR
everything looks more bright it looks
more vivid and pictures of things will
look more natural they'll actually be a
little lit up almost exactly how they're
supposed to be in the original image so
whoever is the developing the image and
everything in the HDR technology if it's
in there we'll take advantage of that
and you will see everything much
brighter much more vivid honestly this
monitor looks amazing I am totally blown
away like I know the price tag is $2,000
but everything on this monitor is
amazing you have a thousand nits of
brightness it features their their acer
i care which basically mean it's like an
anti-glare screen so the screens not
gonna like make you go and be blind it
has built-in speakers it has G sync I
mean just all kinds of features there's
even a way that they have a mode that
you can go in and change the darkness
settings so with this particular setting
you can go in game if the game is too
dark you can actually lighten it or
brighten it up or darken it rather to
whatever you like this is a pretty
unique feature now I know some people
say hey I could just use the brightness
but to do this but this is actually a
different type of thing when you use the
brightness pretty much the entire screen
just starts fading too you get like a
white type image with this particular
tool that doesn't happen at all it just
allows you to brighten the area that
you're playing in the game and it does
it pretty naturally as far as the inputs
and outputs go it's pretty cool because
there's four USB three
ports two of them are located in the
back and two of them are located in the
side for easy access and on the back you
have a display port connection an HDMI
connection you have a headphone
connection and you also have a plug for
your power something that's also kind of
interesting is there are three different
crosshairs that you can choose from and
these can be changed by your OSD or the
game view settings you also have one
button access to eight different types
of mode for various games editing movies
and truly the amazing thing about this
monitor is that it is true 4k on a
27-inch screen and yes it is a full
27-inch screen it's not smaller it's not
like you know 26.4 it's a true 27 inch
screen and that's pretty cool
3840 by 2160 the resolution and with all
of these features i have to tell you it
is the most incredible looking monitor
that I've ever put in front of my face
I've checked out every single one of the
Acer monitors that's ever come out the
predator vision excuse me rather the
predator model and every single one of
these has been really unique always
expensive you know they always are
expensive the Acer predator monitors
like I said they're not for the meek
they're for the people who want the
absolute best and for the specs you're
really not gonna find anything better
for this on the market whatsoever there
are a few companies I think that'll be
involved making monitors like this I
know that a zoo s-- is one of them acer
is another I'm sure there probably is a
couple of their players that will have
monitors of this same quality and
caliber but also these monitors you know
are going to be really really expensive
but in game HDR when it's turned on is
just really nice-looking you go from
having a screen that looks good looks
kind of cool you know looks okay but as
soon as you enable HDR's you guys can
see like here in Far Cry 5 everything
just blooms it gets much brighter
everything just I mean I the only way to
really explain is it just gives
everything a much more lively or look to
it it's not only brighter it just looks
a denser the colors look deeper it's a
lot more than just a brightness
technique but like I said earlier in the
video inside of the monitor around the
inside of the monitor
there's 384 separate lights that are
lighting
that background so that's gonna be
really cool and HDR 10 and the games
that do support it looks honestly
killer you guys will really dig it the
only caveat like I said before however
is for a lot of people don't be like wow
man I can get another panel for way
cheaper than this you know and buy a
couple panels like that and yeah
obviously you can do that but like with
any you know bleeding edge technology
product you're always going to be paying
quantum dot technology right now
is like almost kind of like ahead of the
curve when we work with Samsung we
brought that monitor to the table it was
only like a 24 inch monitor and it was
already like five or six hundred dollars
just for that monitor and it was not a
gaming monitor whatsoever it was just a
monitor for watching for like business
and stuff where this has all kinds of
other technology and the fact of trying
to bring that 144 Hertz on that monitor
at 4k that takes a lot of processing
power and a lot of stuff to get that
stuff going and bring it to the screen
so it looks nice for you now most of
people watching this video obviously
you're gonna know what g-sync is and
what g-sync is is that it works with
different types of products from Nvidia
oh and one thing it's really funny if
you look inside the box it says this is
recommended to use a 1080 Ti or better
yeah 1080i or better so let's see that
you have the best or you hang out and
wait for the future honestly in a couple
of years these monitors will drop in
price and you know about for a little
bit cheaper but even the earlier
predators that I have when I go and look
at the price on like eBay and stuff
they're still selling for like 900 to
$1,300 so these monitors as long as
they're not broke or anything they still
seem to have a value to them now the
design of this particular monitor is
also really cool it's completely
diamond-cut everything looks really
really nice their built-in speakers it
has tilt swivel height adjustment so no
matter how you want to set the monitor
you can set it up there this makes it
really economic for any type of person
because let's just face it different
people like their monitor to be a
different way and with this particular
monitor you can put it any way that you
wanted any height you wanted any kind of
adjustment that that makes it
comfortable for you you can do and the
design like I said it's all diamond-cut
very nice it doesn't even really look
like the earlier generation predators
it's kind of a whole new theme on its
own the built-in speakers they sound
pretty good they're not gonna be like
having a separate set of speakers with a
subwoofer obviously but if you're a
person who likes everything in your desk
and you don't really mess around I got
to say the speakers don't stink
whatsoever they can handle decent bass
and play games and they play games
pretty decently the technology inside of
it you know may even be like geared
courts like you know even headphone
technology so that it can take the boom
of the bass and all that stuff and you
know not make the monitor shake or
anything else because even when you're
playing your game stuff the monitor
doesn't shake so the sound is pretty
decent it's not crappy sound whatsoever
but honestly texts keep saying that
honestly you like to stay on Y but I
always just say what I feel like I just
want to tell the absolute truth about
this product that's because I know it
$2,000 before I go what the frack
gallery $2,000 so I'm like crying okay
in my mind how can I justify this
$200,000 price tag I mean honestly
$2,000 it's hard to justify the price
tag do I personally think it's too much
money yeah hell's to the yes I think
it's too much money um I was lucky
enough that Nvidia kicked me down one
for for a review so that was really
awesome of them paid no money whatsoever
for this though but I mean the specs
themselves just jump out and speak at
you and like when you're online you're
going on the internet and you're looking
at anything and you see how clear the
text and everything is on this monitor
like I said before whether you're a
gamer or your person who's just on the
internet a lot or your person who works
with Photoshop and does that type of
stuff this monitor will shine in all
those different areas for different
reasons even though it's marked as thick
as a gamer's monitor and right now it
probably is the best gaming monitor that
you can get your hands on on the whole
planet
is there one in a secret lab somewhere
better there might be but for now we're
definitely not seeing it whatsoever
the Acer predator X 27 is a really
killer monitor unfortunately for those
out there who want bleeding edge
technology you're gonna have to pay the
big bucks to get that now the on-screen
display is also something I want to talk
about real quick it's very easy to use
there's a little red toggle button in
the back of the monitor so to do all the
adjustments including the overclocking
all that stuff you
can do all that from this little toggle
button even the we talked about a little
bit earlier there's a feature in there
like I said where you can adjust inside
of the game's the darkness level so if
you're in a game it's too dark you just
use a little thing toggle to it adjust
to what you want and then you're up and
going so there you guys have it I mean
if you want more information about this
monitor I'll have a link down below but
it's hard to really say something bad
about something when everything about it
is really really nice like I'd really
like to be able to say okay you know
cool these other monitors like I was
looking online yesterday and they have a
hundred and $69 monitor it's an IPS
panel it's not four milliseconds doesn't
have G sync doesn't have any of these
special technologies but it's a hundred
and $69 so how can I like you know
relate to my audience okay $169 monitor
versus a monitor that cost two thousand
dollars
well this monitor that's two thousand
dollars will probably last a very long
time it looks the best it plays the best
games look great text looks great you
can't get anything better on $169
version I ordered one I don't know how
it's actually going to look and compare
but later on I'll do a comparison
between one hundred and $69 monitor and
a two thousand dollar monitor and we'll
see how much real differences that there
are and what makes this monitor you know
you know worth such a higher price tag
so thanks for watching the channel i'm
mel eric like usual we'll have more
information about this down below so if
you want to check more information out
there you've got the big bucks and you
want the best of the best then you can
buy one for yourself peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
