game giveaway we didn't do it last
Friday because I have found out that it
is totally utterly impossible to ever
hold another contest on YouTube so
before you freak out as you guys found
out there's no way to make any
communication through YouTube anymore
and by the way the last giveaway I
announced all the winners not one of you
claimed your prize I announced all the
winners on the channel how to get a hold
of me how to do it
not one person actually even sent me an
email or even tried to claim the prizes
so there's not gonna be any more YouTube
videos excuse me not YouTube videos
there's not going to be any more
giveaways on my YouTube videos I will
direct you to other places where we're
going to be doing these things so you
can go over there and still win the
prizes but I have no way of
communicating with you you have no way
of communicating with me so that means
how am I gonna get your address how are
you gonna prove it's you it's impossible
so we're gonna have something
interesting for this Friday I'm gonna
give away 30 games that's right 30 steam
games I said it I'll say it one more
time to you thirty mother
frakkin games of my friends that's right
so check it out this is how it's going
to be on the patreon site I will be
giving away a title games the people who
are actually paying to see my videos and
paying to help support me my cameramen
and my family I'm gonna give the
absolute best games out right there and
then I'm gonna give ten games away on
Twitter and ten games away over on
Instagram first time we've ever had an
Instagram ever so if you guys are
wondering do we have an Instagram
channel what's going on with it yes we
have an Instagram thing we'll have a
link down below
now all the games that I give away
though on the Instagram and that these
games will all be games that are around
nine dollars up to nineteen dollars
depending on the title I always go get
the games according to the ratings I
make sure they're fun stuff and people
out there you know you get your games
people always say Oh
dude no one's ever not got their prize
that's just completely rude linkage so
whatever person last time left some
stupid comments saying that you're kind
of ridiculous I mean the only time a
person wouldn't get their prize is if
they never claimed it or bothered to get
a hold of me so I could send it to them
and that's fault you know in that case
it's not my fault I mean what am I
supposed to do if a person doesn't
contact me and claim their prize just
randomly send it up to space and go dear
lord please make sure this package gets
to this person who I have no idea who
they are or anything else so you know
kind of impossible but now we're gonna
do things a little differently in fact
like I said before YouTube is really
failing in many bad ways let me make
another video because they're really
shady things going on now the last few
contest that we had a lot of people said
hey man i subbed your channel i subbed
your channel well according to youtube
there has been not one new sub at all
and it seems like now for every sub or
somebody some of the channel it's going
in Reverse I mean you can experiment it
with yourself if you're a new viewer you
can hit that sub button and then refresh
the page and look at it and most likely
if it's at 291 blah blah blah it's gonna
be 290 the subs are going in Reverse no
crap I'm not joking with you I've always
known that YouTube has had problems
especially with my channel there's been
so many weird things that just don't
work it just keeps getting worse and now
I came and communicate with you so a lot
of stuff we're gonna be doing is over on
the patreon site but over on the patreon
site I'm gonna have like an incentive to
my viewers basically for me to keep
living and everything and take care of
my house and keep things going I need to
make about $2,000 a month so I'm gonna
make tears over on that channel where I
have really unbelievable giveaways from
a lot of different sponsors from around
the world where people can get much
better prizes directly from me on
patreon and as the numbers grow I'm
going to increase what those prizes are
you know so at $500 maybe I'd be giving
away you know like some mice or some
stuff like that at $1,000 I'll start
giving away you know better stuff then
monitors and then obviously you know all
the
way up to giant systems we're also going
to be doing a lot more Instagram or
Instagram right now I'm not really
pushing it so you know it seems kind of
like it's not really going anywhere so
I'd really appreciate it if you guys
would go follow us on Instagram it's
tech of tomorrow list just like the
channel now I'd really appreciate that
and like I said you know now we're gonna
announce it over there so following us
over there and the only one to be able
to you know to do that it's to know to
announce your name that you're the
winner
well it's through that process but we
can contact each other directly even
through Instagram so on Instagram and on
Twitter I can you know contact you guys
and you can contact me directly
every time I announce the winners over
on Twitter
everybody gets their game everybody's
totally stoked there's no BS whatsoever
it's a really nice simple process and I
know some of you guys are like oh man
you know what dude I hate Facebook I
hate Twitter I hate that well I'm not a
hater and if you want to hate man find
these these social media things they're
not hurting anybody I mean they're not
hurting YouTube to be involved them
whatsoever I mean you can make up an
identity and call yourself Fred the Frog
I mean nobody really cares it's not like
you got to put you know who you really
are so and and these days honestly is
the people out there who know there are
a lot of people out there who like our
professional contest dinners you think
I'm joking I'm not there are people
actually they spend all their time and
all they do is enter contests hoping
that the win with with the numbers game
you know so hope you know life is
different for everybody but for me I
want to be able to give you guys your
prizes and I want to be able to
communicate with you directly and I want
you to be able to communicate with me I
wish I had like a phone hotline like in
the old days we're like how you go all
right
winner number seven I'm calling you hey
it's me I'll work from checker tomorrow
you've won a prize blah blah blah blah
blah but technology these days
we've advanced and then win the
backwards all at the same time so there
you have it though 30 games everybody's
gonna get something cool I've never had
anybody complain about any of the games
that I've ever given them ever oh and by
the way yeah please don't leave a
comment down below going oh you know I
just want a freak
copy of plug B or a free copy of this I
don't do requests this is I'm not a DJ
you know I mean I go get the games I buy
my codes and I just give the codes out
but I always make sure they're fun games
always if somebody absolutely hated a
game and said oh dude I already have
this or whatever we trade the codes back
so I'm a very flexible person this is a
good thing for all of us so instead of
like getting mad about anything to do
with this YouTube you know BS that's
going on who even knows how long YouTube
it the way it's going even gonna be here
now that it's bought by Google there's
trying to turn into a TV station or a TV
channel you know YouTube I'll tell you
what it ain't about you and ain't about
me all it is now is about money and
corporate and greed but there you have
the facts folks down below we'll have
links to everything our Facebook our
Twitter hey our Instagram you know what
screw it I'll even give ten games away
from my facebook fans - so know what not
30 games 40 games mother</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
