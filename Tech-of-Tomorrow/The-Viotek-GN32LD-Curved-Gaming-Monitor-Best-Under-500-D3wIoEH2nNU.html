gamer who just games a little bit but a
gamer who games a lot and totally into
his gaming environment today we're gonna
be checking out something from a company
called biotech now this is their brand
new monitor it's the GN 32 LD 30 1.5
inch panel has all kinds of features
it's a curved monitor features 18 in at
our curvature just all kinds of fun
facts and this monitors design well now
I will say this though it does really
look like it's kind of being an Acer
predator clone there are a lot of things
about this particular monitor I was like
hey wow that looks kind of Acer predator
ish but beyond that for under five
hundred dollars if you're a serious
gamer you wanted a monitor that you want
a monitor that you can game on for hours
and hours and hours without giving you
fatigue this monitor features anti glare
technologies who be looking at the
monitor for a long time your eyes aren't
gonna go ah it's so bright it's killing
me but with that said though let's jump
in let's check out the features and
everything about this monitor because
it's honestly really cool for the price
tag so let's first check out the design
of the modern let's do that by checking
out the front first now starting up at
the bottom you guys can see the feet
really look a lot like an Acer predator
monitor I mean they are really looking a
lot like that and the design itself even
is kind of like that now there's a very
small bezel around the edge so you've
got a very nice small bezel around the
edge now on the front are all of the
controls as well your on-screen display
controls and they're very easy to
operate you just flicker through the
different buttons go through all the
different things and set things up now
take this in mind though there are some
features that you can take advantage of
in here but most of the features that
you're going to be using like setting
your refresh rate and all that stuff
you're going to do that all in your
control panel with are using Nvidia or
AMD inside the control panel is where
you're going to set up all that good
stuff now this monitor is sixteen to
nine ratio 178 degree viewing angle
which means that no matter where you sit
no matter where you're looking at it's
going to look pretty much exactly the
same and have a nice clear picture 2560
by 1440 resolution the backlit display
is provided by an LED there's 218 bits
of brightness and the default color
temperature is 65 under K which is a
little strange little bright better than
daytime the contrast ratio is three
thousand to one and one thing really
nice about this monitor is that the
response time is three milliseconds now
it's not the absolute fastest in the
world but it's definitely fast enough
for gaming and the refresh rate is 144
Hertz now best of all about this hundred
and forty four Hertz refresh rate is no
matter which video card you're using
whether you're using AMD or whether
you're using Nvidia you can set that to
144 Hertz without a problem now this
particular monitor also does support the
free sync technology you get less
ripping less tearing in your games if
you use that this is only by AMD cards
few fans who don't know NVIDIA has their
own solution called G sync and it
usually makes the monitor quite a bit
more pricey usually about $100 more so
for those people on a budget that's
definitely not going to work now in the
back of the monitor one thing that's
cool about this monitor is that it does
have lights that you can change so if
you want to have an Nvidia environment
you can make it all green if you want to
make it Angry you make it red or other
colors as well now as far as the
connections go the connections there's a
lot of different connections you have
DVI you have HDMI you have DisplayPort
and you even have an audio out part now
you might be wondering why do you have
an audio out part well with DisplayPort
and with the HDMI it has the audio in it
so you can hook up your speaker's
directly to there if that's so suits you
to keep your wiring without being messy
now this monitor can also be vaison
mounted which means it can be mounted
onto a wall very easily and it does have
a height adjustment feature not too much
as far as turning the monitor back and
forth and stuff like that but at least
you do get height adjustments so there's
no matter where you're sitting you can
make it so it's comfortable for you to
view the power plug is also located in
the back and for those of you guys who
want all the information this monitor
takes a maximum of 60 watts when it's
being used now you guys can see so far
that text and everything else looks
pretty nice on this monitor but how does
it look in game
well let's hop in game and let's check
it out like I said earlier this
particular monitor does feature
anti-glare features so you can look at
the monitor for long periods of time
without getting fatigued and you guys
can see that all the colors are very
nice and balanced they're not too
glaringly bright they're not too dull
they're pretty much right in the middle
which is really nice for a gaming
monitor you don't want some that's
really completely over saturated in
color or something that's actually
lagging in color and another cool
feature about this particular monitor is
it does have five different settings so
if you want to watch TV or play games or
different things you can try those
different settings out and one thing I
haven't really seen on too many monitors
at all is the picture-in-picture feature
so this way if you're watching one show
you can check out something else or you
could be playing your game and like
watching some kind of TV program at the
same time if you want to do so which is
actually quite a cool feature but for
gaming you guys can see this monitor
just looks absolutely brilliant and
that's what it's geared for now I don't
know what you guys think but honestly
I'm really impressed with this monitor
even though it is kind of a clone of the
Acer predator it does a really nice job
now the only Cabot's that I will say to
this monitor is looking at text and just
looking at your screen you know like
when you boot up in your Windows
environment to me this looks a little
bit dull maybe it's because the anti
glare feature I don't know that
particular aspect of the monitor you
know it doesn't shine for me but then
again you know people who are buying
this monitor aren't buying it going hey
I want to write a book they want to go
out and blow some stuff up on screen and
have some gaming fun and for that alone
it works absolutely great you guys saw
the in-game footage this monitor is
absolutely beautiful and with that you
know you get a response time of three
milliseconds that's really really fast
being able to set the monitor at 144
Hertz no matter which video card you're
using I like that a lot the 1800 R
curvature is just perfectly nice it just
barely touches right at the edge of your
peripheral vision now if it was a little
bit bigger that might be cool they might
they you know they marketed as a 32 inch
model but it's really only 31.5 inch
model like so I mean some people that's
gonna be like hey mer
they're not gonna like that very much
but still it's just the way things are
but at the end of the day for monitor
that constantly 469 dollars you do get a
lot of features in a gaming monitor and
honestly I think this monitor is an
editor's choice here in Tekken tomorrow
because for the sub
you know $500 category this monitor is
definitely kicking ass like usual we'll
have a link down below if you want to
check out more information about this
monitor or possibly buy one for yourself
and get your game on
