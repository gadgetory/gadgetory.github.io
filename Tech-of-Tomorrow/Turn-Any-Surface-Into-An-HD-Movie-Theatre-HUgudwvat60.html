gaming you like to watch a lot of TV you
like to do it on a big screen as well
but you do a lot of moving around
well then maybe having a really high-end
projector might just be the a ticket to
your entertainment adventure today's
video is brought to you guys by
viewsonic and we're gonna be checking
out the brand new px 725 HD that has a
lot of features I think you're gonna
really like in a projector and best of
all you can see the projector with light
in the background which I just think is
really amazing so with that said though
let's jump in let's start checking out
those specs and saying why the px 725 HD
is actually a really nice projector now
first off I know you guys are wondering
what comes in the box well you get the
projector itself you get a remote and
you get the power cable the px 725 HD
has a resolution of 1920 by 1080 P with
a brightness of 2000 lumens and with
2,000 lumens you guys can clearly see
the picture is very clear and very
bright and the life of the lamp is 3500
hours in normal mode and 7000 hours in
economy mode for super cinematic colors
the projector features a 6 x speed RGB
RGB color wheel with 100% rec 709 color
accuracy if you're wondering what is rec
709 well rec 709 is a highly exacting
International High Definition standard
that ensures devices can accurately
produce the precise colors of the
original content so what you're seeing
on the screen is just like it was filmed
the projector also features imaging
science foundation certified day and
night modes to deliver optimized color
in both bright and dark environments now
this particular software does it
automatically detects what kind of room
that you're in and tries to give you the
most optimal picture that you can get so
if you in a really really dark room you
probably don't want to be like overtly
brightened to blind you but if you're
also in a room that's pretty well lit
you want to be able to see everything
very clearly and this technology makes
sure that you're getting the absolute
best picture whether it's in darkness or
bright room
and with a cloud-based color profile
exchange you can also create and update
your own color profiles as well as
download color profiles created by
others to use on the px 725 HD and with
an amazingly low input latency of 16
milliseconds this is the ideal projector
for intense action-packed gaming as well
as watching movies the throat distance
this is the distance from the lens to
the wall is from three point three to
thirty two point eight feet or from one
to ten meters the display size which is
the screen size is 30 to 300 inches or
0.76 through seven point six meters now
the color depth on this projector is
1.07 billion colors with a dynamic
contrast ratio of twenty-two thousand to
one so the colors are very vivid and
very bright for ease of use the px 725
HD also includes a built-in eight watt
speaker and features view Sonic's
proprietary Sonic expert technology this
in conjunction with an enlarged speaker
chamber and a powerful amplifier
delivers a full range sound from 20
Hertz to 20 kilohertz
now as far as the connections go there
are two HDMI ports these are both the
1.4 standard there's a VGA connection
there's an rs-232 connection there are
RCA audio and video connections and
audio in and out a USB 2.0 connection a
mini USB connection a Kensington lock to
lock the thing down and make sure that
someone doesn't steal it and the AC
power plug as well another thing about
this projector that I really like is
it's very easy to set up you simply plug
it in turned on put in your source
device and you're up and going now like
I said before there is a little 8 watt
speaker built inside the units that you
can hear what's going on but there's
also a lot of different connections for
hooking up external audio device so if
you want to run it into a giant audio
system with a subwoofer surround sign
and all that stuff
you can do that or you can listen to it
out of the 8 watt speaker and
surprisingly enough this 8 watt speaker
really does sound kind of loud we
watched a couple of movies just checking
it out and everything sounded great and
honestly picture clarity on this once
you get it up on the screen is really
nice you guys can see Billy Idol here
the dudes rocking out and even in his
older age he's still looking good and up
there performing and the picture just
looks amazing and this is done when
we're right in the middle of day time
with a bunch of ambient light coming
around you so even in an ambient light
room you can see that all the colors are
very bright they're very easy to view
and setup just takes a couple of minutes
okay before we bounce out here let's
just once again talk about some key
points about the px 725 HD the things
that are very important to me about the
features are ease of use this particular
product is very easy to use the fact
that you can hook up HDMI USB all kinds
of different devices means you can
access all types of different media and
be able to watch them and the best of
all about this is that you can watch all
these things on a giant wall you don't
even have to go out and buy yourself a
projector screen if you have a nice flat
white wall anywhere in your house you
can use that particular surface and
it'll work great for viewing things
especially if like you're sitting on the
couch or something and you feel cramped
to your family you can
easily just project this onto a giant
wall where everybody can just sit back
and watch this
and playing games is also really cool I
mean it's really crazy to play Doom on a
monitor you know not a monitor but a
screen that's just extremely huge it
changes the entire experience and a lot
of people might think okay you know a
projector it's not really going to look
that great well this projector does look
great as you guys saw and it does it at
1920 by 1080 so you're getting full HD
projected onto whatever surface you want
to project it on to now outdoors for
people outdoors you can buy yourself a
projector screen and you can take this
anywhere you want to go and set it up if
you're not happy with the 8 watt
internal speaker like I said before you
couldn't look up external audio devices
and get absolutely brilliant sound that
way lots of choices here but to me
really the biggest thing of all of all
these features is the day and night
option because when you're watching
movies in different environments you
know that the picture is going to look
different and with that technology
that's built into this particular
projector it doesn't matter if you're in
a dark room you're going to be getting
the best picture it's going to be
turning down the contrast and the
brightness in your room that's got a lot
of daylight it's going to change the
settings again making it so that you get
the absolute best viewing experience
that you're going to get from a
projector also it comes with a
three-year limited parts and labor
warranty and a one-year warranty on the
lap at the end of the day I have to say
the px 725 HD is a killer projector so
if you're looking for something that you
can take all over the place offers you a
lot of options and a great picture hey
make sure you check it out like I said
we'll have a link down below you can
check out more information or get one of
these for yourself in time for the
holidays we'll see you guys back here on
teka tomorrow see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
