on TECA tomorrow checking out the brand
new 2016 12 inch MacBook
so let's first though check out what
comes in the box you get the macbook
itself or the edition that we're taking
a look at its the rose gold edition you
get the power charging cable the power
charging brick and obviously all the
nomenclature now as far as the specs go
internally you get an Intel Core M 3 1.1
gigahertz processor 8 gigabytes of
memory a built-in 256 gigabyte SSD and
as far as what's powering the graphics
side of things we see an Intel HD 515
graphics chipset featuring 1.5 gigabytes
of shared memory and looking under the
hood you guys can see the logic board
inside this thing is really small
actually smaller than a standard
smartphone the 2016 MacBook has a 12
inch screen featuring a resolution of
2304 by 1440 it also has a pixel density
of 226 pixels per inch for a very crispy
picture there is however though a small
caveat to having this great resolution
on this 12 inch screen is that it's
going to seriously tax the onboard HD
515 graphics and the CPU itself which
could result in poor performance in
games and other applications so few
folks out there wondering will this
thing do any rendering let's first check
out Cinebench and then if you want to
see how your MacBook or system compares
let's check out Geekbench the 2016
MacBook weighs in a 2 pounds so it's
very light and very easy to take
wherever you guys want to go but you'll
notice that it's a very very
minimalistic design and only features a
single port on the entire machine the
upside to that port however is it is USB
3.1 C type but the caveat is it only
runs at half the speed because its first
gen also if you want to hook up anything
else externally like little adapter they
run 80 frickin dollars that's right so
to use anything other than one thing at
a time you're gonna be spending some
cash okay so those are the specs on
paper they're not too bad if you like
something that's totally portable you
can take anywhere with you than hey May
the 2016 MacBook is your thing now we
all know that this thing's not geared
for gaming it's geared for general usage
but let's see the full game anyways now
the first game we're gonna check out is
Metal Gear Rising revengeance revenge's
does that mean they're getting vengeance
like twice it actually plays pretty well
maybe you don't get the greatest frame
rates in the world but still the
gameplay is pretty smooth so it looks
like some games are actually playable
next up let's check out Counter Strike
global Offensive now obviously this game
is not playing well at all with the 2016
MacBook you guys can see it's got screen
tearing stuttering huh nothing you
really want to take home and brag to
your mom about for gaming but there are
some other games like Fez and other
lowell games that don't require a lot of
intense graphic performance that run
pretty decent alright fellow youtubers
there you have it everything you want to
know about the brand new 2016 12 inch
MacBook the good is if you're looking
for something that's totally portable
has a great screen resolution then hey
this might be something for you the bad
huh I don't like anything that you
cannot upgrade it all with this once you
buy it what you have is what you get and
that is it and the ugly this thinks
1,300 bucks and 13-hour bucks it's
getting awfully close to a MacBook Pro
which will play games and all your
productivity will be much better
how are you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow like usual all the pricing and
availability down below that like button
and if you like what you see then hey
see in your sub box I'll to play with
the pink book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
