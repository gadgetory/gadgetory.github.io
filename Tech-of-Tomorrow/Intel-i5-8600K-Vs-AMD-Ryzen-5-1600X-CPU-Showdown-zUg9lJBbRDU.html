welcome back once against the channel
war today we have something really cool
a battle royale between Intel and AMD
on the Intel side of things we have
Intel's eighth generation
8600 case CPU 6 cores 6 threads baby and
on the AMD side of things we see the
horizon 5 1600 X with 6 cores and 12
threads now does 12 threads though equal
better performance at the end of the day
well let's first check out our test
systems check out those scores and see
at the end of the day who's the clear
winner for you folks who follow the
channel you guys have probably seen the
test system that we use for the 1600 x
test results we built the system a
little while back and if you guys want
to check out that video we'll have a
link below but here's a list of the
parts that we actually used in that
system for those of you who want to know
on the until side of things we also made
a video showing you guys all the
different parts that we used in that
system you can see those parts listed
right here but we'll also have a link
below if you want to check out that
video now if you're wondering what the
actual prices of these systems were
they're very very close now obviously on
the 1600 x we had to put it in a case
and everything because that was a total
build but if you're just talking about
the motherboard the memory and CPU and
all that stuff on the intel cited thing
that's gonna be about $60 more expensive
now that's not really that much
whatsoever I don't feel but if you guys
have to think it's a deal breaker let me
know down below now with that said
though let's jump in and let's check out
the performance and gaming scores with
these two CPUs so let the battle begin
as far as temperatures go at the lowest
settings the Intel CPU actually ran a
little bit hotter but at the hottest
temperatures you guys can see it the AMD
does run a few degrees hotter than the
Intel comparison alright Tech fans there
you guys have it the numbers they just
don't lie now it's very obvious that the
1600 X is a very very good competitor
it has good scores and although it runs
just a little bit hotter than the Intel
CPU it's fifty dollars less in price but
at the end of the day if you just take
the raw numbers you guys can see that
the i5 8600 K really is the clear winner
it gets better gaming scores it gets
better multiprocessor scores so overall
at the end of the day I have to say that
that is the winner between this battle
so if $50 is a big important thing to
you and you're only gonna buy an AMD CPU
and you don't care about it until what
it's over cuz you've got something
against them or whatever then obviously
you're probably not going to buy the
Intel CPU but if you're a person like me
and you take technology as it is just at
face value not caring about politics not
caring about Jack diddly except for the
performance then you have to admit that
the i5 8600 K it just wins now I know
there's gonna be crazy fanboys out there
like saying all kinds of crazy stuff you
know this is wrong that's wrong but
obviously it's not I try to keep
everything as even as possible the
systems are very much equal in price and
the parts and everything in them so it's
a very very equal battle so there you
guys have it man at the end of the day I
have to say for the price the
performance the I 580 600 K is a clear
winner in today's battle like I said
before folks all the information about
the parts that we used and everything
else will be down below that like button
hopefully you guys you liked this
presentation and we hope to see you guys
back here for more tech on tech a
tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
