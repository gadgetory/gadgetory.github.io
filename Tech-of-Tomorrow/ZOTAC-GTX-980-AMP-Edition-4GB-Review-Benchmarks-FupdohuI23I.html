tomorrow and what's on the hot plate
today a tech move tomorrow we've got
something pretty awesome to talk about
today now the GTX 980 s been out for a
while there's been a lot of variations
today's variation we're looking at his
one from ZOTAC this is the GTX 980 amp
Edition card this thing comes
overclocked out of the box features
three fans pretty awesome-looking kind
of has that black and orange look so if
you're looking for a mod and that type
of vein it's gonna be perfect for that
type of thing
with that said let's jump in let's check
out the speeds and feeds and in see what
this card is all about as we take a look
at the card you guys can see that the
entire card is caged in a really nice
alloy external thing it's pretty
actually strong pretty nice like I said
before there's three fans underneath
those fans you can see the heatsink and
the heat pipes they're all inside of
there to keep the card cool as we flip
the card down to the bottom you guys can
see there's the PCIe interface for
sticking into your motherboard flip it
around you can see there are three heat
pipes that are inside the card you can
see that because at the end there are
three copper tips as I flip the card run
to the other side you guys can clearly
see it has the zotac nomenclature right
there and then as far as the power
requirements you can see there are two
6-pin headers right there in the car for
providing the power to the card on the
back of the card something that's very
very nice you guys can see the whole
back of the card has a protective layer
on it this keeps your card from being
damaged and something that I really like
then we can also see the sli fingers
triple SLI capable now as far as some of
the other features ago this card is
overclocked like I said it comes out of
the box with 1165 megahertz as the base
clock and 12 65 megahertz as the boost
clock it's got 2048 CUDA cores features
a 7010 megahertz memory clock which is
basically you know ten megahertz over
the reference clock also features four
gigabytes of gddr5 memory with a 256-bit
memory interface full support DirectX 12
and opengl 4.4 as we flip the card
around and take a look at the connection
ports you can see there's four ports
altogether including a DVI which
supports 2560 by 1600 resolution there's
also an HDMI connector which features 4k
at 60 Hertz there are three display
ports each of those are 4k at 60 Hertz
and VGA is also available with the
included adapter so that's all the
speeds and feeds and all the stuff about
the card now let's bounce in and see
what everybody wants to know the score
so let's rock out to the benchmark
all right folks now before I bounce out

book called the end of diabetes and it
basically tells you that hey man you've
got to really change the way that you
eat everything and it's true you really
do it's really hard to totally make the
end of diabetes now it can happen but
you've really got to change what you're

Celsius overclocked out of the box you
guys can do more overclocking with it
depending on how good the cooling is
inside your system you guys all know
that the cooler the card the better the
boost is going to be the boost works off
the car being cool so car comes in at
the market though at 566 bucks it's a
bit pricey but hey you know it's a gtx
980 it's overclocked it's got those
three badass fans on it great for
building a custom system with that type
of color scheme I totally dig the
outside exoskeleton thing it's really
