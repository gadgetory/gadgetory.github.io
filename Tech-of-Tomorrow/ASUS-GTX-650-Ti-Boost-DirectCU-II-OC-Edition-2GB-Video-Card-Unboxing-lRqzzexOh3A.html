once again at eka tomorrow we bring you
all the tech all the time I'm Eric your
host and today what can I check the way
up in the table well today we have a
brand new card from the people over at
asu's this is their new 650 ti boost
that's right so their direct cu2 version
now last week you guys saw the reference
card came out we did a bunch of tests on
that and show you how it worked pretty
much for the price range of a hundred
six hundred and seventy nine dollars it
was a very very solid competitor for
that price range now today's card
features advanced cooling features a lot
of stuff that's geared towards a zhuzh
they have their own GPU tweak just all
kinds of stuff that is you know familiar
to their cards so with that said let's
jump in and let's check out the Box in
the card itself
alright folks so here we have at the box
a sous direct cu2 overclocked version
20% cool or vastly quieter the
overclocked edition two gigabytes of
gddr5 alloy super power GPU tweak the
nomenclature GeForce GTX 650 Ti boost I
am alright spin it around show you guys
the back of the box will zoom in here
directs you to 20% cooler three times
quieter this is the design of the card
then we see the super alloy power
enhanced durability and cooling this is
all the electronic components this
controls how well your car works
electronically keeping the card running
longer then last but not least GPU tweak
I use this all the time this helps you
increase all the voltages and stuff in
your card so you can do overclocking and
yes this card does allow you to tweak
the voltage so let's go ahead and pop
the cap
go ahead and take a sign off here
couldn't take them move The Box out of
there we go
set it off to the side we've got a box
another box so here you go now we're
into the black box open the cap right
there you guys can see right here on top
accessories package go ahead open that
up there dump that out there see what
the heck's in there all right so we've
got the molex to 6-pin power connector
rights right here molex to 6-pin then
next up we have the Aizu speed setup
guide all you need to know how to
install the card and do all that stuff
and I connect it most people know that
some well DVI to d-sub VGA connection

of the way that is all the accessories
now you've got some more foam and take
that out of the way
next up the card itself Tim Finchem 210
attention
the other side can see the package combs
completely sealed up so here we see all
packaging out go ahead and remove this
out of its anti-static bag cabone
alrighty then let's check this out
alright folks so here right in the front
we can see the direct cu2 got two fans
here now the direct see you to what it
does it has the copper connecting
directly to the GPU allowing all the
heat to be dissipated away from the card
first it goes into these fins then out
into the heat pipes then dissipate it
away by the fans blowing on them at the
bottom down here we see the pcie 3.0
interface and they turn the card to the
side you guys can see all the components
of capacitors to slot card you look put
around the backside flip it over once
again right here here we can see the six
pin power here we see the heat pipes
show you guys the back of the card here
is our single SLI connector right there
pop that back on there guys and see the
PCB is also completely made on a black
PCB a lot of people like that flip it
around the back the rear i/o go ahead
and pop the caps the top one is a single
link DVI the bottom is a dual link DVI
