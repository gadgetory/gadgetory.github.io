it's me Eric Faris to your host here in
the tech of tomorrow will you a tech of
tomorrow is bringing the tech of
tomorrow but today that's right today
we're going to bring you the full review
of one of the latest cards from AMD and
Sapphire this is the new HD
7750 ultimate silent Edition card so
check it out here's the box if you guys
miss the unboxing make sure to check
that out right here behind me on the
screen so today we're bringing you the
full review we'll be talking about the
card how fast it is the price its
heating all that good stuff so without
further ado let's jump right in and take
a look at this new card from sapphire
right off the bat you guys can see that
this card has a giant heat sink all the
way around the card there's absolutely
no moving parts this is a passively
cooled card meant to be totally silent
great for an HTPC or for a system that
you just want to have no noise in
whatsoever that said make sure that you
do have adequate airflow on the card
some of the basic feature of the card it
features 512 stream processors 16 ROPS
it has one gigabyte of gddr5 memory with
128 bit memory interface as far as the
core clock goes this one comes in
clocked at 800 megahertz it also has a
memory interface of eleven hundred and
twenty five megahertz so those are the
basic features of the card
there's no crossfire connection in this
card it's not meant to be using a
crossfire consideration at all it's just
a single card that you're going to be
wanting to use in your system if you
want like I said before absolute silence
taking a look at through our i/o we can
see there's a single DVI a single HDMI
and a single DisplayPort connection that
we have all the latest technology
supported and there's one of each of
these the PCI interface is based off the
new 3.0 design and that should show
significant improvement when Ivy Bridge
is released here very very soon like
with all of the AMD cards you're going
to get all the Eyefinity support this
card will also support the new 4k
monitors so basically all those features
DirectX 11 all those things are
incorporated into the card
now that we've showed you the card we've
showed you the features let's jump in
and let's take a look at the performance
of this card
okay so you guys have seen the card you
guys know what it's all about this is a
very entry level gaming card it's going
to come to the market about a hundred
and twenty dollars and it runs just
slightly slower than the 550 TI which is
priced actually about twenty dollars
more than it so it's priced right in a
kind of a narrow gap right there pretty
good card things I like about it the
card stayed cool throughout our entire
testing even during our testing the card
never got over sixty degrees Celsius now
the one thing you want to watch out for
though is the heat fin around the card
it does get very hot if you were to
touch with your hand you could possibly
burn yourself because you got to think
about this all of the heat from the GPU
is being sucked out by that giant
radiator and then dissipate it inside
your case so another thing to take note
there also is make sure you have plenty
of airflow in your case that way all
that hot air is being sent out and
keeping it away from the parts inside
your system as far as gaming goes this
card plays games okay it's just an
entry-level card it'll play battlefield
3 it will not play it on its ultimate
settings it'll play it on its meeting
settings and play it okay this thing is
mainly really geared there was an entry
level gaming card HTPC and to be utterly
totally silent now in those respects
this card is a total winner so at the
end of the day I have to say if you're
looking for a card that's under 150
bucks doesn't make any noise will still
play your games okay but is mainly just
chock-full of all the latest features
the 28 nanometer process and all that
stuff that comes in this latest AMD card
this could be a winner for you folks i'm
Elric here at echo tomorrow see you
folks later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
