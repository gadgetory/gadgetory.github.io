realm welcome to techyv tomorrow
for today's adventure raise that red and
black flag high into the sky because you
AMD fans this is something you're going
to want to check out now like I said
previous in their videos we're now
working with AMD we're gonna be doing a
lot to build with those folks and those
builds involve a lot of killer parts so
the first we'll be taking a look at
right now it's in the people over at XFX
now I know this video cards been out for
a little while but this thing is a
complete utter beast this is the r9
295x2 video karna this thing's the Hydra
Edition has 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
features power to 2.0 and it has to GPU
processors on board bringing you twice
the power hence the x2 now one thing
even more awesome about this things that
comes with its own water core that's
right you don't have to do anything this
thing comes liquid cooled out of the box
so for you enthusiasts out there you
want to have your card cool this thing's
pretty cool is I know a lot of people
out there already using these on water
coolers for their CPU well now if you
want to use your GPU you can just slap
this in you can share this space man
with that said though let's jump in
let's take a really closer look at the
Hydra edition of the XFX
r9 295x2 so if you folks out there who
have never actually seen this before
close up
check this out here's the box and it is
a doozy you guys can see it's no mungus
sticking this on a shelf space somewhere
like Best Buy and I don't know about
that cuz it's huge but here's the front
of the box I know you guys don't want to
get too crazy about it
here's the back of the box here is the
nomenclature which shows the model
number we all have pricing and
availability down below in the
description so now let's move forward
though and let's actually take this and
see what's inside the box so right here
we got a little flap on the side here
I'll go ahead and pop that pop the cap
the box goes down like this here and the
cap pops open then inside of here we got
all the stuff so wrap the bat we have
the driver CD install guy this is always
something that's made me question why
does somebody need to know how to
install a driver office CD like if you
don't know how to do that you really
should not be touching the computer I'm
sure you guys agree with that I think
that's kind of a
kind of a weird thing to include in the
box then we've got more Hardware limited
warranty some more warranty information
here
here's your warranty card make sure if
you have this card you send this in so
you can get your full warranty then
we've got the graphics driver CD I'll
use this probably just to initially set
it up but then I'll go and make sure I
go over the MD website and install the
very latest and most current driver
because it'll probably be newer than
this one so we'll set that down they
have a little thing about their adapters
in connector is not really important to
this whatsoever just some stuff that
you're getting from them now we have
screws and that's here
these things are obviously going to be
probably to take off the water core and
change it or do stuff like that also got
some additional cabling here we have
main DisplayPort to standard DisplayPort
we've got a DVI to HDMI and then we
start getting into the real deal which
is this giant size thing here which is
that bear with me folks I try to pull
this out of the box like I said this
whole thing is water-cooled so let's
start out let's pull the card out kaboom
and right here it says stop stop make
sure you install and connect the card
properly yes we realize that so check it
out water cooler single fan single rad
not bad right it was like it's nice 140
see the card right here beautiful
looking card very clean looking has a
red fan signifying once again the AMD
and like I said in the beginning of the
video the black and red flag because
that's the total colors for these guys
on the side we can see the Radeon
nomenclature right here seeing the cards
Radeon there are two stickers up here on
top I'm not gonna remove them right now
I guess I can go ahead and we'll just
pop these little stickers off and these
little stickers are where the power goes
now in this particular card bear with me
folks I try to do this I'm sorry to look
away from the camera like that don't
mean to be rude there are two full-blown
eight pin power connectors to this bad
boy so you got 150 watts reach one of
those
now as we translate over to the back of
the card you guys can see they have a
full-blown protector on the back of it
you guys can see one GPU here one GPU
there it's very cool
this makes sure the card won't get
damaged at all you can touch it we'll
make the card actually last longer want
to wear about that electrostatic shock
on the bottom we have the PCIe Express
3.0 interface a common thing all cards
have them got a little protective cover
on here go and just quickly remove that
just go ahead and stick it back on there
just to keep it protected kind of like
safe-sex it's a video card cutting them
I'm just kidding now in the back cards
pretty cool for main display ports and a
single DVI port now this thing's gonna
be able to pump out maximum I affinity
stuff so if you're somebody looking to
run multiple monitors looking to run 4k
well then damn it this is a card you're
gonna want to be seriously looking at
now obviously for AMD
this is their top-of-the-line bad-boy
and we're gonna be comparing it against
a lot of other things including and
videos
Titans heed to show all the comparison
difference between the two cards now
from what I'm hearing for most of my
readers out there they're saying that
they would pretty much probably take
this card over the other card any day of
the week due to the pricing now this
particular car because it's water-cooled
is totally top of line this car comes to
market at about $1400 it's a little bit
pricey but if you're looking at a Titan
Z you're looking at a card that's almost
$4,000 so big savings here between this
and that
less than half even so that's pretty
amazing stuff we're gonna be taking this
card we're gonna be putting actually two
of these into the new x99 platform
usually every bill we do we do a lot of
them we always use in video cards this
time we're gonna do something a little
bit different and we're gonna put a pair
of these bad boys on the x99 platform
and bring a system like that to the
table as well so I'm Eric thanks for
watching ticker tomorrow like I said
before all of this information will be
down in the description pricing
availability all that stuff so if you're
looking to buy on these for yourself or
just want to check out more information
you guys can see that so thanks for
watching techie tomorrow and last but
not least if you're not subbed and you
like what you see then Hank hit that sub
button cuz we've always got exciting
stuff going on for you guys our fans
love you see you guys background Tecmo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
