mainboard by mod right calm well cry
keys made it's at TECA tomorrow's at the
got-dang blanking nature channel no I'm
just kidding
anyways folks check it out another under
unboxing that's right today we're
bringing you the msi empower Maxx
motherboard that's where I got this baby
right here it's based off the za7
platform for all the new Haswell CPUs
that were coming out high 5zi sevens all
those bad boys so with that said let's
jump in and let's check out what comes
in the box and what this new boards all
about from MSI alright folks so here we
have it the motherboard of the M power
max from MSI supporting the new fourth
generation Intel Core processors
obviously the z87 chipset we had a
little tab right here flips it up where
you guys can see in the box and see
those color schemes in there the nice
buzzing be black and yellow which I've
actually gotta be buzzing my my damn
head right now which will go away I'll
close it up real quick bring it over the
side as I try to swoop to be away from
my head you can see it's OC certified
the za7 empower max there's a serial
number and all that stuff right there
flip it around real quick show you guys
the back of the box once again we see
the OC certified more the nomenclature
military class burnin test passed higher
performance enhanced pwm cooling better
power stability some of their features
and stuff their command center their OC
Genie for their audio boost the killer e
20 200 Nick which is onboard Sound
Blaster cinema and the virtue what is
that MVP so they got the virtue MVP 2
point is for using your graphics cards
in combination with your CPU so with
that said check it out down here below
me
we got the mod mat for your mainboard
and those things really bitching for
doing unboxings too because check it out
you get to ground yourself out so get
the camera to swing over here you guys
can see this because we're mixing this
all in one here today so check it out
and the mod met right here you can
ground yourself out it easily pops off
two of these come inside the box so with
that said you guys can see all this here
let's go ahead and begin the unboxing
alright folks are pop the cap right here
pop it
up a couple flaps right here just go
ahead and just take everything nice and
simply set it out here you guys can see
we got the motherboard in one box
Vincent uh and then we have all the
accessory features right here so let's
first talk about the accessory features
so we're gonna pop the cap and there's a
lot of stuff in here right on the top
we've got a bunch of easy connections
right here there's either connecting all
your wires your motherboard they're all
easily labeled so you can see them and
connect things up get that out of the
way next up we see the MSI quick
installation guide a giant book telling
you how to install your motherboard in
case you don't know how then you get a
high performance OC power msi intel 8
series platform overclocking guide
telling you how to do some of your
overclocking with the msi OC functions
they have their direct OC button their
digit all power this actually provides
more power to your system when needed
for overclocking so this is actually
pretty interesting stuff right here
gives you an introduction to bios
overclocking and everything else so this
actually is a pretty useful tool for
those people who have never done
anything before whatsoever
good idea msi now here we go all the
other stuff and gam there's a lot of it
right off the bat we get the gaming g
series MSI logo now this is kind of a
trippy because I didn't know this was
one of the gaming series motherboards I
thought this was like they're you know
high-end motherboard but hey it's for
gaming as well and you get that badge
here we go some wires right here these
are connecting up one of your digital
power meters so these things that
connect directly to your board you look
at that thing you can see all of your
voltage and all that stuff right through
these through your meter then we have
one we got here one A two A three what's
a year one two three let's this is that
all we got right there I'll keep going
through here's to make sure but okay so
we have three of the new SATA 6 cables
right here
we have a breakout box right here the
breakout box provides power through
molex eSATA so you got dual eSATA and
one molex power connector right to this
breakout box and here are the
connections for that you actually get
the cables and all that for that and an
additional cable right here for SATA get
the other way I'm going on a rampage
here here we have an SLI bridge next up
now this is pretty interesting
this is your antenna cable VSO
electronics company provides this thing
this is your antenna cable for your
wireless LAN and go ahead and take this
out here so you guys can check that out
so here's all that you get two antennas
for dual connectivity gives you a lot
more area for picking up bandwidth keep
going down here USB 3.0 breakout box
again or bracket rear i/o here we have
the MSI Wi-Fi BT this is their Intel
WiDi now this is pretty interesting the
WiDi technology um in the future there
might be a lot more interfaces like this
but what this does right now this is
wireless display and so if you can find
some product out there that could use it
you can actually show the display
through this wireless display I think if
monitors and TVs and more products
actually had that connectivity it would
be an awesome product for now just a
really cool idea also right here folks
here are instructions on how to cook up
your antenna cable and all that your
installation guide on a little piece of
paper we have the drivers and utilities
CD then a no limits overclocking
motherboard driver and CD it's actually
a DVD set it on there
then we get a little nice anti-static
bag that nothing's in just there for
extra protection a out buying ln2
Shannon Rob his issue is this this you
mystery you're out buying Allen - you're
not around buddy alright busy breaking
World Records so they have some cool
stuff on this now as we're getting down
to the bottom of the box I understand
there's a lot of stuff here folks we get
a certificate of quality and stability
now if only girlfriend's came with these
would that be awesome now be honest with
me
does the bits come with the quality and
stability warranty coz if not I don't
want to I'm just kidding I'll move on
past that and then we've got the z87
empower max overclocking motherboards
guide step it off to the side and last
but not least just a more nomenclature
on stuff so that's all that stuff folks
you guys see there just comes with a
shit ton of accessories so let's move on
let's start checking out my damn board
alright folks so now we have the
motherboard out of the box and I have to
say this thing looks pretty damn killer
now the camera keep stroking over and
over again it's like bumblebee but you
know what I don't really think it's that
bright as bumblebee it's semi bumblebee
but these color schemes are almost kind
of gold tone they're not totally gold
tone but they're you know semi gold tone
now we're gonna start the very top of
the board we're gonna see that we have
two eight pin power connectors up there
that's you get lots of power to the
board for overclocking and all kinds of
other stuff we want to work our way
around we're gonna see the first of our
fans all these fans can be controlled
through the BIOS as well now let's take
a look right here around the ZIF socket
area this is the LGA 1150 for the new
fourth generation obviously has weld
chips you guys can see all the MOSFETs
are covered all the way around
underneath you can see all of the
quality chokes and all the components
being used these are very very expensive
high-end components you can tell just by
the way they look now we're gonna spin
around and go to the side of the board
we see we have four dimm slots for our
memory this motherboard can support up
to 32 gigabytes of ddr3 memory as we
flip around the side of the board more
we're going to see that we have a bunch
of little ports right here these are for
connecting up a meter for measuring out
all
power on your boards those little wires
that I showed you guys we did the
unboxing they hook up into this area
right here then endear meter and that
way you guys can be able to check all
that stuff out now as we keep going
around the side of the motherboard we're
gonna see the 24 pin power connector
right there and then here we're gonna
see two USB 3.0 external headers there's
actually two of those in this board then
we'll bring our way down and here we see
all the SATA connectivity there are two
types of connections
there's the Intel and the as media all
these ones right here two four six are
all Intel these ins right here are as
media now it also says that when you use
the v controller that the onboard M SATA
which we'll show you in a second
actually gets disabled so let's keep
moving around we're gonna go down to the
bottom of the board here now here we
have something very interesting we're
gonna see right below the little cooling
thing right here to bios's you can see
them right here they're very small but
underneath that we have the bios switch
so you can change between this and
switch with bios you want to use so if
one of them gets fried an overclock you
can switch the other ones so it
automatically post up also next to that
we see the post light LEDs if you're
having a problem with your boot or
anything it'll tell you in a number what
is wrong with your system so that you'll
be able to go in look at it and figure
it out and move on down below that we
have the fast B one button this little
button right here allows you to click
and go directly into your BIOS upon
restart so you click this button and
when you do the restart it automatically
goes into your BIOS so now as you move
along the bottom of the board we can see
there's more USB connectivity we see a
couple more system fan connections down
here as well then right here we see the
BIOS reset switch it's not actually the
type of BIOS through so much like normal
you have to actually put a jumper on
here and you put the jumper on here
it'll actually disengage or reset the
BIOS then I'm just going to bounce over
here to the real far side over here when
we see the front panel audio and then we
see the OC switch now this allows you to
go between gear 1 and gear 2 for
overclocking then right next to that we
see the OC G button you hit that button
it does automatic overclocking on your
board and tells you pretty much how far
to go within their standards
next that we have the power button the
reset button and then these two switches
right here which have positive and
negative these two things allow you to
go on to the motherboard and when you're
using on board testing and overclocking
like we have ln2 and stuff you can
control the board directly through here
so pretty interesting stuff for the
overclocker now we're gonna continue
moving around we'll see right here they
have the audio boost right here this is
part of the stuff that has to do with
the creative sound now the creative
sound on here isn't actually pure it's
actually a real tech alc 1150 audio chip
so using that audio chip you're not
actually using a creative audio chip the
creative stuff comes all via software
implementation now let's actually take a
look at the expansion and the PCI and
the M SATA port so right here at the top
we have one two three four of your PCI
Express 1x slots and then we have one
two three PCI Express multi slots now
this board will allow either three cards
in triple crossfire or two cards in SLI
but you can also use that Virtua 2.0 to
use a mixture of cards and the CPU to
get better performance that's a whole
nother video in itself those folks and
then right here on the board we see the
M SATA power port and like I said before
it says when you use this it
automatically disables SATA 5 you can
also tell down here by the audio that
all the components are very high-quality
and last but not least folks let's turn
around and let's take a look at the rear
i/o and the rear i/o in this board
features legacy ps2 keyboard mouse also
have two USB 2.0 ports the clear CMOS
switch so if this thing's inside of your
case you can click this little button
right here it automatically clears the
CMOS for you then over here we have two
USB 3.0 ports another two USB ports up
above that we have that killer nic plan
that we were talking about before
display port HDMI digital audio another
HDMI port so this board actually has two
HDMI ports and a display port but no DVI
then we have two more USB 3.0 ports and
then we have all of the gold-plated
7.1 analog audio our folks so there you
have it the brand-new M power max
motherboard that's right this is the z87
model to the people over at MSI lots and
lots of great components in this
motherboard lots and lots of great
content I try to bring you as much
information the unboxing as possible
before in the old days we just bring out
of the box but we try to cover all the
components and all that stuff now you
see grounded out a lot of you folks
complain about that in the past but hey
this new mod mat from the people over at
mod right is actually pretty cool I'm
gonna be using this thing in all my
videos for now long cuz it's actually
quite nice and doesn't do something
pretty cool so anyways we hope you guys
liked this video
if so you guys know what to do - I have
to ask you again come on it's great for
interactivity always leave your comments
down below tell me what you guys think
I'm gonna build me a badass system on
this I just think it's really cool not
bumblebee either but it's gonna be kind
of cool I'm actually thinking because
the color scheme is gonna sound weird
but I'm thinking like maybe like Knights
the roundtable or King Arthur type build
I know that sounds kind of weird but he
gives me that medieval type feeling so
that's it folks
I'm Elric thanks for watching tech go
tomorrow peace that if you're not
subscribed you want to see more than hey
you know what to do hit that sub button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
