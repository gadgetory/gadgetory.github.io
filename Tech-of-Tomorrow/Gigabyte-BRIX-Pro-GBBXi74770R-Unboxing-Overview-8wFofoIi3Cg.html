welcome back once again to TECA tomorrow
bringing you all the tech all the time
and today we got something really cool
for the people over at gigabyte and it's
something very very small so and some
people say you know good things come in
small packages well in this particular
instance that is very true now you guys
may have heard about the bricks things
from good white these things have been
out for a little while they're like
little tiny little computers that are
basically based off the nut that's right
so I don't know if you guys know but
that's the next unit of computing its
Intel's latest greatest thing they've
been promoting it for quite a while now
these guys have taken it a step further
so basically this thing is like a nook
on steroids and this is the Brix Pro now
this thing can be up to about $700 but
it features a lot of cool stuff it's got
its own i7 processor in it that's right
and it really does kick some serious
butt is being a little small little unit
so before I do the unboxing let's first
jump in real quick and let's go over the
specs and just take a quick look
the dimensions are 62 by 11.4 by 114
point four millimeters or 2.4 by 4.3 by
4.5 inches the motherboard itself is a
hundred by a hundred and five
millimeters it features the fourth
generation Intel i7 4770k Hertz CPU for
memory support there are two sword em
slots supporting ddr3l 1333 or 1600
megahertz with a maximum of 16 gigabytes
the unit features a gigabyte lan
provided by the realtek RTL 8 1 1 G the
audio is the realtek ALC 2 6 9 graphics
are provided by the Intel iris pro
graphics 5200 HDMI resolution is as
follows 4096 by 2300 for 24 Hertz the
main display resolution is 3840 by 2160
at 60 Hertz as far as expansion slots
there's 1m SATA slot 1/2 sized mini PCI
slot which is occupied by the Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth card
and once a the slot the front i/o offers
two USB 3.0 and one headphone jack with
s/pdif through i/o features one HDMI
wanted me to display port two USB 3.0
one rj45 jack one DC N and one
Kensington lock slot as far as the power
goes uses an output of DC at 19 volts
it's also basic compatible and the
bracket is included support 75 by 75 and
100 by 100 millimeter setups alright
folks so those are all the specs now
let's actually take a look at the unit
first we'll look at the box you guys can
see it's a gigabyte professional
performance bricks pro ultra compact PC
obviously it's got Intel inside of it
what else what I have right spin around
the back which you get you can see some
more nomenclature by just talking about
some of the specs that we already went
over here back here is a little tag
right here the camera can zoom and get a
close by that because if you guys are
looking to buy this this is something
you want to make tight take a look at
know if you can scan your camera through
through the screen there that'd be
pretty cool that with it
get your little Boop and scan it there
you go so let's pop pull the unit out of
here I don't think I need a knife or
anything on this one nope I don't it
slides
nice and easy out of there no friction
little black box
it's a Pandora's box and I'm gonna open
her up hopefully Pandora's in a good
mood right alright there we go there you
go nice little box it's coming to get
you get you get you uh alright moving
forward alright inside we see there's an
upside-down thing there but nope this is
your version of Windows Microsoft
Microsoft Corporation Windows pro 8.1
x64
in English so that's pretty cool that I
came included in there and thank you
very much folks pop that off to the side
let's go ahead and start pulling stuff
out of the box one little unit of time
like is doesn't want to come out like
that so I'll just turn the box or make
it nice and simple for myself oh and
then we do gonna have some accessories
and stuff falling out but what the heck
right alright
slip it off but I daddy did I do a lot
of
yeah yeah all right yeah yeah so here we
go power stuff every little things of
power so here is the power source for
the Brooks Pro talked about in the
description it'll plug into your unit
right there so they're actually very
small and ripe brick comes from the SPS
group or FSP group rather excuse me I'm
getting dyslexic there and you're just
the power cable whoa
which I happen to drop like a like a
silly guy on the floor so here we go
but a bing bada boom the other being yet
a moon yeah
all right set that off the side there is
the power part where there next up we
have different various parts for
obviously adding the drives and all the
different parts to it this one right
here says it's a rubber seal included in
package for headphone use so this is
something for your headphones kind of
interesting screws right here obviously
for doing one of the drives and then
more screws right here these look like
the ones for your SSD so we can get
those out of the way a metal plate this
way up
obviously for mounting your drives and
everything on set that off then we have
the gigabyte the brics pro ultra compact
PC kit this is the Quick Start Guide
probably gonna tell you how to do
everything inside of it how to put it
together and all that stuff how to take
it apart I may have to read it I don't
know if I will have to hopefully I won't
have to it says I'm gonna need a
screwdriver so if I plan on taking it
apart I will have to get a screwdriver
but basically gives you all the
instructions and everything shows you
how to install the memory and all that
stuff but this thing is gonna be very
very simple I mean sodium just pops in
like a laptop and this thing is it's
essentially you know a really super
duper laptop in a box without a screen
so let's keep going let's get to the
unit itself and here we go never
very very very
very small yeah a little package here
there we go all right then cool though
right in the front we see we got the
first of the USB 3.0 here's your spit if
out right here headphone jack
whichever you need it's right there in
the front you can see a little vent here
for putting out some of the heat the
vent continues along over on this side
as well as here it has that new product
smell here in the back we have the HDMI
main display port the LAN 2 more USB 3.0
the power and obviously the Kensington
lock here's the bottom the unit which
says this way is that the gigabyte model
number the serial number for the unit
and all that stuff alright now here on
the top I'm just gonna remove this real
quick here and here we can see the power
button and it does look very elegant you
guys can see it's very small very shiny
it's powerful enough to do quite a bit
of things alright everybody so that's
pretty much it and this thing is the
Brix Pro you guys can see it's small its
elegant it's gonna be one of those
things that you wouldn't almost even
notice and since it has such a high
powerful processor it can do quite a bit
now the onboard video obviously HD 5200
you're not gonna be able to play like
here you know killer 3d you know first
person shooters third highest
resolutions but a lot of the games out
there such as you these guys talk about
steam boxes and all those types of
things this will handle that pretty well
especially viewers playing those third
person games a lot of those games will
be able to be a played on this without a
problem or a hitch obviously get a
greater video card power you can do more
but man come on let's be realistic here
this thing's super duper small it's
smaller than my hand completely smaller
than my hand completely works powerful
it's under $700 by the way if you're
looking to purchase one of these we'll
have links down below in the description
down below like button there's a lot of
different eatos you can pick one of
these bad boys up for yourself now all
you have to do like I said before is add
two things here to basically add your
hard drive and you have to add your
memory now next week I'm gonna bring you
guys another video because I have
another another
I have another nook in the living room
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna build
both the nuts at the same time and show
you guys that video I probably won't do
it with the go cam I'll probably have
the cameraman just film it straight on
because Anthony is the go cam man but
till we bring that to you so that's
pretty much it folks you guys have more
interest in this make sure you guys look
down there in the description and check
out all that stuff
