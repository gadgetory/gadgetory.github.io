welcome back once against a challenge I
know all the Apple fanatics out there
are going crazy about the release of the
brand-new iPhone 7 the iPhone 7 plus but
when I got mine in my hand and
everything I checked it out and you guys
saw this video I was thinking about
switching as I was playing around
fitting using and I kind of noticed that
wow there are really five things about
this phone that just plainly suck and
are something definitely think about
before ever buying a new iPhone 7 so
right now let's check out the top 5
reasons why you shouldn't upgrade to an
iPhone 7 reason number one to consider
not buying an iPhone 7 is this there's
absolutely no headphone jack and the
audio on it even though it's stereo is
definitely subpar to any of the other
phones that I've seen out there that
features stereo sound now Apple just
introduced stereo sound with the iPhone
7 but it's completely lacking in any
kind of real quality in fact if you were
in a gym or anything and you're trying
to listen to it or just listen to it
your room or anything it has a much much
tinnier sound than anything else out
there and it's not really booming in any
way at all
and even though the iPhone 7 does come
with a thunderbolt adapter Jack that you
can use your old headphones with what if
you lose this at that point you're
screwed you have to buy another adapter
and if you don't happen to have an
adapter with you and just happen up some
old headphones you're not going to be
able to use them whatsoever so the
bottom line is this if you have a
standard jack set of headphones that you
really love if you lose the adapter you
are Sol you can always buy another one
that's gonna cost you more money from
the people over at Apple and like I said
since Apple introduced arrow sound on
the iPhone 7 for the first time I was
really expecting much better sound
quality and I just got to say I was
disappointed reason number two the
iPhone 7 has absolutely no wireless
charging capabilities now that's just
really strange all these features that
are talked about on the release day but
you can't use a wireless charger with
the iPhone 7 I mean what is up with that
that's just crazy in my opinion every
phone out there this state in the game
should be able to do wireless charging
why Apple left that off of the iPhone 7
phones I have no idea whatsoever but
honestly it's another caveat that I just
don't like okay now reason number three
let's talk about the screen on the
iPhone 7 no 1440 no 1080p 750 what
that's right this screen has a 1334 by
750 resolution only has 326 pixels per
inch on the v20 the screen on that is
much superior larger screen size 2560 by
1440 resolution and 513 pixels per inch
that's almost twice as much as that so
it totally counts as the screen on the
Apple when you're watching movies and
you're doing stuff like that
you want the most pixels per inch
because that's going to give you the
most dense and most awesome realistic
picture that you can get once again the
iPhone 7
fail reason number four just like all
its brethren once again we see no
expandable storage and even though
they've raised up the amount of stuff
you can get a 128 at 256
you can get all these larger things with
storage on them but if you watch a lot
of movies you store a lot of movies I'd
like to have a lot of information on
your phone and use your phone as like
your main business thing and you need
that the lack of expendable storage
really sucks ass I know a lot of the PC
fans out there they're gonna look at
that they're gonna go what and the frack
is going on with that so as you guys see
number 4 is actually to me a very big
thing no expandable storage whatsoever
means that as soon as you run a
information on there you got to transfer
it off or do something if you're at a
Disneyland or something like that and
you're taking pictures of your family or
taking movies what are you going to do
if you're in the middle of nowhere pull
a laptop out of your ass and transfer it
it's just not happening so the lack of
expandable storage for me especially in
a world that's so media driven it's a
serious once again fail drum roll please
and reason number 5 there's absolutely
no quick charging with the Apple iPhone
7 once again this is just really crazy
everybody knows that we're on the go we
use our cell phones more than anything
else in fact that market the mold market
is the biggest growing market in the
entire frackin world yet they're going
to sit there and make you scratch your
ass and scratch your head for longer
times waiting for your phone to charge
and I just think that's really really
crazy so number five like I said you're
going to just sit around and wait when
quick-charge you should be available
it's available in almost all the other
phones up from the market Apple what are
you thinking anyways I know if you guys
been watching teka tomorrow like you too
want to hear you guys's comments down
below but for me these five things make
me really back off and make me change my
mind about upgrading to the new iPhone 7
so we'll see you guys back in the
channel I've got lots of more stuff
coming we've got speed tests
lots of comparison stuff in fact a lot
of the stuff this week is going to be on
phone so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
