again detective tomorrow now if you're
like me you're always trying to get the
absolute best bang for your buck which
means you want a high-value product but
you don't want to pay a lot of money for
it and it's definitely something if you
want to buy it you want to be able to
look at it not go okay I just sacrifice
that now if we were like Mario we could
just get our coins off a little blinky
thing and we'd have cash all day long
but unfortunately we all have to work
for our cash now we're gonna be doing
today is we're gonna give you guys the
first looks and talk about the carbide
Series 275 our case for the people over
at Corsair now this is a mid tower case
that has a lot of nice features for the
price range first of all it does look
very nice in the particular model that
we got this is an arctic white and you
guys can see right off the bat that
there's a nice tempered glass side
window so that when you put your build
inside of it you're gonna be able to see
that build which I think anybody out
there who's building their own custom PC
wants to see the build they're doing
that's just kind of the whole thing with
building your own PC otherwise that all
just come in a paper brown sack right
take a look at the front of the case you
guys can see that there's not a totally
clear air passageway however there are
vents all the way around the front so
the air can be brought in now there are
a lot of options in the front with this
case you can put up to a three hundred
sixty millimeter rad right in the front
320 millimeter fans or a 240 millimeter
rad all in the front so you get a lot of
options there in fact you can put a
total of six hundred and twenty
millimeter fans in this case on the top
you can stick another two or you can put
a 240 millimeter rad and then in the
back there's also another place for a
fan now the case when you buy it right
out the market does come with two fans
one in the front and one in the rear but
you can add more as you see fit on the
front there's also removable dust
filters so it starts to get a little bit
dusty you can take that out clean it and
keep the inside of your case nice and
clean all the controls for the 275 are
are located conveniently on the top of
the front of the case now there are two
USB 3.0 ports your audio ports your on
switch and your restart button on the
top of the case you guys will see it
there's a removable dust filter I like
these things they're pretty flexible you
can also watch them making sure you keep
your system clean there's
plenty of airflow room here so whether
you're gonna put in a rat you're gonna
put in your fans either way you'll have
nice airflow coming through and this
will be nice as well now the back of the
case it just has a simple metal cover
just like most cases do and on the back
you guys can see that there's room for
your eye on the top you have your seven
expansion slots and at the very bottom
is where your power supply goes now you
can have up to a hundred and eighty
millimeter power supply go inside of
here so even a full length power supply
should you just find one thing you guys
want to take note of because this is
something becoming very popular and even
though people do say that the video
cards are kind of up against the glass
it's very nice to have the option to be
able to vertically mount your video card
in your system actually I think it's
pretty badass now for those of you
wondering what the size of the actual
case is it's 460 millimeters by 211
millimeters by 455 millimeters also the
maximum GPU length which is how long
your video card can be inside the system
is 370 millimeters the 275 are also
features a maximum CPU cooler height of
a hundred and seventy millimeters now
this is the distance between your CPU
cooler and the glass window
okay so we've taken off the glass panel
on the side and you guys can see that
internally the 275 R is very very clean
you can see on the front panel how you
could add more fans to it there's also
that removable filter that I told you
about and like I said before you can fit
a really nice 360 millimeter radiator in
the front if you want so that's kind of
really cool you can also see right to
the left of that there are two grommets
this helps with cable management and
then down below on top of the power
supply shroud you can see there's an
additional grommet for even more cable
management after removing the back panel
you guys can see that there's plenty of
room back here for cable management you
can totally get your hands in the back
in here and there's plenty of room to
work and get those cables going now
there's actually in the manual it says
that there is room for three 2.5 slots
and two of the three point five slots
now you guys can see down the bottom
there are two removable bays these are
for your 3.5 drives but as far as a 2.5
drives there are actually two spaces
that you guys can see with those little
black holders but also to the very left
of the motherboard there are actually
two more
places where you can hard mount 2.5
Drive so in reality you can actually
mount for 2.5 drives inside this system
and on the bottom of the case there are
four little feet for keeping your case
up and balanced now one other thing that
does come with the case it's not a whole
lot as far as accessories go but they do
give this little box and this box is
located inside the 3.5 drive bays and
it's all the little holes all over it
they fit it and they're kind of like a
hard drive but you do get a lot of
different stuff however for doing your
cable management so you actually get
screws for mounting the different drives
and their like we talked about and you
get a few things for cable management
although trust me you'll probably need
more than this and if you're planning on
doing a really good build some simple
things you probably really should have
around are a bunch of different size
cable ties because it just makes it so
much easier to make it clean our next
step is to actually do the build inside
of the system and a special thanks out
to Gary key from the people over at
asu's he kicked me down a nice
motherboard and video card for this
build so we'll be puttin those parts in
there and also Coursera's give me a few
other parts to help with the build as
well so the next step will be doing the
build now the only caveat that I can see
that anybody's going to really have
about this particular case at this price
is that yes in the front it's not
completely clear the airflow but when
you've got those fans bringing air in
those holes that are on the side the the
vents excuse me the vents they're gonna
allow the air to be pulled into the case
pretty freely now I know that you know
having a completely open is probably the
most optimal if you want to you know be
a plus plus plus but still I'd say this
design is pretty much a minus one thing
I personally like in a case is that it
feels sturdy you know it doesn't feel
flimsy at all moves around your hands
now this case is made of steel and
obviously the tempered glass front panel
but all in all it's a very very well
made product I feel that for 80 dollars
even from just looking at it without
doing the build in it I think it's
definitely going to be one of those
editors choice products it's just really
nice I really like the fact that you can
vertically mount a video card yes I know
it's slightly up against the glass but
when is bring in the air and that air
still coming into it that's like it's in
a suffocating room with a plug hole and
that it was that I would say that's
terrible but just being kind of you know
with about 3/4 of an inch
the glass you're still gonna be bringing
a lot of air into that card it's not
like the end of the world it's honestly
not as bad as you think the temps are
probably gonna be a little wee bit
higher maybe than being your placement
just because the way the air flow goes
through but let's just face it a
vertical mounted video card just looks
totally like I said before it looks
kick-ass and and I want this system we
build it to be totally clean and totally
kick-ass so that will be our next video
the build in the 275 are all right folks
so like every video down below like
button love all the information on this
case if you guys want to check one out
buy one or just look up more information
although I think I've covered pretty
much everything there was to cover with
this Hey the information will be there
