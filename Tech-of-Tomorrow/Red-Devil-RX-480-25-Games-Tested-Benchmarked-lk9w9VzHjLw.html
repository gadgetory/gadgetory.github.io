for it I've read your comments over and
over again where are the scores for the
Red Devil rx 40 okay well the thing is
the bios that we had originally the card
was not running well I would have just
heard all your hate tell me there's no
way that card scores like that the order
working for AMD so I said hey no we got
a new bios and so now we've got the card
all nice and running beautiful and you
guys will like the numbers that you see
so today we're gonna show you 25 games
tested on the Red Devil rx 480 and
you'll see why we waited because there's
a big I mean a huge significant
difference in how they were so with that
said let's first jump in and let's take
a real quick look at the carb those of
you guys who missed the last day do you
guys can see the Red Devil rx 40 is a
beast of a card it features three fans
on the front and on the rear there's an
amazing backplate featuring a which
catch your design but if you guys want
the full specs check out the link we
left down below but with that said now
let's jump in real quick let's check out
the test system the test system features
an i7 6700 K we keep it at turbo mode
4.4 gigahertz we also have an asrock
motherboard and we also feature 16
gigabytes of G skills rip JA memory the
driver on the AMD side is a sixteen
point eight point two which is the
latest that's available and with that
said let's rock out to the benchmark and
let's actually see how this car did in
25 games
you guys can see that using the old BIOS
we had a core clock speed of twelve
hundred and seventy nine megahertz and
we saw a temperature of 72 degrees
Celsius using the new bios we saw a core
clock speed jump up to thirteen hundred
and thirty megahertz but the temps also
jumped up a little bit up to 76 Celsius
okay so you guys can see with the new
bios and the new drivers the 480 is
getting faster and faster and faster I
will say it flat-out we're not testing
with the Vulcan API yet and yes doom is
faster on the 480 than it is on the 1060
in the Vulcan API will say that clearly
straight at it just right now takes so
damn long missed half an hour just to
doing the testing that are involving two
hours just for one game it's a whole
hell of a lot of testing and I hear that
there's a new patch coming out well
you'll be able to actually do a lot
easier testing using the Vulcan API when
we get there we'll bring that to the
table but I just want to say that fly
off the bat that yes
using the Vulcan API in Doom the AMDR X
480
does beat the 1060 that's a fact that's
just how it is
so moving on though as you can see as
far as the temps go it went from 72
Celsius up to 76 Celsius but you get
much better performance at thirteen
hundred and thirty megahertz then you
did on the previous so all in all I got
to say you guys can see this card is a
kickass card it comes into market at a
really nice price around two hundred and
forty dollars so we don't want to break
the bank and you want something's gonna
totally kick ass and a lot of you guys
saying a future-proof then Hank you guys
can see the Red Devil rx forty from
power color is a serious winner of a
card
I'm Ehlert you guys been watching techni
tomorrow down below that like button
which hopefully you'll go Bruce Lee
style on you guys can see all the
information and purchase one for
yourself hopefully there'll be some
available at the moment that's it we'll
see you guys back in the channel for
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
