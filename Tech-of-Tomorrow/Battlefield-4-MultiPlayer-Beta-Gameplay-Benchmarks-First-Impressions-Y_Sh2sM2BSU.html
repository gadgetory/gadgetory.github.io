tomorrow now for those of you that are
unaware one of the biggest things to
come out today was the battlefield 4
beta now right now it is an exclusive
beta only available to people that
purchased either battlefield 3 premium
or medal of honor warfighter or if you
didn't buy either of those you can also
get in by pre-ordering the digital
deluxe edition of the game now those you
that just aren't really do any of those
yet it will go into full open beta for
everyone starting on the 4th running
through the 15th so I grabbed it this
morning and jumped on to play a couple
of games try out some of the new
features and radical benchmarks so let's
go ahead and take a quick look at one of
the most anticipated games of 2013
so in the beta you play on the Shanghai
map and you can play it in either
domination or conquest mode which are
basically the same game mode in concept
is just that domination is a small-scale
one with three points and smaller teams
whereas conquest is the full scale map
with 64 players at once now the main
focus of this beta is to really show off
this particular map and how it's meant
to encapsulate a field for there's good
mix of needing land air and sea vehicles
all of which are useful and the level
prominently features what DICE has been
calling l'évolution the idea that maps
change as the battle progresses well
there's lots of little examples of the
throughout the map the big key one that
really shows it off is the skyscraper in
the middle of the stage that if you
shoot the supports for it brings the
whole thing crashing down totally
changing the landscape of the area as
well as the tactics needed to capture it
now that aside the core dynamic is still
very much the same as battlefield 3 i'll
be at the gameplay is even prettier and
numerous little tweaks have been made so
while running the game on our system
which has an msi gtx 780 as well as an
i7 4770k processor overclocked to 4
gigahertz we tested the beta on medium
high and ultra settings which we
benchmarked at 88-81 and 73 frames per
second respectively now of course this
is based on the beta of the game which
is not properly indicative what the full
title will be like once it's released a
lot of this content has not been
properly optimized and there's plenty of
odd little bugs and glitches so of
course we will run these tests again
once the actual game is released now for
those same reasons I don't want to go
too in depth on the gameplay because as
I said it's a beta which means you're
never quite sure what balances and such
are going to make it to launch but what
I will talk about is just my experience
so far that has been pretty damn awesome
while I am more of a fan of the rush
mode which bf3 used its beta conquest
does create a fun sort of shoved back
and forth match especially with the
focus on l'évolution at the start of
matches you'll see a lot of people
relying in helicopter drops and big in
air battles to try and get supremacy
over the central tower and it's easy to
hold it first since it's so high up and
you can hold off enemy assaults pretty
easy but then it gets really crazy if
you don't have people protecting the
base and whole thing collapses in levels
the area turning it into an uneven
terrain one new neat little feature that
i noticed that i really liked to is that
when you choose where to redeploy when
selecting teammates you actually get a
little camera
you what's going on directly around them
giving you a better idea of what kind of
situation you're getting yourself into
so you can act right away after spawning
so this is just a quick little recap of
what we've gotten to see so far in the
beta those of you that can't wait to try
it out for yourselves as I said earlier
you can get in on the action today by
pre-ordering the digital deluxe edition
of the game if you don't already qualify
or you can wait until October fourth for
it to go full open beta and get a taste
of what the game will be like when it
finally launches on the twenty-fifth of
this month and for those of you that
have already been playing the beta
please make sure to let us know in the
comments what you think so far based on
your experience is what changes do you
like not like what things do you hope
they fix or just your thoughts and
feelings on the Shanghai map itself and
what I might mean for the game in its
hole once finally released now while
you're commenting down there please go
ahead and make sure to smash that like
