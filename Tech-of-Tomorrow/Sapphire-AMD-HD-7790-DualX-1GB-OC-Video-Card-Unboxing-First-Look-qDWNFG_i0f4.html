evening time here at Tech of tomorrow
and why are we coming to you in the
evening instead of a normal time well
for one thing it's launch time that's
right AMD has their latest weapon in
their arsenal for the mid-level gaming
market what is this
well this is their latest solution it's
called the Radeon HD 77 90 now this card
has 800 nice extreme processors 40
texture units 16 ROPS one gigabyte of
gddr5 memory with a 128-bit memory
interface with 6 gigabits per second
total memory effective bandwidth so all
in all it's a pretty good card now the
only thing it may affect this car at all
may be the one gigabyte of memory
because you guys know when you start
increasing all the features and stuff
like that it has sometimes some you know
negative stuff on it but since it's late
tonight we're just gonna bring you first
the unboxing so you guys can see it back
behind me this is the sapphire version
this is their dual X Edition this card's
gonna be coming to market at about a
hundred and $59 it's pretty interesting
and I think you guys are actually going
to like this car so with that said let's
jump in let's just take a quick spin the
box I know you guys don't like it if I
pause too much between things trying to
work on that and I also does you guys
make a lot of notices about my hand just
as I apologize for that I have really
advanced age diabetes and sometimes I
shake really bad so I'm trying to do my
best to slow that down and not pause too
much but it's hard for me just keep
talking it you know fast paced the whole
entire time I'm doing this so all right
now let's jump over the table and let's
actually delve into the box alright
folks so here we have a close-up of the
box some of the most interesting things
are the woman's breasteses they are
quite the proper size there even though
the virtual we got the overclocked thing
here dual X cooling that's all-important
Radeon 28 nanometer process all good
stuff
now basically right here this tells you
will come to the box system requirements
not much there here's the nomenclature
so if you guys are looking to buy this
card because you can type in the
internet to find it and purchase it
then we'll flip it around just real
quick show you guys the back of the box
not too much to it just going over some
of the other features about the card all
the way down
you know I affinities important but I
don't think with a 1 gigabyte card
you're gonna be having very much luck
with I affinity it's kind of a I think a
bullshit tactic so just go ahead and pop
the box open whole thing out set it off
the side already then now okay I will
admit it took me a lot of doggone time
but now it seems that on the tab here is
using the correct way to open the box so
there we go no more upside-down boxing's
inside we can see you the card all of
the accessories which we shall take out
on take a look at and that's it for the
box all right so let's start off
sapphire this is from there sapphire
project registration from the sapphire
Club via member here's the driver CD
where to get all the company in Germany
or here quick installation guide
crossfire bridge molex to 6-pin cable
connection HDMI cable and DVI to VGA
that's all the stuff for the accessories
so we're going to pop out of the way
then let's take a look at the card
itself go ahead and pull it out of its
anti-static bag so the anaesthetic bag
down let's start up on the back of the
card you guys can see this card has a
black PCB a lot of you people have
complained for years of sapphire uses a
crappy blue PCB for all you folks out
there hated it hey your prayers have
been answered
you can see it there are four bolts
right here if you remove these you can
very easily remove the cooling off the
front of the card let's fit around a
little quick take a look at the Rio we
have one single link and one dueling DVI
connection standard HDMI and standard
DisplayPort one thing it's kind of weird
though is that you guys notice that most
of the AMD cards always have two mains
portes this is something totally
different we see Nomi display ports at
all on this card so let's flip it around
to the side you guys can see it's a two
slot solution now inside here if the
cameraman get inside there you guys can
see some of the copper that's part of
the heat pipe part of that dual X
cooling here's the pcie 3.0 interface
down on the bottom now here you guys can
see there are two fans
hence the dual X cooling and underneath
them you can see all of the cooling fins
as well to help keep the card running
cool flip the round the back side once
again you guys can see inside and some
of the coolants more heat fins inside of
there flip that around right here I'll
flip it around you guys can see the
sapphire logo though so here's the
Sapphire logo six pin power so you're
gonna have got 150 TDP single crossfire
connection right here up on top so you
can only do two waik crossfire you won't
be doing quad on this card at all so
that's pretty much it till you get the
card and all the accessories and that's
everything that comes in the box of the
new sapphire HD 77 90 over clocked
edition see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
