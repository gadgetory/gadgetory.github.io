you guys like Final Fantasy you hate
Final Fantasy I've been playing it for a
long time plus I've watched all those
cool movies like ghost in the machine
and all of these I'm just kind of a big
fan of the entire John or all together I
got to be honest with you so Final
Fantasy 15 windows Edition it just hit
the streets takes up so much space you
almost need to like get yourself a huge
huge huge storage center just this
particular game but the graphics are
very nice it's a little bit different
than any other Final Fantasy game that
has ever been out you know because it's
of totally a totally first-person type
experience unlike anything I've ever
seen before and the graphics I got a
save no the characters a little bit
cartoony the graphics themselves are
very very nice the skies are clear the
clouds look great everything is nice and
focused and so we decided that we would
do is we would show you guys how a bunch
of different video cards would play
playing this game now obviously we use
our test system and I just gotta say
this live you guys have always stressed
in the past and we've found out that
it's true having the best video card is
really more important than the CPU know
the CPU does help having the best video
card is the absolute best so if you have
a much lower you know n CPU there might
be a few frames per difference you know
between your system and ours but overall
our system is just the standard i7 8700
K and we don't have it overclocked or
anything we just rent just on stock and
then we tested it and bring you through
these different things so let's jump in
we also filmed the graphics did the
testing separately and then inlaid the
testing for you so that you guys could
see the best results because obviously
when we're playing the game and we're
capturing the screen capture you're
going to lose a few frames per second
due to that software so we calculated
that stuff outside of that and then
brought you guys that stuff but if you
want to see our test system however you
guys can check it out right here here
are all the different parts we use 16
gigabytes of RAM you know nice parts all
around it's actually a very nice system
somebody's specs are probably going to
be a little bit lower but you guys get
the gist of what we're trying to say
through this so now with that said
though let's jump in let's do the AMD
cards first we tested for AMD cards all
the way from an entry-level 560 all the
way up to the
bad-boy the 64 that's right so let's
jump in now I know one question that
everybody is going to want to ask before
we jump in and show you guys the scores
is what settings did you have it on we
had it on the highest settings for all
cards through all games now we use the
560 all the way up to the Vegas 64 on
the AMD side of things and on the nvidia
side of things we use the 1050 TI the
1070 TI
and the 1080 TI so let's jump in and
let's check out those games also on the
nvidia side of things we turned off
silly things like hair works and those
type of things so that both cards would
be tested on an even field let's go
our entry-level card in the AMD side of
things is the a Zeus rx 560 overclocked
edition card now on 4k the card got
seven frames per second I remember this
is with everything set to its maximum
1440 at 11 frames per second and 1080 at
15 frames per second now obviously if
you play the game with other settings
turned off or set at lower values your
car to play it much better Gladio come
on gotcha
you want to go check it out
what is it now
the AMDR x 480 jumped in a little better
at 4k we see 20 frames per second at
1440 36 frames per second and at 1080 50
frames per second luggage indeed
better make tracks
chop-chop prompt Oh a jiffy
want to go check it out what is it next
up the AMD rx 580 not too much different
than the 40 just a few frames per second
with 4k at 23 1440 at 41 and 1080 at 56
right underneath that 60 which is a
sweet spot better make tracks want to go
check it out what is it now the Red
Devil RX Vega 64 it does a lot better 4k
at 38 frames per second like I said
before 4k is really not here 1440 at 66
frames per second and at 1080 87 frames
per second
so you guys can see that if you want to
play this game with all of its settings
to the maximum you actually need like a
Vegas 64 or a Vega 56 because the other
cards are all coming in at under 60
frames per second even at 1080 but like
I said you can lower the settings let's
check out the Nvidia side of things we
want to go check it out
what is it the entry-level card we used
on Nvidia side of things as a so tech
GTX 1050 Ti mini card now at 4k this
card got 12 frames per second at 1440 23
frames per second and at 1080 34 frames
per second
want to go check it out what is it next
up is the gtx 1070 TI at 4k you get 35
frames per second 1440 you get 63 frames
per second and with the 1080 87 frames
per second and honestly folks this is
probably the sweet spot of everything
for this particular game
eyes forward didn't mean to do that how
far are we going you want to go check it
out
what is it so next up the GTX 1080 Ti in
at 4k it gets really close to that 60
frames per second sweet spot with 50
frames per second at 1440 it kills at 86
frames per second and at 1080 a hundred
and nine frames per second
nice here yeah it's alright guys here is
the bottom line this game is very
demanding on your video card this is a
very very demanding game if you want to
play this game and you want to have
ultra-high frames per second you're
gonna have to have a high end video card
and the only thing is right now that's
kind of a real slap to the face to
everybody out there with video card
prices being the way that they are
because you just can't get a hold of
these high end video cards unless you do
something like build you know a
pre-built system which we talked about
so a lot of people don't like but one of
the only ways that you can do this now
unfortunately I'm I know you guys
probably tripping on this is though is
that this game does not work on a Mac at
all because an iMac actually these days
comes with a 580 inside of it and
they're about 2 grand and if you're not
right totally dedicated anything or a
crazy guy who just wants to you know who
only wants a hardcore PC they actually
play most games pretty well especially
games that are like this that don't have
you know so many special effects going
all over the place too much but that's
another whole story you guys see how the
game plays I like it a lot it's a pretty
cool game we'll bring you guys more
footage with more cards and different
aspects of it as we go along we're
actually gonna test it on some lower
systems completely lower you know like
entry level completely system with lower
CPUs and lower memory all that stuff
just to see how it plays and also we'll
play it on a couple lower end laptops
and see how that does as well so that's
it folks
thanks for watching the channel like
usual down below like button we'll have
a link to this game if you want to check
it out for yourself um if they had any
demo of this game you guys should
definitely check it out and play the
demo because I think it'll really in
you'll want to play it and for fans of
Final Fantasy hey it's the 15th freaking
version man obviously it's around for a
long time if you want to see me here the
channel
and subscribe and I'll see you here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
