techno crap welcome back to tech of
tomorrow where we're actually moving
past the 280 series of cards and we're
going to start moving into the new r9
270x set of cards and the first that we
have on the table is the direct C
version from the people over at a soos
now this card is going to have all their
awesome cooling all their stuff that's
in the card that makes it special to a
Zeus you guys know that the people over
at a soos they never use reference stuff
they always go out of their way on their
series of cards and bring you guys
aftermarket cooling and their own design
which is totally based on non reference
stuff so with that said let's jump in
and check out this brand new card then
people over at asus alright folks so
here we have it the Box part of every
unboxing includes obviously well the box
alright so we have the aid Zeus in
search of incredible the direct see you
to top version now do you guys know
anything about the top version the top
version is always the highest o'clock
version that these guys make now this
card is going to be replacing the 7870
that's right but you guys thought was
anything different nope that's what it
is you guys can see down here top
overclocked edition two gigabytes of
gddr5 there DIGI+ plus vrm alloy power
all this is all the stuff that's power
conditioning the good parts they use
makes it last longer run cooler GPU
tweak you guys all know what that is
that's a sis's there software for
overclocking and monitoring your card
bank through all that real quick to flip
it around the back where they really
just reiterate stuff do you guys don't
know it yet direct Cu is direct copper
it means that they think connects
directly to the copper on the card gets
dissipated out to the heat pipes and
then into the metal cooling fins to keep
the card cooler 20% cooler and vastly
quieter once they give me to the digits
vrm plus super alloy power which
actually is just the way that the power
conditioning of the card is the parts
that they use and it's supposed to have
30% less power noise and 2.5 times the
lifespan once again we see GPU tweak
sorry folks mission ablaze this I know
you guys don't really like too much
about the box but some people do so I
try to appease you all let's go ahead
now pop the endcap off
you're da the r9 270x we'll go ahead and
get that out of the way so we have to
see a box in a box and actually had a
little bit of damage and shipping their
epic kick the shippers but it was UPS
though so what do you expect alright so
there we go we're going to pop the cap
here we see all the accessories I'm
going to real quickly go over these a
lot of you guys said that you didn't
want me to spend a lot of time on them
but you did want to see him something
spend a lot of time on them but I'll
still let you see them so quick speed
setup what we're doing speedy molex 66
pin crossfire cable driver was that
quick enough all right then let me past
it
here we are onto the card itself where
now you can see since my video that I
made before about them not coming in
plastic bags we'll check it out they're
in plastic bags I guess I pissed
somebody off already so go ahead and
take that out a lot of times my cards
are review samples though this is
actually a full on retail package if
you're watching Nick I prefer them this
way let's go ahead and pull this out got
a little bit of a sticky thing there
stick it on the car then BOOM let me
just get the box out of the way or at
least fold it up I think it'll be a nice
part to stop so anyways since I got this
way let's start off with the beautiful
black PCB on the rear of the card check
that out I know that all you guys prefer
that you've stated that many many times
you don't want to see any other color
pretty much but black on your PCB well a
deuce listens to you now one thing that
could have been cool about this card I'm
sure we'll see on some other models when
they put the back cover on I really
prefer that I know you guys do as well
it protects the card here's your pcie
3.0 interface stick that into your
little slot in your computer I think you
guys all know that flip it up here to
the top let me spin this bad boy around
and then I want to take note of
something here you see these power
connectors when I get to the review I'll
find exactly what this is but this is
looking like a Zeus did something a
little bit different here don't know
exactly what it is yet but I will
investigate flip the card to the side we
see the name hey Zeus direct see you too
here are the heat pipes dual six pin
power connectors hence why we had the
molex to 6-pin kind of useless for some
people but if you need it
they have it better to have it than need
it and not have it right exactly so here
is the power plug for the fans you guys
can see some of the components all
underneath there see the fins some of
you guys said it makes your skin cringe
when I do that but this one's not making
any noise I'm not getting any musical
tenderness out of that so nothing there
to slot solution you guys can see that
more the heat pipes down here flip it to
the top of the card now
dc2 that means two fans direct copper
and two fans hence the two fans that we
see here underneath you can see all of
the aluminum heat fins that help make up
the cooling of the card so other IO we
have standard DisplayPort none of those
little mini DisplayPort jobbers standard
HDMI and to DVI connections DVID and DVI
I this can show you right the bat is
completely aftermarket when you see a
card directly from AMD it's going to
have a single DVI no standard
DisplayPort you're going to see two of
those main display ports which I don't
even like they're only good for people
who own Macs
I mean if you don't want Mac those main
display ports are almost useless so I'm
glad that a Zeus took the time to take
that out so that's it folks the card the
content and that's it alright so well
that's the unboxing and now I've got to
part with the cars it's got to go on the
test station but I don't wanna part with
it it's a nice-looking little card nice
price well so that's it folks if you
guys like this video hit that like
button also if you guys would like to
see a video on some articles comparing
this directly against the various 280s
let us know that as well also over on
our website
www.scottandjimdeserthomes.com that
bye-bye
he will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
