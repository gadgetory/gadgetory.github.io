TECA tomorrow today bringing you guys
more stuff going on about the new NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 780 now what do we bring to
the table now well today we're going to
show you guys how very easy it is to
overclock this card using EVGA z'
precision tune software we were able to
overclock the card 100 megahertz very
very simple and we got some actually
pretty decent results as well now as a
general rule of thumb for the beginning
overclocker you only want to do things
in increments of 10 megahertz at a time
that way you can make sure that
everything is very very stable that's
what we did we just kept increasing and
increasing it until we got to that and
we just kind of left it at that due the
fact that we're not having you know
extreme cooling on this is just the
reference based cooling and we didn't
want to fry the card out but the big
question is is really what in the hell
did this do for me right okay that's
going to be the big question so check it
out three to five frames per second in
games depending on the game
OpenCL performance was much more
improved and the really the biggest
thing is there wasn't even that much of
a heat increase like you got about two
degrees more and that's really it that's
not really that bad considering that
you're overclocking the card one thing
to take note of though we were very
easily able to get the hundred megahertz
overclock that we did what that happen
to increase the voltage at all and
really the only time the voltage should
be touched at all is if you're having
stability problems like say that you
actually did overclock the car do you
say to me like 125 but you increase the
voltage that seem to be stable without
really blowing the card out of the water
you can go ahead and experiment with
that and the cards not frying out you
may get lucky but you always want to
take small baby steps and EVGA precision
tune works very very well it's very
simple and intuitive to use you guys saw
how simple that was to do you just go in
and click a couple of buttons drag and
drop it hit apply and you're good to go
lastly we're pumping out a lot of videos
today on launch day I hope you guys like
them if you do make sure you guys hit
that like button and show us that you
guys appreciate it like usual anything
that you've missed will be down there in
the description button below so click on
that and you'll have all the information
with links to anything you want
- no so imma we'll see you guys back
here on Tekken tomorrow for more GeForce
GTX 780 goodness as the day goes on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
