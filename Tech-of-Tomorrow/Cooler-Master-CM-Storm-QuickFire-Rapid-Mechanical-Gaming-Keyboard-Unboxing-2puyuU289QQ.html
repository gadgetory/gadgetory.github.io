here on the tech of tomorrow YouTube
channel bringing you guys an unboxing
and first look at the CM storm quickfire
rapid keyboard now this thing features
cherry MX bronze keys has a lot of cool
features and is actually very small so
it doesn't have a little keypad to the
side so it's perfect for those gamers
who are on the go or just want something
smaller on their desk so let's jump over
to the damn desk and let's look at this
thing
alright folks so here we have the box
and for any good box I guess or to pull
out the pill what's that for
oh that's right I guess I don't need
that alright never mind so here we have
it folks the CM storm quickfire rapid
mechanical gaming keyboard medium
resistance force feedback bump on the
Cherry MX brown oh you know what folks I
guess I was wrong on my introduction I
thought these were the bronze which ones
this actually is the Cherry MX brown my
apologies my bad alright so let's move
on
flip it around the back right here
mechanical Cherry MX switches n key roll
over in ps2 mode extra key caps bundle
with the key cap polar this little tool
which I'll admit the very first time I
ever seen it I had no idea what it was
anyways says has removable braided USB
cable with cable routing which means you
can probably unplug the cable move it
all around once again we see the
features mechanical Cherry MX switches
Windows key disabled in game mode extra
key caps bundled with key caps puller
laser marked key caps anti-ghosting
necro in ps2 game mode thousand
megahertz one makers response pieman USB
mode multimedia shortcuts rubber coated
keyboard surface removable braided USB
cable with cable routing and the
dimensions are 350 6.6 by 130 5.5 by 30
and the weight is 940 grams so with that
said let's actually unbox this thing and
see what it's all about as far as its
look so a little tab right here get that
out of there now I don't know if a lot
of you folks out there have actually
used mechanical keyboards they're a lot
different than your standard keyboards
they have a lot different feel they're
very old-school if you guys like the old
I
p.m. keyboards where you punch them you
click these are the ones you want so
here is the users guide here's the
keyboard let's do the accessories here
is the USB to ps/2 connector right there
you can plug that little bad boy in the
back of your computer give it old school
computer and don't have the new stuff
here go the extra keys and the key
puller
you've got coolermaster stuff on here
and one thing I do think is cool is that
when you go into gaming mode it disables
all the windows key so you don't
actually hit that windows button your
whole game get all freaked out like the
old days I think that's a pretty good
thing to have then go ahead and pop this
out here is the gold-plated cable see
gold-plated on each end go ahead and
move that stuff out of the way and let's
get to the keyboard itself is open table
boom this thing's really kind of trippy
feeling you can carry around quite a bit
it's actually industrious feeling feels
very tough so feel like I could break it
very easily nope it's a tough-ass
keyboard that's for damn sure
now split around the back I've got a
couple little pop things right here
here's what they talked about their
management the cable that's really hard
to see but underneath right here is
where the cable plugs in and you can
route your cable either through this
side or that side however you want to do
it flip this bad boy around get down to
the table here let's take a look at the
keyboard itself now you notice it's
missing the 10 keypad that's over here
not a lot of people use that as you guys
can hear as I'm clicking all of the keys
make noise but since what it's about and
put this here and actually see how this
feels to me the responsiveness feels
good I won't know until I actually plug
in and use a little bit you can see all
your other keys are up here nothing very
fancy just all simply laid out you get
these keys right here which you can see
can be changed out with those other ones
and there you can pop little keys out
use them you selves your directional
keys here
your Delete key and all that stuff
alright folks so here we see this thing
now the quick fire rapid is supposed to
be a very portable ultimate little
mechanical gaming keyboard now as far as
you can see you can see it fits in my
hand very easily so it's easy to carry
around the cable management ought to be
pretty decent now if you like mechanical
