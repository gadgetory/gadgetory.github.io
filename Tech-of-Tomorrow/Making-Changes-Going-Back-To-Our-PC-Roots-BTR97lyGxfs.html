channel glad to see you guys here now
since last November of 2016 all of a
sudden all of the numbers for my channel
the views and everything else has just
completely gone to crap we went from an
average of a hundred and fifty K almost
for every video down three you guys see
I'm barely getting four and five K
almost for a total of videos now and
that probably has to do with a lot of
different reasons so we're gonna be
changing the channel and that's one of
the main reasons why the shift on
YouTube has seemed to change in a
direction which for some reason I'm not
meeting that algorithm so we really need
to take a step back from the channel
look at what's going on and figure it
out so that we can actually come back to
the table because because with you I'm
almost just burned out on making videos
because the videos aren't having the
same attraction that they wore and that
like I said that probably has to do with
a lot of things that have been going on
the challenge know you guys eight
sponsored videos but I've just had a lot
of different medical bills and stuff
that had to do with my heart that just
raised all my price of what I'm doing
with my life which just kind of forced
me to kind of make those kind of deals
so I could have money to afford my meds
and stuff like that and I know you guys
don't like that so one of the first
things we're going to be doing almost is
just cutting out all paid sponsorship
I'm still going to probably having my
deals with Corsair because like they're
one of my favorite companies that I'm
working with them almost since the
entire time they've been in business so
that I'll probably still have but the
things with Chinese products and
sponsors like that we're gonna dump all
that aside it doesn't really seem like
you guys appreciate anything that we do
outside of the real hardcore PC realm so
we really need to like get back and
focus on that but that authy takes a
step back to take a look at everything
we're doing and then reorganize so we
have started now our own snapchat and we
have our Instagram stuff we'll start
using that I'm also going to fix the
website and get back to writing the
reviews probably before I bring the
videos to the table let's see that's
kind of hard because it seemed like now
YouTube almost wants you to have to have
a video every single solitary day of the
week almost unless you're one of those
giant channels you know to get the views
and we can't really do that because if I
need to slow down and make the better
videos and that's going to be taking
more time there's only a couple of us
here so it's not like there's this big
giant TECA tomorrow corporation exists
you know of really three people me
Anthony M Jesus and you know the dog you
know as our mascot that's really all
there is to it and sometimes there's
launch date we're all working instead of
trying to you know do these you know
bring this stuff to the table it gets to
be a little bit hard so we want to make
the absolute best videos so I think to
really do that we have to slow down and
look at exactly what's going on bring to
the table what you guys want we've seen
the comments so we know what's going on
but that honestly takes slowing and down
so we making a lot of changes I'll be
redesigning the channel all the logos
and all that stuff I'll be changing that
around like I said before I'll be
getting the website going and doing that
basically we need to make a lot of a lot
of changes to the channel to make sure
that we can keep going on YouTube or I
just don't see us surviving into the far
future because the numbers just keep
dwindling and we need to figure out why
so we're always open to your guys
suggestions you know I really hate when
people just leave negative stupid
comments it just makes no sense but if
you have something positive to say and
you may have some secret magic that you
know hey go ahead and share with me
because I'm always willing to learn but
I just want to let you guys know if you
don't see as many videos right now it's
because we were reorganizing the channel
and changing our focus and getting back
to what the channel was actually start
about which was you know PC stuff
motherboards that kind of thing so we'll
be going back to doing motherboard
reviews and the things that you guys
originally liked about the channel
because I admit I know that we've
changed direction a little bit because I
experimented a lot I want to try
different avenues and you know see how
they went like consumer electronics that
sounded really cool so I've never really
done that before so I wanted to like do
that you know it's kind of like a
musician in a band you know you've been
playing heavy metal forever you know but
you know you'd like to like maybe make a
disco song or a country song or
something just because it's different
you know
and that's kind of where it kind of got
with me with the channel I've been doing
the same thing for so long that I just
needed a change but I realized though
the core audience and the core things
that you guys like might not be what my
experimentation is so with that said
though we love you guys hope you see you
guys back from the channel hopefully
2018 will be a much better years we get
reorganized and figure out just what the
heck we need to do you know to keep
being successful here on YouTube and
bringing you guys the top quality videos
peace-out we'll see you guys back here
on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
