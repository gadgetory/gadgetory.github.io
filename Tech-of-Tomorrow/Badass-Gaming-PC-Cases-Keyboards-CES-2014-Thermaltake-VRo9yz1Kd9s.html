welcome back to tech Audemar we're
bringing you all the tech all the time
and this year's tech is CES 2014 now
right now we're up at the thermaltake
suite in the Palazzo Hotel and they've
got some pretty interesting stuff now
although this company did not come out
with a ton of new items for this year's
CES they still have some pretty cool
stuff including a few cases and a few
nice Mouse's and a few other products
that are actually just branded things so
we're gonna be walking around the room
and right now you guys can see they have
four cases lined up here on a table this
is one of their brand new products
that's going to be coming out and it's
being shown for the first time at this
year's CES 2014 now we couldn't get a
one-on-one meeting with Shannon Rob from
thermaltake due to the fact the time
that we came the room was just actually
like an entire zoo it was filled with
people crawling all of the products
everywhere and trying to film a video
and trying to capture the vocals would
have been pretty impossible because the
waters come out you might have felt like
you're one of those people is having
your mind invaded by a hundred voices
but still we were able to get some cool
shots you can see there's like all kinds
of different stuff here they've got a
table full of stuff including some of
their new cooling stuff some new fans
and some other cool guys treat they're
gonna be breaking out this year to show
you guys we have another table over here
that's full of all their different type
of mice products which they have a lot
of and they also have some new keyboards
and one thing that they're saying is
that these guys are actually going to
start making their own switch so it's
really funny because I just met with
Cherry MX and coursera the other day and
they were saying hey you know right now
we feel like other people might start
competing the market and well
surprisingly enough it seems like
Thermaltake is now going to be one of
these people they are now going to start
making their own switch embedding in
their own keyboards and so instead of
buying switches from Cherry they'll be
buying their own Taiwanese or Chinese
mad products so that's approved pretty
interesting so not a whole whole lot to
see at this year's Thermaltake booth but
they do have a few nice things and we
just want to make sure
you guys got to see them at this year's
CES 2014 so I'm Eric thanks for watching
we'll see you guys back in town because
thermal takes actually about four blocks
from my house so we love you guys thanks
for watching we'll see you back here on
the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
