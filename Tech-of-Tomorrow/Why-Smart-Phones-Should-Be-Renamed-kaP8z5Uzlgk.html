every few months we see a new smartphone
hit the market they're always having
brand new ones coming out right but
check this out they call it a smart
phone right phone phone has the actual
feature the phone feature on any phone
almost from the invention of the phone
until the phone that you're talking to
that sticks to your head how much
different is there really in the phone
part of it as far as like picking up
your voice and sending it and
transmitting it's just you know you've
got a little bit better reception on
wireless but but let's be honest the
phone features are the least feature
ever really talked about honestly look
at any launch from Apple look at any
launch from Samsung look at any company
Boost Mobile t-mobile look at it am
simple mobile hey look at them all
sprint how many of them honestly talk
about the phone stuff it's very little
don't be saying hey you get great
reception you know you can pick up your
phones which means you know basically
you can talk on your phone but that's it
you don't ever hear anybody going hey
man um yeah you know I'm your voice
everything is so much better on the
latest smartphone it's really not about
the phone anymore whatsoever what it
seems like to me is the battle right now
is between what kind of camera goes on
your phone and what kind of screen
because now we're seeing screens with
speakers built-in to and all kinds of
crazy stuff like that
and we're seeing every launch what are
you really really here about every
launch honestly it's the camera does
this now the camera does background it
does distance it does this every launch
it's really a camera battle so I mean
should it really be called a smart
camera because the camera features there
are more features honestly about a
camera on a phone than pretty much
anything else yeah sure they got some
cool design features like we just said a
second ago they got speakers that are
built into the display but still the
display
is still a display you know they've
changed a little bit you know Apple
claims that our liquid crystal display
thing it just means it's kind of
edgeless little display there you know
but the technology is not about phone so
I mean it's kind of crazy why they keep
calling it a smartphone and honestly
when I go out I don't never seen anybody
really even talking on it even right now
the Camerons back here he's back there
texting on his phone checking his email
texting on his phone why is it work -
lap him later for this stuff but I guess
I'm talking so he can do it he wants but
what I'm saying is that people use their
so-called phone for doing so much other
stuff that has really nothing to do with
the phone I use mine for texting for
doing stuff on Instagram checking out
information looking for restaurants if
I'm out I'm looking for directions but
the phone part of it from the very first
cell phone that I ever had which really
looked just like a Star Trek
communicator from the early days of Star
Trek the Motorola I don't if you guys
remember that one the first Motorola
flip phone look exactly like the flip
from the James T care queue so years on
the enterprise on the Star Trek thing
that's fried the very first one looked
just like it and guess what I can hear
you on that phone pretty much just as
good as I can hear you on my phone you
know so there's not much of a technology
difference whatsoever and I kind of feel
that as far as like these things being
called smart phones I don't think the
name really applies anymore and things
seriously need to change for one thing
they're getting more and more powerful
all the time okay so the thing is now
coming between portability and power and
that's the balance that we're trying to
find and I've said it before I think
that these things should the products
should become a totally different name
used might be able to have a device and
you guys can tell me what you think
that's strictly dedicated to just making
phone calls a simple talking phone
device you can call it a cell phone if
you want is then to be a smart one but
you know you can just have that maybe
charge like you know eighty to a hundred
dollars for that and
that and there probably is somebody out
there who has a product that's similar
to that but the way things are going
with all these so-called smart phones
they're not bones they're computers and
the way I see it now the coolest thing
that these guys can do and I don't
really hear many people talking about it
is having these devices be able to come
home take into your home and then place
inside of another device which could
boost the power and everything else so
you could like have your so-called you
know it's not gonna be called a smart
phone we'll just call it a smart device
or something like that and this device
you take with you and you can make phone
calls obviously on the thing since
that's like the simplest thing on the
entire device but the information that
you acure out about places the pictures
the music everything else that you're
going to get you should be able to take
it come home with it putting a little
dock and have all of that stuff on the
computer at your house and that could be
your main computer and that's where
stuff I feel really needs to go as far
as technology goes and I'm not really
seeing that when I go out and I search
for stuff all I ever see over and over
and over and goes hey my smartphone has
a better camera than the last generation
you know it's got better everything
better features better aperture it's
just better better better but check it
out what in the hell does that have to
do with a phone nothing we're talking
camera technology and let's be real a
screen oh my god we have a liquid
crystal display great screen what the
heck does a screen have to do with a
phone does a screen pick up your voice
because unless that screens picking up
your voice then it has nothing to do
with the phone there's a microphone
built into your phone it picks up your
voice but it ain't the screen so all of
these features that pretty much
everybody touts over and over and over
again have nothing to do with the phone
they just keep calling it a smart phone
when really it's passed the phone stage
I don't know how many generations back
smartphone is really not the right name
for this product anymore because the
phone has the least amount of impact and
you you probably use the phone the least
amount of anything else on it I'm sure
there are probably older people like my
mom and people who just use it for a
phone but most people including me now
try to catch up with my kids I use my
phone for pretty much everything but a
phone I rarely use it to talk on it to
people it's always about texting posting
on Instagram viewing things looking for
stuff getting directions really smart
phone smart phone huh yeah things need
to change I want to see a whole world
where you take a look lights fish you
better than that
like that came out so I was speaking in
tongues for a second there I thought I
was where anyways I want to see the
technology change names and change the
way things are going because if you can
fit a really kick butt processor inside
this little thing get a great camera and
have all this stuff that's all cool but
you should be able to bring that device
home and use that device at home why
should you have to buy a smartphone and
a computer really I mean I know these
companies want to milk us for every
penny we have and suck us dry for our
dollar but really by them not doing this
they're honestly screwing all of us
because the technology is getting so
advanced that you should be able to buy
one of these devices and it should
double as your computer maybe you can
plug it in like I said into a docking of
a better monitor of better speakers and
all this stuff but you should be able to
use this little device and put it in
there and it should be so powerful that
it's all that you need why are we buying
multiple devices and why is something
that we barely used to talk on call the
smartphone really things need to change
I hope they change what do you guys
think are you with me on this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
