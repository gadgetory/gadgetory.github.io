just makes you feel warm and fuzzy
inside
oh yeah welcome back we're glad to see
you here today
hands and I hey all right so what's
going on welcome back TECA tomorrow I'm
Eric you're insane
host of the day now what's going on well
it has been released that's right Lisa
speculate that release that the new
nvidia gtx 880 is going to be out
featuring an all-new GPU it should
perform even the old gk110 so with that
said though let's jump in and let's talk
a little bit these specs about this new
card from the folks at Nvidia so far
folks it looks like the chipset in this
car will be the GM 204 and it's not
supposed to be the most powerful Maxwell
based GPU at all judging by the way
Nvidia did this last time this card is
probably the entry level and it's going
to keep going up from there so let's
check it out this thing's based off the
20 nanometer GM 204 silicon features
seven point nine billion transistors
3200 CUDA cores 200 TM use thirty-two
Rob's 256-bit wide gddr5 memory
interface four gigabytes of standard
memory 238 gigabytes of memory bandwidth
and the clocks these are supposed to be
at 900 megahertz core 950 mega Hertz
boost and last but not least the power
requirements on this bad boy are
supposed to be 230 watts now this is
really awesome news I know people have
been waiting for the eight series for
quite a while and now we're seeing some
leaked specs that could quite possibly
be real now our off spot correspondent
Biff Baxter had the following thing to
say when he heard this from his off
store location so there you have it
let's keep going more stories coming up
great news for gamers from the people
over at Logitech that's right they have
a brand new Mouse in their G Series line
the new g502 proteus core now this
thing's supposed to be totally
customizable for any type of user out
that has all kinds of outstanding
features including one that's supposed
to really stand out is this automated
customized thing whenever you change
services it automatically detects
the environments you're in bringing you
the ultimate gaming now at that said
let's check out some of the other
features about this mouse which will be
hitting the market about 80 bucks later
on this month one of the big focus in
this mouse is customization fitting any
gamers preference along with the ability
to adjust the mouse's weight using up to
five three point five gram weights the
Proteus core will also offer eleven
customizable buttons for users to set up
whatever macros they find useful as well
as the ability to set its dpi between
two hundred and twelve thousand another
really cool feature is how this mouse is
able to calibrate itself depending on
the surface that you're using so think
about this you change services with your
mouse this thing will automatically
recalibrate to give you the best
performance on this mouse so why folks
there you have it the new g502 from the
people at logitech now their theory on
this is that one type fails science wins

other features this camera and why those
folks who are looking for something in
4k from their favorite brown Sony this
is going to be something you're gonna
want to check out the alpha 7s was

Vegas the a7 is based off the same body
found in the a7 in the a7 R but on the

megapixel sensor but it's still
full-frame this 12 megapixel Exmor CMOS
is combined with Sony's own buy on Zechs
image processor giving a huge
sensitivity range of ISO s from 50 to
over 400,000 now there is a slide little
kes to this you'll only be able to store
1080p videos on the actual unit itself
