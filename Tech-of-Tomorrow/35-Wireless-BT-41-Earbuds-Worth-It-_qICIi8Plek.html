one of those folks out there who's
always looking for a nice set of
bluetooth 4.1 headphones but you don't
have a lot of money to spend on them
well if you are let's check out this set
from I sounds I think you're gonna like
them the AI sounds earbuds are pretty
cool now these things are completely
sweat proof and they have these really
cool ear hooks that make sure they don't
fall out of your ears even when you're
moving around and exercising which is
pretty cool for those people who are
always on the go they offer bluetooth
4.1 connectivity they also have CVC 6.0
noise cancellation means that all you're
going to really hear is the sounds in
your ears the eye sounds also contained
an 85 milliamp battery which takes just
two hours to charge and then provides
240 hours of standby time or 7 hours of
continuous music playtime the eye sounds
are fully compatible with iPhone 6s Plus
success iPad Samsung Galaxy or pretty
much anything that's Bluetooth capable
be it Android or Apple what you get when
you purchase the I sounds is a nice
little carrying case the headphones
themselves the charging cable and a few
different set of earbuds for different
sized ears the only caveat to me would
have been if these ear hooks would have
been adjustable that would have been
really nice but they work pretty well
even as is they're also very easy to put
in your head and very comfortable
because they're pretty much almost
weightless all you do is just simply
just put the hook on your ear and you're
good to go with the I sounds you can
clearly see which is the right hand side
and which is the left hand side because
the headphones clearly tell you what
they are and another nice thing is all
the controls are located on the right
hand side the power button all the
control features and underneath the
controls is the mini USB plug for
charging those headphones up now I know
though the biggest question on
everybody's mind is okay you've told us
those few specs but how do they sound
well really these things are really nice
sounding they're pretty much flat they
have a little bit more basin than
trouble in but they can get really
really loud so you don't have to worry
about your volume in regards to what
you're doing you'll be able to turn the
volume up inside of these and be able to
illuminate
pretty much all the outside sound I mean
unless you're probably standing at the
jet engine or something like that you're
definitely going to hear that but the
bottom line folks is this these earbuds
are only $35 now we brought you a bunch
of other inner ear headphones in the
past under the $50 range I wish I would
have got a hold of this pair before we
did that unfortunately we got these
afterwards but these are very nice and
if I had to do like my top five for
under that these would definitely be
included so I know there's not a whole
lot to a set you know of ear buds but
still for $35 they're a great deal so if
you guys want more information about
this want to check any more stuff check
out that down below like button we'll
have links where you guys can purchase
these or just see more information for
yourself
but at the end of the day if you don't
have a lot of cash you still want
something that sounds good and is not
made of junk check out the I sounds I
think you'll like them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
