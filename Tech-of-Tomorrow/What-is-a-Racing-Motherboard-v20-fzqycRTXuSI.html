once again back to tech of tomorrow so
you guys all know until release new CPUs
and that means new motherboards today
we're going to check out the z2 70 GT 6
now this is from Biostar a lot of people
out there may think the biostar is some
low-end company because back in the day
they did a lot of OEM stuff but they've
changed over the years and the racing
series motherboards have been pretty
popular so with that said though let's
jump in let's do the unboxing and first
look and see what this motherboards all
about the top of the box really doesn't
say a lot just says it's the Racing z2
70 GT 6 but what's really cool is that
it says it is a 240 gigabyte SSD inside
the box for free so that's pretty much
it let's turn around the back of the box
just let you guys see the back of the
box we'll talk about these things we do
the unboxing but for those who really
care there it is
so beyond that let me pop the cap here
starting off the top we're going to get
the users guide user's manual watched up
shows your everything that comes inside
there and what you can do with it
although I have to say though that I was
a little bit not too pleased when I read
the manual I'll get into that as we go
along but let me set that off to the
side then we have the 3 240 gigabyte G
300 series SSD pretty cool stuff great
for your boot drive got it plenty of
room the next up we have four SATA
cables easy stuff their driver CD rear
i/o plate and then a cable right here
see what this is set up this little
thing in here ok RGB LED adapter cable
ok so this is very different lights
inside the system we do in the unboxing
we'll talk about some of those features
but you get a few features we're doing
your lighting in here especially with
the fan so to set that up the side and
that's what the cable looks like and so
those are the accessories and what comes
there next up obviously some other board
itself we pulled out of the way get the
box out of the way or back in here
so it's cool motherboard out and there
we have it dropping to the floor so
actually let's start up a little bit
different let's start off the rear il
something we never do first off we see a
legacy ps2 keyboard force this is
perfect for those people who have old
components and they want to make sure
that when you're getting their BIOS
it'll be recognized then down below we
see two USB standard ports these are
also just as well a plug in when you're
doing your boot sequence if you try to
plug into USB 3.0 ports a lot of times
your keyboard your mouse won't be seeing
your beats going ah why can't I get in
the BIOS oh it's better sometimes just
use them older stuff the next to that
with a DVI connection display port USB
type-c then we have four USB 3.0 ports
gigabyte lan and then all of the audio
components you can see are all
gold-plated on the inside so that's
pretty cool so that's right we usually
don't start there but hey what the heck
let's do something different
now here's the board we can see the
layout of the board is pretty decent
lots of room all the way around the CPU
socket so that you can put an
aftermarket cooler all that they use
absolutely the most highest components
because they can use all of the caps
everything on the motherboard is made
pretty much what they consider to be the
best of the best they don't give any
fancy really marketing things as in
racing they don't try to say it's like
military or good enough to you know to
to wipe out an army nothing like that
it's just what it is the GT 6 also
features the Intel LGA 1151 socket
plenty of room like I said around the
socket though for installing those
aftermarket cooler so I don't think is
going to be too much worried about what
you use to cool it single 8bim power
port in the top 24 pin over here there
are a total of five fan headers on the
board including the one that's for the
fans now I say the fans I mean the fan
colors so on top we have two fan headers
up here these are both considered for
the CPU and then the other other three
which are here here here located in the
bottom and then right over here as well
we have another port for actually
connecting up lights so when you use
this port not for lights but for
coloring the light when you use this
particular port on the motherboard you
could cable to it up it it allows you to
control all the colors and everything on
your motherboard for creative design
stuff so people out there who like doing
systems with color stuff they're going
to like that because you have to buy
that extra controller what
ever so that's pretty cool also this
piece right here in the motherboard this
was not in the manual whatsoever
and I mean not in the manual at all so I
was kind of tripping out and that really
didn't have anything about it but this
thing actually lights up in four
different color varieties so you can use
different ones and we actually do the
review and the build will actually show
all that you can see all the different
colors in it but it will be pretty cool
the GT six features four dimm slots for
dual channel ddr3 memory but what I
think is really nice about this
motherboard are these really nice
controls here kind of hard to see but
these are all like touch unlike the old
days it has a bunch of pins coming up
this is a lot different you have power
you have different modes you have Eco
mode which basically sets the entire
motherboard to one and it's power saving
modes and then you have sport mode the
sport mode allows you to do all the
adjustments do all the overclock and all
that stuff and then right next that's
kind of hard to see it's a little small
of a button but this is the ln2
controller now if you would engage
gayland to controller it will set the
board automatically to its lowest
setting since you can do all your
overclocking to your arcs desire but not
right when the board starts off so it'll
make sure the board just starts right up
I guess there's been some problems in
the past with like things being too cold
and something evelle into it not posting
so this button should eliminate that
altogether also next to a 24 pin power
connector you have two external SATA
ports and then right over here you have
all your SATA ports for the motherboard
now you can do all kinds of braids 0 1 5
all those can be set up through the
right raise on the board now this little
connector right here is something very
interesting now this is a SATA connector
which is basically a youtube controller
for external devices this is three times
the speed of USB 3.0 so it's 32 gigabits
per second so that's pretty damn amazing
now let's put the board around again we
receive a comport I don't really think
anybody's going to really use that you a
few of those on there I don't know maybe
somebody out there who's using you their
computer for running machinery and stuff
would use those but for gaming I've
never used one I would you know expect
the motherboard that says racing it's
for gaming now you have two BIOS chips
down here
they're both removable you have a switch
to switch between the two of them and
the good thing with this is if you blow
one of the biases out you can switch it
to the other and then boom you're back
up and going right next that right here
we have the LED indicator if there's any
type of problem with your board store
is going to give you a code you're going
to be like holy crap what's going on but
at least they'll tell you what's going
on as far as PC is latsko you get one
two three PCI by 16 and then one two
three four just the PCI single slots now
the single slots were really geared for
like putting modems and stuff like that
in but I've noticed a lot of people just
put their cards in the big slots and
just roll with it on both sides of Mo's
boards we all see the racing logo right
by the SATA which is a racing logo and
then once again over here by the audio
we see the racing and then here the
audio components right here now these
aren't the absolute best film caps I've
ever seen but they're still pretty
decent and to talk just a little bit
more about the audio the audio onboard
features complete 7.1 surround sound
technology so if you got the speakers
you can listen to it earlier we pointed
out to you guys a little fast control
over here which is basically m2
technology for external but on this
board the m2 connection is located right
here and it actually has some type of
advanced cooling it which keeps your m2
running cool now at 32 gigabits a second
this is the absolute fastest way you can
get your boot time so it's all possible
putting an m2 in your device and using
it as the boot drive would be my most
recommended way of doing so let's just
face it it's faster than hell when you
use that connection and one thing really
interesting how many motherboards of
using that actually has Intel land surge
protection that's right on this
motherboard right behind the land socket
is the surge protection I never knew
there was that much juice comes the
Lamport to pop my board but hey maybe it
was wrong anyways folks all right that
is it
biostar racing GT 6 I would have thought
though being called Racing motherboard
might have had some stripes or something
more racing about it I mean when I look
at this I guess this thing or appears
kind of racing other that says racing I
want to hear you guys have thoughts down
below
always so down below a like button olive
lynxes motherboard plus more information
if you want more about it we'll be doing
a build soon so you guys can see how the
mother performs how it looks all that
good stuff so I networked you've been
watching Tekken tomorrow thanks for
watching this was the Biostar z 270 GT 6
