guys back here on the channel now before
we jump in the video I just want to say
this particular video was a total
learning experience for us as we learned
how to do all the things that you guys
were asking for you guys asked for the
one percent point one percent lows so we
learned how to do that and bringing
those things to you so when our videos
in the future which we're going to be
totally change our test system will
containing the lows the highs and the 1%
point one percent loads that you guys
have been asking for because we want you
guys to love us as much as we love you
so we took the XFX rx 580 card and we
put it in a battle against the founders
Edition 10:17 I know that 1070 is a
little bit kind of out of a price range
but why not it's not a total David
Goliath type of thing but the 1070 is
supposed to be a lot faster some more
expensive Cardin I think you guys are
going to see at the end of the video
that the RX 580 actually does pretty
damn solid against them I mean I think
you guys will be pretty shocked to see
that so with that said let's just talk a
little bit of our test so this test
system is going to be changed as you see
the next videos will be switch to or to
an i7 system like you guys said we
listen to what you guys say so we
building a system that most of the
mainline game reviews and dumping the
x99 system because let's just face it
x99 motherboard expensive 5960 cpu the
16 gigabytes of Vengeance memory inside
the system still pretty costly the case
everything really about this entire
system is just expensive and
over-the-top but the good thing is it
has no bottlenecks whatsoever and that's
the cool thing about the test system you
English guys might recognize the slogan
a quick in and out so it's kind of how
this video it's going to be a quick
in-and-out of you know what I mean my
because we're just going to jump in
right now let's check out the test
scores so you guys can see the new
testing that we're doing here on Tekken
tomorrow this is our first one so let's
jump in and let's see all the scores
that you've been asking for
you
one thing that was quite surprising is
that the temperatures on these cards
were pretty close the 1070 got a maximum
value of 81 Celsius under full load and
the XFX car was running at 78 Celsius in
our maximum load so they're pretty close
both cards are eight gigabyte cards both
cards have a minimum power supply
requirement of 500 Watts the two
differences is the XFX card has a single
six pen and a single 8 pen and the
founders Edition 1070 has a single a10
power connector now as far as the boost
clocks went on the XFX card we saw a top
boost of 1400 and 5 megahertz and on the
1070 founders Edition at 1500 six art
everybody sold there you have it man the
XFX card versus the powers Edition 1070
now these cards are about 100 dollars
difference in price the RX 580 about
$2.99 at 1070 is about 399 and as far as
those 1% 1% lows you guys can see that
the difference is kind of go back and
forth in some games one card does better
in some games the other car does better
and that's just how it is now the big
difference really however is that you
get about 5 to 15 frames per second
higher with the 1070 but you're going to
pay that extra $100 at the end of the
day you have to think yourself hey is it
really worth it for me do I really need
that much or am I better with the other
car now I think a lot of people out
there right now are really liking the RX
580 with the dryers in everything that's
going on with with AMD right now Andy
seems to be like hitting all the spots
so at the end of the day I have to say
it was me just going out and buying a
card I probably get the rx 580 because
those frames per second really don't
make that much of a difference you know
and in the long run you're playing a
game unless you need so many frames per
second on your screen like I do like
when you're using 144 Hertz monitors and
all its stuff then you might have some
difference between the cards but overall
I think gamers are going to want to pay
the $300 instead of paying $400 you know
to get that better card but I want to
hear what you guys had to say out there
because I know many of my fans are in
vidya fans and other fans that I have
are AMD fan so I really love to hear
your guys's opinion please tell me if
there's anything more that we can do in
the testing to appease you folks and
make the channel more appealing please
let me know because like you I'm a
who's learning and growing all the time
who have more information about both
these cards down below the like button
but hey that's it man 1% point 1%
testing that's the future
we're in thank you very much we'll see
you guys back here in the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
