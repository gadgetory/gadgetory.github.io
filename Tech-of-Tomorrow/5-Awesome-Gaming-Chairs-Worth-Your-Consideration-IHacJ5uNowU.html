guys back here once again on tech of
tomorrow now before I jump into the
video I just want to state something
very clearly the chairs that we're gonna
be looking at today all have the name
gaming attached to them but to be quite
honest with you I don't really think
there's anything that's truly a gaming
chair it's just a name they throw on
things I feel to get a little bit of
extra money you know like gaming snacks
gaming this gaming that we've talked
about this in other videos but in
honesty when somebody says it's a gaming
chair pretty much I think it just means
it's the chair that you're gonna be able
to sit in a long time without being
discomforted and being able to enjoy the
chair while you're gaming now today
we're gonna bring you five different
chairs now they range all the way up
from one hundred and sixty nine dollars
from the one that I'm sitting in now all
the way up to four hundred dollars so
there's a quite a bit of variance in
these different chairs and the things
that really separate these chairs is the
quality of the build how much weight the
chair can it can take in it and things
like that especially like the stitching
the parts that are made in it the more
you go up and the better these chairs
are made the more that you're going to
see the prices increase and some of
these chairs though are actually very
nice and as we jump in and talk about
them I'll tell you why I like the
certain chairs and there's certain
prices so with that said though let's
jump in and let's check out the first
chair that I'm sitting in that's only a
hundred and sixty nine bucks for one
hundred and sixty-nine dollars I have to
say that the Langmuir computer gaming
chair is a pretty good deal it features
a high back design with a well padded
headrest backrest seat and armrests it
also features a pullout and flip-over
footrest and a lumbar cushion now one
thing I do want to mention the footrest
is kind of cool but the caveat that I
have with it is it just doesn't go very
far out honestly my feet kind of dangle
over the edge now if you're a really
short person this wouldn't really matter
but I'm a 235 pounds 6 feet and for me
my feet kind of hang over the edges and
that to me is just a little bit of
something that I wish was better
designed one important aspect about any
chair that I'm sitting in is that the
armrests are very comfortable sometimes
they're like too hard sometimes they are
too soft and sometimes they're just
right in the middle and
perfect and these ones are very very
nice the armrest can also be adjusted up
and down but I wish it could be adjusted
just a little bit higher that would be
best for me but there are two buttons to
do this and it's very easy to do now
another thing about this chair is it'll
support pretty big guys up to 265 pounds
what this chair can handle and you guys
saw in the beginning of the video me and
buddies sitting in the chair all
together that's about 250 pounds of
weight and the chair didn't feel at all
like it was going to fall over or
anything like that the overall build
quality the langree is pretty good
especially for something that's only a
hundred and sixty nine dollars now all
the pseudo leather features a single
stitch design if you don't know what
that means it means that they use a
single stitch to connect all the pieces
together some of the higher-end chairs
feature double stitching and a little
bit better quality stuff now
this chairs made of pseudo leather it's
made of plastic and it's made of metal
now even though it's not the most
totally highest quality that you can get
as far as the build goes it's still very
very nice like I said this chair is
under $200 some of the other chairs are
much more in fact I have some chairs
that are coming in that are gaming
chairs that are actually a thousand
dollars and that's just totally insane
but overall what I feel is the most
important thing of all beyond the design
and all that is the comfort level of the
chair now because of the footrest if you
wanted to use this chair to like kick
back in your living room for like a
lounge chair you could totally do that
or even have it in your back yard and
kick back and firm the barbecue it'll do
all those things just because they say
it's a gaming chair I don't necessarily
think that you would even have to buy it
strictly for gaming because of the
comfort level of the chair even if you
are just working at your desk sitting
typing all day long and doing that kind
of stuff it's pretty comfortable like I
said there are a few cabinets about this
chair that I wish were better first of
all being like I said the footrest I
really wish it would pull out a little
bit more I wish these armrests would
pull up a little bit higher so I could
have my arms a little bit more level
doesn't quite do that perfectly for what
I want to do but sitting in it is very
comfortable I get no discomfort on my
back the lumbar support is actually very
nice some of the parts and the stuff
like it kind of moves around a little
bit like you know I'm talking about like
some chairs and you put them together
they feel completely solid like you
can't move anything I'm on it and
they're very very kind of stiff this
chair isn't very stiff the the arms kind
of move around a little bit loosely and
I mean to me that could be a little bit
better but if you're looking for a chair
that's not going to break the bank is
totally comfort and will still bring you
plenty of hours in front of your
computer gaming without discomfort the
Langham might just be something that you
want to check out I mean you can go to
Office Depot and Costco and you can get
chairs there for around a hundred
dollars now these particular chairs
they're not going to be built very well
you could probably save yourself 69
bucks but the design the implementation
the comfort everything about this chair
I feel for one hundred and sixty-nine
dollars is a great deal now the next
chair in today's lineup it's a very nice
chair it's actually about a hundred and
ten dollars more than the first chair we
looked at coming in to market at about
two hundred and seventy nine dollars but
it can also take people up to three
hundred pounds in the chair and has a
lot of design features which I feel make
it a very quality chair for the price
range first of all all the material in
this particular chair is very nice it
does feature double stitching all the
way around the materials are very soft
and very nice the armrests are
completely adjustable and one thing I
really like about them is that you can
adjust them up to the total height that
I like which means that I'm sitting at
my desk I have my arms on my armrest and
I can type and everything else without
my arms feeling like they're falling off
the side or anything else like that the
ability to recline your chair from
ninety two hundred and thirty five
degrees is pretty nice especially if
you're one of those people who gets lazy
and just wants to put their chair back
and take a quick nap now there's also a
head and lumbar support pillows the
support pillow that goes behind my back
is actually very comfortable so if your
person who suffers from a bad back and
sitting in a chair that doesn't have
that is gonna hurt you well you'll be
very satisfied with this chairs lumbar
support it feels really good on my back
now the head pillow itself I mean I'm
not really too much of into a head
pillow but if I was going to lay back in
my chair and rest it would be something
that's really cool and like I said the
armrests are 3d adjustable arm rests and
they can adjust it pretty much any way
you want them to they move left and
right up and down a lot of flexibility
as far as that goes
the s-300 also features a steel frame a
5-star nylon base the upholstery is made
of cold foam and the cover and the
pillows are all made of fabric which is
really nice and soft to the touch now
the nylon and Paul urethane casters on
this chair are also very nice so if
you're like have thick carpet and you're
trying to move around and slide across
the carpet it'll do that without any
problem I don't know if you guys have
ever got a chair before where you're
trying to scoot forward or whatever and
the chair gets like locked on the ground
you almost go falling on your face you
don't have to worry about that
whatsoever on the s-300 and the comfort
level is very nice I have to say that
for the price on this chair if I wanted
something that was not going to be entry
level but not going to break the bank
the s-300 fits right in that perfect
middle spot
honestly the s-300 even though it's kind
of like right in the middle of the road
as far as pricing goes it does have a
lot of the same features that higher end
chairs have one thing double stitching
we talked about the first journal not
having single stitching well double
stitching actually make sure that all
the material that's sewn together stays
sewn together with single stitching if
you get a rip or a tear obviously
probably that tear and rip is going to
just keep opening up and opening up and
opening up until you have a chair with a
bunch of hanging pieces off it when you
have double stitching it makes the chair
so it's gonna last a lot longer but you
have having two times as much strength
in that makes it so that you're the rips
and chairs that you see in chairs will
not happen for quite a long time and
really as far as comfort goes this chair
is really nice now some of the other
chairs we're gonna take a look at even
though they might have a little bit of
better features and stuff some of them
tend to be a little bit stiff and this
kind of like the three bears is kind of
right in the middle not everybody likes
the exact same color so it's a really
good thing that the s-300 series has a
lot of different choice as far as colors
go so whether you're Nvidia fan and AMD
fan I'm sure there's a color they'll
suit your need okay so next up we have
the anda dark demon series gaming chair
dunt dunt uh yeah dark demon gaming
chair kind of scary right Lou you don't
want to get it for a little kick as they
might freak out and say oh my god I
don't want to sit in that chair it
amen it's a picnic no I'm just joking
around but this chair comes to market at
$399 in fact this chair and the next to
that we're gonna be looking at are all
$399 they're more on the upper echelon
of pricing goes but this chair is very
very well made so you might be thinking
yourself oh my god this chair costs 400
bucks but let's put it this way if you
went to Costco or Home Depot none of
these places out there Office Depot and
you buy an office chair there and you're
only going to want to spend a couple of
hundred bucks those chairs probably
won't really last that long this
particular type of chair and the other
two we're going to look at are going to
last for years and years and years when
we get to the last chair I'll tell you
why I really like the way that these
chairs are now the entity
complete double stitching over
everything all of the backrest and
everything is completely ribbed for
comfort kind of sounds funny right kind
of like a Trojan condom it's ribbed for
comfort good Nell but sorry but it's
very very nice the lumbar support on
this is also very very nice and and the
headrest on most of the chairs I have to
like totally like lean back completely
to get the headrest to work as soon as
you sit in this chair and you settle
back it's very very comforting now
the armrests they're pretty well
adjustable they're a little bit stiff
for my liking I prefer them to a little
bit softer and I really wish that they
went forward more because as they are
right now they don't go very far forward
so if there was gonna be really a caveat
for me it would be that the armrests
should be able to slide a little bit
forward and maybe be a little bit longer
if I was gonna be saying hey I'm trying
to design the perfect chair as far as
the materials used in the dark demon
series the frame construction is made of
nice quality steel now the chair cover
material they call it a PVC plus carbon
look vinyl now I don't know how this is
really going to go over in the summer
time because I haven't sat in the
summertime but it seems like it's
possible that with this type of material
you might get a little bit sweaty I
don't know for sure yet
but just being that it's made of vinyl
vinyl is traditionally known to you know
get you a little bit sweaty now you can
adjust the back angle to 160 degrees it
features a 5 star aluminum base and like
I said earlier all the government
features a double stitch which means
it's not gonna tear up and rip anytime
soon another thing that's really nice
about this chair is if you're a big guy
it'll take up to a three hundred and
thirty pound person so that's pretty
good I mean if you're a big guy you
don't want to sit in a chair and have it
fall over or break on you that could
actually end up injuring you and be
pretty scary so if you're wondering hey
why be able to sit in this thing and
break it well as hey as long as you're
under three hundred and thirty pounds
you should be good to go now the dark
demon it also touts that it has an
adjustable headrest now how really
adjustable this is and I'd have to say
that's kind of you know kind of in your
own opinion it's not really that
adjustable sure you can move it up and
down but it's not really that adjustable
all the recline in Haifa justments of
the dark demon are located in the right
hand side and the controls are very well
made it's not you're gonna go and use
them and they're gonna bend or break off
and that's something that I like in a
chair because when you're doing a lot of
adjustment on a chair you don't want
those parts to fail on you whatsoever
some things however that I think that
you will really like however is that the
metal frame of the chair has a lifetime
warranty so ever in the time that you
own this chair any of the metal piece in
the chair get bent or broken you'll be
able to turn your chair in and get a
brand new one and the standard warranty
just for the outside of the chair is six
years so even though you're gonna be
paying 399 you'll be able to use that
chair with that any worry for six years
and within six years if that chair lasts
that long that is a really good deal
this chair is really really well made
the base is very very solid like the
chair that we talked about before
sliding across carpet and doing stuff
like that is absolutely no problem
there's no unbalancing in the chair so
if you're gonna move forward and move
backwards you're not gonna have any
problems like that
I mean I've honestly had a chair before
that I got where I sat in the chair and
I went to go move forward and I'd
literally almost flipped on my face
because the design of the chair was not
well balanced this chair doesn't suffer
from that whatsoever like I said before
though the only thing about this chair
that I'm really not completely thrilled
about is the armrests I wish they were a
little longer and a little bit more
adjustable but beyond that for a price
tag of 399
with a six year warranty and all the
external and the metal parts being a
lifetime warranty that's really hard to
beat okay next up we have the Corsair t2
road warrior t2 Road wear so are we
doing Terminator or are we doing road
war I have to say the naming convention
on this chair is pretty crazy now this
particular chair I have to say I've been
using for the last few months at my desk
so where I'm actually sitting is where
this chair usually is and this chair is
actually very nice now throughout the
entire chair is a steel skeleton this
helps to reinforce the chair and make
sure that's gonna have a solid solid
lifespan and not break on you and
another thing about this particular
chair is that this chair is actually
covered in real leather that's right
real leather not pseudo leather nothing
else they call it a PVC type leather but
it's very very nice to the touch and
when I'm sitting it I don't find that
I'm sweating in it or feeling cold it
pretty much just matches my body
temperature
it also features complete double
stitched design a 5 star base I mean
this chair honestly is one of the most
comfortable chairs that I've ever sit in
and something a little bit different
about the road warrior is the adjustable
armrest and all the other chairs that we
looked at they all said they had a 3d
design well this one has a 4d design up
down left right front back and swivel
one thing that you'll also notice that
the armrests looked more like carbon
fiber than any other chair that we're
going to look at today but just like the
other chair the answer that we saw
before it I honestly wish that the
armrests went a little bit more forward
than they do because as it is even
though it's pretty comfortable for me my
elbows are really right on the edge so
if I really want to chill out and like
lay my arms down I'd have to sit
completely back in the chair to do that
and that's something that I kind of find
to be a caveat in a lot of the chairs in
the market period so it's not just a
fault of course there it's pretty much a
fault of almost all the chairs out there
I rarely see a chair where I get the
armrest and I'm like oh my god this is
absolutely perfect for me I mean it
works well and all but in my particular
taste like I said before I really wish
that I'd be able to move them forward
just a little bit another thing that I
really find nice about the Corsair road
warrior are the lumbar pillow and the
neck
pelo you don't get any kind of vinyl or
leather or anything like that
in fact the pillows themselves are kind
of like a plush pillow they're very soft
and nice to the touch and they offer
superior comfort especially if you're
sitting in your chair for long hours of
time another thing very similar to the
and a chair is that all the adjustments
for doing your recline and all that are
all located on the right hand side and
they're very easy to access
now you can recline this chair from
ninety to 170 degrees and it can take up
to a 300-pound person in the chair
without having any kind of problems
whatsoever
one thing that I really have to mention
this probably speaks volumes is you guys
can see I have a lot of gaming chairs
floating around inside of my house which
means that I could choose any one of
these chairs to sit in all day long and
the fact that I chose the t2 road
warrior to be my personal chair that to
me says quite a bit and out of all these
chairs that were looking at today I have
to say that this is my favorite now the
next chair we're gonna be looking at is
a vertigo chair it has some really nice
things and is very very close but just
at the end of the day when it came
between you know Jesus using this chair
or Jesus using the other chair we looked
at the two chairs and this one ended up
being the one that I chose to use just
because of all the overall features it's
not too stiff it's not too you know
flimsy to me it's very very much right
in the middle of the road I sit in this
chair for hours and hours and hours all
day long every day looking at the
internet doing my videos and just you
know generally just sitting in the thing
doing my stuff at my computer and I
never have any discomfort whatsoever the
lumbar support is very very nice it
doesn't protrude you know too much in
your back where you feel like you're
sitting your chair you know somebody's
pushing you forward and the headrest
also you can sit back in it and it's
very very comfortable and the fact that
it's made of this is a really really
duper SuperDuper soft material can I
tear this thing up here probably not but
but the fact that this is really really
SuperDuper soft and plushy it's really
really nice to feel so looks like if you
were sitting in your chair without your
shirt on or whatever you'd really notice
that comfort level and Plus let's just
face it
leather breeze we all know that vinyl
polyurethane PU leather all that kind of
different kind of stuff it honestly
creates sweat and discomfort that's just
how I feel and leather
doesn't do this I mean there's a reason
why leather couches cost a friggin
fortune now the only caveat about this
chair be to about this other than the
armrest is this chair only has a two
year warranty but with all the double
stitching of the material and all that
stuff I'm sure it's going to last much
longer than two years but I guess they
just wanted to keep everything within
the safe zone because everything about
this chair from its steel frame from its
design to the leather to the double
stitching everything about this chair
just totally speaks hey I'm a quality
chair now like I said before the word
gaming is just pretty much you know a
catchphrase
but this chair for me is a chair that's
just overall great for sitting at your
desk and working at for long hours of
time okay now last but not least is the
Vertigo PL 6000 series gaming chair and
I have to say that of all the chairs
that we've looked at today no offense to
Coursera or anything but this chair is
absolutely the best made out of them all
not only does it have double stitching
it has triple stitching in some areas
it also features complete leather but
you're sitting in so it's very very
comfortable once again we have those 4d
adjustable armrests they go up down left
and right however you want them to go
and one thing that's cool about the
recline this is it'll go completely flat
which means completely vertical and the
chair doesn't fall over whatsoever and
if you're a big guy this is definitely
the chair that you want to be taking a
look at and I'm dead serious about this
this chair will take up to a 440 pound
person the actual base that you sit in
and everything like the area inside of
here is much wider than all the rest of
the chairs so if you're a big guy and
you're heavy and you know you have a
little bit of girth you'll be able to
sit down right in this chair and you
won't have any discomfort whatsoever now
Jesus our cameraman he's kind of a big
guy and he tends to go through chairs
pretty quickly we got this chair about
six months ago and there's virtually no
damage to it whatsoever it looks just
like brand-new like the day that we got
it now the last sure I got him
admittedly it was only a hundred dollar
job or that I got from Costco but he
literally went through that chair in a
cup
of months all of the material started
ripping up all the armrests all the
material on it was completely ripped up
within six months time that chair was a
complete piece of this chair
whoever even after six months looks
brand new like the day that we got it
now like all the other chairs that we've
looked at today this chair does feature
a solid steel frame throughout the
entire design and the base on this chair
and honestly the wheels I feel are truly
exceptional they run across the carpet
the floor ain't niche you want to do
with complete comfort and ease and
they're so well made that don't think
you have to ever worry about this chair
breaking on you honestly so if you're a
big guy out there and you're looking for
a chair that you know you're gonna be
able to sit in comfortably and it's not
gonna break apart on you this is
definitely the chair you want to be
looking at plus the fact that it's made
of complete leather is very very nice I
know some people you know will want to
pay less money and get that leather
stuff but let me excuse me get that
pseudo leather stuff but this PBC
leather is very very nice I don't sweat
in it I don't get hot in it and it's
honestly for me a preferable material
some other nice things about this chair
is the lumbar support is very very nice
it's SuperDuper solid on your back so if
you're a person who suffered some kind
of back problems and a lot of chairs
make you uncomfortable you won't have to
worry about that whatsoever with the pl
6000 it's really made for comfort and
the headrest is also very nice like I
said a lot of the chairs you got a
complete legs you know sink yourself
back into the chair for the headrest to
work this isn't like that whatsoever
even when you're just casually sitting
in the chair the headrest is right back
there and you can adjust it down a
little bit more if you want to so you
have even more comfort just depending on
what your comfort style is now like all
the other chairs that we saw these top
pins when this chair is also $399 but
the one thing I just really want to
stress overall is that of all these
chairs if you're a really big guy you're
definitely going to want to look at the
pl 6,000 to me it's the absolute best
chair for any big guy out there and the
fact that you can recline the chair
completely to a vertical angle and fall
asleep in it with Abner
falling over on your ass and cracking
your skull open is a thumbs up around
here Jesus really loves this chair I'm
sure that if he wasn't working here he'd
want to stick it on his back and take it
home with him because he likes it that
much and that says a lot because most of
their chairs in the past he's got him
and just been like yeah but this morning
when I said hey before we do this video
man what do you really think about this
chair and he got a big ol shit-eating
grin said man I love this chair and that
really just to me says a lot because
like I said he's gone through chairs you
know really quickly
and after six months you guys can see
this chair still totally looks brand new
so the Vertigo repeal 6,000 it features
a great design great comfort can take
big people in without any problem having
this extra width like inside your
sitting area is also very important and
please don't take this offense anybody
out there but if you're a guy who has a
thyroid problem whatever you've got like
a really big gut and stuff you really
don't want your gut and stuff hanging
over being pushed in on the sides making
you feel like you're being squished in
like a can of sardines and with this
chair you don't have to worry about that
whatsoever so for big guys honestly take
a look at this chair now like usual all
