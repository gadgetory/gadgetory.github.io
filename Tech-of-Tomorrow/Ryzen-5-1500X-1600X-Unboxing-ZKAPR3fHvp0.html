folks and I know while you AMD fans have
been eagerly awaiting the rise in five
so check it out I've got an unboxing of
the 1500 X and the 1600 X right here on
tech of tomorrow so let's jump right in
and let's check out those CPUs and a
Wraith cooler let's go alright man so
let's check it out now this is AMD's
risen 5 this is the 6 core version the
1600 X I'll go ahead up here and just a
cut the little top up here a little
trusty screwdriver we will pop the cap
on that baby will open it up you guys
can see all inside there not too much
actually inside this particular box
because the CPU and the rate is separate
but you do get the installation
instructions and all that stuff that's
all in there you know how to install and
everything so those people who have
never done it before and then after that
you pop it out of here looks like that
took the is to see to itself now real
quick post you guys want to see in the
back this is a sample CPU from AMD a and
B risen 5 1600 X and it's a sample it
says right there
and then here itself is the CPU I'll go
ahead and pull out of the box as well
and check it out up close and personal
let's go ahead and do that check it out
let me pop the cap here again pop the
cap in this little thing right there and
then
ba-ba-boom so we have Google sticker
stickers on the top they're not gonna
really to worry about too much about
that you guys want to see a close-up of
it you spin it around there you have a
little risin 5 and I know I keep going
between rising arisen I'm sorry man
I'm more trying to concentrate in the
video I mean no offense to anybody
obviously it is risin and here is the
CPU itself in all of its glory getting
ready to get stuck in one a mom with a
frakkin motherboards so we'll do two
builds you know with the higher-end
chipset and this chipset just be in all
fairness so there we go to 1600 X let me
just pop that out of the way real quick
folks and to cool this bad boy obviously
we have the rate cooler
Tapan that Papa being a baboon you guys
can see pretty doggone durable cooler
here already has all of your insulation
right there on to you and then you worry
about thermal paste it's all there
got your plugins and everything very
very nice cooler these work actually
quite well and I think that people who
know about them know that they like them
as well
so let's just pop that out of the way
that's for all stuff to the 1600 and now
we have the 1500 so we'll start out here
we'll show you guys the box now this
particular one actually has the rate
cooler in the box itself so you're
actually two different SKUs on the
market you guys can see the CPU in the
box and then once again we have the AMD
risin 5 1500 X and it's once again like
I said a review sample so once again go
ahead and just cut this right here you
to damage the Box in and it's time to
get it out of there all right there we
go
go ahead and pop the cap on that bad boy
like I said this particular version
already comes with the Wraith cool in
the box so you have to worry about that
so let's go ahead and take that rate
cooler out we don't need to unbox that
again you guys already saw it once don't
need to see it twice then we've got once
again the installation manual and then
the last but not least the CPU itself
and so once again we have the CPU in its
packaging their little license sticker
there rise in five so let me go ahead
and pop the cap on that as well pull
that bad boy out here's the packaging of
it run them back once again pop another
little thing here lots of plastic lots
of popping today right alright and there
you have it folks
Rison 5 1500 X alright folks so there
you have it the unboxing of both the
1500 X and the 1600 X 10 these things
are coming around the corner I can't
release any more specs or any kind of
information I'll be breaking NDA but I
