Elric here in the TECA tomorrow YouTube
channel we bring you all the tech all
the time now when I was at CES
you guys saw we brought you a product
from Swift tech that was their new h2 20
now today we're gonna look at another
one of their kits this is their H 2 O 3
2011 is it safe is it dangerous nowadays
it's totally safe these kits are geared
to be very easily used filled taken
apart reused they're just made that way
if you're somebody who's pretty handy
with their hand and stuff you can
definitely tackle water cooling your
system now Swift tech products are known
to be very quiet and very very efficient
this particular can I'm looking at today
it's a triple rad system made to cool
off multiple parts so this system can be
used to cool your GPU your CPU and
whatever now only the CPU block comes in
this kit but with the comodo and other
components from Swift tech you can
completely cool all the parts that are
inside of your system so with that said
let's jump in and let's check out what
comes in this box from Swift Tekken all
right folks now in the Swift tech box
it's pretty simple they don't waste
money giving you fancy boxes they pass
on the savings by not wasting that kind
of money so here you guys can see all
the information all have the camera just
lock down on there now actually Karen me
just pointed out to me and I guess I'm
holding you guys up the non-english
version so for you guys out there who
don't speak English here you guys check
this out this is for you
rock on we support the world man taking
them all as a worldly company spin it
around here goes the one that I believe
is in English so once again we'll hold
this here so you guys can see that
everything that comes in the box in
English that's right that's right
hmm sorry we're gonna drop it down now
get out the old trusty this is the old
army knife get that thing up there nice
easy click of the blade couple of
insertions don't try this at home
I am a doctor so there we go
set that down little pin it up so the
kits all inside of here that's all nice
and well packed let's start dissecting
it and start off with this by throwing
at the cameramen and then ride out the
bat on top we have the instruction guide
so we work really closely with these
guys Brian Ramirez actually one of the
guys that we used to have working here
he's gone back and forth before with mr.
Gabe you know the company and they've
made their manuals very very well
written these things have really been
taken apart by enthusiasts and then
taking a consideration by the team over
to Swift tech and written so that you
guys can completely understand what's
going on like you know how you looking
man you go oh what the what didn't
even tell me what do I do with that
you're not gonna have any of those kind
of problems with this everything is
completely detailed out all the way even
different types of things on
installation and everything else now a
triple rad isn't going to fit on the top
of most cases internally it's just too
big but I'm not gonna go on and on about
this but basically these instructions
are very well written you'll be able to
understand them and do them so right to
bat this is a nice brand new product
from Swift tech it's their PWM
controller so basically you can plug all
of your fans into this then plug this in
and control all of the fans in the
system from just off of this thing so
it's pretty excellent it works in
conjunction with you know onboard
controllers as well so nice stuff get to
things of fluid Hydra xpm Hydra xpm
don't drink this stuff it won't taste
good and you probably won't feel good so
get that out of the way
here we see the tubing so you'd fill
that up it'll become the color of that
or you can use other stuff actually
Swift tech tells me they're going to
sell a bunch of new cables and all kinds
of new stuff in this coming year in 2013
so put the down here we have the funnel
you're gonna need this when you fill up
the reservoir and everything set that
down
alright next up we have the fill port
hardware so we're gonna drill your hole
or whatever and then put this in that'll
be your fill port alternate bracket
mount pack so they give you all kinds of
alternating things on mounting it allen
wrench wonder why they call them allen
wrench not a bob or a Pete or you know a
Joseph or or Jesus wrench I mean what
you know why Allen who is mr. Allen
anyway I don't know who that guy is
alright now we're gonna come to the
really cool parts all right da the
apogee drive - you guys have seen this
around this is the very famous product
and you ready to pop the cap right here
just the box back actually this a little
bit out of the way we're gonna set this
down so even the apogee drive - it has
all of its own instruction guide and
everything in here how to mountain after
everything else you will be actually
seriously frakkin amazed at how easy
this installs like I really think that
air coolers as far as just installing
this particular part are way more of a
pain in the ass and this is just a cheap
little pop kind this thing's really easy
to use and pop it out see the little
backplate right there
boy just pull stuff that there's a lot
of accessories in here too so I'll show
you all these this could be a you know a
whole unboxing video on itself you've
got various different back plates the
mounting tension screws you can see the
spring in there they mount give you the
tension that actually keeps you know the
thing pressured up against your block
different colored things right here now
people a lot of times like oh what the
heck are those things and at first you
know what I didn't even know was in a
friend of mine Shannon Robb he modified
out the system so let me go ahead and
take this thing out of here so here is
the apogee drive to check it out now
right here you can see this is red but
there's four little screws around here
you remove those four of those screws
and pop this off you can put either the
green went in or the blue one in to
custom match your system so that's
pretty cool stuff you also do get the
obviously the thermal compound so your
mounting right there here's the bottom
solid copper base I'm not gonna remove
it you guys can see what it is I don't
want to get oxidized the connectors PWM
molex so let me just go ahead and set
that off on the side as we go to the
last piece of equipment in the box box
out here this is with our fans check
this out will all of our nice white
Swift Tech fans it's kind of in the
color scheme of Swift Eggers between the
standard black and white design which
really kind of goes with everything but
you see you get the three fans no no no
they're the actual rat itself and they
move the rat out also all the mounting
screws by the way ching ching ching
ching ching and then here we go
here is the rad now right here on the
end they have a lot more room in here
for liquid this helps eliminate the air
bubbles now on some things you might
have to mount it this way on others
you'll have to mount it this way the
optimal way if you come out it will be
either this way or like this onto a back
of a case if you do it that way you'll
have a lot less time between have to
fill the unit up so here's the front of
it parts here you can see all the holes
right here for mounting all the fins
inside now Swift tech also has a custom
way that they make their radiators the
way that the connectivity is in the way
that it is made makes it so it has a
much better flow for all the liquid
meaning much better cooling results so
flip it around here's the backside
here's where you're going to fill it
you'll be removing this off right here
and then filling the unit and so that's
it this unit is completely totally
flexible so there you guys have it the
Swift tech h2o 3 2011
dust your CPU this thing is totally good
to go but like I said if you want to
cool your GPU as well you can get all
kinds of parts out there either
aftermarket or from Swift tech
themselves and build yourself a totally
custom water-cooled system that cools
everything and with this triple rad and
the apogee drive - you'll be totally
solid good to go it'll be silent you
will be satisfied so with that said I
hope you guys like this video if so show
me the love by hitting that like button
me and the people give you the products
really appreciate that it shows your
guys's interests in the product and
makes it so they're more willing to give
more stuff so you guys can see it so
