hey guys doing welcome back once again
to the tech of tomorrow YouTube channel
bringing you tomorrow's technology today
so you guys have seen it when I shoot he
gets a video of my lab it was kind of
dirty the first time around we've
cleaned it up but we also to make some
changes due to the fact that all these
new cards are come at are so freakin
powerful they need high resolution
monitors so you guys have seen on my
over motherboards our channel I've used
a 30 inch monitor a lot well start
looking around for another monitor that
was a little bit more affordable because
that monitor actually put me back
sixteen hundred dollars to buy that now
I still wanted to monitor that 2560 but
I couldn't find one for anywhere near
the same price range as that so I went
for looking for lower ones found one
this is a 27 inch IPS backlit monitor
from the people over at HP basically
this is a totally new school 27-inch
monitor has all the latest ports
everything including display and all
that 2560 by 1440 resolution got it for
under seven hundred bucks
pro-style at least I'm thinking so there
anyways I got my knife right here I'm
gonna take the knife flip the thing
aside here a couple insertions don't try
this at home like I said before I am a
doctor open it up you guys see how it
comes packed it's like a monster yeah
yeah CHP monster it's like the Loch Ness
only in a box
so actually it allowed damage there but
right came right the camera - that
probably came out good all right take
this little sound to fix here whoa
alrighty then let's go ahead let's see
her I don't know if you guys can see
this point like that well all right
there a little secondary angling there
you guys can see you start off we got
the panel obviously right here on this
plastic stuff here I'll get back to this
but right down to the unboxing so on so
it comes in the box so I'll just set
this off to the side over here one more
layer of foam here go ahead and take
that we have the stand for the plastic
bag there we go
nice little stand for the monitor there
okay you see the bottom I'll actually
set this thing up for you guys and show
you in the video
that'd be crazy not to so go ahead move
out of the way see what else comes
inside the box there are different
options also you can get with this folks
you can actually get a speaker bar that
mounts on the bottom of this I'm
actually thinking about getting it
because it would save ergonomically on
my desk a night out some speakers most
wasn't headphones we would work to
actually show all those different
options back here in the back dry our
CDs inside of here go back yeah yeah
power cable gives me the power let's see
here here we have the DVI cable and see
that you guys know what that is we have
a USB cable we also have neighbors
walking by with their whining crying
children so shut up and then last but
not least the last cable that comes in
here and I'm actually thinking this is
going to be pretty cool I think these
guys actually gave me a display port
cable oh hey yeah yeah yep
now this is the first monitor that I
personally have ever purchased that came
with its own DisplayPort cable so I'm
trying to get this out a little rap here
so check this out folks comes the
DisplayPort cable rock and roll
and let's show you guys the panel
and pull this thing out show you guys
the back of the panel now I'm just going
to go ahead and set this thing down real
quick takes a very long time to assemble
very pain-in-the-ass you guys saw that
how hard that was very hard I'm gonna
complain right now to HB no honestly I
was like the easiest thing in the world
the monkey could have done it alright
folks let's check it out let me go ahead
and take these little side little flip
ease off here sorry stickies I'm trying
to damage my monitor all right folks now
that we got the monitor out of the box
let's just take a look at this thing you
can see 27 inches IPS technology bottle
number over here so here's the model
number right here it's the HP Zr - 7 4 o
W that's the model number over here we
have the main display all the menu keys
are on here those will all be nice to
operate to monitor this side over here
we have nothing at all on it there are
no connectors on this side you can see
there's a nice bezel all the way around
the entire monitor it's a very nice and
elegant looking the stand functions
aren't all that much you have to let
this much movability on it and here on
the side of the monitor we have two USB
ports and I'm gonna flip the monitor
again onto its back you guys can see
right here here's the power on button
where you turn it on here's the power
cable comes in as you move across over
here you can see all the various
different connections and so that's
pretty much it folks I mean I got this
monitor for the test station I can't
wait to see how it looks this is a new
awesome 27 inch IPS monitor backlit
great resolution I can't wait to see how
the actual the damn thing looks in the
lab thanks for watching the unboxing and
first look here at tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
