back here once again on the channel
spent a few days I had a slight heart
attack needed some days off but now we
were back with more goodness on the
channel so check it out a lot of people
like gaming laptops because they can
take them on the road pretty much take
them wherever they go and do their
gaming but are they worth the money at
the end of the day well today we're
gonna be checking out a really nice home
from the people over at MSI now this is
the GT 73 VR Titan pro laptop and
believe me this thing has a lot of
features under the hood so let's jump
right in let's check out everything it's
cool about this laptop all its
performance scores and at the end of the
day why you'd want to purchase it but
before we do that let's real quick
hear a word from our sponsor of Corsair
if you're looking to add some color to
your system look no further of course
there has your answer with their LL
series RGB LED case fans with 16
independent RGB LEDs in every fan
customization is practically endless the
LL series fans are also engineered for
low noise operation all without
sacrificing performance and with the PWM
control these fans can be set anywhere
from 600 to 1500 rpms for precise noise
and airflow adjustments so if you want
to trick out your system with color
check out the Corsair ll series RGB LED
case fans today starting off one thing I
want to mention we're off the bat is
this laptop weighs almost 9 pounds and
it's actually quite heavy it feels
actually heavier than 9 pounds now
aesthetically it features their dragon
logo and the red and black colors
they've been using all along which
actually a lot of people you use the
same color signature you know that a zoo
says you know this a lot of people use
this color scheme and it seems to be
very popular now the first thing that
you're going to notice when you open up
the laptop is the very top of the screen
there is a camera so this way you can
talk to all your friends and communicate
when you're gaming and doing all that
stuff if you want to the screen itself
is a 17 inch screen it also features a
hundred and 20 Hertz of a refresh rate
so that's really good and also features
G sync technology so not to worry about
any screen rips any screen tearing at
all while you're playing your games the
monitor also has a native resolution of
4k but you can play games at 1080p if
you want to
well the screen itself is actually very
nice it has a nice variation of your
colors in your spectrum to black
everything looks very very nice plus
with the G sync technology like I said a
minute ago you can be able to play your
games and none of your games are going
to be stressing your eyesight out which
means you can play your games for hours
and hours on end before I go in oh my
god I got a headache and along with
g-sync you also get a 5 millisecond
refresh rate with the monitor and it
actually looks really really nice and
it's one of the better features of the
laptop now as we move down the laptop
you guys can see it's got a nice
standard keyboard everything lights up
on an RGB so if you know those people
who likes RGB you can have a
multicolored if you only want to have it
one solid color you can do that as well
and the keyboard itself is responsive it
doesn't offer any problems one thing
also of note the keyboard itself is
actually made by steel series so if you
had a steelseries keyboard in the past
and you liked the way it felt
you'll probably like this keypad as well
but as we move down on the laptop I just
have to say the touchpad is one of the V
worst I've ever used testing this laptop
I honestly got to tell you was a real
pain and my arse a lot of times it would
just lock up wouldn't move the screen
whatsoever honestly I had a real
headache with this touchpad one of the
definite things about this laptop that I
do not like at all taking a look to the
right of the keyboard on the very top is
the power button and right below that is
a button they call the graphics button
now this allows you to switch between
the graphics on your CPU or your
discrete GPU graphics on your laptop
down below that we see the cooler boost
button what this does is basically just
increase the speed of your fans keeping
your laptop cooler the last two buttons
are the xsplit gamecaster and below that
is the SSE button and what this actually
does is it changes the laptop to all
kinds of different color features on the
RGB on the right-hand side of the GT 73
we see two USB 3.0 ports and then right
next to that we see an SD card reader up
above that you guys can see there slips
in the laptop this is one of the designs
as a laptop to help alleviate all the
heat that's inside of it it actually
dissipates that out those holes keeping
your laptop running cool and last but
not least at the very top there's a
Kensington lock just like most laptops
and on the back behind the screen we see
the LAN port display port USB type-c
HDMI and the power connection
and to both sides in the back you can
also see additional heat fins to help
dissipate that heat away from the laptop
and on the left-hand side we see
additional cooling fans three USB 3.0
ports and then last but not least the
audio ports checking out the bottom of
the laptop you guys can see that it has
a really nice design and plenty of room
for airflow airflow is very important in
a laptop because you know everything's
stuck inside that small frame so the
best heat dissipation you can get with
nice fans and ways to get that heat away
from the laptop make it run really nice
and this laptop really never got that
hot even when we were gaming on it I've
had some that actually burnt my arms so
so far it looks good right but now let's
look under the hood and talk about some
of the more specified features about
this little machine the power behind the
GT 73 VR Titan Pro is an Intel Core i7
68 20 HK CPU at 2.7 gigahertz now one
thing I really do like about this
particular model as it ships with 64
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and the video
card is a full eight gigabyte that's
right a full eight gigabyte 1080 GTX
card from Nvidia I'm not talking about
the Mobile Edition this is the
full-blown video card just like you get
on your desktop there is also plenty of
room for all your games in this
particular model because it comes with a
two terabyte hybrid drive that's quite a
lot of space and if you don't know what
a hybrid Drive is its part SSD part hard
drive and is really really fast let's
just face it two terabytes will store a
lot of games also if for some reason 2
terabytes of storage just isn't enough
for you or you want the most incredibly
fast boot drive you can ever get this
particular model features super raid 4
technology and what this allows you to
do is it allows you to take two m2 SATA
drives put them in raid zero for the
most ultimate fast drive you can ever
get on your laptop audio I know is
something that's very subjective and
when we come to think of audio on a
laptop we usually think of the audio is
being crappy and that's due to the
speaker so let's just face it you're on
a laptop how much speaker room do you
actually have but the audio in this
particular unit is very nice especially
if you're gonna be listening to
headphones they use their own ESS sob
raid DAC now this is totally lossless
audio which means that you're gonna be
your audio without any kind of noise any
kind of background stuff and it's gonna
be pure nice clean audio the onboard
Sabri audio deck is very nice
it supports 24 bit 192 kilohertz
sampling rates and drives high quality
headsets from 16 ohms all the way up to
600 ohms this also gives the highest
sound detail and up to 122 decibels when
we're playing games the environment that
were ending the sound that we hear
actually helped us play the game why
because we can hear people coming up
behind us and all that kind of stuff now
there's a technology underneath the hood
here called majimak - and this is
basically a program which allows you to
do positional 3d sound on the laptop and
it allows you to do it in a virtual 7.1
environment the speakers inside this
model are also very high quality they're
made by a danish company called Dynaudio
now this company specializes in high-end
speakers that get featured in German
cars so you know if they're being in
German cars they're very nice speakers
they also feature a 50% boost in the
power which allows you to get 10 more
decibels of audio without any distortion
whatsoever so pretty much this
technology not only makes everything
sound good the speakers are tuned to
actually sound good in the environment
that they're in which means they're
actually made to be inside this laptop
they're not not you know meant to be in
a desktop speaker or anything else
they're built exactly to design
specifications of what you see right
here one thing that's very unique to MSI
laptops is the dragon centre from the
dragon center you can do a lot of
different things you can change all the
lights you can control your overclocking
pretty much if there's anything you want
to do you'll be able to do it from the
dragon center it's a pretty cool thing
and if you buy the laptop and start
playing around that I think you'll find
it pretty ergonomic and easy to use as
well one thing I want to mention before
we jump into the benchmarks is that the
LAN port on this is actually a killer
land so if you guys know about the
particular product it's really
specifically made for doing gaming but I
think that most folks who buy this are
probably going to be using the Wi-Fi
features more for gaming than the LAN
port with that said however let's now
check out those benchmark scores
all right folks so there you have it a
lot of features under the hood of this
laptop I mean let's face it there's
everything but the kitchen sink
inside of this thing there are however a
few cabinets about this laptop that I
absolutely totally hate the first one
like I said huh the touchpad is a total
nightmare I can't stand it whatsoever
it's the way that it moves and
everything
it drives me absolutely nuts another
thing about this laptop that really was
frustrating is that it actually just
froze up and shut down many times during
testing so I don't really know what the
hell is up with that particular thing
but it really sucks me playing your game
and have it drop out you either got to
start all over again you're miss what
you're doing with your friends I totally
hate that now as far as the performance
scores go though you guys can see this
thing's kicking ass even in 4k most of
the games are over 60 frames per second
and it's doing that pretty easily and in
1080 obviously it's the eating through
those games like hot knife through
butter now the last caveat about this
laptop and this is just insane is this
particular model is about $3500 that's
right
don't throw shit at me but that's right
it is $3,500 me personally I cannot
honestly recommend this laptop to you I
wouldn't go out and purchase this laptop
whatsoever um one of the main reasons
that we actually took a look at this
particular laptop is we're actually
working with Linksys and they gave us
one of their brand new wor t gaming
routers and we're gonna be using this in
combination with that so that's kind of
how we got our hands on it but for me
personally I couldn't recommend that you
go out and buy this particular laptop
for that amount of money I've used some
other ones from a Zeus and they were
actually a lot more stable in this
particular beast the features are nice
the screen is nice the keyboards nice
audio totally kicks ass but stability
and that Rutan touchpad plus the price
at the end of the day just totally ruin
it for me so like usual let me hear what
you guys think I'll have more
information down below so if you want to
see more about this laptop or for some
reason you think it's for you hey you
can purchase one I Mellaart you've been
watching Tekken tomorrow I'm glad to be
back and we'll see you guys back in the
channel for more tech
