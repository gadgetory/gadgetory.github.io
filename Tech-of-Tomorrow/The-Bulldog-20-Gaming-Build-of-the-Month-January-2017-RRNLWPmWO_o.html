and buddy the dog back here once again
on Tekken tomorrow now if you guys
follow the channel you guys know that
last week we did the unboxing we showed
you all the parts that we were going to
use in the Bulldog 2.0 build want to say
a small correction I thought the
motherboard inside of it was in a Zeus
board but I was wrong it actually was an
MSI board so you guys were correct I was
wrong so bad our but anyways we've put
things together ran the test and it's
pretty good now honestly all the parts
using this build are actually pretty
expensive like this build like between
1518 or bucks it's quite a bit of money
because just getting the basic systems
almost poner dollar but you know for a
bare-bones system it comes with a lot of
nice parts so if you guys want to still
check out that video though you guys can
check out this little thing right here
beside me there'll be a link down below
as well if you guys can check out that
unboxing video and see all the parts
that came in the build today we're just
going to show you guys to build getting
built and then what it tested at at the
end of the day which you guys think what
I guys think of the system and see if
we're on the same page so let's jump in
and let's see Anthony rails once again
put together the bulldog 2 point
see you guys can see this bill did not
take Anthony very long at all the only
thing at all that I thought was a little
bit odd and he agree was that the video
card was a little bit difficult to put
him you guys actually made a lot of
comments before since you guys thought
that there was no way in hell but that
video car was going to fit in there well
check it out you're proven wrong because
the card actually does go in it was a
bit tricky though because the way that
we saw the designs in the waiting for
the system together it didn't even seem
like it was going to work whatsoever but
after a few fumblings around a few
things moved around we would look at the
video card in there no problem the rest
of parts were very simply put in the CP
was easily matted putting at the liquid
cooler that's no problem since the video
car was an AI l-sit that's a snap as
well the only thing really difficult
like I said was trying to get the video
card in its place beyond that putting
together everything in the bulldog 2.0
pretty doggone system I think any of you
guys at home could do this now it's
cable management all that particularly
great well for one thing you're not
going to be looking into this thing so
cable management other than keeping it
out of the way of airflow it's not going
to really matter obviously you don't
want to be a big mess but we never do
anything like that but having it look
all super professional inside the
bulldog 2.0 really is going to do you
too much because well nobody's going to
see it let you run with the top down
like it's a v8 engine and
you
you
so after the system was built we
installed the latest version of Windows
10 and you got to make sure that you
install the latest patch near in Windows
10 especially running video cards
otherwise it's going to give you this
driver message it says hey this is not
the right driver for your card so if you
come across that at all you know you
just need to do the upgrade to Windows
10 we use the latest Nvidia drivers the
latest patches the latest everything in
this list and we get our hands on so
what that said though let's rock out to
the benchmark let's check out the system
and then let's talk about something else
before we bounce out so let's go time to
rock
okay you guys can see this is some
scores pretty damn well it plays a lot
of games at 14:40 and for k at awesome
speeds now you guys can see the CPU was
running a little bit hot I have to admit
that I would've thought with the AIO
liquid cooler been doing a little bit
better but since it's actually inside
the system it's not a whole hell of a
lot of airflow that's why it's running a
little bit hot GPU however ran
absolutely cool so that's that's cool
right and you should put on words but
hey it is now another thing you guys
have asked for is boot times now for me
the boot time comes after all the
electronics in the system have already
booted ups and from that point forward
that's the recorded time so we did it
two different ways once which is
standard settings in the BIOS and then
once again with the MSI now the same
aside boots program you probably save
about a second so if a second is really
important to you make sure you guys
engage that
all right so you guys can see the system
actually boots pretty damn fast
regardless whether using the msi boost
or not it still goes nice and fast like
I said before the only cavities of the
system that I feel are it is a bit
pricey obviously the CPU is running a
little bit hotter than I expected GPU
running great scores of great price
expenses so overall I think it's a
pretty nice thing a lot of you people
out there who want to build your own can
use whatever parts you want to use and
you can cut the price on those parts all
the way down to the bare minimum
depending up what you want to do now
like usual download like button which
hopefully will go Chuck Norris style
onto this video appreciate that is more
information so if you want to find out
about buying these parts we're just
getting more information about all these
parts you can see that down below that
like button so I'm Eric buddy the dog
mr. G beyond the camera we love you and
we'll see you back here for more tech on
teka tomorrow I'm going to Disneyland</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
