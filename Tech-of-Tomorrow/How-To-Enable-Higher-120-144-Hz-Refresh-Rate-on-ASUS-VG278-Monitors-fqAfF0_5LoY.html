techo tomorrow I'm Eric Faris we have a
very very special guest here today we
have JJ from a Zeus and we're going to
feature one of their latest monitors
that's right this is their 144 Hertz
27-inch monitor and I know that's very
very hard to actually show you guys a
lot of stuff through a YouTube video but
we're going to probably show you some
features that you didn't know that you
could take advantage of with having
those great refresh rates so I'm going
to have the floor to JJ and he's going
to show you this great view monitor ok
guys like doc was talking about here
we've got our brand new VG 2 7 8 monitor
and one of the biggest things we've
actually found out with our previous
generation 3d vision monitors is that
some users aren't actually enabling the
higher refresh rate because it's not
automatically enabled so two things but
before we actually show you how to do
this on the desktop is one you want to
make sure that of course you have a
graphics card that supports this so
that's going to be GTX 460 above and
make sure you get the latest version of
the GeForce driver from there we're just
going to go ahead and right click on the
desktop and you have two options either
screen resolution or Nvidia control
panel we're going to go through screen
resolution once you're there you just
need to go ahead and click on the
Advanced Settings tab and from there
head over to the monitor tab once you
get over to the monitor tab you're going
to see that you have an option says
screen refresh rate okay and right now
we're at 60 Hertz and so all we need to
do is go ahead and select 120 Hertz if
maybe you're using a one-hour first or
second generation 3d vision panels if
you have this one actually the VG 2 7 8
then you can go ahead and select the 140
40 Hertz it'll take a moment to go ahead
and send over that information and from
there now we're set it we've set it to
144 Hertz and at that point now we're go
ahead and take advantage of the actual
faster refresh rate so that allow us to
have a more faster responsive in fluid
2d desktop as well of course is a more
fluid and responsive 3d desktop in game
and with that guys if you want to check
out more information regarding the
specifications and the features this
modern make sure I click here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
