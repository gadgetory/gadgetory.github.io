again to tech of tomorrow now today
we're gonna be doing something really
cool now everybody knows the new
Playstation 4 is coming to market but
it's not going to be here till the
holiday season most likely well here on
TECA tomorrow we're really impatient so
we thought we would go ahead and do
something a bit different and try to
build our own this is going to be the
new Playstation 4 build project now
we're gonna have the same things as them
at a lot of ways we're gonna build
around the same type of 8 core processor
but we're also going to step it up a
little bit by giving it dedicated
graphics we're gonna try to keep
everything else the same 8 gigabytes of
RAM small form-factor motherboard really
tiny case just as much as possible to be
like that but we're gonna have better
dedicated graphics now you guys know
that they're only gonna allow streaming
games and all that stuff so it's really
not going to be that much different
except for also be much cooler I think
all around now there's all kinds of ways
that we can build this now we've looked
at a bunch of different type of cases
but we want to get some feedback and
input from you folks as well and for you
guys helping us out and being
interactive I'm gonna give you guys a
really really cool high-end mechanical
keyboard that's right so what are you
guys gonna do we'll check it out
you guys know there's all kinds of
different parts out there on the market
so I'm gonna have an article over on the
website
and what I want you guys to do is go
over there and I want you guys to give
me some of the ideas that you guys think
would be the awesome build to match this
as close as possible step up a little
bit and still be really cool under $500
now the person who's system closely
resembles the one that we choose to
build we're going to give the keyboard
to and also even more spectacular check
it out that's right
we're gonna give you guys the system at
the end of it all that's right so when
it's all said and done one of you lucky
