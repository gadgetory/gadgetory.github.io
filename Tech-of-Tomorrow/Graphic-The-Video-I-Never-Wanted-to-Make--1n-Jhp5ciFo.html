really really scared well it's from
somebody beating you up from being in a
car accident fear of dying from
something that's your end well that's
where I'm at right now I am so scared of
going to the hospital and losing my leg
that I should have already checked in
the hospital a couple of days ago but I
am literally just so nervous and so
scared about what's going on that I've
been procrastinating and I know that's
wrong I should already be in the
hospital but things just took a really
bad turn for the worst last week last
Friday I made a video because on the
very end of my foot it kind of turned
like this little like dark ball but then
over the weekend that ball swelled up
and literally exploded and I'll show you
guys a picture of what my foot looks
like so I'll give you its graphic very
graphic and it's gross but I'll show you
a picture just you know exactly what I'm
going through you know that I'm not
bullshitting you whatsoever I've fought
this now for two years for two years
I've been taking different antibiotics
food you guys have seen how much weight
I've lost I'm really just I'm not all
that healthy it's starting to honestly
get to me mentally really bad I've been
just staying in my bed since Friday
lying there I dragged myself out of bed
right now because the cameramen guys
down are just trying to get some stuff
done so we can do it so Jesus been
trying to take care of that buddy's been
sad because he knows I'm just sitting in
my bed and honestly dude my foot stinks
so bad it just smells like death it's
just so unbelievably horrible so I won't
be able to produce as many videos I
don't know at the hospital I'm going to
which is Loma Linda if they're going to
allow me to film inside of there if they
do I'll make videos or swing my
wheelchair in the hallway and I can
still bring some videos to you guys from
there at least videos about speculation
and stuff but I will be checking in the
hospital later on today I can't put it
off anymore whatsoever so I just want to
let everybody know and this is probably
going to cost me millions of dollars so
I am going to start a GoFundMe because
I'm gonna need to make about two
thousand dollars just to be able to at
least pay my rent next month and keep
going so if you ever really did care
about me not many people actually really
helped with the patreon thing you know
but hopefully with this it will make
things a little bit easier
for me and I'll be able to at least go
take care of my medical stuff and then
come back and be here for you without
that I pretty much see myself I may I
may even go under I don't know I don't
want to but I'm really struggling with
that fact because I just don't know what
life is going to be with without a leg
so real quick here let's check out my
foot you guys can see that all the skin
off the end of my foot has all
completely come off all you see down
there now is just thing but a bunch of
pus and the bone and it's really bad so
this is it for me folks I'll try to be
back on here as soon as possible
I don't know how long I'm going to be in
the hospital I'm gonna be there as long
as it takes if you're a religious person
out there please pray for me if you're
not that kind of person could you at
least do me the courtesy of sending me
your positive thoughts and byes because
I could use all the support I can get
right now because even though I'm a
grown man I'm a grown man who's scared
out of his head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
