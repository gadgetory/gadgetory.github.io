day but before we get to exciting news
let's hear a word from today's sponsor 0
&amp;amp; 9 if you're the type of person who
builds a lot of PCs or just changes the
parts out inside their PC quite a bit
having an extra Windows 10 Pro key can
be a lifesaver especially if something
happens and all of a sudden your
registration isn't working and right now
at 0 &amp;amp; 9
they have Windows 10 Pro for 16 dollars
now this is like 84 percent off but with
a coupon code that we're gonna share
with you
you'll be able to get the same code for
$13 that's right Windows 10 Pro for 13
dollars
we'll have a link down below where you
guys can check us out on their website
and one thing that's really cool is you
can buy as many keys as you want alright
so if you're looking for office on the
cheap check out the link down below so
like I said for tech fans around the
world today is a great day you guys all
know that AMD has been taking serious
strides in the cpu market pushing in
till farther and farther back and
becoming more competitive by the minute
we'll check it out
thread Ripper is awesome I have the
previous generation 1950 X and that CPU
was just amazing but what's even more
amazing is what's happening today as two
brand new thread Ripper CPUs are going
to be released so first up we have the
2970 WX now this is a seriously heavy
hitting CPU 24 cores 48 threads this CPU
has a base clock of 3.0 and an amazing
boost of 4.2 gigahertz it has 76
megabytes of total cache requires 250
watts to power the bad boy and with
these CPUs and the new platform you
never have to worry about running out of
PCIe lanes because on this platform you
get up to 72 pcie 3.0 lanes which is
just whopping now the current street
price on this is twelve hundred and
ninety nine dollars which is exactly the
same as a twenty atti so pretty much you
want to get a top-end processor and the
20
gie together well you're gonna be
looking at about $2,500 preparing of
those two together now next up and very
affordable is the twenty nine twenty now
this particular processor is only six
hundred and forty nine dollars it has 12
cores
and twenty-four threads it has a base
clock of 3.5 a boost clock of 4.3 which
is actually higher than the 29 70 WX
strangely it has a total cash of thirty
eight megabytes its TDP is only a
hundred and eighty watts and like I said
this CPU is only six hundred and forty
nine dollars AMD made the notable
introduction of AMD dynamic local mode
DLM software for the Rison thread Ripper
WX series processors optimizing
application performance by ensuring the
most demanding threads always get
preferential time on cores with local
memory also the new Alienware area51
will now include AMD's powerful sixteen
core rise in threader 429 50x and the
twelve core rise in thread Ripper twenty
nine twenty
the twenty four core forty eight thread
rise in thread Ripper 2970 WX processor
and the twelve core twenty four thread
rise in thread River twenty nine twenty
X processor offer unprecedented
multi-threading with up to thirty nine
and fifty five percent faster
multi-threaded performance compared to
the core I 970 960 X and core i7 and
seventy-eight 20x respectively now it's
also really cool is for gamers these
CPUs give up to 32 percent better
performance and rate racing and this is
actually quite better than those other
two Intel CPUs we just talked to a
moment ago so all in all these CPUs are
gonna be really kick butt I can't wait
to go out and try to get one on my own
I'm gonna contact AMD and see if somehow
they can send me one otherwise I'm gonna
be selling some guitars because I
definitely want to get my hands in the
29 20 x4 649 dollars I just feel this
processor just offers a lot under the
hood for people who are out there who
are content creators who do a lot of
stuff and play games these CPUs are
looking like they're going to be a plus
and really kick ass on the market
especially if they can beat Intel at
their own game even at the same price
level or even a little lower will just
level the playing field completely
and honestly it's really good to see AMD
doing good somewhere even though on the
GPU side of things we all know right now
they're kind of lagging with Manavi and
all that stuff yeah we've got the
Polaris refresh coming on twelve
nanometer that's all cool stuff but
these CPUs are available today so that
means if you want to go out and buy
either one of these CPUs today you can
go out and do it now personally I wish I
had enough money to go out and buy it
$299 CPU but for me personally we edit a
lot of videos and stuff like that and I
don't really feel like I need a
processor that costs that much money but
the 29 20 X I think it's going to be
absolutely perfect now my only thing is
I really like to build hackintosh
machines and in the past I just haven't
really had good luck with building AMD
based systems now if I could build an
AMD based system and get a nice
hackintosh build out of it I think that
would be pretty interesting as well let
me know what you guys think if it's
possible would you guys like to see me
build a hackintosh
with this brand new AMD you know I mean
honestly these new CPUs to me look great
I can't wait to pull the systems see how
well they perform and the very fact that
they're working you know with
ray-tracing and are going to be able to
perform 32% better and ray-tracing
and 32 to 55 percent better and
multi-core stuff I mean that's gonna be
really incredible if everything about
these CPUs comes out to be true at the
end of the day AMD is definitely going
to have an editor's choice product on
their hands for sure and I mean both
these CPUs because if you're a person
out there and you make your living off
rendering videos doing 3d and stuff like
that oh my god that 2970 WX is going to
be one seriously kick-ass processor for
that type of stuff
get yourself a ton of RAM get
yourself that processor nice big fast
SSDs and you've got your system that
will totally kick ass across the board
on doing anything you need whether it's
making a game playing a game or even
surfing the internet
so if you guys are looking to get one of
these CPUs for yourself we'll have a
link down below where you can get one
over on Amazon I'm Miller you've been
watching teka tomorrow if you're looking
for a really cheap Windows or office key
on the cheap look down below and check
out the link from zero and nine B's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
