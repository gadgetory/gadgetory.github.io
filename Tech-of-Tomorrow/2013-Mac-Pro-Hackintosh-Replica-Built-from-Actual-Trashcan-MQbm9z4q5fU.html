back to tech demo we're bringing you all
the tech all the time and what's going
on today well today we're going to be
bringing you the top news stories of the
week and today's video is made possible
by Squarespace so thank you very much
Squarespace so with that said let's
actually jump in and start talking about
the news now first off I have an
announcement you guys are all totally
into the AMD 290x you guys know the
reference models been out but starting
next week a lot of cards are going to
start hitting the US market they've
already hit the European market but now
they're going to get the US market I'm
going to be able to get my hands on a
few of them next week to bring you guys
for review so our first story of the
week last year there were a shittim
amount of games that came out you guys
know it Kevin covered a bunch of them
everybody's covered them well Amazon has
their top 10 picks now they also have a
runner up and they also have a winner
picked by you the audience now I think
they base this off of whatever games
sold the most through the year so as
Amazon you know these guys sell lots and
lots of games they took those games made
up a list but they also have a runner up
and a People's Choice if you guys want
to check the article out and actually go
and check it out and see what's up check
out the link down below the description
we'll have that information for you now
next up on the news DRAM has gone up
just crazy
now I don't know if you guys notice or
not but there was a fire in China last
year and it damaged one of the plants
that makes the hynek's wafers now since
then memory prices have frickin sky
rocketed and now there seems to be a
rumor that because of low production
prices in 2014 are still going to be
buku bucks now I want your guys
interaction on this article I personally
think this is just complete total

price gouging at its absolute worst oh
gee I stubbed my toe so you got to buy
me a new pair of shoes just doesn't make
a lot of sense to me one fire even
though this company does make about 10%
of the memory think about it 10%
what 10% part of the memory is actually
making the prices go up to almost double
of what they were a few years ago just
look at it carefully and you guys agree
with me this is nothing but and
price gouging by those people memory
prices shouldn't be that high and let's
just face it 10% of the market what
about the other frakkin 90 percent right
yeah that's what I'm saying all right so
last up in today's news you guys all
know the new Mac has come out it was a
late 2013 Mac looked like a trash can we
made a funny video about it well now
some cat actor has taken this a step
further that's right this dude is one
out got himself a real trash can that's
right
he got himself a real trash can and made
himself a hackintosh computer out of it
so he actually has a real trash can
Mac that's right one thing to note
though this guy's Mac Pro is a lot lower
in specs than obviously the new one that
came out in late 2013 the late 2013 Mac
Pro is just decked out small as actually
it's unbelievable for what it is as far
as design wise goes this guy had no
access to those type of parts so this is
pretty much about to him saying hey cool
design Mac I'm going with it now before
I jump back here just once a once again
