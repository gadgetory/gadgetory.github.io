Tekra tomorrow elric Faris here now what
are we doing here today on second
tomorrow well today we're going to be
doing an unboxing and first look an
overview of a new case from the people
over at Silverstone this is there ft 0 3
mini now this thing's basically like
their big fortress tower but it's a mini
tower so it's gonna have lots of
features if you guys don't know
Silverstone they're the guys a little
snowflake logo it may make lots of great
cases and fans so with that said let's
hop in and let's take a look at this new
ft 0 3 mini
alright folks let's check it out like
all in boxes everything we're going to
start out with the box you guys to see
us as USB 3.0 which means probably going
to have the connectors in here and a
little cable that goes to your
motherboard it's the fortress series ft
0 3 mini says 2.5 millimeter thick
anodized aluminum outer shell a
removable top cover top-mounted buttons
compatible with sfx power supplies and
capacity for 13.5 hard drive or 2 2.5
drives supports for graphics cards up to
9.5 inches long not quite the 10-inch
lady pleaser that were you stabbing
around here but hey that's still cool
rotate it 90 degree motherboard mounting
which is cool to me straight up just
like some of the other ones we've seen
so we saw the front of the box here's a
side of the box not much to that this
tells the different languages the ones I
had a chance of talking about and these
other ones that are just basically
symbols or what I call the w2f languages
you know I can't read that when I can't
read that one that one that one or that
one I'm sure they're less people who can
but me I can go touch espa√±ol frenzies
italiano laughter that'll be like
earlier but la route / but it does they
pump around show you a couple pictures
of it here's the introduction if you
guys want to take a look real quick i'll
lock on the screen here so you guys can
see about this and read this I won't
read it off to you guys tell me you hate
that so I'll let you read it I'll hold
on here long enough to see you guys to
see it but you can see down here's the
model numbers here's the material the
type of motherboards that it takes how
many drive bays cooling system the i/o
ports the type of power supply and the
expansion card it's all right here so if
you guys need to know that just make
your screen bear so you can check that
out so let's go ahead and start unboxing
it I'm going to take my trusty knife I
won't even gives me a sound effects sale
just click the thing out you guys are
getting tired of the same old joke so i
won't use them i won't throw anything at
the cameraman today either so we'll just
take it a little easy open the box up
nice and gently
be two much problems if I don't even
have to probably stand up for this one
at all I'll be good to go to move
forward when it keep safety first toss
the knife out all right then so here we
go pull it out you guys the styrofoam
just take this like this and Kalani
completely we have it I'll just go ahead
and set the box off the side over here
starting off the bat we can see we have
the silver stone fortress series ft 0 1
mini manual it's the mini manual it
should be smaller than their man it's a
mini manual I'm just kidding here are
the screws connection for your USB and
the USB 3.0 header in case you only have
those type of connections on your
motherboard most motherboards these days
actually have this type of connection
though nothing else there backpedal
round since I got it this way we'll just
start out on the bottom this time so
right here in the bottom of it we can
see there's a fan that's in here pull
that bad boy off you can see the blue
colored fan right on the bottom feet all
rubberize slap this little bit way back
in there you hear the clipping as I do
it easy to go so actually things really
like to so a lot of the cases I get are
so happy to carry that I can't do
anything so now let's jump it up and
let's just check it out I'll do some
turns with its you guys can just see how
elegant it is it's very elegant and
simple on its outside and spin it once
you guys can see the side spin it again
going to spin it again
okay go ahead i'm going to move it up
here remove this plastic cover at the
top here here's where some of your
connections are and what they said this
case the motherboard mounts vertically
so you have the motherboard coming up
and down instead of being sideways so
your rear IO is going to be right here
here goes your on and off buttons your
USB 3.0 your microphone your headset all
right there here's two slots right here
for your video cards so you can see you
can fit one single car in there so if
you had a single 690 you'd be able to
stick that bad boy in here without a
problem at all so let's go ahead and
move the front to magnetic so all you do
is just pop back on this magnetically
seals and holds on there very nice
ergonomic design very easy to come off
and then we'll move inside let's take a
look at the interior oh you take this
little bit apart disassemble it piece by
piece kind of crazy look at this the
whole thing just simply comes apart very
elegant please every side this is you
once actually kind of got some luck so
every panel comes up except for the one
the motherboard goes on so Rodney round
is going to be pissed it's not and
remove the mode where tray but
everything else in the system comes
completely apart pop it up here's the
internal to your cables for everything
right here including like I said a USB
3.1 plug into most motherboards here's
where your hard drive will go so if
you're going to use a standard HDD it
fit right there if you're going to use
the Sato you'll need to use an adapter
here's the motherboard tray goes in and
the power supply goes right over here
now you guys can see this is very small
so you're not going to be able to fit
any of the normal type power supplies
now take that into mind before you go
building the system because there's only
going to fit the very smaller power
supplies and that might be something you
want to take into consideration but
beyond that I mean you guys can see this
little fortress ft 0 3 mini it's very
small it's very elegant all the parts
are magnetic thing just pops together
Pop's apart very simply so that's it
folks you guys saw it here the fortress
ft 0 3
this is a really nice small case if you
guys are looking for something just
stick in a corner this might be
something you're looking for also go at
the board mounts like this instead of
mounting like this makes it very tricky
I think to put the cabling it's a little
bit different but when you get it all up
and you put the covers on it it does
look pretty elegant as well so thanks
for watching decking tomorrow we'll see
you guys back here with another video
shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
