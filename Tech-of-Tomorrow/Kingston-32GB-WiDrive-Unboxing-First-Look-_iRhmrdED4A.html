unboxing on Tekkit tomorrow today we're
looking at the 32 gigabyte kingston why
drive essentially this is wireless
storage that you can use a conjunction
with the iphone ipod touch and the ipad
via the free app that you can download
in the App Store so today is going to be
the first look we're going to see what
comes in the box then you guys can look
forward to a full review both written
and video next couple of days so in
front of the box they show the unit
itself you guys can see there's a 32
gigabyte model backside not much going
on except specifications so we're going
to skip that flip backside around and
pop the top where we owe some clumsy so
we got a couple things popping out right
there so we got the Kingston why drive
the owners manual looks like a charger
and then a USB cable right here so
that's just about wraps that up this is
covered and it actually is very thin for
my first impressions with a little
plastic that we're going to take off
it's very sleek so that's pretty cool
it's not going to take up extra storage
if you want throw it in your pocket and
for reference I got the iphone 4 right
here so you can see it's actually
smaller and if we hold it up side to
side it is actually thinner than the
iphone 4 with the case on so probably
without the case to be thinner but just
so you guys can see so again you can use
you can connect with up to three users
so you can all share the same files this
is actually kind of perfect to maybe you
bought the 16 gig ipad you thought it
was enough storage i realized it wasn't
instead even have to return it or
exchange it and i can just add on
storage for that so here is the y drive
itself you got a getting started user's
manual a USB cable and a USB to wall
charger adapter in case you want to
charge this because it does have a
built-in batteries so this has been a
quick unboxing and first look again look
out for a full review and a full video
review in the next couple of days this
is jonathan doing a guest video on
tickets tomorrow if you guys want to
check out my other stuff link is down
below and i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
