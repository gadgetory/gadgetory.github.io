tomorrow I'm Elric your host now if you
guys missed yesterday's video
yesterday's videos when I told you guys
about my new phone that I got my new
Galaxy s3 I did the unboxing talked
about my stuff that I got with my new
verizon account now today is now
Thursday and I've got a brand new case
for that phone so it doesn't get
destroyed this is the new speakin sgp
Neo Hybrid this is their gray and blue
case and as you can see right here in
the box it's called spigen it's kind of
kind of a weird name kind of like
speaking hetero the speakin yeah though
she do look at Nautica don't could do
but but this is it there's this spigen
case so I'll show you guys the front and
we'll show you guys the back not much
really to this but you guys can see you
know the spigen SGP I'll turn to the
side real quick so you guys can see it's
Badou and there was you're gonna see it
anyways just a second so pretty much
this is the case that it comes in so now
let's pop in and let's put my phone
inside the case let's go
alright folks so not too much to go you
guys Alba said before you know it's the
spigen the SGP the Neo Hybrid you know
blah blah blah blah blah you guys know a
lot stuff but you want to see is the
actual case itself so well let's pop in
and get it
he's my trusty little fingernail right
here open the case up another knife
right here so then I'll go ahead and
pull it open so come bloom not too much
to it
kind of blue kind of gray kind of tough
not extremely tough still and I mean
there's not really too much to I think
but it also luckily that's right comes
with a shield so inside of here you've
got it's a screen protector and you've
got an original spigen product serial
number and a buffer thing so first thing
we're gonna want to do is put on the
crystal shield of the phone so I'll set
that down really gently now here's my
poem and then we're going to go ahead
and very gently figure out how to apply
this one on to the phone I think it's
just like that so I'm gonna very gently
try to do this sometimes these are kind
of tricky to put on because if you don't
do it right the first time
it can be a real pain in the butt I'm
gonna try to do on the first try without
messing anything up and if I don't and
then I'll have to be able to buying
another one which I don't want to do so
let me just get this stuff out of the
way here so I'm gonna very gently get in
your door it matches on the phone it's
my phone wakes up from a sleep mode
it's a pretty easy one on there I don't
think I got it exactly totally perfect
it's not rocket science though so now
it's on there
how could you move the filter them so I
got pretty much all of the air bubbles
out there just a really a couple of them
right here on the sides which I'm gonna
very easily wipe out now as you'll see
so there we go other than a few little
air bubbles and stuff which I've now
been able to completely wipe out you
guys can see I now have the phone
completely done so and then last but not
least we'll go ahead and put the foam
cover on so here's the thong and foam
cover very easily just sits in there and
boom so then we got the foam cover
spigen our phone still open so you can
use a camera and there we go so that's
it folks hope you guys enjoyed it we'll
see you guys background ticker tomorrow
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
