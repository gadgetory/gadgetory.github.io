how's it going tech fans welcome back to
tech of tomorrow were unless you've been
living on top of the mountain or out in
space you guys all know that AMD is
having an event in Hawaii that happened
earlier today announcing five of their
latest new GPUs giving the market and
they range all the way from $89 all the
way up into well that will get into a
minute we just don't know it's kind of
funny though they started off trying to
this live event and doing it through
YouTube but there seemed to be some
technical difficulties are there to stop
the show and then rebrand show to us
later on in the day but now we have all
the pertinent for mation for this launch
now not only did AMD talk about their
new cards and their new releases they
also talked about a lot of the new
technology surrounding these cards now
they talked a really lot about audio to
help for 25 years they've done all this
stuff to research with your head and how
positional audio and how your brain
reacts to audio and these guys are
claiming that on a few of their new
cards they're going to have this thing
called true audio and this is going to
allow them to do programming to make
positional audio so you can like hear
people coming up behind you try to hear
things coming up in front of you which
should be very very industry now
traditionally video card companies don't
push audio they push their GPU but now
these guys are going to have a complete
separate dsb on some cards that allow
this new audio now another big thing is
direct3d 11.2 brought to you by their
new GC and technology this is something
that we're also going to see in the
future and some of their lower end cards
don't have this at all and it's kind of
actually kind of strange because AMD has
certain technologies on certain cards
not usually when you buy a series of a
card you get just a flat thing of
certain things across the board that's
not going to be true with this new
release some cards will have the audio
on it some cards won't some cards
support the new 11.2 some cards won't or
at least it's questionable right now
because AMD kind of left a lot of things
very ambiguous first of all the GPU
that's going to be used in
new r9 290x nobody knows exactly what
it's codenamed at this time nobody knows
the pricing and nobody knows the exact
details of what's going on with this car
but what we do know there are five new
cards hitting the market starting off
all the way at an $89 card which is
called the r7 250 which also has one
gigabyte of memory on board and scored
over 2,000 on 3dmark fire strikes so
this is their entry-level coordinates
looking pretty good next up is the r7
260x so this is like the top of the line
of the entry-level cards and this card
features two gigabytes of memory is
coming to market about a hundred and
thirty nine dollars and it got a fire
strike score of over 3700 not bad at all
so now let's move in to the r9 or what
they consider to be their enthusiastic
ards like I said before the r7 that's
geared for the entry-level moderate
gamers the r9 is geared for the
enthusiast and the hardcore gamer and
they start off with theirs which is the
new r9 270x now this card features two
gigabytes of memory is going to be
coming to market about a hundred and
ninety nine dollars and it's scored over
5500 and 3dmark fire strike so not bad
for the entry level for the enthusiast
next up is the r9 280x now this card is
going to be coming to market at about
two hundred ninety nine dollars features
three gigabytes of memory and this car
scored over 6,800 on 3dmark fire strike
so we're getting faster as we get the
cards now last up on the list AMD claims
this is their fastest GPU to date and
that is the new r9 290x now we know it's
going to have four gigabytes of gddr5
memory we know that it's going to have a
512-bit memory interface we don't know
exactly a lot of the other specs the
pricing still doesn't come out the name
of the GPU hasn't come out but we know
that it's supposed to be the fastest of
the fast from the people at AMD and
we're really looking forward to getting
our hands in these cards and actually as
of say when the video was being filmed I
got
tected by a few companies who are
already getting us in line to get review
samples so you know for a fact we're
going to have those cards for you guys
here we're hearing some time the
beginning of October we're going to see
these cards so hopefully hold your hats
on Harper that will see those things
very very soon now I've written a full
article and all this technology which
you guys can see the description down
the like button which I know you guys
are going to chuck norris and beyond
that hey it's been great bringing the
guys information I can't wait to get the
cards in here in a house to bring you
guys actual testing and see what the
real deal is but with that said I'm
