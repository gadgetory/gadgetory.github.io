died off the side of the road Kenny here
she's almost dying but almost right so
now we're going to show you their mice
and their keyboard stuff so can you just
real quick give us a glance over some of
the new stuff you guys are doing this
year sure um so these are actually our
severe mouse mouse is actually was a lot
of them so this is actually a model that
we have released already but we are
offering a lot more new colors and a
different finish our original Saphira
mouse was a black matte so right now
we're offering it in the red combat me
white yellow camouflage orange cream
we've got a lot of good color or so and
it's also with the new boss finish so
there's not anything really new with in
Beecher's itself but you know this is a
really popular malice and we only had
one color so this is kind of our deck oh
yeah so we're trying to expand on it I
give people more options on one of their
favorite Mouse's right now what's down
here the gallery yeah one thing I was
actually our mouse bungee hawk I think
we already did that progress so in what
it does is a and this happens in all the
time you know when you play games in
your mouth courgettes cotton keyboard
the monitor or some tables in the back
so what this really does it just helps
prevent that from happening so you have
pretty much consistent moving from your
mouth and you know it doesn't get snake
on anything and that doesn't affect your
game legs it was really simple but
honestly once you use it like I started
using my works good right yeah like this
is pretty good I'm gonna use it you know
I'm running out of dead space now I've
got all these little gadgets everywhere
but you know it's really good actually
you can you know you can adjust it to
never much slack you need some people
and move like AZ like this something
like really short distance yeah so I'm
and it's also it's a magnet and you can
just easily take it out pop it in
and we got the way down here Tom back
there are yes this is actually aren't
there on right there is a mouse that has
been released already this one is on the
battle edition so it comes in the combat
great you want to fight about it I don't
want to fight about it I fight remember
you in the game I can't uniform but I'm
gonna say no ok what that night that is
on your desk oh she had a really cool
knife on her desk books I went on bought
it it's from a video game it's a video
game night yeah I've got a lot of video
game like from all mmos yeah that's it
it's cool yeah and get some more Lord of
the Rings weapons exactly but so this
one actually it's our Theron but the
difference is I'm we actually did update
to this one but just this this
particular mouse and this Theron is with
the new sensor we originally have it
with the laser sensor but this is with
the inference ok that's what what's the
big difference in the cost performance
go this channel honestly I have to just
this one out already and Fred
I don't all right then the keyboard
don't know he has lots of these over
here to his right if we should be
infrared it's the things you can see to
your dress yeah you know what Superman
does I'm doing that right now but you
got the mouse yep bye oh you guys I just
used your mouse oh I'm sorry hear you oh
yes I don't know now here are all the
keyboards now some of these I've seen
familiar and I see a lot of new colors
out here we've got red we've got Wyatt
we've got lucky so what's going on some
ABC combat edition we're all about
combat see you guys that's my man oh so
arm wrestle pick us off all right Thank
You Russell I don't know and I've been
working my butt so this year we're
really pushing for mechanical keyboards
we do have another line which is our
challenger you know but nowadays i think
mechanical keyboard is really picking up
in terms of popular keyboards works at
definitely membranes old actually
mechanicals old but new yes coming back
the old bring back the oldest back with
disco you know right off so so basically
our mechanical keyboards we have our g1
and RG units right here we have our the
genius or the ones with the macro keys
actually and we already had to these
mechanical keyboards release but we
didn't have as many features so this
year what we're trying to do is we're
trying to bring in more features and
things kind of personalized a little bit
and see what people like like what like
more programmable macros yeah well
backlash exactly for what that lady we
just started offering backlighting we
also have new switches are default at
the time last year was black but now
we're getting all sorts of different
switches for example this g unit is with
red switches so the Cherry MX red under
here yeah so we're really pushing an
offer for more switches or switches for
our gamers we actually have this one
which is our new meka g1 Prime and that
one's de prime yes I check this out
coach the Prime it's got paint keys
Scott pinky I makes it prime personally
designed by our Korean asst I
22 or starcraft 2 for any deals who
don't know what i see two is our soccer
ball team in Korea now do you guys have
any plans in the future for maybe making
an option where people could change
their own colored keys like that would
be a really great thing you guys got any
plans for that where people just come
and just change their own couple you
know I custom WASD all that have a
feedback we are exactly looking for we
were trying a lot of different things
but what we want to do for her is hey
this is keyboard tied not danced I he
was trying to break out a song right now
we can dance after you know never gasps
battle with these these keyboards
anyways so um what we're trying to do
right now is kind of just offer small
things at first backlighting different
switches and then from there you know
different key caps and things like that
this particular one backlit or no no
this one's not backlit but this one's
Brown switches and that with this I feel
like this is the most anticipated
keyboard because first of all our prime
team is very popular people really love
them and you know star talk to you is
really big right now so this really my
son plays have to daily trying to get
professionally that's why I don't read
Koreans good you know yeah I've been
joking cuz it's a paper on sale no se
only beef bulgogi you're just naming
food I'm sorry what so so as I said this
was designed by our stock up to cream um
sc2 team so they made this especially
for how they play starcraft 2 so well
the reason why these are different
colors is because these are you know
certain keys that they use a lot the
hotkeys that we use when they play so i
was joking that these extra buttons here
because because actually rg1 we have a
longer spacebar yes so it's actually a
little bit smaller and we have these two
keys its Gigi and this one is escape you
know this was like yeah I'm happy about
winning this one's like no I'm just
gonna give a mage quick I'm not sure no
there's no rage quitting fry well wall
see when they come across yeah someone's
gonna be saying you don't know Korean at
all this offensive we're an Asian I get
away with that I don't know maybe you
can't you might be Chinese so would you
like to know the MSRP oh yes what is the
MSRP the manufacturer's suggested not a
twice yeah well probably well this one
is 149 99 it's pretty but you know we
haven't had
a change in prices from our original
mega keyboards we just we want to add
you know features little features here
and there until we get the right ones
that everybody wants and then keep it at
a price i really like the way this one
works yeah this one has selective
illuminated lighting so you know you got
your Center whud for FPS games the TT up
here light up as well yes it does but we
only have it plugged for one of the plug
haha still I really like the way this
one looks right now plugging keyboards
into other keywords other keyboards
right now so these two are basically the
same just in different colors right yes
what's you know what this one has all of
it 'let so this was our illuminated
series so these are all it for our white
edition you just have these ones right
now but we are looking to offer more
incredible so there's a different
there's a little different changes for
people who want different things you
know I'm like this is these are both
black switches right now but we're
looking to integrate more red and what's
gonna be the manufacturer start to
retail on these two bad boys 149 99 and
this one's once the balloon excellent
right on not as much light so you say
that ten bucks on it so now made
Almighty zelena's now laughter that
least on the same rule kitty I see you
guys got some new stuff and I also see a
little box right here yeah so what is
this little box that's our muhammad
azhar you exchange our car it's USB it's
felt like plug and play for your
learner's it it is you know you know
what if we don't know if we can do it
right now but it makes a sound we have
it plugged in somewhere you know and I
would do the center now but my voice is
kind of dying from Allah see you're
gonna show the function all kinds of new
stuff yeah so this this is actually
gonna come out very soon it should be
available by the end of this month okay
excellent yeah and you know this is our
first external sound card so um we
really want to you know push your tire
market I know I know there's not a lot
out there but you know in order to make
a perfect product you gotta put put a
product out there you gotta break those
eggs to make an omelet forget it see
what people like and we'll just perfect
it so we it's very basic for now but
we're hoping to get more into
and so the MSRP is 47 48 49 99 49 99
okay now we're here we see the shock and
so we got we got well we got we got the
how do you pronounce that Mohammed
Mohammed you have to say Hamid yeah the
souris azureus dog is actually upgraded
or its yeah it's upgraded version of our
old Azzurri stuff oh no the thing about
that is back to stock up to 90 we always
talk about starcraft ii model but you
know it's really popular right now um is
that some gamers a lot of pro gamers you
know not all of them use the headsets a
lot of them prefer the in-ear earbuds so
we realized that there wasn't really a
big market for that so I'm really trying
to offer more options for gamers for
high-quality sound for gamers who don't
necessarily what the big bulky head says
maybe there was little inner box for
this is our new is there a stove and
it's pretty much the same as our last
one point it features the flat cable so
it doesn't tangle right on let me up the
shock the shock is up here and across
your website right the chorus is
actually our newest headset the shock is
is an over headset but we're just
showcasing some different colors which
one up here is the promise man sadita
Martha it's out here get too down here

effects yeah that's cool that talk about
okay not everything is start going to
no things are trying you're kidding you
know I thought isn't it pretty cool yeah
these things are totally built for the
game right yes and it's actually a bit
more fashionable I would say it's
pushing for more sleep I sure will
design and other handset as you can see
we're now offering the LED side that
year the earcups they light up when we
plug them in just you know to show
something or represent TT east locust
and what's the green nvidia colored
looking things in there what are these
things this is the green shock one
console and it's our shock one headset
but this was actually multi-platform you
can use it for the Xbox the ps3 and the
pc for people who really like our shock
headset but they also play on the xbox
so maybe the ps3 or both this actually
is a good alternative or upgrade for
them so that they can use the same
headset for all of them we do offer the
adapters and the cables for it and we
weave you know we upgraded the quality
we've reinforced what people had notes
on so we've really taken the notes of
