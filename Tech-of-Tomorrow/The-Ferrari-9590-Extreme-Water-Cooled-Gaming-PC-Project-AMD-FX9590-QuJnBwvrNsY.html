what up friends welcome back to tech of
tomorrow where I know you guys have been
expecting it so now we're bringing it to
the table
AMD fans your day hath arrived we've all
talked about building a system around
the new AMD FX 95 90 and we've got all
the damn parts right here in front of me
in fact there's so many of them I feel
like I'm almost buried and crawling out
of these things so check it all out here
it all is starting off with the case
this is from NZXT this is the Phantom
530
we're obviously using the AMD 95 90 FX
processor motherboard you can see right
here crosshair formulas II got a 79 70
over here from H is got all kinds of
cool stuff Neutron SSD 3 terabyte
Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm drive for the
backup got complete water cooling across
the board from Swift tech got an awesome
OCZ modular power supply that also fits
that build and by the way if I haven't
said the name to build this one's gonna
be called the Ferrari 95 90 hence the
red coloring we'll do a few mods and
he's gonna mess around with stuff we're
actually gonna bring you guys a series
of videos as Anthony does different
stuff on the system first we're gonna
bring you a video showing you how he's
doing the water cooling and installing
all the water cooling components on it
and then we're gonna show you how we
building the system and putting
everything inside the case so really
exciting stuff we didn't just feel like
throwing the 95 90 onto a test station
and bringing you guys some scores I mean
anybody can do that we figured we'd
bring a full-blown badass system to the
table show you guys the system this can
be also one of those system builds so if
you want you can call it the Xtreme 95
90 build and these are all the parts we
chose because they look totally badass
together now like usual all the parts
that are using this build will be down
there below the like button in the
description where you guys can see
everything we used in this bill that way
if you want to mimic it part four part
you can we know some people are gonna
come
say oh I would have used this I would
have used that that's okay that's your
option but please don't put down our
choices these are all great things they
match together very well and at the end
of the day this systems gonna look
really really bad as now every day we
get a ton of people asking about our
music that we feature in our videos
where they can be downloading it or
where it can be strange so we thought
it'd be cool to debut a new Tod website
