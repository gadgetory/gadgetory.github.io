Squarespace what's up Tech fans Kevin
here in tech in tomorrow keeping up the
momentum because we've just had games
back to back to back since the end of
February through this month and today
we're talking about a game for my
favorite developers based on one of my
favorite TV shows South Park the stick
of truth now this is a game we've been
waiting long time for it's been pushed
back several times initially you do some
development errors then the fact that
THQ and under and the new be soft picked
it up and pushed it back a couple more
times and now it's finally here so we
get to find out if it was worth all that
weight today on tech of tomorrow
now for those of you that haven't heard
of this title the stick of truth is a
turn-based RPG based on the South Park
franchise brought to us from the guys
over at obsidian entertainment now this
is the company responsible for a lot of
RPGs like fallout new vegas and alpha
protocol and consists of a lot of
members from the former Black Isle
Studios which was responsible for a lot
of big-name RPGs like Baldur's Gate as
the player you take on the role of the
new kid in town a silent protagonist
that you can completely customize or at
least as far as customization goes in a
world made of paper cutouts the story is
one gigantic event of LARPing gone way
too far and pits you and the friends you
make against all kinds of ridiculous
enemies whether it be other kids aliens
giant rats or nazi zombies to begin with
the RPG mechanics in this game are
exceedingly simple but in a good way you
have four classes to choose from at the
start fighter mage thief and Jew all of
which simply determine what special
attacks you have there's no stats and
any class can equip anything so your
character's appearance is entirely up to
you combat feels extremely reminiscent
of the Mario &amp;amp; Luigi RPGs for those you
who have played them with a heavier
emphasis on timed button presses and
inputs to make moves work as effective
as possible during the fight your lead
character can attack use items activate
a special class ability or summon
powerful characters once a day to wipe
out enemies you'll also normally be
accompanied by one of the other major
characters from the series which you can
change out in the middle of combat each
one has a different type of attack
special abilities and even a special
quick action that gives them a certain
tactical benefit depending on who you're
fighting now one of the more interesting
mechanics in the game though is that you
can end up winning a lot of battles
without even starting them while walking
around and exploring the town there's
numerous interactable as you can work
with and over time you'll gain a lot of
special items that can open up even more
options like being able to shrink
yourself teleport or shoot a bow making
use of these can oftentimes create and
set off traps to knock out enemies
either reducing how many people you have
to fight in an actual battle or even
just clearing them all out and getting
XP as though you had fought them well it
does make leveling up a bit easier
there's still plenty of unavoidable
fights that you'll have to learn how to
play and winning fights with the
environment is just an awesome idea and
rewards players for paying attention to
their surroundings now of course these
special exploration abilities have more
uses than just for combat the town of
South Park is filled with
different collectibles you can find such
as Chinpokomon hidden chests with items
in them or even side quests to complete
in order unlock special new summons
there is even a constant side quest goal
of making as many Facebook friends as
you can with the residents of South Park
earning you special perk points whenever
you reach a certain number there's never
really any major points of no return so
players can feel at ease taking their
time doing the side quests they want or
just rush through the main story if they
feel like it there's a fantastic sense
of pacing to this game that just seems
to have crazy things happen back to back
to back yet you always have time just
run around to do what you want now
you've probably noticed looking at the
gameplay that this looks exactly like an
episode of South Park and this is one
aspect of the game that I just can't
stop praising enough the change between
game playing cutscenes is seamless at
times and it really does feel like
you're playing a part in one big episode
all the animations work just the way
they look like in the show right down to
the characters running animation of just
shuffling along sideways this creates an
incredible sense of immersion for series
fans and is one of the best examples of
another property being translated into a
video game now of course there is one
downside to this game for some of you
out there and that is of course the fact
that it is South Park and just like the
show and even more so at times the game
does not pull punches when it comes to
foul racist or sexist humor and it does
everything it can to anger the easily
offended just about every 15 or 20
minutes it somehow finds a way to once
again surprise you covering a number of
taboo subjects and recent pop culture at
the same time this is of course a boon
for fans of the series as it's also
riddled with tons of references to
episodes from all seasons whether it's a
song or advertisement playing in the
background a specific NPC or side quest
or even just looking at one of the
characters closets there's just too many
references to keep track of and doesn't
stop there the game is actively
self-aware that it is a game and so
there are numerous jokes played on
popular gaming conventions whether
that's having to take turns when
fighting or discovering audio logs in
dangerous places in the end I have to
say that South Park the stick of truth
is a fantastic game well it's not the
most complex or difficult of RPGs it
throws just enough difficult to your way
and makes use of an elegantly simple RPG
formula it's a little bit on the short
side weighing in at between 1012 hours
depending on how much side content you
complete but I could easily see
replaying the game at least once more to
try out a different class or make
different choices when few
in moments the game has if you're not a
fan of South Park then obviously this
game is not for you but if you do enjoy
the series then this is easily a
must-buy it's simple pure fun and most
importantly hilarious if you enjoy their
sense of humor South Park the stick of
truth is one of the best adaptations of
a TV series to video game
easily worth paying full price for well
