ticket tomorrow bringing you guys
another accessory review and today we're
taking a look at the max Nighthawk x8
backlit mechanical keyboard now this is
a part of many similar lines of
keyboards that all have pretty much the
same features but the main thing that
distinguishes the x8 is that it uses
brown cherry MX switches as opposed to
the blue switches in the x7 and the red
switches in the x9 so you guys know the
drill by now we're going to talk about
what features it has how customizable it
is and of course how it performs to let
you know whether or not it's worth its
MSRP of 144 99 so let's check it out
so first off as the name implies this is
a backlit keyboard this particular one
as you can see features a couple
different colors going on the colored
lights are however not customizable you
can choose between a couple different
colors when you order the keyboard but
once you get it the color you chose is
what you're stuck with there are some
lighting options for things like how
bright the keys are or if they pulsate
or not but past that the colors are set
now backlit keys aside the nighthawk is
pretty simple and straightforward when
it comes to aesthetics there's not
really any fancy shaping or over-the-top
style going on here just a good solid
rectangle the windows key design has
been replaced as well as having a couple
customizable key replacements including
a nice little portal reference and Clark
keys to replace the f1 through f12
buttons now along with these replacement
keys the nighthawk does come with one
extra little accessory it right outside
of the box and that's a wrist rest now
in this case it's not one of those
plastic ones that just attaches to the
bottom of your keyboard but rather a
separate cloth one which does a pretty
good job of keeping your wrists nice and
comfortable so that's how the keyboard
looks and when you get right out of the
box right away now let's talk about
special features and what makes
Nighthawk possibly worth getting over
its competition now as I said earlier
this is a part of a line of different
keyboards whose main difference is which
switches you get based on preference the
brown ones in this case gives you a nice
little tactile response won't
maintaining the low force of the red
switches as opposed to the higher
resistance of the blue ones giving it a
nice balanced approach making it
appropriate for use in multiple styles
of games or just for some heavy-duty
typing another nice background feature
that we are seeing in this keyboard
that's getting featured in a lot more
gaming keyboards these days is full and
key rollover meaning that no matter how
many keys you press simultaneously
they're all going to register in
addition to that it's also called turn
into functions for all of the F keys one
through six double is multimedia
controls
7 through 11 for switching between
different macro profiles which I'll get
to in a bit and f12 is used for
activating the game mode so you can
disable that pesky little Windows key
last but not least the keyboard does
also feature a small hub to plug other
devices into you've got your microphone
and audio jacks as well as a pair of USB
2.0 ports each capable of supplying a
hundred milliamps of power now some
other minor functions worth noting right
away is that it does include a
heavy-duty braided cable so the cable
does have a
extra durability and the USB connector
is gold-plated so it'll stay shiny
longer this one also has an adjustable
height between two options either just
simply lying flat on your desk or
slightly elevated now as I said earlier
some of the function keys do have an
alternative use as switching between
different macro profiles and as you've
probably noticed by now the nighthawk
does not have any dedicated macro
buttons so if you want to use macros and
you download their customization
software you'll have to replace one of
the standard keys with alternative macro
option of which you can have 10
different macro setup per each profile
now in all honesty the lack of any
dedicated macro buttons really isn't
that big of a loss no individual game is
going to ever really require you to use
every single button on the keyboard
so you can customize each profile to fit
what macros work for what game you're
currently playing and by not using any
dedicated buttons it helps keep the
overall keyboard much more trim so with
all that out on the table what's the
final verdict on the nighthawk well I
think the easiest way to sum it up is
that it's a keyboard that heavily favors
function over style shirt has backlit
keys and a few thematic replacement keys
but the overall design is very very
simple and then all honesty a little bit
on the bland side you can't customize
the colors of the keys and there are no
dedicated macro buttons but at the same
time though while the keys don't have
customizable colors they ace their
performance test not having macro
buttons keeps the whole thing nice light
and trim and while it's simple looking
it's incredibly sturdy this keyboard is
all about minimal frills and peak
performance if you're in the market for
a keyboard that just gets the job done
with having to deal with all these extra
bells and whistles then it is an
excellent choice for the MSRP of one
$44.99 and if you want a different type
of switch well as I said earlier the X 7
and X 9 are basically the same thing
with different switches the X 7 model
gives you blue switches for the same
MSRP of 144 99 while the red switches on
the X 9 will just cost you an extra 5
bucks
