to another day at teco tomorrow now if
you're like most folks you spend a lot
of time in your living room I know that
I do and begin your living room you want
to have the absolute best equipment so
you can take total control now as many
of you tech folks probably know already
apple has released their brand new Apple
TV now previously we took a look at
Nvidia shield and they're so confident
about the shield that they sponsored I
head to head comparison with the brand
new Apple TV let's check it out so let's
first start off with something very
simple the looks now the apple TV is a
very small little unit and it's very
unobtrusive and will fit pretty much
anywhere in your environment your living
room in fact when it's on you can't even
see it the Nvidia shield however I feel
it's more geared towards the pc crowd
it's a little bit bigger has nice shiny
green lights on it and when it's on you
can definitely tell it's on now the next
thing we're going to talk about though
is the means of navigation because it
actually tells quite a bit about how the
product is made and what it's geared for
now the Nvidia shield it obviously comes
with a controller so it's perfectly
geared for a gamer now the Apple control
ever is their new glass controller and
it's very well made and is very easy to
operate in fact the interface when
surfing through all your channels and
all that stuff is very very nice on the
Apple TV but for me being a gamer I just
got to say having some that I can game
with as well as control those that's a
plus now as far as performance goes the
shield packs a monster Tegra x1
processor and a 256 core GPU where's the
apple TV features an a8 chip which is no
slouch but it's definitely not as fast
as the x1 next up let's talk about
streaming resolutions now you guys all
know that Netflix and YouTube offer full
4k content now and you got to have a
device it's going to keep up with that
now the problem with the apple TV is it
only supports 1080p that's right your
cat the 1080p via the hdmi 1.4
connection however though you can get 60
hertz at 4k using the Nvidia shield so
if you want the absolute best and you
care about 4k the choice is obvious
following that let's
about pricing and models now the Apple
DV it currently has two models on the
market a 32 gigabyte model which is $149
or a 64 gigabyte model which is 199
dollars now NVIDIA has two different
models of their shield they have an
entry level at 16 gigabytes 199 dollars
or if they have a more one that's geared
towards gamer just 500 gigabytes and
it's 299 dollars that's actually my
preferred one because if you're a gamer
you want to have that storage plus if
your user out there who really wants to
have external storage the Nvidia shield
offers both micro SD and USB external
connections where the Apple TV offers
nothing now one area where I definitely
got to give apple serious props though
is in their interface and the way you
operate it their OS for operating the TV
is one of the cleanest and best looking
in the market it's really hard to beat
on top of that you also get Siri voice
recognition now I know some people out
there make fun of Siri but it actually
works quite well now at the Nvidia
shield you're getting Android TV and
like an android phone you're getting
total control over your environment you
also get chromecast functionality now if
any of you guys have ever used this you
know it's the absolute easiest way to
stream things from your phone to your TV
and lastly if you're a fan of google
voice guess what it's here too in fact
it's your means of voice navigation on
the shield and it works great now
jumping back to the controllers the
biggest thing beyond 4k is the ability
to game on the shield the apple TV is a
really great device it's really a my
eyes though geared more for watching TV
now you can play simple iPad style games
on it then that's not necessarily a
really a bad thing but with the shield
you get more of a gaming experience that
the PC users really enjoy and want now
currently there are a lot of great look
and Android titles out there but for the
serious gamer you can stream actual pc
games through the shield and you do this
through geforce now which is kind of
like Netflix but for gaming so there you
have it the difference is between the
Apple TV and the Nvidia shield now for
me personally if you're just a person
who lives in the iOS realm then you're
going to really love the Apple
it has a great interface going through
it navigating is really incredible so if
you're somebody just want something very
simple easy to use hey the apple TV is
definitely a winner but if you're a
gamer nothing right now compares to the
Nvidia shield and that's more with my
heart lies obviously being a guy who has
a tech background high resolution and
high-end components are my thing and you
guys can clearly see that when it comes
to resolutions and it comes to the
components inside the Nvidia shield is
the clear winner like I said if you just
watch TV and you're a guy who's already
totaled into the iOS world maybe the
Apple TVs for you but if you're a person
who wants to game and watch those same
TV programs the choice is clear</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
