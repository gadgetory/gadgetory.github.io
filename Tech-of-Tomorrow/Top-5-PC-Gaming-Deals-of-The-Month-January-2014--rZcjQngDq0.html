another edition of tech of tomorrow
we've got two planes flying in the sunny
sky bees out nature is definitely
happening here and I know a lot of the
rest of the countries like freezing but
in California we're actually having a
pretty nice dang sunny day and i'm
bringing you guys now the deals of the
month and the first ones rather
interesting this is the new pyrex two
thousand MX mouse or MX two thousand
miles and this thing has like five star
ratings across the board which means a
lot of people out there have actually
used this thing when they bought it on
amazon right now you can get this thing
for 29 bucks it's usually 49 bucks so
it's pretty much twenty bucks aw it's
about half price so about a forty to
fifty percent off there is discount so
if you're somebody out there looking for
a totally programmable gaming mouse this
might be something you're going to want
to look at especially since it has five
star ratings across the board not a lot
of products have that when you see that
psych hey that might be something
actually well worth looking into and so

like it's going to be a pretty damn good
thing I personally haven't owned this
