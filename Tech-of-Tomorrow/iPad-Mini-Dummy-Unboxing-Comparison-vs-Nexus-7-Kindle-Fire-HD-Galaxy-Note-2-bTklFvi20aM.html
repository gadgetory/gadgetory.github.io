once again it's me eldercare the ticket
tomorrow YouTube channel Saturday
edition just got back from New York and
got some pretty exciting stuff to talk
to you guys about now you guys all know
that the new iPad Mini is going to be
coming out next week and with that said
we were able to buy one from China
through eBay which is a dummy model now
today we're going to talk about some of
the differences and similarities between
this one and the real model that's going
to be coming out next week so with that
said let's begin the unboxing and show
you guys the dummy model so the dummy
model gonna go ahead and pull it out of
the little box right here so you guys
can see it now the dummy model right off
the bat you guys can see it has an
aluminum back the real black model it
has a anodized slate back which is
slightly different color now the front
of the screen features a 7.9 inch screen
and this is going to be the same on all
models another thing that's going to be
the same is the 5 megapixel rear camera
now even though the white model which
will have a silver background similar to
this it will not have the black buttons
you see on this version it will actually
have silver buttons as well now
something different on the mock up dummy
model is it has two microphones that you
can see up above the Apple logo on the
real version there'll only be a single
microphone now the resolution on this
one is 1024 by 768 that's gonna be the
same on all the models even though some
doesn't actually currently work now I'm
going to be comparing this today to some
of the latest tablets and phablets that
have lately hit the market so now before
we jump into the actual comparisons
let's talk about two of the other things
that will be the same across all the new
iPad Mini one thing is the new thinner
bezel that we can see here and also the
Lightning port that's located down here
this will be the same on all models so
now let's compare these items form
factor for form factor across these
other similar items so here I'm going to
set this down
and then right next to it we have the
Nexus 7 didn't we have the Kindle Fire
and we have the latest Note 2 phablet
from Samsung now these two models right
here have 1280 by 800 resolution like I
said before that says 1024 by 768 but
this one has a 7.9 inch screen these
have 7 inch screens and the phablet here
by Samsung Note 2 is a 5.5 inch screen
now let's talk about comfort and
ergonomics now both the iPad Mini and
the Kindle are very very wide you can
see I'm going to try to turn them around
real quick for you folks how much it
takes at the hand space to hold these so
obviously we can't do any testing
because the iPad Mini is a dummy model
but just as far as sheer comfort goes I
got to give that to the Google Nexus 7
because it just feels more comfortable
my hand and I think I'd be able to hold
in my hand much longer without feeling
any discomfort alright folks so I hope
you liked this video no I actually have
absolutely zero need for this
I bought it more for shits and giggles
type of thing but with that said I know
that some of you out there would love to
get your hands on this because you can
play some serious pranks on your friends
with this bad boy so check it out I'm
gonna give this thing worldwide that's
right all you have to do is like this
video leave a comment down below and hey
you're in also make sure you subscribe
to the channel because if you're not
subscribe to the channel and I do an
announcement
you won't hear it and you may miss your
chance to win this so that's it folks
this is the little mock-up dummy I'll
have the new one in next Monday well
I'll be bringing you the full review
first look and unboxing until then peace
out and see you on the Sunday version of
tech of tomorrow oh by the way let's do
a little little crash test with this
thing shall we
cameraman here we go everybody
