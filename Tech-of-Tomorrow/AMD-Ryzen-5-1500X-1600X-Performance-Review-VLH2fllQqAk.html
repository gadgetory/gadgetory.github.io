world it's that time once again time for
some rise in action that's right this
time we're going to have the 1500 X and
the 1600 X on the table big difference
between the two well the one that's
under $200 $189 for the 1500 X fork or
eight thread great CPU for the price
then you're going to have the 1600 X bit
more expensive 249 but 6 cores 12
threads a lot of cool stuff here with
that said though let's just talk a
little bit about what this entire launch
is about obviously Intel has their i-5
line up and there's nothing right now
that's going to be able to be touched by
the Rison 1600 X and its price point
it's going to have more cores but the
thing is how often right now in today's
age is having six cores versus four
cores going to effects performance and
like a lot of the stuff you do now
obviously I know there will be a few
tasks out there that do it that's going
to take advantage of that but I don't
think across the board just having a
little bit more cores is going to be the
winning advantage right now but with
that said though let's jump in let's
check out these two brand new CPUs these
are both the x-series in fact everything
we're testing today is all x-series you
can call it the Battle of the exes and
all my exes don't live in Texas but hey
that's just the way it goes so let's
jump right in real quick let's check out
these two CPUs let's check out the
performance I told you guys the pricing
and stuff up front of all the people
like that but we'll talk a little more
about everything in the conclusion so
let's go so let's start out with a 16
100 X this is a 95 watt TDP CPU features
16 megabytes of level 3 cache 512 level
2 cache per core 3.6 gigahertz base
clock 3.7 gigahertz all core boost 4.0
gigahertz 2 core boost and 4.1 gigahertz
with xfr next up the risin 5 1500 X
never CPU has 65 Watts TDP there's 16
megabytes of level 3 cache 512 K level 2
cache per core this one has a 3.5
gigahertz base 3.6 gigahertz all core
boost 3.7 gigahertz or the 2 core boost
and 3.9 gigahertz with XFR so you guys
can see the really main difference that
I feel is the T
bb-because you don't have to send a lot
of voltage to your CPU to make a worker
that lends a lot of headroom for
overclocking so right now I just got to
say for me specs alone I don't see
really that much difference between the
two what I see is $189 versus two
hundred and forty nine dollars what do
you guys think so okay there's the
differences between CPUs and layman's
terms now as far as our test systems go
if you guys follow the challenge you
know that we previously built two badass
systems based on the rise in technology
the rise in seven we built an 1800 X
system and a 1700 X system one of them
was the phoenix rising system and the
other one is the producer those
decisions that we continued to test and
I know some people out there probably
wondering why I didn't use the lower you
know the be 350 chipset or whatever I
decide that since I already had the
scores going before with that chipset
we'd see how those CPUs looked in these
systems as it is I'll be building a
complete different system based on the
lower end motherboards and bringing
those systems and bill to the table but
for right now I want to be able to keep
everything with the 1,800 with the 1700
the 1600 and the 1500 all in the same
way for you guys to check out so with
that said you guys know the channel you
guys know the systems by the way we'll
have links down below if you guys want
to get more information about that but
that said let's jump in and let's
actually see what the gaming performance
differences are and a few wee bit of
things as far as doing up multitasking
stuff like that those let's rock
one thing definitely worth mentioning
the 1500 X even though it's only being
cooled on air is running incredibly cool
there's just so much room on the 1500 X
for upping that voltage and pumping that
bad-boy out to see what we can maximum
get out of that CPU I got to say this
1600 X it's doing pretty good but the
1500 X on air cooling you guys can see
the CPU is just running incredibly cool
and I'm quite impressed with that
because AMD is traditionally known to be
running things hot in fact if you guys
ever seen so my videos always make
little jokes about that and stuff and so
does everybody else
but it seems like AMD has turned the
tide and the 50 hundred X is one damn
cool running CPU alright folks so there
you have it pretty much the Battle of
the exes now in my opinion I'm thinking
the 1500 X is definitely a nice nice
nice nice
CPU under $200 Gaming scores only
slightly lower even the top-of-the-line
CPU even when you guys see the top of
line 1800 X all the way down to this you
can see there's only a few frames per
seconds and difference so if you're a
gamer and a streamer this is definitely
a CPU you want to check out especially
if you're on a budget let's in space
I've said it before a lot of people out
there we've now found that Egypt Jamaica
all kinds of people out there don't
really have access to technology
Australia very expensive stuff so when
you got to pay big bucks out of your
pocket to get technology I know what you
want to get the absolute best bang for
your buck my next video I'm going to
focus on is doing all the overclocking
I've never been focusing all that too
much stuff lately to be quite honest all
you folks I've had serious health issues
lately have not been feeling that good I
don't think I've done my absolute best
but I'm going to try to shoot for better
in the future but for right now you guys
can see the differences between these
CPUs all the way down from top to bottom
not that much of a difference as far as
gaming goes whatsoever and like I said
you can overclock these CPUs they're
doing ok they're not doing the best in
the world from what I'm seeing you know
everything's you know a little bit
different every CPUs a little bit
different results are going to vary
obviously with new technology with new
drivers with new processing stuff that's
coming out hopefully with all that
you'll get better overclocking results
in the future we're going to do all of
our clocking stuff tomorrow so we'll
bring you all those CPUs do overclock
and see the difference
all dedicated but at the end of the day
I have to say my personal favorite out
of this bunch is definitely the 15-under
ex like I said price versus performance
you can overclock this thing right of
the box it doesn't conceal halfway
decent overclocking if you want to go
ahead and get crazy with liquid cooling
and all that stuff I'm sure results will
be even better so thanks for watching
Tekken tomorrow I'm mark thanks for
checking out the channel I hope you guys
like this video like I said men AMD has
a lot of releases out Vegas coming
around the corner too so you guys who
are out there who are strict AMD fans
you've got a lot of to be looking
forward to sons we'll see you back here
on Tekken tomorrow like usual underneath
that like button all the information if
you're not sub you know what to do and
turn on those notifications because you
want to be notified to this video he's
here for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
