tomorrow apple just wrapped up their
worldwide developers conference in san
francisco california where be introduced
iOS 8 Mac OS X Yosemite and a bunch of
new developer tools to make developers
very happy for making all the
applications now this year we actually
kept it all software based so there was
no hardware announced at the World Wide
Developers Conference a good for Apple
for making it a true Developers
Conference it's kind of bad for us
because we wanted a 4k display and they
didn't announce it so no but these are
my top 5 features from both iOS 8 and
Mac OS X Yosemite I'm gonna start
reverse with mac OS x yosemite because I
was more impressed with its over iOS 8
now i'm actually pretty impressed with
both of them but Mac OS X Yosemite is
probably the best version of mac OS x
men I've seen so far and the first one
is going to be Notification Center now
obviously Notification Center has always
been on Mac OS X since Mavericks but now
if you've actually revamped the way it
looks and it looks a little bit more
flat definitely more in line of iOS 8
and iOS 7 and they've also added the
same tab you between today and also
notifications so it's definitely going
to be a little bit easier for anyone who
uses iOS and Mac so because it looks
exactly the same now number two on the
list would be spotlight search now
spotlights Ben and Mac OS X for quite
some time but they've revamped the way
you search you actually when you hit the
search bar it will actually come down
like Google so it looks exactly like
google com and it will search through
your Mac you'll search through your
iTunes collections iTunes stores it will
do online so you have like things like
Wikipedia coming up it's definitely a
great unified search I'm sure it's going
to be powerful for quite a lot of people
if you're doing research papers or
whatever it's definitely gonna be a cool
tool and it does look really slick when
you're using it on Mac OS X my number
three would be male on Mac OS X Yosemite
now male has never really been a great
application for any Mac and any time
just because it's not that great at all
it's actually pretty terrible
I bet they've made it a little bit more
I guess flat more in line with iPad and
iPhone they've added things like you can
actually upload larger files up to i
believe 5 gigabytes so i can like upload
my youtube video and the way it sends it
is it actually sends the email portion
just normally and it will upload that to
iCloud and it will send the recipients a
download link to securely download that
file so it's definitely great to see
that my number 4 would be a new revamp
Safari now this one looks absolutely
beautiful i'm not exactly sure what
they've done to it looks very similar to
the ipad application and man it looks
super super sexy and super slick it's
basically transparent like you know if
you're going through your actual content
you'll see the transparent going through
the menu bar they've made the menu bar
the search bar on the top really really
small really easy to navigate we've
added favorites into a search bar and
they just made it a much better
experience on Safari I've actually run
into a couple problems so far it's after
like three hours of using safari on the
new mac OS x but it looks really good at
I can't wait to see it in its final form
at later this year my number five and
probably the most exciting feature of
Mac OS X Yosemite would be continuity
now that word sounds really interesting
and it means a heck of a lot for Apple
now Mac OS X Yosemite adds this new
feature where you can basically really
connect all of your devices your iPhone
your iPad and your Mac all together so
basically for for an example I'm writing
a message or an email all my mac and I
just had to go out and get some gas I
can actually pick up right from where I
left off now this is across the whole
system of iCloud so this is an
incredible feature but I'm just really
really wanting to use it's not working
so far on my on my iOS 8 and aback OS X
Yosemite but in practice it looks
greatly debuted or they showed it off at
double W DC and it looked fantastic so I
can't wait to use that now let me switch
my focus on to iOS 8 now iOS 8 is
basically a revamped iOS 7 looks pretty
much identical to iOS 7 the first one I
want to talk about we've a new messages
application
you can actually add audio messages you
can add video messages right from the
message you also have little things like
you can actually manage your group
messages so if you ever getting caught
one of those and it's almost endless
takes like 5 for 7 days for you to
actually kill that Finn you can actually
manage that if you created it you can
put people on off you can get yourself
out if you're in it it's definitely a
great thing and I'm sure a lot of people
can relate when they get into those
group messages now my number to be quick
type it's a new predictive keyboard from
Apple now this is going to be one of the
smarter ones it's actually going to not
only read what you're writing but also
read your messages so the example that
Apple showed off here is if you want to
go to dinner and a movie and some of the
responses you get before you even typing
would be a dinner or movie or whatever
so that would be really cool and I can't
wait to actually use it in practice so
far it's been okay I guess it takes some
time to actually learn how you speak in
terms of professionally or just casually
to your friends or your co-workers then
one figure I've noticed so far it
doesn't really interrupt your text
messaging just because it's above the
normal keyboard and then it make the
keyboard smaller it basically just added
a little bit more to the keyboard and
you can turn that service off if you
hate predictive text messaging I'm kind
of like that but I really want to try it
out to see how it works over the next
couple days now my number three would be
interactive notifications from iOS 8
this is pretty much as simple as it gets
you get a message or an email you
dragged down from notification bar you
can actually reply to that right in the
notification bar you don't have to go to
the application it's simple it's easy
and it's one of the great features it's
basically lifted off for mac OS x
mavericks of its notification bar reply
system number four is something i've
been waiting for since iOS 7 basically
the iphone 5s touch ID expansion so
finally Apple will be opening up their
api's for third party application
developers so think about like Amazon
eBay all the stores you can use on your
phone will be able to get access to
touch ID now I won't actually have that
verification in terms of getting your
fingerprint but it can use that as a
password to do your own account so that
will be great I can't wait to see that
integration roll out to future
applications I wanted to have it on ebay
on Amazon Amazon will be deadly for me
actually so maybe not but it will be cut
very soon to third-party applications
pretty much when iOS 8 rolls out later
this fall now my number five would be
health now there is a new application
called health it wasn't called health
book or anything and it's basically not
about I watch at all it's actually just
integrating all your health services
like if you have a jawbone up a Fitbit a
Nike FuelBand if you have those
third-party applications and hardware
you that application can actually just
tap into all that information and give
you a unified health application this
sounds incredibly awesome for everything
I mean just thinking about it if you
have different applications to do your
calories the food intake how many miles
you run you can add all those
applications into one application and
there you have you don't have to use
your applications it would be incredible
I can't wait to use it i actually have a
jawbone up so i'll be testing out and
seeing how much actual data i get if you
guys would like to see some kind of
video on behalf application because it's
up in close and dear to my heart let me
know in the comments below and i will
definitely make a video about that in
the near future there you have it those
are my top five features for both iOS 8
and Mac OS X Yosemite leave me any
questions in the comments below make
sure to give this video a thumbs up if
you liked it and follow me on Twitter or
some of you questions on twitter app
marvel and hannah and i'll catch you
guys in the next video
and be
