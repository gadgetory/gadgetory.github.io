know the general rule of thumb is if
you've got the extra cash you always
want to buy the biggest baddest video
card for your gaming experience that you
can get your hands on at this moment
that is the paschal version of the Titan
X but what if you learn those people who
doesn't have just a bunch of money to
throw at one of those cards you know
they're like twelve thirteen hundred
dollars maybe you get to use them for a
grand but still there are a lot of money
many people out there bought the gtx
1070 it was a great card it performed
well at a good price point now can two
of these cards though in sli totally
kick ass
against the pascal version of the titan
eggs let's see hey folks just a real
quick note before we actually jump in
and check out the test system in the
benchmarks we tested some games in
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 because we
just weren't seeing any type of scaling
at all in DX 12 and that's going to
happen because not all games have caught
up and obviously there'll be some games
that just don't scale at all and SLI and
that's just how it is real quick though
let's just check out the test system we
have an i7 6700 K we keep it on turbo
mode running at 4.4 all the time we also
have an asrock motherboard this is the Z
170 this is the overclocked version we
also have 16 gigabytes of G skills rip
job memory we're also using Windows 10
and the latest drivers that were
available at the time of this testing
with that said though let's rock out and
let's check out those benches to the
benchmark song
you
all right so there you have it you guys
can see on when it scales well SLI kicks
ass and even beats the Pascal version of
the tight necks in minigames across the
board obviously not every game out there
is going to scale and that's one of the
things why they say you know by the
absolute best card that you can if you
have the money because you're gonna get
the best performance but when SLI works
it really kicks ass and you guys can see
in those games it scales very very well
not everything in DirectX 12 has caught
up so we're not seeing great scaling
across the board with that yet but as
drivers change in dx12 matures I'm sure
we're going to see much better results
in SLI all the way across the board so
I'm Miller you guys been watching techni
tomorrow like usual all the information
about these cards will be down there
below that like button hopefully you
guys like this and you guys can see that
too 10 70s can definitely cripple the
giant Goliath of the Titan decks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
