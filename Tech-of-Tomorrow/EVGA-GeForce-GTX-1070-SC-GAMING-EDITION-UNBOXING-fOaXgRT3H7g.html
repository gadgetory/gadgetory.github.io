care once again on TECA tomorrow to
bring you guys an old-school unboxing
which basically means taking the
out of the box what are we a boxing
today it's something for the folks over
at EVGA gtx 1070 superclocked Edition so
let's see what's in the freaking box
alright so I cannae unboxing well if
you're gonna have to open the box so
usually like to use big crazy knives but
I think with this one I should be able
to just take the little plastic piece
over here and pull it off to the side
and then remove the card pretty simple
there we go no hard eight there nice and
simply alright now II BJ's famous they
always have nice big plastic packaging
inside there something you guys can see
that they're just stuff tumbles out of
the box I think there's also a poster in
here so I'll set that down we'll get to
that but as far as the box itself those
folks I mean for those folks who really
really care about the box I mean I'm
just gonna show it to you real quick
there was this part of the box and I
mean there was pretty much this part of
the box and that was really it so I mean
most people really care about the box
anyway so we'll just set that off the
side what's really important is the
content so inside of here we've got one
cable so we'll go ahead and open this up
to you folks and see what's inside of
there and jump that out alright we've
got 2 6 been to an 8 pin so obviously
this car is going to have a single 8 pin
connection which will be good for power
draw and better than just a standard 6
pin that's for sure anybody you know who
thinks different let us know down below
but I think the extra power will be
great for overclocking here we've got
some more stickers and stuff from people
over at the EVGA nice little case badge
there as well in case you're interested
in then building up your case and making
a look cool give this other stuff out of
the way they also give instructions on
how to do SLI and how to install your
card and with these new cards you know
that you have to have the newer faster
SLI bridges and actually you get the
full speed so make sure if you have
older SLI bridges that you'll take note
of that because you'll need a newer
bridge just some more nomenclature just
some more information once again the
graphics card I don't even know if there
is a CD in here for the drivers lately
I'm EBG
give me a CD because pretty much
downloading the drivers on line gets you
the latest greatest drivers and that's
what we're all going to do anyways in
this new digital online world so that's
that and then lastly we have the poster
I don't know if I can pull the whole
poster out here if you guys can see it
we'll try to show you guys a little bit
of it though because it's what comes
inside the box so I think I got it kind
of upside down let me spin it around but
uh I'm just gonna show you get is this
part of it right here I think you guys
can probably see pretty much most of
this so this looks really nice it's
gonna be a great poster from the wall in
fact let me hear you guys as votes down
below would you guys like to see me put
this in the wall behind me as part of
our wall decoration if so leave me a
comment down below with the hashtag go
EVGA right on
so we'll get past that um some of the
things about this card is the card is
overclocked it has a 1590 for megahertz
base clock and a 1784 megahertz Bhoots
clock and obviously with the AC ex 3.0
cooling you're gonna get to take that
sucker even a little farther now as we
take the card out of here
this card is slightly bigger than a
founded Edition car it is slightly did
pop this up so you can see everything on
top is really really beautiful in the
card you've got two of the AC X fans got
heat things here for more stuff to just
you know dissipate all that heat away
from the card it's nice looking a lot of
people said before that they didn't like
the color scheme I don't know why these
pretty much color schemes will go with
any type of build it doesn't matter
whether your build is red black green
purple whatever black and silver pretty
neutral colors it'll go with anything so
you go in just pop this bad boy out of
here boom all righty now this part has
eight gigabytes of gddr5 memory 256
point three gigabytes of memory
bandwidth take a look at the side of the
card you guys can see though that this
card has all of the heat fins all on the
side here and there's heat pipes
actually running throughout the card as
well this is what helps the card keep
running cool when you're pushing it at
max
for gaming so up here on top we have the
SC logo which means super clock and EVGA
all of this up here lights up and you
can change the colors and all that stuff
on top we have a set of SLI fingers you
guys can see those clearly right there
on top of a pair of them now
Nvidia says that you can do whatever you
want with your time for doing SLI but
they are only saying that with two cards
it's where you get your maximum
performance levels and that's what they
natively recommend doing however like I
said you can do what you want and
there's also a single 8 pin power
connector located here as well this will
add more to the card a lot of the other
cards that we saw that were found
edition only offered a 6 pin power
connector this 8 pin power connector
will actually add a little bit more
power the card allowing for better
overclocking one of my absolute favorite
things about the cards though like usual
is this awesome backplate keeps the car
protected I'm smacking around or from
you getting your hand cut on anything on
it I like it
I'm glad EVGA has on this card on the
very end of the card you guys can see
the heat pipe is curving around right
here and you clearly see once again the
EVGA nomenclature stating it's their
card so as far as how big the card is
the card side is in 10.5 inches long 4.3
inches high and features a dual slot
design and this is slightly bigger than
the founders Edition cards and lastly as
far as the connections go with the vgs c
edition you get a single DVID connection
a single HDMI connection and three
display boards and the card also comes
with a very cool three-year warranty so
all right folks that's what came inside
of the box of the brand-new EVGA gtx
1070 superclocked edition if you guys
want more information about this card or
want to purchase one they'll be
information down below that like button
and you know what to do there and if
you're not subbed and they like what you
see the name sub by the way we just got
moved and we're still not totally
balanced out so you might see a bunch of
different filming locations as we figure
out we're doing but eventually we'll be
back on track for you folks I know
you've been watching the channel we'll
see you back here for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
