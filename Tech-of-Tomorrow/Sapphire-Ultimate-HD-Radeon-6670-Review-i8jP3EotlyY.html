Elric Faris here once again on the tech
of tomorrow YouTube channel today we're
taking a look at an entry-level video
card from the people over at sapphire
this is their new sapphire ultimate 6670
card now this card is very entry-level
card it's basically gonna be coming to
the market it's just a little bit over
$100
it features passive cooling in my
unboxing as it didn't have any cooling I
was incorrect it actually has passive
cooling what passive cooling means it as
a giant heatsink that's on top dissipate
the heat away from the GPU but it does
not contain any active or moving parts
type of things also there's a nice
package to come to this you actually get
a free copy of dirt 3 someone actually
emailed me yesterday and actually asked
me how do you activate the code there's
a couple ways usually to the Sapphire
website you have to go on and actually
log in to their website become where
they're select Club members or you can
just go on to Steam and activate the
code so it's pretty easy for now let's
just go ahead and let's move in take a
look at the card see the performance of
it and at the end of the day why you
would want this card in your system so
now we're gonna move on we're gonna take
a look at the card itself like I said
earlier this is a passive cooling
solution you can see there's a giant
heatsink and there are heat pipes the
heat pipes have oil inside of them and
what happens is the heat gathers inside
of these pipes anything goes into these
heat tubes to be dissipated away from
the GPU to keep the card cool without
any moving parts at all those who like
silent PCs this is going to be a very
excellent solution for those people you
can see the heatsink goes all the way
around has this sapphire branding logo
right there on top spinning the card
around once you guys see the back of the
card the card is pretty much a single
PCI slot it's going to probably almost
take up two slots just because the width
of the fan but it's actually a pretty
small card it's very short as well as
you can see so it will fit in a lot of
those mini systems as well the cards not
long whatsoever get you guys take
another look at the heat pipes there the
rear i/o it's kind of different
it features hdmi displayport and a
single DVI connector there's no more
old-school VGA connector whatsoever on
this card at all so you can see that so
it's pretty good the cards really small
has a nice passive cooler on it good
options here for those building
and disbelieved now excuse me for those
people who were building a computer
that's going to be used for a media
center and stuff like that this has all
the stuff that you're going to need also
because of the fact that has no moving
parts if you can actually keep us in a
system that has a well ventilated area
this card will be sufficient but one
thing to take note if you are using this
card in your system you want to make
sure that you do have appropriate air
flow which I means a computer usually
has suction in from the front and then
it has ejection from the rear of your
case so make sure you a proper airflow
going through your case if you're using
this card otherwise it probably will
overheat so we're going to just come
over here this is everything all right
over here about the camera just readjust
this real quick here this is everything
basically that comes inside the box I
know we did the unboxing before I'm not
gonna do an unboxing just to show you
guys that here's all this stuff here so
here we show you basically a bulleted
out section of what the features are of
this card before we actually move into
seeing the card itself so now let's move
on to the performance of the card and
see how it does against the competitors
okay so you guys have seen it we know
that this card is a very passive cooled
card no moving parts this is good for
people who want to have a computer
that's a very silent PC friend of mine
Eric de Silva lives in Florida owns a
company called silent PC this is
something that he would really be
inspired by having in one of his
companies and one of the systems he
builds because their whole thing is
silence so if you're somebody who only
wants to spend within a hundred to one
hundred and thirty dollars you're an
entry-level video game player you're not
really too hardcore intense with with
giant monitors whirring Billy on the
latest deal 3d first-person shooter
games this car will play pretty good if
you're planning on playing the old
crisis and stuff like that
this card is only gonna play those at
low frame rates also if for anybody who
has basically a 19 inch monitor below
this car will be perfect for you the
resolutions offered on those monitors
will be perfectly represented by the
features on this card
so if basically that's it if you're an
entry-level gamer you want a silent card
and one thing also to note the thing
does come with dirt three now this game
is probably going to be like $49 $39 in
the internet so you actually have to
take that in consideration when buying
this card one thing to make sure if
you're doing the sapphire you want to
also make sure that you join up the
Sapphire select Club so that you get
their benefits and knee of the offers
that they offer you guys so at the end
of the day I think this is a really good
card for those people who want something
that's quiet works pretty well for
entry-level has a small monitor and is
on a pretty tight budget for gaming so
they're a habit see you back here once
again on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
