on tech of tomorrow just want to tell
the world everybody out there to have a
happy new year now I know that 2012 for
almost everybody I know was a really
really shitty crappy year so many deaths
so many people lost their jobs so many
people went financially under 2012 I got
something for you and this is it 2012
was a shitty year I'm much looking
forward to 2013 I hope all of you out
there are as well like usual in 2013
we're gonna have all kinds of
interesting stuff coming up I know you
guys are asking for all the tutorials on
how to videos I'm just trying to find a
way to do them without taking forever
being boring like couple guys said why
don't I do system builds well we build a
system it usually takes like three hours
to do I don't really think you guys want
to sit to a three hour pc video I also
been hearing some clem plants from
people saying we're not doing enough PC
stuff well guys we had to really change
the pc market is shrinking all the time
and as that market shrinks I lose
audience so I needed to really change it
up and do a lot more products to be
competitive and a lot of you people out
there really do appreciate it for those
people out there who are strictly pc
people will get a little bad taste their
stomach I apologize ma'am but this is
just the way of the future now that's
not saying that we're not going to do PC
because obviously we are when I left
motherboards org I maintained all of my
contacts all of my sponsors they really
got so all that stuff's still going
to be seen here on the channel we're
just trying to figure out a way to gear
it all up and bring it to you guys in a
really easy digestible matter that you
guys will enjoy and will enjoy as well
all kinds of great things come up in
2013 though we have great contest we
have full system builds we're going to
be giving away and all kinds of just
great stuff going on so I hope 2013 is
better for me I hope it's better for you
god bless all of you and your families I
wish all of you the most happiest
happiest of wishes and for all those
people out there supporting me through
all the changes you know I love you and
we're here for you on TECA tomorrow
so make sure you that like button for
2013 and let's all enjoy it together see
you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
