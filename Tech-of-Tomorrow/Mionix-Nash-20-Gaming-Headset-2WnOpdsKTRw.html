tomorrow bringing you guys another
accessory review and today we're taking
a look at another product from my annex
now if you've been keeping up with these
videos you'll have seen a previous
review on another product called the AV
or gaming mouse witchers from them as
well and today we're looking at a
headset called the nash 20 now we're
going to talk about how comfortable it
is it looks aesthetics form factor and
how the mic and sound quality are to let
you know whether or not it's worth its
price tag of 129 99 so let's check it
out today on tech of tomorrow
okay so first off let's talk about
aesthetics how does the Nash 20 look
well it's definitely from the same
company as the avior because there's a
lot of similarities going on here in
terms of design philosophy it's very
simple and straightforward which is
something you may or may not like a lot
of giving heads these days rely on LEDs
or flashy colors or really kind of neat
little colorful designs to make it
really stand out and unique whereas this
headset is much more basic than that
it's all a very simple matte black it
does have the my index logo on the ear
cups but it's just an etching there's no
color going on and the only time you're
not seeing black is on the top of the
headband where it has the name Nash 20
in white and green lettering now in all
honesty for me personally I'm not a big
fan of how this headset looks I
understand the point is for it to be
very basic and not overly flashy but
it's just too plain for my taste
personally you need just a little bit of
flash to help make a headset look unique
and I just don't get that feeling from
this headset now of course aesthetics
are a very subjective thing so you might
think I'm full of crap right now you
might like how it looks in which case
doesn't matter good for you but the main
point is I just not a fan of how simple
it looks but of course aesthetics are a
very secondary concern compared to how
it actually performs so let's start
talking about what other features this
headset has to offer now before we start
talking about Mike and audio quality I
want to talk about form factor and
comfort which are two things the Nash 20
does an excellent job of in terms of
cushioning it has an 18 millimeter foam
layer on the headband and 22 millimeter
foam ear cups all of which use memory
foam and the ear cups are designed to
slightly swivel in all directions so it
can adjust a little to accommodate the
shape of your head as a result the Nash
20 is able to lie comfortably on your
head and I was able to wear it for quite
a few hours of any real sense of
discomfort or irritation the only thing
I did notice is that the ear cups are a
bit on the snug side which is both a
good and bad thing the upside is that it
does a great job of insulating game
sound so you're able to hear everything
really clearly and it adds a lot more
impact the downside of this however is
for those of you out there that have
larger than average ears because it's
going to end up being a lot tighter on
you and so you're going to lose out on
that comfort factor so that is one thing
to look out for every ears are a little
above average in terms of size now one
of my favorite aspects of the Nash 20 is
how they designed them
phone at first glance it's really simple
it's just a flip-up flip down design and
it's just flexible enough to be useful
but not the most flexible you can push
it a little forward or pull it a little
in but it's really cool about it is how
they combine to mike controls with it if
you want to mute the microphone you just
put it in the flip top position so if
you're in game chat you need to take a
moment to yell something to someone in
your house you just flip the microphone
up do what you need to do and then flip
it back down to re-enter chat which is
really intuitive another design choice
they made that similar to this is its
audio controls which have the volume
dial located on the back of the left
earcup rather than on inline control so
you always know exactly where the volume
controls are now of course on other
headsets depending on cable length that
might not be that big of a deal having
to search the cable but in the case of
this headset where you have a 2 meter
long cable that could get really
annoying so having it right on that left
ear cup is really convenient as I said
earlier I'm not a huge fan of how the
Nash 20 looks but as far as the form
factor goes it's excellent now as for
sound quality the Nash 20 offers solid
performance with 50 millimeter neodymium
drivers for speakers now I tested this
on a couple of different games mostly
FPS titles where you get the most lots
of just different loud noises happening
at once and everything came through nice
and clean I will note that there are a
little less basically than most other
gaming headsets so things like
explosions aren't going to have the same
impact they would otherwise but as far
as practical things go like directional
hearing or just being able to hear
everything going on on the battlefield
they do their job really well now as for
the my quality we're going to let you
hear that for yourself so we've done
this before in previous headset reviews
all the sound you're hearing right now
is being recorded by the headset itself
and not by my pin mic so what everything
you're hearing right now is basically
what other people will hear when you're
talking to them over chat now like I
said earlier one of the nice little
features about this headset is the fact
that flipping the mic up is what mutes
it so when I do this
well now you're able to hear me again as
I said earlier this is one of my
favorite little features of the headset
because it's just a really intuitive
convenient way for you to mute the mic
off and on without having to deal with
any kind of switch or button so all that
being said I really do think the Nash 20
is worth its MSRP of 129 99 it is a
little bit on the high side to be sure
but I think its performance warrants it
there's a lot of flashy ER headsets out
there on the market if you want
something that looks cool but as far as
brute performance goes this thing really
does XL mic and sound quality are
excellent the earcups do a great job of
insulating everything it's really
comfortable and like i said i love that
form factor the only warning i have as i
said earlier is that if your ears are a
little larger than average it might be
too tight for you and you'll lose out on
that comfort but otherwise this is a
really comfy headset and a great choice
