take a Tomorrowland it's me L Rick Fehr
is here back in the Tecla tomorrow
YouTube channel bringing you guys an
unboxing sorry I've been a little bit
lagging doing the videos over here we
kind of like juggle like who's doing
what around here so like we get to
things last but today we've got a cool
unboxing
I hate lately a bought a 60-inch TV you
guys saw we did the videos the iPhone or
thing playing games everything well I
kind of thought that my sound was
lagging for like the last 15 years I've
had the same receiver and it only has
basic features plus it only worked with
an optical cable I didn't really have
any great options so that said I wanted
to go out and get something that I could
hook up through my HDMI cable and get
all of the great features that are
offered with that now today I'll be
doing the RX v 671 there's an 875 watt
AV receiver from the folks over at
yamaha nope they're not my friends I
actually went out to Best Buy spending
500 bucks and bought this thing because
I really want to have something really
good but it's got a lot of features in
it has a lot of HDMI connections and one
thing that's most importantly for me
anyways was having a pass-through
ability which means that if the unit was
turned off even if you still want to use
your DVD player or your blu-ray player
with your TV you could still do it and
not use this unit I went out and bought
a pioneer unit yesterday not to talk
 but I think blue I would
never buy another pioneer product after
seeing that I mean worst thing 3 hours
of the connections turned it on popped
that said let's go back to the unboxing
whoops Kim Yamaha RX v 675 1/8 175 watt
AV receiver and has lots of great
connections you can even like hook up
this thing and use it as like a receiver
in your house for these like Sirius
radio you can hook up your iPod to it
your iPhone and you have that stuff like
that so you guys all know when you get a
box comes all well packed I'm just gonna
go ahead and just turn this thing
slightly to the side in fact you know
what I'm gonna start pulling stuff out
slowly so let off the bat we get to
remote control I'm gonna pull it out and
just put it over here so you guys and
get a good look at this real first it
scum you trippin kind of unboxing here
kind of experiment some new ideas but
here's the remote control I'm just going
to go ahead and set this off
because you guys know the remote control
is this thing right here though I want
to talk about this this is really cool
this is a microphone that you actually
plug in to your system and then you set
your system up and it'll totally set
your entire room for perfect sound you
don't have to do anything at all you
just plug this in and you go on with it
maybe I'll even make a video that it's
really cool I like that then we've got
the instruction guides all that stuff
and we've even got a cable if you guys
still want to use like you know am/fm
radio you just tear this open you guys
still want to use am/fm radio whoa all
right I think this is actually the stand
that goes to this is the thing rather
here's the antenna pretty cool stuff
here are the batteries actually for the
remote they were somewhere else in there
buried I'm throwing those across the
room I'm crazy today woohoo I'm trying
to pull this off without breaking it or
anything but yeah like I was saying if
you were in the living room with this
with this ant you would be able to play
all your videos and stuff in the living
room I'm trying I hit the microphone all
right I did it
success crazies I'm holding my baby all
right let me get the box out of there
give this thing and set it back out of
here aren't these nice and ugly out
we'll just bang my need a second hurt
man all right container here here we
take a look at the back of the v6 71 as
you can see over here we've got lots of
connections for everything all of your
old-school connectors if you want to do
it old school analog you have all those
here you have your rj45 so in case you
want to connect to your internet like we
talked about before lots of connections
here all of your HDMI connects here so
your blu-ray your DVD you need that
they'll all be connected through these
devices here and then this will go out
to your TV for your speakers and
everything you can see all kinds of
different connections here for surround
sound 7.1 Center speakers and everything
else this thing is fully fleshed out to
do anything that you need I really like
this has lots of stuff we can use
I'll actually have the specs if I can
just stuck up in the video so you guys
can see all the natural specs but
basically this thing is going to be a
really cool unit it comes with
everything out of the box stuff your
HDMI connection cables so basically just
plug it in hook all the stuff up into it
and then I'll see how it sounds
I'll give you guys another update video
but today I'm just doing the unboxing I
mean this rx v6 71 is looking to be a
really good unit at $500 it's not priced
to be like a super high-end it's
actually considered mid end but a lot of
the features that are on this thing are
supposed to be geared for like the way
higher-end online if you look at Amazon
you look at Best Buy in place that are
selling online this is actually the
highest rated one when I went into the
store the guy tried to sell me some
other one that's there was a lot more
money but when it came down to it all
around just more things said good stuff
about this amp this is the unboxing
thanks for watching Tekken 2 bar and
I'll see you guys later as I give you
guys a review about this app and how it
works in my surround sound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
