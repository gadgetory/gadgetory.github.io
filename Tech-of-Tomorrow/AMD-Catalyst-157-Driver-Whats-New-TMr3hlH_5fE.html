welcome back once again to tech of
tomorrow what's going on we'll check it
out last week and you release all of
their latest line of a video cards
including the fury x2 a very very eager
audience now at that time it competed
pretty much head and head with a gtx 980
TI hmm but now on the heels of that is
brand new information what's that
information will check it out new
drivers catalyst 15.7 omega drivers now
these omega drivers are supposed to
bring great performance for all of the
latest cards from these folks over at
AMD so you people out there who we're
going to hate that last driver wasn't
too happy we'll check it out Omega is
here and it's bringing a lot of things
to the table that'll hopefully bring it
not only great gaming in Windows 10 but
also just bring gaming all the way
around better performance with their
latest cards so right off the bat what
did you guys think of that teaser system
of the blue fury right off the bat I
want to hear a comment I want you guys
to hit that like button like a crazy
bunch of psychopaths if you're digging
the way this system is going now check
it out last week mu released their brand
new line of video cards a whole bunch of
new cards including the fury X which
actually a very eager audience pretty
much accepted but the game is going to
change just a little bit now last week
all the things seemed to test like oh my
god it was just barely keeping up with
the 980 TI oh my god well Windows 10 is
now hitting the table with Windows 10 is
going to be direct x 12 a lot of people
are going to be going hope I'm jumping
on to windows 10 I myself I'm going to
do it just as well I kind of skipped the
8.1 and all that stuff but alright with
windows 10 I'm caving in now with this
brand new driver which is code name
Omega
it's actually 15.7 catalyst driver it's
going to address all of these things and
it should bring all the performance with
the fury action all of these AMD cards
much better performance all around so
real quick let's just talk about this
new 15.7 driver what's bringing to the
table and why you AMD fan should I check
out down below and to download it for
yourself Windows 10 is in the now and
AMD is ready to integrate their products
into wind 10 friendly environment and
the catalyst drivers are ready to roll
out right alongside with the launch of
wind 10 if you miss my video the fury X
some of the things that we talked about
were f RT C or frame rate target control
which allows the users are throttle back
in the cards usage when the cards frame
rates exceed the refresh rate of the
monitor allowing the car to cut back
there for saving power allowing the car
to run cooler but let's say that you
have a super duper high end video card
but your monitor doesn't quite match
them to refresh rate so you can actually
push the video card to getting 110
frames per second but if your monitor
only has 60 well you can only really see
60 so it's just a waste of time and
throttling back in the card will
actually overclock that card because
it'll be using less power so therefore
it's kind of a neat little thing how it
exacts it's going to work and how well
to work but we'll see as time goes by
but it is interesting there will also be
updated precinct support which like
g-sync allows you to set your VGA cars
refresh rate to match that of your
monitor so pretty much it'll set your
frames per second at 60 just like your
monitors refresh rate at 60 this will
eliminate all screen tearing and allow
your game to run much smoother the
catalyst 15.7 driver offers support
upgrades from any GPU from the r9 to 60
and above and for AP used from the 7400
k hannover put in your neck what about
if you're a software developer
the candle is 15.7 driver healthy for
those who need support for that Avenue
of application AMD's Cody XL 1.8 will
help software developers by allowing a
host of options including OpenGL shader
CPU profiling has profiler and more as
well as the AMD GPU / studio 3.3 which
is a GPU performance analysis and
debugging tool for gaming and graphics
applications alright folks so there you
have it AMD's latest driver the omega
catalyst 15.7 has now hit the street so
you guys can download that and see for
yourself how much performance gains it's
going to bring to the table full review
we've got it in house we're going to
retest our fear reactions and see how
they do and see how much performance you
get from catalyst 15.7 but you guys can
see it seems like AMD has really thought
this driver out quite a bit they've kind
of got their chest out and pounding it
right now this driver saying we are back
with our driver hey all the information
will be down below I mellor if you've
been watching teka DeMar peanuts up do
it see you
and be
he will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
