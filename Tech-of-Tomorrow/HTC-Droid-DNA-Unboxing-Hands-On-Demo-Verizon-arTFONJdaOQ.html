we do the unboxing and first look of the
droid DNA I am Eric welcome to tech of
tomorrow let's begin dog show
alright folks so let's start off with
the box the droid DNA 4G LTE certified
for verizon now that a contract this
thing's like 800 bucks with a contract
to about 200 bucks really big thing
about this phone though folks is the
1920 x 1080 screen like that is
incredible it's the new super lcd3 type
screen here in the back we'll to see the
box real quick I'm going to bring it up
here close to the Camerons so we can
readjust real quick it just tells you
the package contents we're going to go
over them as we unbox it anyways but
some people like that stuff so we'll
bring it back down to the table again
I'll go ahead and begin unboxing it
could pop it out of here thing features
a quad-core Snapdragon processor 1.5
gigahertz crate and Adreno 320 that's
the GPU go ahead and pop this little bad
boy out of here so here's the phone
itself 5-inch screen super lcd3
technology unbelievable 1920 x 1080
resolution the first to hit the American
stores so on top we have the power on
button right next to that we have the
sim card slot and then the headphone
jack now there are two cameras on this a
8-megapixel rear and a 2.1 megapixel
front on the side we have the volume
rockers we bring that up there closer is
probably a little bit difficult to see
because it actually blends so well into
the phone spinning around down to the
bottom here is your USB connections
microUSB flip around to the other side
nothing but nice clean elegance there to
put around to the back HTC 4g
ate beans by Duane hold on cameramen
beats by dre what's this beats by dre
thing all right that's it folks where's
the nearest trash can I am going to
throw this now I'm just kidding all
right learning ways folks like I said
the really the biggest feature of all is
that this is the first 1080p ever screen
to hit the United States in the little
phone sighs and that's the big thing
about it so obviously you folks are
going to want to see me turn this bad
boy on so let me go ahead and peel off
this plastic take that off quit it the
button here on top we're going to go
ahead and we're going to give you a demo
of how the screen looks so we'll go over
here in to YouTube we've got our latest
Google Video going on here
so you guys can see it looks really
really clean jump on back out of there
so now let's move on let's take a look
at the rest of stuff that comes in the
box go ahead and take this out yes we
got going on on here let's get this up
here all right then so open it up says
start here go ahead and pull that out
now up here on top we have the sim tray
removal tool you can see that right here
go ahead and pull that little bad boy
out of there that touch always pull this
whole thing out of here actually what
else is in here ah we have an nco a key
conceal a key any on takers on that one
think it's a start here all right global
support information and calling card
Consumer Affairs information about
radiofrequency emissions and responsible
driving so basically don't talk on your
phone and text why you're driving
because you could crash and kill
yourself or someone else let's loved by
someone in Sumer look at that look that
is I Bluff a little bit of it up left
bit limited laughs anyways you get back
over here the important consumer
information and the product safety
warranty information the sim card which
obviously we put in before the unboxing
obviously because we want to be to have
it up and running so you guys could see
it but that's what it came in and that
little tool up here on top which I was a
not trying to rip and tear I was failing
to remove from the box must be
underneath here somewhere so obvious for
me and my big cave man hands removing
the trading rule thing was not as simple
as possible I actually got it there now
as you guys can see I'm kind of clumsy
there but ok now I have it out here and
here it is and let me try to get a view
of that for you guys the HTC sometimes
it's not so easy a caveman can do it
because I'm like Captain kayvyun they
can't do it so continue moving on and
I'm going to tell you folks I don't know
what it is but this box today bought me
the entire way so that's it let me go
ahead and remove these out of the
plastic this is the HTC AC charger and
see that right there I'll go ahead and
remove it from the bag here's that
little puppy have a USB on the other
side obviously HTC and then last but not
least where they call this this is the
HTC micro USB cable go ahead and remove
that as well as you can see that I'm
sure you guys have seen them all on
other phones just going to go ahead and
pull that out there's that too the USB
and for those of you who really don't
know exactly what's going on this just
plugs into that plugs into the wall and
into your phone simplicity itself so you
grab the phone here alright folks so
there you guys have all the main
features now it's running jellybean it's
not the latest it's 4.1 point one but it
sure tastes a lot better than ice cream
sandwich right now this thing has got a
skin version for the HTC and it's also
got something that I've heard that's not
so good now wonder if you guys are
willing to sacrifice that in order to
have the big screen battery life battery
life on this thing supposed to be pretty
atrocious not even a whole day when
you're using it now my samsung already
my galaxy that thing runs for barely a
day and it dies anything else for me is
going to be dying is almost kind of a
drag if you're going to be away from the
house all day long and stuff so you guys
tell me does the 1920 x 1080 resolution
screen for you equality y is equal
having terrible battery life or is that
just like
you guys let me know now without a
contract this things about seven hundred
dollars how do you guys feel about that
that means if you want to go out and buy
one of these bad boys you gotta dish out
the cashola for that now if you just
want to add a line and get it on verizon
it's going to be a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars the contract and
that way it's more affordable if anybody
out there if you've already own this
phone I would gladly love to hear your
comments because I just got this thing
