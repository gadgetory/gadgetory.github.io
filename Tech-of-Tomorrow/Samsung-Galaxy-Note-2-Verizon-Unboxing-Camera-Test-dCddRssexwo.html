day one of the 12 days of Christmas here
on tech of tomorrow I'm Eric Ferris your
host welcome glad you're here
now if you guys have been following the
channel you guys know that I went to New
York check out this Kanye West Show and
everything else where they released the
sprint version of the new galaxy note 2
now what today I've got the version that
was sent to me so I can have for my
provider this is the Verizon one so now
I can trade out my galaxy s3 and
actually upgrade to this phone now there
are a few major differences with this
one and the galaxy s3 for one thing 4.1
jelly bean already running on the note 2
not on the galaxy s3 5.5 inch Super
AMOLED screen that has 1280 by 720
resolution not on the s3 on the note 2
so there's some major factors including
a quad-core processor this one has the
1.6 gigahertz quad core Exynos processor
that is not it's the same thing that's
on the galaxy s3 so lots of upgrades
there so with all that stuff said let's
actually jump in and let's do the
unboxing of the Verizon version of the
galaxy note 2 let's jump right in
alright folks like any good unboxing
we're going to show you the box there's
not much to it it's just this and then
we have the back right here we're going
to show you a little cut screen right
here we show you actually all of the
specs you guys can see them right here
so you have to jump anywhere else to
check them all out so you guys can see
them all the battery life how big it is
everything else so beyond all that stuff
we'll jump past that now we'll go ahead
and remove it out of here just slides
out another really cool thing about this
though is the fact that you're going to
be able to use that cool little smart
pen that's in here that is one thing
that's really really cool so just go
ahead and take all the stuff out of here
nothing there
here we go with all the accessories so
all the accessories are right here right
off the bat we see the start here guide
the Galaxy Note 2 easy stuff there
the wall plug-in charger it's also going
to come with a USB that's going to plug
into that as well and the cable should
be in here which up yep there it is
right there
so you have the micro USB 2 standard USB
when it goes in your phone when it goes
into that little piece right there then
we have the battery go ahead and get the
battery out of here once you folks see
that and all those people are interested
in the batteries I'll go ahead and tear
it out of here so here's the battery hmm
go ahead and just step it off the side
there's nothing else inside the box so
I'll just go ahead and take this stuff
out of there and we shall move forward
to the phone so here we go it's
beautiful it's basically this phone's
basically pretty much it's 5 inches by 3
inches by a little bit bigger than a
quarter inch so this is like the
dimensions so I'm going to flip this
plastic off the back of it here you guys
can see it says the Verizon 4G LTE
galaxy note 2 the rear cameras right
here go ahead and flip it around
here's the pen as well I don't have this
thing like I said folks I just got this
you saw me just unbox the battery and
everything else so this thing's probably
not charged at all but this pin actually
works really awesome for operating on
here I'm going to go ahead and charge
this thing up go ahead and remove that
off there real quick though so you guys
can see that anyways now a lot of people
tell me they thought this was actually
too big and I don't know how anybody
could actually say that to me this phone
is it fits so perfect in your pocket and
the screen is just awesome as well as
the camera I don't know a quad-core
processor
I don't know pretty cool let's take a
little second pause here and let's see
if I can get this thing started
alright folks I pop the back off now so
I'm going to go ahead and install the
battery you can see there's little marks
right here you're going to wanna make
sure you match those up in here go ahead
and just put the battery in and you just
pop on the back again and your phone is
all back to the way it was now hopefully
I'll just be able to power this thing on
and be able to show you guys what it
looks like from the initial Start screen
still popping it back on there maybe ski
just a there we go the nice little work
does that work fine so see I believe is
the power so here we go we're turning it
on for the first time power buttons over
here on the right side by the way you
can see that down here they have their
little verizon logo
so the volume rocker bars everything on
the side right here so I folks so I've
still got to get this phone activate and
everything I just got it just want to
show you guys a little bit about the pen
show you how the pen works how much I
guess there's nothing in here but you
can just basically use the pen for
whatever you want to use I've got the
camera on right now so you guys can see
the camera working at check us that's
pretty cool the cameras filming my
desktop while we're filming it there we
go we got a dual shot with another with
another camera angle there so let's get
the other camera involved so there we go
we've got cameras filming cameras camera
cameras
yeah all right folks we thought we would
shake things up just a little bit what
you guys were actually seeing for the
outro is my Galaxy Note 2 from Verizon
filming this video so the audio and
everything you're hearing now is all
coming from directly from that's right
the note 2 which i think is pretty
awesome now it's the 12 days of
Christmas I told you that we're giving
stuff away every single solitary day now
today we've got a winner I keep
forgetting his name now mr. Xu's what is
it again make a puppet it's like this
coke a it's like Micka papa mega puppet
mega pooper I'm just kidding around guy
but it's mecha Papa something like that
it'll be in the link in the description
below or you guys just check out the
screen over here to my right you guys
will actually see that in there so
that's how it's going to go so thank you
guys very much I hope that you guys like
this video I'm going to go activate my
phone tomorrow and then after I activate
the damn thing I'll bring you guys some
more videos I actually learn about the
note2 I haven't had one of my own yet
