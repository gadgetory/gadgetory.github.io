that is kind of like the most craziest
unboxing thing I've ever seen ever seen
thing pop out of the nuclear containment
unit before I personally have it so
that's incredible so if you guys like
that intro and you think this thing
itself is really cool which is actually
sponsored by Intel hit a thumbs up down
there below and hey leave a comment
saying what you guys think so what is it
you're looking at exactly well this is
the intel pro performance enthusiasts
kit now i know is going to be offering
this over on their website we'll talk a
little bit about that at the end of the
video so what does all the kit parts
what it's basically based on Intel's x99
platform that's their bland new platform
that's for gamers and professionals
alike do its robust power multiple lanes
for video cards we talked about this
before 40 pci lanes for dedicated
discrete video cards you can use in
there overclocking is incredible ddr4
ddr4 in this case provided by the people
over here at crucial incredible stuff
also with the x99 deluxe and the people
over at a zhuzh and this is an
incredible mother board offers five way
optimization crazy overclocking it just
basically it says deluxe on that board
you know it's filled with crazy stuff
now since it's obviously sponsored by
Intel the Intel side of it is the brand
new i7 59 60 x Extreme Edition process
was an eight-core processor base clock
speed of three point 0 boost of 3.5 20
megabytes of smart cache I mean just an
incredible CPU it's super robust think
about that eight cores 16 threads
multi-threading applications are going
to be kicking ass all the way down the
line using this cpu they're also
providing an SSD this is the Intel 730
series 240 gigabyte SSD perfectly for
your boot drive and major basically
programs that's going to be using do you
want to use an expansion drive for your
median stuff you can get something
bigger but for a base kit this thing's
pretty dang incredible now let me talk
about some key points they want to
really point out though with this kit
you're pretty much guaranteed even with
standard air to be able to get 4.4
minimum overclock to 4.6 on the average
on your cpu so that means you know if
you go out and you get even more
incredible cooling like liquid cooling
or anything like that you might even be
able to get
better results but rather box which is
regular air cooling you'll better record
some incredible little overclocking
results which I think it's pretty killer
so with that said though let's actually
now take a look at these parts and hey
see what they do hey I see you guys down
there now check it out so instead of
doing your traditional type of unboxing
I just basically took everything out of
the box i'm sure you guys don't really
want to see me take another box if
that's really all that important me eyes
you guys leave a comment tell me down
below but i thought you guys just prefer
to actually see what comes in the box
now let's first check out this asus x 99
deluxe motherboard let's check it out
man this thing has totally white colored
highlights now I haven't ever seen a
board like this yet to my eyes it's
going to be pretty cool I have some
actual white cases that I've been
wanting to build in and just haven't
seen the right thing come across when I
built my Tron system if I would have had
this motherboard around I would have
definitely built in the tron system and
who knows maybe all do Tron too so as we
look down at the board you guys can see
that it's really cool it's got this
plastic housing along the side that
covers the crystal sound to you guys
since it's x99 series designed by a sous
plenty of room around the CPU area for
aftermarket coolers you guys can see
there's two sides to where the memory go
amazing stuff here now this is the first
motherboard comes out using ddr4 some of
the stuff goes up to 3000 megahertz and
faster so that's going to be pretty
incredible lots of room on the board so
if you want to do for way crossfire or
sli it's going to be available on this
board nice board next up we have the CPU
talked about it before I 7 59 60 X
extreme edition now this one clearly
says on it Intel confidential so I know
some people out there going to go hail
Rick and you can do a giveaway well
unfortunately this stuff actually
belongs to Intel until confidential
means the property of Intel I can use it
for in-house builds and show it off but
can't give it to you guys now next to
that you can see the skull is on the
Intel 730 series SSD 240 gigabyte you
can see it comes the cable install a
little disk and all that stuff and then
last up to the side is a 16 gigabyte kit
of the crucial ddr4 memory so you guys
see pretty cool kit all this stuff's
going to be available
directly from Intel as well so now
you'll be able to save money and all
that stuff by going directly through
these guys which is going to be pretty
doggone cool so all in all I think you
get a pretty good amount of stuff for
what they're trying to give to you guys
all you have to do now is go out and get
your case that kind of stuff all your
basic essentials are all right here on
the table all right so there you guys
have it Intel's new performance pro-kit
unbox radioactive style here on tech of
tomorrow now like usual all of this will
be download below that like button in
the description where you guys can see
where to go check more the stuff out
over on Intel's website I think it's
pretty doggone cool it's good basically
for gamers and for professionals all in
one due to all the options so here's
somebody you want to work at home use a
workstation stuff and you still want to
have the ability to play awesome games
this is what you're going to want to be
looking at the x9 I Zamir pretty damn
robust platform so Intel thank you very
much for making this video possible
today thank you guys for watching tech
in tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
on more tech
and be with you
