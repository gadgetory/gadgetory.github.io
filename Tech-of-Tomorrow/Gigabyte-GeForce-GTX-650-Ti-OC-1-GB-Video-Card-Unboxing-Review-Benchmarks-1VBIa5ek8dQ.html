crowing somewhere Hey
good morning folks it's me I work here
on the ticket Omar YouTube channel the
last few days I've been getting up every
morning early doing lots of testing and
staying up all night long doing more
testing getting ready for the latest end
video launch so what in the frak am I
talking about well unless you live it on
the moon you guys all know the new GTX
650 Ti is hitting the market today on
October 9th I was lucky to get my hand
on the gigabyte overclocked edition
which features our triangle cooling and
it's a really really tiny card so today
we're gonna bring you the unboxing the
features and the performance all in one
glorious reviews so without any further
ado let's go check this shiz Nick out
all right folks so now let's check out
the box you guys can see it's the
gigabyte we got the triangle cool The OC
version the GeForce GTX 650 TI one
gigabyte of gddr5 memory you guys and
see that all flip the card around just
talks about they're trying Gore culling
fan this car is pretty much entry-level
how the camera just zoom in here real
quick this is the nomenclature of the
card so if anybody out there wants to
buy this card you want to pick up an
Amazon or whatever you can check that
out in the link the description below
and pick it up here's the nomenclature
let's go ahead and set the card off to
the side folks okay let's just first off
get the accessories so that's it can
take the box
toss it towards the camera in so there's
not much in here we get the driver CD a
molex to 6-pin power connector in case
you've got an old-school power supply
and the graphics card quick guide which
is basically tells you how to install it
which most people I would assume we're
gonna know how to do that so let me get
that out of the way the car let's go
ahead and set the card down can you go
ahead and take out my trusty measuring
tape now I'm gonna measure than inches
but we'll make sure that you guys get
the translation can we see it so about
the bat we can see this card is seven
inches long so it's a mild lady pleaser
maybe for the small girls it'll go over
here five inches in height I'm a little
bit less than that let's see oh sorry
about that it's about two actually
excuse me it's about actually four
inches in height and as far as the width
goes it's about one and a half inches
wide now that we've seen how big the
card is let's just take a look at some
of the other aspects of the card right
down here we have your PCIe interface
flip it around show you guys tap the
card now this card does not support SLI
only one card technology only does
however require a single six pin power
connector which we can see right here
here's the rear of the card and then
lastly here's the rear ro the card where
we have two DVI ports single HDMI and a
normal VGA port now with that said let's
check out the features of the new GTX
650 Ti this card has 768 cuda cores
features one gigabyte of gddr5 memory
128 bit memory interface clocks comes in
at overclocked at ten hundred
thirty-three megahertz and the memory
comes in at 1350 these are all the basic
specs of the card now let's jump in and
let's see how this car performs against
the competition and rock out to the
benchmark song
ha all right you're back again always
look to rock out to the benchmark song
so okay you guys can see that at 1920 by
1080 this car does fairly well it's not
gonna play your favorite first-person
shooter games in ultra mode if you want
to play battlefield 3 on Ultra with
everything set in its highest you are
not going to play that with this card
now that said if you do want to play it
on medium or in the high settings that
plays okay it actually plays really good
on the medium settings on all games and
that also said if you're a person who
plays like Starcraft 2 World of Warcraft
this car is serious fuel will burn
through like butter in fact I think it's
where this card is really great if
you're a person who's not really a
first-person shooter guy and you play
the other games this card is gonna
really seriously kick ass if you're a
first-person shooter guy this will be
your entry level card and you're only
gonna be able to play at probably the
medium settings now if you try to play
it 2560 by 1440 you're gonna see this
card go they're really kind of choked at
that resolution but this card's also
under $200 gigabyte card never got
hotter than about 55 degrees Celsius so
it runs very very cool it's quiet and
it's under $200 so that said here over
on Tekken tomorrow for the budget and
entry level this gets the gamers gold
and we'll see you back here later on
