stories for you folks
first off Intel good news for those
people who want power in their usage
that is right the new tips are coming
out that's right Ivy Bridge - he is
hitting the market along with the x99
chipset motherboards to support them now
some of the really cool things about
this is gonna be expanded lanes you're
gonna get better overclocking support
you're gonna get more lanes than ever
before
and you're gonna get all kinds of stuff
with new ddr4 memory that's right so
ddr4 is going to be making its way to
the scene on the new ivy bridge-e
platform interesting stuff coming up
with that now I don't if you guys have
been following our web site but we've
been doing some really cool stuff - with
modding we're actually building a modded
system to replace the Red Dawn that's
right you guys all know we actually gave
the Red Dawn away to one of our fans
that lucky guys out there so now we're
building a replacement and this one's
based on the Trond theme now we're using
the as a case on the outside we're using
a couple of sapphire 79 50s now these
are the ones that were geared towards
the Mac platform they were white but we
flashed the BIOS on them made them
strictly cards for the PC everything's
running great you guys concede that so
far we've had two mod logs the first one
was just getting the paint job we took
care of everything got an awesome
bitching metal flake white paint job
then next was putting in the lights and
stuff like that and then we started
modding the video car which is all
really cool stuff now we're on mod 3

continue on as we go along but those are
all right now on the website now the
last story up Samsung always releasing a
phone as soon as you blink your eyes
Samsung has another phone come
now this one is called the advanced LTE
so everybody's going what the is
advanced LTE personally from what I've
read so far I don't know if it's
 or not it does seem like a
marketing plug laughs to see what it
gets here now what is it supposed to be
advanced LT is supposed to have faster
than 4G that's right
faster than 4G that's what they're
claiming we'll have to see like I said
