land to me I work here at the tech of
tomorrow youtube channel you guys know
that I use my Mac for doing all my music
and stuff and even our editing and with
that said I want to get a new keyboard
I've used the wireless mac one it's okay
i've used the wire mac one that's a
little bit better but when i saw that
these guys had their own for mac the new
k750 that was not only wireless it
actually did solar power as well I was
like damn logitech I think I'll buy me
one of those things so I hopped on
Amazon looked around I actually went to
best buy a couple times and try to find
one they don't carry this please
they don't right now maybe one the
future but I went there they were out of
stock so i went online damn is on and
got this and i'm kind of looking forward
to the unboxing i actually even have a
new army knife right here to use for the
unboxing so that said let's jump by it
and see what comes in the box of this
new logitech k750 wireless solar
keyboard
so check it out today we're looking at
the logitech wireless solar keyboard
k750 for the Mac they also make this for
the pc and I've got a pretty cool knife
here let me show this to you guys check
it out now we're going to flip the knife
open ooh nice slick play look at that
nice sharp army steel yeah but anyways
here's the unboxing so I'm just gonna go
ahead and take the knife take a couple
of decisions around here what's really
weird is too is and you buy this off of
Amazon this thing comes white box I mean
well alright in this case not really
white box would we call you will call
this bra brown box okay so brown box
it's the latin version half its way it's
the latin version of the white box
they've changed things up now we are in
california now so here we go popping
open now the really cool thing about
this is you guys can see all this stuff
here is all your support stuff how you
hook it up if you had a laptop they show
it to your little imac right there you
can see it's obviously pretty much an
imac anyways what's really cool about
this is it's totally solar power this
also comes in silver and black i chose
the black one I think black is awesome
looking so it says to go ahead and pull
this little strip out right here so I'm
gonna go ahead and pull that strip out
that's probably going to make the
keyboard work a couple little things up
here I will just leave that on there now
well hot tank i'll go ahead and open it
up let's see what all this is so i guess
the whole keyboard has a big plastic
film over it which maybe i should have
left on there I don't know but that's a
truly unboxing attitude completely out
and I think this thing just looks
totally cool it's totally solar-powered
totally wireless works off the lights
inside of your house that's what's
totally cool about it as far as the
typing and stuff goes I haven't really
had a chance to use it yet i'll review
up you guys in a couple of days but this
part is pretty cool i got in an amazon
and i got it for an amazing
price man i get this thing for 59 bucks
over at bestbuy it's going for 18 I and
they only have for the pc and look how
thin it is I mean seriously it's going
to be the most bucco keyboard you're
ever going to see in your life those are
the / espa√±ol will know what I'm
talking about when I say flat go but
here we go check it out here's the back
we've got a couple little tabs back here
put it open you know these are these
make the keyboard tilt up so I'm going
to go and move this back to spare
seconds you guys can just see this
there's the keyboard keyboard in action
the last thing is is a little on and off
switch there so and turn on probably
it's going to be dead because I haven't
really had it on the light but for a
couple seconds and it's not plugged in
anything so i guess it's got to be
plugged in first and charged so continue
with the unboxing though got some other
stuff over here this is the little
bluetooth enabler here got a little
sticker here i don't know why they give
you that dumb sticker but they do so you
get the sticker and then over here are
the two different things this one's for
the back of the computer and distance
for a laptop so neither one of
unplugging the keyboard all the stuff
for the keyboard is already inside of it
distance to your laptop and then this
one's right here dan there was a little
package back here to anyway this little
cleaning cloth thing so this is to shine
the thing up you know gets all
fingerprinting you make it all beautiful
game we all shine it all up look at that
would you look at that oh how beautiful
this is basically though everything that
comes in the box this is the new
logitech it's the wireless and
solar-powered k750 for the mac this is
the unboxing i got this thing $59 on
amazon i'm pretty stoked i'll see you
guys back here on the tech tomorrow
