alright so that's a pretty cool product
right but now let's jump in to today's
video right now it honestly seems to me
that this is the absolute worst time
ever in the entire history of my life in
the PC industry to build a PC it's just
gotten completely out of hand completely
out of hand doc trying to clean my hand
but it's gotten completely out of hand
at first it was just kind of a little
thorn in my foot bothering me but now
it's getting really to be a major pain
in my butt
for one thing almost every person that I
know has called me and asked me for
something weird to do like they called
me up they get a system quote for me and
then it's like well how about if I just
want the video card now if it was one
time I'd be like okay is cool but this
happened like about seven or eight times
now where I'm quoting these people like
full systems you know and and trying to
square them with a video card and then
they're just like oh I just want the
video card and I wanted this price and
there's really no way that unless I can
replace a video card right now but I can
give it out for pretty much anything
less than what I'm at to pay for it I
mean getting video cards even from the
company's Aizu EVGA MSI gigabyte these
companies is getting very very slim
pickings a few guys are able to get them
you know but they are very slim picky
and all the prices on a lot of things
are going up up up memories going up so
that's gonna drive the price of a lot of
other stuff up as well and honestly
these video cards I mean I'm blown by
the price like the other day we did a
video I asked you guys if you guys
wanted me to do the Red Devil but that
cards 1,500 bucks for a card that is
normally $600 so that's more than double
the face value of that card and that's
complete BS so many people out there
right now around the world and you know
a lot of you guys out there who have
likened to make in these rural areas you
know how hard is just to get parts to
where you are a lot of countries also
have super duper high tariffs so if you
know if you go and you buy this video
cars $1000 and it gets to your country
well guess what you may even be paying
up to another thousand dollars in tax I
know a lot of companies out there in
Brazil my Brazilian friends tell me that
whenever stuff comes into Brazil it just
costs them a fortune just to pay the
duty fees and the tax fees so honestly
who can afford $2,000 for a video card
and let's share rich guys so what is PC
gaming now just turning into something
that's going to be a rich man's game and
I said this before what's really
freaking crazy is even consoles are
going up they're using the excuse of all
these cards that are out there to bring
up the prices on consoles so now not
only are you getting screwed when you're
trying to buy a video card you're
getting screwed if you're trying to buy
a console you're getting screwed if you
want to buy memory now the only things
that seem to be going down and I have to
admit these two markets I've been able
to find a lot of great price deals and
this is in hard drives SSDs monitors and
peripherals now obviously since nobody
out there right now unless they've got a
bunch of cash can build a good high-end
gaming machine of course let's drop all
the price and everything else so people
are probably buying all this stuff up
I'll admit it I have lately I bought in
like nine or ten hard drives I've been
able to get these two terabyte hard
drives
they're just barracudas but they're
really fast or sitting 200 rpm they last
for a good long time they're solid
50 bucks I mean who can go wrong for two
terabytes of a good drive for 50 bucks
so right now I mean I can get cases
cheap hey nope
I get you know anything like that cheap
memory is starting to really creep up
those so buying good memory is now
really expensive as well so the bottom
line here is that anything high end PC
at this point in time is unobtainable
unless you have a lot of money or some
connection who can hook you up at price
because it's just ridiculous now I know
that people say hey you can go buy
pre-built systems and honestly I know
that people don't like that but if that
is going to be the only way that you can
afford to get a video card here's what I
would suggest just go out and find the
parts that you like and then contact one
of those pre-built systems and see if
they end up - excuse me pre-built system
companies you know there's a lot of them
out there that do this and they could
probably build the machine almost how
you want it
so I mean unless you the person just
absolutely has to have their hands on
you know you're like as a mechanic who
wants to fix his own car you're the
doctor who likes to look up your own
well I won't even say that but you know
what I mean you know that's really kind
of that's all that's weird thing but
it's laughing so hard I forgot I was
saying but but anyways unless you want
those people I mean getting someone to
build your you a pre-built system isn't
really that bad of a thing I mean if you
want a course there are nine under
decays you know you want a a water
cooler from Swift tech you want a
motherboard from a Seuss you know you
want another part from gigabyte they can
all build this for you one thing that's
also cool about having a prebuilt is the
fact that when these guys build it they
test it they do all the cable management
so you should know that when you're
receiving these systems they're going to
be good to go
I mean let's face it you can't get the
cards I can't get them you can't get
them really nobody can get them and you
know I made a video other day where I
was talking about you know Nvidia
bringing some cards and making these
cards now listen you're telling me
because if I keep hearing from everybody
Oh Erik they're not going to buy those
cards because they don't game well what
about if a company I don't care who the
frak it is I don't care if it's AMD and
video or Bob's cheeseburgers I don't
give a damn if anybody can come up with
a mining card for a lower price that
does nothing but mine that would totally
alleviate this problem all together if I
was a miner
why would I want to pay $5.99 for a
gaming card if I could get me a plain
old card for you know $300 and that's
the problem with the market right now
you can fix that one little problem
right there one thing and it's just a
simple thing is provide these cards to
miners at a lower price than gaming
cards guess what they'll sell a shite
ton of these cards face it I would buy
the cards you would buy the cards if all
of us could go out excuse me and we
could buy you know cards that were
dedicated for mining that we're going to
cost an arm and a leg well you wouldn't
even really worry about trying to resell
them once they get broke and that's
another thing it's really up you know
I'm saying you guys tell me all the time
well what these guys do is they take the
card and they mine the card do the cards
almost dead and they turn around and
sell it on eBay as a normal card well if
they've almost worn the card out that's
like selling a broken car and that's
totally utterly uncool and should
honestly be illegal it's not but it is
it's pretty much selling you a lemon for
the price of a diamond and that's just
totally totally rotten rotten rotten
rotten rotten rotten rotten so what do
you guys think I mean I know there are a
lot of guys out there like I said before
in a lot of these countries that don't
have access to a lot of stuff and for
you guys trying to get even a mid-level
system is extremely hard but now trying
to get a high-end gaming system you guys
literally probably have to sell your
house sell your sister and work on the
corner doing some crazy stuff for a few
months just to probably able to buy a
video card much less the surrounding
parts to that system and honestly I find
that very sad and discouraging right now
I'm telling you I've been this PC
business since the very beginning let
you guys in a little secret when all
these companies first formed in the
beginning there was all just one company
well my dad's an attorney and he was
involved with that bringing the
businesses over here to America so
something you guys probably don't know
what I'm just going to share with you
right now hey Zeus gigabyte MSI all
owned by the same corporation shocking
no it's true in the beginning they set
up four companies and they set those
companies up to all come against each
other because you guys all know in
America we have laws that do not let you
naah peláez you cannot totally
monopolize anything at all and rule the
market so there it's gonna come over
here as one PC company
it'll be like Intel and there'd be no
AMD so we all know AMD is the counter to
Intel well when these guys came here
they split those companies up and
actually it's really smart because they
make those companies all compete against
each other so just imagine if you owned
a taco business right and so you had
four different taco shops you owned them
all and you made them all compete for
better business smart idea right it
really is so honestly folks I hope
things change for not just for me but
for you and everybody out there so that
in the future things will be better for
gamers gaming right now is a pain in the
butt you can really be a console peasant
unless you dish out a bunch of money to
the prices Justins christmas have over
then doubled why should they do that
it's just gong and passing it down the
line I am really really frustrated now I
know some of you people may not like
this but you could always turn to the
dark side
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
