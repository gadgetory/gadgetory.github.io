checking out a brand new product called
the stream deck mini now this is the
little brother to the steam deck by El
Gato now el gato was a company that has
recently been acquired by Corsair so now
Corsair owns that company lock stock and
barrel so we'll be seeing their products
coming in here and this product is
really geared towards a person who's a
streamer but it can be used by all kinds
of different people for different things
so first of all this product works on
either a PC or Macs it doesn't matter
what kind of computer you have with your
a PC master-race guy or a nice sheep it
doesn't really matter whatever I can't
help but man I just got to say it was
funny cuz me and Jonathan Morrison from
TLD were talking about he was talking
about some of the negative comments they
were talking about and they were calling
him an IC so I think IC just sounds
pretty funny I mean no offense to the
Apple guys I have some Apple stuff
myself but I just can't help but I sheep
just sounds funnier than crap so whether
you're a PC master-race guy or an IC
what I say is but I say this with a joke
um this product will work with it now
what it allows you to do is usually you
have to alt tab when you're inside of a
game or doing something to access a
program like doing chat and stuff like
that but with this product you can set
up the six keys on it so that you can
actually access these programs do things
like chat and stuff like that from the
various different you know sites that do
streaming you can see how many of your
fans are online how many people are
active and this is all pretty cool stuff
now the basis of this product though is
that it is a little 6 button
configuration and yes all the
functionality a few people out there who
have heard of the stream the the depth
of the bigger one it has all the same
functionality as this bigger brother
just with less buttons now these buttons
can be made to automatically one of 13
different things that they have built-in
when you purchase the product so like
twitch and stuff like that inside of
these different areas they have already
customizable stuff that's built into the
program like I said you can do chat
custom mixes you can interact with them
all kinds of different stuff for
streamers this is actually really cool
stuff now I'm really not a
dream erm I don't really stream games
and play that stuff I know there's a lot
of people out there so for people who do
that and you don't want to have to keep
doing the clunky thing or using your
keyboard and mouse so the simple push of
the button the product is really easy to
access and to use it all you do is
download their driver hook up the
product via the USB cable and then boom
you're up and going now what I
particularly like about this product for
me is that you can do a lot of different
things with this with these keys and
when I say custom programmable I really
mean it like you can set keys up to
raise your volume to increase your
volume to go to the next song to the
previous song you can have it launch
whatever applications you want whatever
folders you want within the 6 button
environment you can have it do whatever
you like mouth for me and my music
studio upstairs I want to use this
particular product so I can access all
of my different music stuff so if I want
to use logic I hit a button and
automatic is going to use logic if I
want to use something else Pro Tools I
hit a button goes to Pro Tools reason
hit another thing go to all those things
plus the very fact I do like that I can
program the buttons for play pause and
record so that's really cool stuff so
like that's suppose to say that I'm in
my environment inside of logic and I
don't want to mess with the keyboard or
anything else all I really need to do is
just hit a button and I can have auto
record now the way this is done is you
basically go in and you do these things
and you train the device to do what it's
supposed to do it it's not hard
whatsoever everything is you guys can
see on the screen right here is complete
drag and drop or just click click and go
there's no actual real programming
involved whatsoever so you don't have to
worry about going oh my god how am I
gonna program all these features is
thing I look I'm not a programmer that
would give me a bloody headache and
believe me it would give me a headache
too I will say it I hate programming all
those numbers dragging and dropping all
different stuff gives me a migraine not
my thing now to some people out there
who dig it you might say well this is
just a too symbol of a product it's a
peasant product but for the average Joe
this product is very easy to use now a
lot of people are going to go
okay well how can i integrate this like
into my life well if you're a streamer
like I said earlier there are already
programs they're custom built into this
as soon as you buy it so if you don't
want to have to go out and do any kind
of crazy programming and you like the
stuff that's built in here then you can
use it like you can be streaming a game
playing a game showing people what
you're doing and then all of a sudden
engage the chat mode with them
automatically what happened to alt click
out go to other programs and do all that
you can do all this stuff on the fly and
that's what really the apply the shining
point of this particular product is is
that for those people out there who do a
lot of streaming and you want to
interact with your audience that's
really probably why I should probably
say the best is if you really want to
interact with your audience and you want
to do it in a seamless environment
without having to go and use your
keyboard and mouse and all that stuff
this product could help you quite a bit
or if you're musician like myself and
you want to avoid having to use your
keyboard and mouse and you're doing the
recording and playback and stuff you can
easily just set this up for that which
is great because let's just say that
you're monitoring a song on sets you
just recorded you're not quite sure what
you want to do with it but you just want
to check it out you could custom do the
buttons inside of there to do a lot of
different features for you so that you
would never really have to mess with
your keyboard and mouse unless you were
going to change it up or add some
filters or something like that
other than that controlling your play
pause all at different stuff you can do
all automatically through the stream
deck and that's what I like about it for
me personally because like I said I'm
not a streamer whatsoever but I can see
the value of this product do a streamer
a person out there who does a lot of
streaming has wanted to have any hassles
whatsoever doesn't want to invest a
whole lot of money if I haven't said it
yet this particular product is $99 I
believe that it's bigbrother which is a
little bit bigger and has some more
buttons on it's about a hundred and
thirty-four dollars I'll make sure that
I have a link down below to both these
products at the end of the video so if
you guys want to check out either one of
them for yourselves and you can buy one
or just get more information about it
you can do that yourself but at the end
of the day I think this product for 99
bucks does have some cool application
values
I can't wait to really get it upstairs
and try and see how far and what kind of
you know complicated things I can get it
to do in
side of logic pro tools and reason and
just see but different programming what
I can do now obviously there is the
limitation of the six buttons and that
might be reason for like me to actually
look into the the bigger brother it has
more buttons because like I said I'd
like to almost like completely and
totally you know control my audio
environment the recording thing just by
hitting click buttons that would just be
really really nice but for now I'll have
to settle for six buttons see how it
works and see if I really really like
the product but just from interacting
with it the last couple of days it seems
very very interesting there's a lot more
stuff that I could explore in depth
about this product but as you guys can
see it's been going through the video
everything is easy to do with
drag-and-drop simplicity that makes it
pretty much so that anybody out there
who can think and reason can look at
this and do it it doesn't take any kind
of person with any kind of great you
know mental value to be able to do this
doesn't take rocket science what I'm
trying to say
it doesn't take person with a rocket
scientist brain to figure this out it's
simple to use it's very interactive with
your audience and if you're looking for
something unusual and kind of in a niche
of its own then hey this might just be
the product for you one other thing
that's really cool about the stream deck
mini is that you can customize all of
the little thumbnails on ours you can
see we've got them customized for our
different gaming things and this is
actually a pretty cool little thing so
no matter what you know what kind of
image you can find you can custom set it
for the thumbnail they can either be
funny kiddie stuff serious stuff but
anything that you really want even like
simple buttons like you know pause
forward you know backwards any of that
stuff can all be programmed very very
simply so like I said if you're a
streamer you'll probably really like
this product quite a bit it's something
different it definitely has a niche
market of its own
currently $99 like usual like I said
we'll have links down below where you
guys can check this product out I'm mark
you guys been watching teka tomorrow
we'll see you guys back from the channel
for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
