Faris here once again the tech go
tomorrow channel bringing you guys the
unboxing and first look at the new
fortress 750 watt power supply from the
people over at Rose will supposed to be
a semi modular power supply supposed to
support SLI and crossfire and all that
are the good shiz Nick so beyond that
let's jump in let's see what comes
inside this little box
alright folks like every good unboxing
obviously we're going to show you the
box it's the fortress series 750 180 +
platinum which is as high as you can get
seven-year warranty that's pretty
incredible you guys can see them in the
front
here's the back all at the cameraman
zoom in it tells you the different
features actually little feature screens
right here 80 X 1200 ad + platinum full
range active PFC file 135 millimeter fan
with auto speed control all high-quality
Japanese capacitors all this good stuff
over this over that over that over that
all kinds of over protection 7 year
warranty one to one replacement which
means the thinking that's messed up
you call the folks up get an army you
get an advanced army and get your power
supply so that's it let's go ahead and
let's cut this open now this is a dual
rail power supply summer single rail
this is a dual rail again we'll take the
paper and put timber man down the camera
is a little clip behind the back we're
gonna go ahead and knock that off top
box open the cap comes off kaboom kaboom
kaboom but I go all crazy here
get these portraits 80-plus platinum
your manual all that good stuff
zip ties for human management foam to
hold the thing in place or to throw a
camera in my grill power supply cable
this thing out of here
the mounting screws throw them at the
camera oh no it's like throwing stuff
the cameramen today one of those days
he's angered me right Herriman do that
they have that effect on us Oh
box out of the way huh boom well let's
start dissecting the unit first off
let's take a look at all of the cabling
so actually folks I guess I've read the
Box wrong this power supply isn't
modular at all it's completely connected
no modular at all so that was my bad in
the intro there
here's that hundred and thirty-five
millimeter silent fan we talked about
they said it's adjustable as well the
fortress series nomenclature flip it
around here's the backside you can see
the AC input the DC output the total
power once again they're saying it's 80
plus platinum - ok burnin okay 80s okay
so it passed all of their tests here's
the back shot you can kind of see inside
of there some of the parts of their
using power plug in on an off switch and
alright that's pretty much that
now let's just go over all the different
cabling now so let's start off with this
stuff all apart here one by one so here
is power
24-pin power right there try to do all
these things and separate them by power
and that but they're all just kind of a
giant conglomerate miss here believe it
or not can be kind of frustrating when
you're gonna try to short tune the video
as I try to go through and figure that
all the power plugs out okay here goes
some additional power eight pin four
plus four so these are all your power
connectors right here and separate those
easier power okay bring you all out one
by one
frustrating as long get up I'll tell you
that
alright here you go our SATA get that
all the way next up another SATA video
card six and eight pin once again
another video card one two six eight
pins so you know the port SLI or
crossfire configurations a little
support to video cards no more than that
continue on molex and finally another
molex and your floppy drive connector
for those of you who use old school
stuff so alright folks so here it is the
Rose Bowl fortress 750 watt power supply
or sent in buying this thing you guys
can look at the link in the description
below and purchase a thing for yourself
we're going to throw a test bed and see
how it does and get back deal bit later

about this fortress 750 watt power
supply so peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
