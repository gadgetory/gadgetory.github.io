back to the channel I work here with mr.
buddy the dog of mr. gee behind the
camera now the reason that we're
bringing you guys today's video is
because my system got totally burned up
and a power surge in the house actually
caught some my surf detectors on fire it
was crazy look like a KISS concert and
 inside of this place I'm telling
you it was nuts now this system's value
is about almost $3,800 before you guys
all freaking go my god it's so much
money oh my god I really didn't pay for
anything in the system but the CPU I
reached out to all my friends in the
industry and just told them what
happened and I basically showed pictures
of the burnt-out power surge protector
and it was crazy so hey they were kind
enough to kick me down a lot of these
parts in today's build so the price in
this really is irrelevant I really want
to show off though the case the
motherboard and the parts in this that
are really really nice and I really
wanted to have a nice system that had a
78 28 from Intel I figured that would
pretty much be the best thing to compare
against thread Ripper which by the way I
bought my thread rumor processor I'm
just waiting for it now so with that
said though let's jump in let's check
out this bill which is my basically my
brand new gaming system replaced the old
one I think it's pretty awesome I think
you will too so let's check this bad boy
out for this build I wanted something
that was really big and had a lot of
great airflow going through it but not
only that it would have a whole lot of
features for today's gaming environment
so I chose to use the EB GA DG 86 full
tower case now this case has a whole lot
of features man it has a software fan
controller it as a cable
which you can actually change your fan
speed which i think is really nice
because it shows the fan speed actually
on the left hand side of the case so
that's pretty cool I set mine for 50
percent and hundred percent and with a
click of a button
my fans are automatically changed inside
of the case there's also a controller
for doing all of your RGB lighting and
with this build the RGB is actually
being controlled from two different
places it's being controlled hardware by
the button inside the case and then it's
controlled by the software inside the
windows 10 environment the DG 86 totally
fit my need and I honestly got to say I
was really impressed with this case now
it's a little pricey coming to the
market at two hundred and nineteen bucks
but still if you want a case that not
only looks good has a lot of badass
features and it can even fit
the latest and greatest in the largest
radiators this is something you want to
seriously check out and the way the case
is designed it doesn't have a
restriction on airflow in fact airflow
goes really clean right through the
system keeping all of your parts running
cool having the window on the side is
also really nice because this way you
can totally show off that custom build
on the back of the case there's plenty
of room for cable management so no
matter how many wires you have there's
plenty of room back here to put and
store all of your cables without looking
like a messy mess you really don't even
see your cables because they're
connected to the motherboard inside of
the case and once you close the door
they can be routed through the bottom or
through the side and then out to your
peripherals this actually is a very
clean way to do cable management with
your system all in all the case just
looks very clean in fact you can't even
see the power supply because it's
covered behind a shroud for this build I
got lucky again good bike kicked me down
the x-29 9 iOS gaming @ 9 motherboard
now this motherboard has a lot of
features including their brand new
thermal guard
it features ESS sabri audio RGB fusing
lighting dual LAN killer Wi-Fi and also
3-way SLI support if you want to go
really crazy in the BGA department the
motherboard also features a lot of RGB
lighting so if you love that RGB look
with a bunch of flashing lights hey this
motherboard has it all for the CPU I
chose the Intel Core i7 78 20x processor
I did this for two reasons one to be the
CPU in my gaming machine and two so I
could test it against the latest thread
Ripper CPU the 7820 x has 8 cores 16
threads a base clock speed of 3.6
gigahertz and a maximum turbo frequency
of 4.3 gigahertz it's still based in the
14 nanometer process and has a TDP of
140 watts if you guys follow the channel
you guys know that I use a lot of
products from Corsair they're like one
of my main people that I work with so
once again I'm with one of their coolers
to cool my CPU this time the corsair
hydra series h-11 5 eye now this is an a
i/o cooler that actually works really
nice in the system we didn't even have
any problems installing it whatsoever
because the EVGA case had enough room to
put just about anything in it the memory
in this build is also by corsair is
pretty
expensive it's the corsair dominator
platinum series 32-gigabyte set now this
is ddr4 3000 megahertz and currently
it's about three hundred and fifteen
dollars now this stuff looks absolutely
great and the only thing it's missing
for the build that I would have liked is
a little bit more RGB cuz who can't have
enough RGB the video card from this
build was also kicked down by my friends
at gigabyte and this is their ARS
GeForce GTX 1080 TI video card now the
only thing I don't like about this video
card is that it weighs so doggone much
that I couldn't really get away from the
video cards sagging a little bit now I'm
probably gonna have to do a little mod
or something and figure something out to
actually get rid of that but you guys
can see that right now that card is
sagging a little bit and that's really
not the fault of the motherboard or the
video card it's just the fact this video
card is huge and it weighs a lot but
with that said it's also faster than
 as you guys will see in the tests
now this next part is probably the most
ridiculously priced part in the entire
build but I was able to get it from
Intel so I was like hey Hales to the yes
I will use this now this is their brand
new 750 series PCI solid-state drive
that's right 1.2 terabytes of ultra fast
speed unfortunately though this thing's
about eight hundred and forty five
dollars I know most people out there
aren't going to use this in their build
whatsoever I mean let's just face it you
can get a one terabyte black drive for
49 bucks and be good to go but because
like I said before these parts are being
given to me for the build I went for the
absolute best and this really can't be
beaten for the boot drive I went with a
corsair 4 series le SS Dina this is 480
gigabytes of SSD power and it's perfect
for my boot drive and just storing a
little bit of programming most of my
games and everything else I'm gonna keep
on the Intel 750 because that's just
faster than all hell even though you
can't see the power supply powering up
this bad boy is the EVGA supernova 850
now this is an 80 plus gold 850 watt
fully modular power supply has a lot of
nice features and incredibly a 10 year
warranty and let's just face it not many
people are gonna actually use their
computer for 10 years building this rig
did take a few hours because paying a 10
into detail and doing all that cable
management and everything actually does
take a little bit of your time doesn't
matter whether you're a professional or
beginner when you're doing cable
management and doing a build and trying
to get everything precise it does take a
little bit of your time now we had
really absolutely no troubles at all
with this EVGA case it's so big and has
so many features on it that it was just
like pretty much putting Legos together
like there were no complaints at all
that I could have at all about putting
this build inside of that case and in
fact if you're a person out there
looking for a really radical case I got
to say this EVGA case is really really
awesome
some of the corsair stuff is really nice
and I like them but at this point right
now I'd have to say this is probably my
favorite case that I've seen in a couple
of years just overall badass no sharp
edges inside whatsoever cable management
even though it took time there was still
plenty of room ample space in the back
if you hide all those cables away it
looks good right
so with that said let's check out those
performance scores
as far as the temperatures go
we saw the CPU having a maximum of 57
degrees and a minimum of 27 degrees and
for the GPU we see a minimum of 41 and a
maximum 73 degrees under full load all
in all I got to say this system runs
pretty damn cool and it runs absolutely
silent with the fan set at 50%
all right Tech fans so there you have it
my brand new gaming rig now yes is it
probably a little overpriced and could
you build a cheaper I got there I'm
absolutely sure that you could but like
I said these parts were all donated to
me so I could have a brand new gaming
machine and actually bring more testing
to you I'm gonna start doing a lot more
game stuff which is what I actually got
into the whole business in the first
place with helping people in doing
gaming and and that's my eyesight got
worse I kind of got out of it but now
I'm going to get back into it start
bringing you guys some more game reviews
showing you guys more in depth stuff
about the games and just a little change
of the pace that things have going on
around here
so mr. buddy was glad to see you I was
glad to see you and like usual all the
parts that we used this bill will be
down below that like button so if you
like the video hey you guys know what to
do and you guys can obviously change
everything around in the build as you
guys want to I think though that EBG a
case is just amazing I mean it has so
many features on it and I mean I know
that it's a little bit pricey for what
it is but when you want something that's
really really cool and something you're
gonna be putting your parts in for a
long time why go on the cheap unless you
have to it let's just be honest with you
I mean I've been this industry since the
very beginning so I know just about
everybody out there so getting some
stuff in to build a system for me isn't
that part of the thing to do and I'm
very very lucky and I thank God every
day for you know bringing this
opportunity to my life but I mean for me
using cheap parts and stuff when I don't
have to just doesn't really add up I
mean I know you guys like budget systems
and will bring a lot more of those to
the table cuz I know that through the
people out there that don't have a lot
of money they want the budget stuff and
if I was honestly going out there and
paying for all this stuff I would
probably have a different approach but
the way I see it is since I have access
why not use it I mean it just makes
sense and that way I can bring killer
stuff and this system can be built by
anybody out there you don't have to be a
guy who knows about water cooling and
all that stuff because the AIO
is easy to install you may have
to take your time doing the build to
learn how to do stuff but honestly the
cable management and everything on a
system like this can be done by anybody
out there who takes their time and just
slows down pays attention to detail you
can make your system just like this with
the parts that you want to use by the
way if you guys actually prefer it right
film Anthony doing the bill let's set
peppers down let me know and we'll
return to that method it didn't seem
like a lot of people were really
catching on to that but you guys
actually prefer to see the build you
know and then we'll compress it and show
you guys that let me know but with that
said though this system is pretty killer
you have to admit if you had the
opportunity to get a new system wouldn't
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
