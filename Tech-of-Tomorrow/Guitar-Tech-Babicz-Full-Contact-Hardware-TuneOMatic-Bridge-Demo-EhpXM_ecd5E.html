hey what's going on everybody
I'm Elric and welcome to tech of
tomorrow
Tech fans music lovers welcome back to
another edition of tech of tomorrow now
today we've got something a little bit
different our tech plate than our usual
standard computer type stuff like we are
a total technology channel we're not
just locked-in devein and today we're
going to be talking about technologies
that's involved in the music industry
now this technology today is called the
BAP X full-contact tune-o-matic bridge I
know some people set out there take some
time for my thoughts to reach my brain
you got to remember something I don't
actually rehearse any of this stuff I
come out and do these videos for you
guys
raw every single one of them so yeah it
does take me sometimes again my thoughts
and my brain and take them out my mouth
but today we're going to take a look
something really cool
like I said this is the báb Uxbridge
you guys are not going oh okay a bridge
like what do we do well you don't cross
it it actually has to do with guitar
technology now right here in front of me
this is my guitar midnight this is a
2013 Les Paul traditional guitar it has
the standard bridge that comes with all
Gibson guitars sometimes you get one of
their Nashville's but this one comes
with this particular one and we're going
to be removing this bridge and replacing
it with this bridge and the reason we're
going to be doing that is the Babbitt's
bridge makes full contact with the body
of the guitar you're going to again well
okay what the frak does that mean dude
like what does that matter okay so check
it out a lot of times with a lot of
guitars you get your string tone and you
get some tonality out of the strings but
picture this I don't know if any of you
people out there have ever had like a
subwoofers speakers and you put it like
on a big wooden desk and all of a sudden
the entire desk sounds like this huge
frakkin speaker the same thing goes into
the idea behind the báb Uxbridge makes
full contact with the guitar body which
then makes the entire guitar a resonance
chamber for the strings much different
than any other technology out there and
I believe Jeff Babbitt's is the only
person that actually has this product
out there now I was able to get my hands
on two of these products so thanks to
the other Jeff and thank you very much
sir yeah so we've got two of them we've
got a gold one which I'll be putting on
another
and then we have the Crumlin which I'll
be putting on this guitar I actually
have another BC rich it's a shadow Pro X
mockingbird that's what I'll be sticking
on this one but that's another day for
today let's talk about this one so this
product comes to market about 128 bucks
if you go out and buy just a normal type
bridge they're like 60 to 70 type
dollars but this one has a lot more
features you can adjust it a lot more
and like I said the really big thing
about it is the full contact to the body
of the guitar so what I'm going to do
right now is we're going to give you
samples of me playing this guitar with
this bridge and then we're going to film
after the technician comes over with me
and we're going to install the bridge
and then we're going to play you some
more and show you the difference so with
that said let me jump in just play a
little bit of guitar a couple simple
Dipple things and then we'll compare
those when we change the bridge out to
the box full content so let's do a
little Rocking
you
so there you go folks I mean we can do a
couple more things with just
sustainability like wiping these type of
things you can really hear other guitar
like
I don't know just for shits and giggles
so that's the guitar playing with the
standard bridge installed in it now I'm
just going to play a couple basic notes
and stuff so that we can compare them a
head-to-head so this right here is the
basic opening
now you might wonder what I'm doing okay
we're going to do is we're going to time
how long the note keeps going before it
starts to feedback so right about there
now we'll try another note down here
and then a full nice little full
three-quarter thing here
more
yeah that's right folks we're going to
do is we're going to change the bridge
out I'm going to come back play that
guitar do some of those matching notes
and we'll see how the tone and
everything changes after the bridge is
installed you guys got all this to go
from I'll play some of the same similar
exact stuff and we'll see how it goes
so we'll see in a minute
but maybe more since I possess
well maybe that's actually a bit of you
Mitch but check it out the Bab Uxbridge
is installed the total of about 30
minutes was a total time it actually
took it on a Gibson Les Paul it couldn't
have been any easier your bassist had to
loosen up the bolts that are on here on
your standard bridge take your old
bridge off pop this thing off set all
the strings off to the side install the
bridge reattach everything and just do
your minor adjustments now this one was
pretty accurate we just had to do a
little bit of measuring along up inside
here between the string so we get the
perfect you know depth all the way
across but actually only two of them had
to be adjusted also special thanks to my
friend and tech gary under for coming
over and helping out with his event it
was really cool now I must say now this
thing cost about $89 and it looks
amazing I mean just look at it it looks
totally badass you have to admit it
don't even lie to yourself it looks
amazing so I mean right off the bat as
far as visual goes it's amazing plus now
that it's made the entire guitar body a
resonance chamber it's really really
bold you guys heard before some of the
stuff I was playing now we'll do some
more play and we'll compare some of the
actresses straight notes of stuff so you
guys can see how the notes resonate and
how long it resonates like a simple
chord
you
you
ballsy stuff just all the way around I'm
just so much impressed with how well
this sounds now I don't like we're going
to say oh wow it's not night and day but
it's not totally night and day but it is
a very nice difference everything's
really really warmed up all the notes
resonate very nice you can hear that
they do resonate a lot longer just in
the comparisons like baseline this is a
straight chord like this before and you
can hear how long the note resonates out
it's a lot longer lot wider you hear the
bottom in the depth the base of it
just keeps going off into the distance
there anyways folks I mean I'm pretty
impressed with this I have to say that
it's not a very expensive thing you can
get this for about 89 bucks but wink and
everything will be down below in the
description where you guys want to check
us out if you guys like this type of
video a hit that like button I know it's
something different than our normal
technology but hey this is technology
though the bat box bridge is one of the
latest greatest things for guitars now
obviously guitars have been around
probably since you know around what you
know like middle England time their
guitars and type stuff but still this is
one of the latest greatest innovations I
give it editor's choice for the price
that it is it makes enough of difference
in your guitar to make it well worth the
upgrade special thanks to Jeff and Jeff
over there at Babic for kicking us down
these bridges totally appreciated
brothers looks good it sounds good I'm a
happy fracking camper I'll see you guys
a little bit later I got through the
rock and roll
he with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
