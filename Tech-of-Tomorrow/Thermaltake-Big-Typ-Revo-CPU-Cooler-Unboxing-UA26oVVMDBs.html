it's all the tech all the time here on
tech of tomorrow and if I'm here and
you're here then it's our time isn't it
now who else has said this who's an old
school person who knows who said that
I'll give you a hint that's a hint all
right you got your hint there so anyways
check it out today we're gonna take a
look at a brand new product from the
people over at thermaltake that's right
this is the big type rivo featuring five
heat pipes 160 watts a single 120
millimeter downward blowing fan and
works at both AMD and Intel even the LGA
2011 so that's a pretty good product
supposed to be you know basically
somebody just wants to replace their
heatsink but doesn't look for the
greatest greatest thing in the world and
there's like only 40 bucks and only two
160 watts so the higher-end cpus aren't
gonna cool very well with this so it's a
middle-level product heist at 40 bucks
so there we go and now let's jump in and
check out the unboxing alright folks so
here we have obviously the front of the
box like any good unboxing supports 160
watts v heat pipes and LG 2011 - we'll
take obviously you guys can see a
picture the little unit right there will
flip it around this is nothing really
too interesting just a bunch of things
and a bunch of language is alright and
not when we go folks here's a halfway
decent box picture because in the back
here you can see a bunch of different
shots of the product and all that stuff
so if you were someone walking around
the mall one to buy one you could at
least take a look at what comes in the
box without actually I have to tear it
apart pretty good your own self unboxing
in the mall think about it alright
flip it around here's the last shows of
specifications all the way down its
compatibility the fan about three pounds
you can see that alright then now let's
unbox this damn thing so we're going to
pop the little lid right here
open it up on the top here we can see
all the paperwork there are warranty
guide is right here
next up instruction manual one and then
instruction manual to moving along we
have some stuff right here so I'll just
go ahead and take this turn it upside
down and out of the box that comes
though the box at the cameraman and away
it goes alright so here we go top here
so you know out of the box alright let's
check it out folks
start off in the bottom right here this
is the part that's going to hook up and
be placed on to your CPU gets a little
warning sticker here you guys can see
all of the copper heat pipes radiating
away from here there's five of them as
we said before no thermal paste on this
so you'll be applying your own which I
prefer anyways I don't like it when
things come with thermal paste that just
kind of to me implies cheap so here we
see all the heat fins these are all made
of aluminum this thing is actually very
very lightweight here you see the single
120 millimeter fan
it blows downward cooling the area
around the ZIF socket and the CPU itself
right here we have a single power header
now let's just get some close-up shots
get the cam into focus in an area over
here so we'll just start right here
here's one shot right here the front and
the fan
okay sideview
those little connections right here if
you want to remove this fan and add your
own you could also do that if you so
choose here we can see all of the copper
heat pipes coming out to the very side
of it show you lastly the other side and
then just once again we'll show you the
bottoms that we just get everything for
anybody who have just miss it alright so
there you have it folks now one thing
that this will be really good for any of
the aftermarket ones that you get are
gonna be usually ten times better than
those little ones you get inside of a
package or maybe not ten times be fair
but they work better they usually last
longer one of the big failings I've seen
with nem from Intel or AMD is the fans
usually go out very very fast and you
need to replace it so why even screw
with it only if you're building a system
and you know you're only gonna have it
like a year so you're in a really heavy
budget do you usually want to use the
included one that comes inside the box
this one you can replace it's 40 bucks
very lightweight needs it's not gonna
have any stress on your board we're
pulling off your motherboard so that's
always a good thing
forty bucks is a good price those of you
guys I like to hear you guys's comments
I'm gonna go ahead and put this on my
CPU and we'll see how it cools I know
you guys have been asking for a bunch of
reviews so watch tomorrow we're gonna
have a review that's right your favorite
thing with benchmarks and the benchmark
song going on its back rock and roll so
anyways make sure you show me that love
and it doesn't like button and anyways
make sure you subscribe because the 70k
contest is almost up and that means lots
of prizes for you rockin folks see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
