back once again at Ecco tomorrow so
check it out everybody's always looking
for that killer gift for the holiday
season but you don't always have a whole
lot of money so here's my best tech
gifts for under $25 now this first one
is for that Android fan in your family
it's little 3.5 millimeter speaker now
this thing is the pal BOTS from go
groove and it's pretty cool because it
has little movable arms
it also can turn on switch it the little
eyes come on and I think we've pretty
funny if we have one in red and green so
I could have like you know wouldn't be
the good boys won't be the bad voice
that'd be pretty funny but if you're out
there and you're an Android fan or you
have somebody you know who's an Android
fan for under 25 bucks this thing's
pretty cool now the only thing about it
that's probably not the absolute coolest
is it's not Bluetooth but big deal it
plugs into your Android phone and away
you go and to the 3.5 millimeter if you
want to be a rebel you could even use it
with your Apple device now this next one
even though these are the gifts under 25
bucks this next one's actually under $15
is the x1 scroll mouse and the people
over at eat tech sitting this thing he
has great ratings on Amazon features 5
million clicks which should last forever
2400 dpi not bad and it's actually
pretty ergonomic and pretty comfortable
so if you're looking to really save some
money and still get a killer Mouse this
thing for me tech city might just be the
golden key
so are you one of those people out there
you really like have trouble buying
gifts for someone we'll check this out
the just money from the people over at
coolermaster is a really cool device
that pretty much can be used for anybody
I think that anybody you know it's gonna
have either a smartphone or they're
gonna have themselves a tablet and this
thing works for both now adjust mini is
really really rugged constructed it's
tough
you can't break with your hands even if
you pretty much try less you're really
super strong and it's well-priced
so anybody like I said out there that
you know we'll probably most likely have
a small tablet or they'll have
themselves a smartphone and this gift
can pretty much be your solution to
solve all those problems next up we got
a wireless Bluetooth speaker from Amazon
basics so if you guys like the idea of
the speaker that we showed earlier but
you don't like the idea of having to
have that bad boy wired this might be
the solution for you now this thing
comes in a whole lot of different colors
and it's really easy to use plus it's
pretty durable all the controls are on
top all your volume control connections
and everything they're very easy to use
so honestly if you're looking for
something very small and very
unobtrusive this is something you're
gonna want to check out and things by
amazonbasics are always well priced so
you know once again this would be a gift
that won't break the bank
now this last gift is something that I
feel that anybody in the world can use
this is the grid it by cocoon and this
is an absolutely wonderful and ergonomic
product as you guys can see this thing
is very flat very easy to use it'll fit
in any type of bag any type of notebook
so you know you can take it anywhere
with you on the road now all these
things normally will be floating around
and bouncing around inside your backpack
or just bouncing around period but with
this with these straps you can lock them
down and have them all ergonomically in
place on the back you also get a zipper
so you can put a little extra storage
back here if you want to store some
stuff back here you have that as well so
it can do a dual duty thing this thing
is very well priced and I think this is
honestly one cool thing you can get for
anybody if I got this for Christmas I
gotta say I'd be like damn thank you you
want the same result try it yourself
alright so there you guys have it the
first of many of our tech guides now
was for $25 and none but we've got some
others coming so stick around now the
really cool thing about all this stuff
too is that all these prizes we're gonna
be giving away but these ones are only
for the fans of TECA tomorrow so you'll
have to go join Twitter you do not join
Facebook you don't have to join a cult
yet just kidding so this one's very
simple all you have to be is subscribed
