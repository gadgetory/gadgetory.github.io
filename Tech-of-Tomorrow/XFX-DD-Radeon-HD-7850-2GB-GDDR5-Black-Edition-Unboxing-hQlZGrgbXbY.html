just made man you know like we're just
trying to like do some cool music for
like us you know in life we thought
you'd be cool with it you know the bros
like it rock and roll you know and you
know say I've got a measuring tape and
we're gonna see this all 7870 you know
we're gonna totally totally see if it's
a lady pleaser yeah
for all my bros out there you know like
total brows and broski's let's jump in
and do some epoxy alright guys you guys
home screwing around all my videos just
like to have fun with some so check
it out this is the new XFX
our 7850 card now this is their black
edition overclock and it features their
double dissipation tooth pen technology
and their ghost done with technology for
upping the cards stay cool this card's
got 2 gigabytes of gddr5 memory pci 3.0
you guys are just here in the front of
the boxes to get to my award logo here
on the front of this box so thumbs up
i'm very stoked about that I'll get the
camera to zoom in real quick and I'll
show you guys the nomenclature on the
side of the card so if you want to look
this particular card up on new way or
whatever you can see the exact model
number of it flip it around and show you
guys the back of the box on the back of
the box got some of the repetitive stuff
here now this is AMD CPU ready and Intel
CPU ready I still find that kind of
funny they're gonna go down and talk
about some of the stuff on their card
right here got more stuff on their card
here this is the power toon software for
doing overclocking they just got some
like pictures of gaming and stuff like
that not much here's some other
technology and down here by the keeping
their card cool some other features down
here on the side they have a dual length
a single length HDMI and DisplayPort one
last thing I just want to show you folks
Before we jump in the unboxing mics I
guess we're in the unboxing before
actually actually get inside of the box
is how they choose their cards now you
can see they have GPU edging and then
the black edition cards these are like
the cream of the crop pic cards so like
in the old days you guys are hear people
talking about oh the golden sample I
want to get a golden sample well this
here is a golden sample
now reposition the box right here get
out the trusty knife after that we'll
begin the quick insertion I'm a doctor
don't try this at home and children
under 17 don't do this without
supervision of your parents no you know
I'm just with you all right
let's put the cap of the box open we're
going to have a box inside of a box
which my friend called box ception
so there we go good a little sound
effects going on here here's the car box
going oh
all the fun stuff Sears the box my stuff
not much Larry I spin around the camera
and the camera in a little bit when I
spin out of angle and everything I
do it just to make them go crazy here we
go yep and we see that all the stuff
slides out so it's like an auto open box
when you open it up it automatically
slaps all your out of the table and
I'm just kidding
all right here we go Pro Series PS use
these guys have all their good power
supplies they're actually made by sea
sonic and they're really good we've used
a bunch of them and a lot of our builds
show you guys that if you guys don't
know about it just to let you know these
guys do make good power supplies here's
a bunch of accessories and adapters that
you can get for these guys as cards they
have low profile kits those the cards
they work with here's their hardware
limited warranty XFX is known to have a
great warranty program and good RMA and
also good support it's one of the things
that people really do like about this
company's cards now here's also the
quick install guide gives you simple
basic directions on how to install the
card it's pretty pretty easy
self-explanatory stuff that's that the
quick install guide continue on the top
we've got the driver CD install guide
and this tells you how to install your
CD hopefully you know how to do that I
pray you now to do it here's the AMD
graphics card and the driver CD will be
inside the box
voila you'll disappear now bye-bye
we got some bells cool in here now I
always like this thing XFX
do not disturb on gaming this is for
pesky parents pesky girlfriends pesky
wives pesky roommates basically any of
those pesky little bastards that would
disturb in your gaming you put this on
your door it's colic turner at a hotel
and you say leave me alone I'm with my
girl room service stay away I just want
to stay in my room and have fun all day
so this is the same type of thing but
for gaming what else kind of accessories
we got in here
all right here we have the crossfire
bridge itself get that all the way this
is the case badge this is a really cool
thing I'll get this out of here for you
folks let you see it you guys haven't
seen it before it's pretty impressive
I like it
XFX has a really cool case badge XFX
black edition that's right black is
beautiful
okay so we have the card here in its
anti-static bag we'll go ahead and
remove it from the anti-static bag now I
really like the way this card looks I'm
just gonna turn this way right off the
bat get the camera get a nice zoom in
there very beautiful card the way it
looks all the clean lines all the silver
reminds me all the really high-end like
Siri equipment that I saw in the 80s so
it shows my age but hey I thought that
 was cool to fans nice shroud on the
entire thing now one of the really great
and main features about this card though
is the thermal technology involved this
card actually has a flexible membrane
that's inside of here that moves around
as the card gets hot all of the heat
gets dissipated into the heat fins into
the heat pipes and then blown out by
these two fans so the card stays really
really cool the PCI right here this is
PCI 3.0
I've your bridges right around the
corner so it probably will be happy to
go back to the table and retest
everything again there but for now we're
still gonna use it and hopefully results
will still be great so now let's take a
look at how the card looks from the side
I'm gonna flip it around I'll show you
the back of the card take a look at the
side right here you guys can see this is
the XFX are 7850 with ghost thermal
technology we have two 6-pin power
connectors right here we also have a
single I'll flip this around we also
have a single crossfire connection right
here as we take a look through our EO we
can see that XFX clearly has their label
here we have a single and a dual DVI
connection we have two main display
ports and a single HDMI port right there
now let's set the card in the table and
let's take some measurements of the card
we can see that the card is 10 inches of
the length so it's going to be a sure
lady pleaser at 10 inches take another
measurement right here the card is about
4 inches high
and in the last measurement is how thick
the card is so why people asses question
you guys can see it there
this card is just a little bit shy of
one and a half inches so that's about it
folks this is just the unboxing look for
the full review in the next couple of
days thanks for watching teka tomorrow
so you folks back here in another rock
and roll unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
