heads for around the world it's time for
SLI with the GTX 1080p I that's right
Ryan's even now this time we've taken 25
games and we've tested them all to see
how SLI scales with this a mass amount
of games I want tell you guys we're off
the bat that the scaling is pretty good
in the games but however how well it
skills and that's a little bit iffy
although 14 of the games scale not all
didn't scale very well we'll talk a
little bit about that later on the video
but with that said let's first check out
our test system if you guys follow the
channel you guys know this test system
we've used it in quite a few videos too
I think I like the last six months we're
going to ready to change it up to
something different but for now this is
the same test system that we've been
using hopefully though you fans out
there find this a well balanced of them
that's not too expensive or not too
cheap to be right in that fine pocket
for gamers out there I figured a system
that was right in the middle of the road
was the best way to go we're still using
Nvidia driver three seven eight point
seven eight we're also using the latest
edition of Windows 10 it's patched all
the drivers everything on the system are
the latest and greatest you can get your
hands on so with that said it's time to
rock
you guys can see that the way the card
scales is very kind of erratic there are
some games that score very very well
others that score kind of poorly now
Tomb Raider if you're a fan of that game
you guys can see that that game kicks
serious ass you get amazing frame rates
when you left so a with this game there
are also a few other games in DirectX 12
that do this as well out of the nine
games that we tested in DirectX 12 three
of them scaled very very well
now a lot of you guys are wondering out
there well hey I'll recommend how hot
was this running well no higher than
eighty five Celsius under full load and
what's really interesting I think is
that the back panel is removable we have
a shot of us taking the back panel off
here from other video and we also have a
shot of it running in the system this
actually helps the cards run a lot
cooler and why we're probably seeing
actually cooler scores in SL lives and
we were the single card performance
alright folks so there you have it the
goodness of SLI with the GTX 1080p I
once it connects your rhymes right on
alright so here's my opinion about this
honestly a lot of people out there don't
have the $700 to chuckle out for one
card much less another $700 to chuckle
out for a second card and with the way
that the games perform being kind of
erratic unless you're a person you've
seen our scores and you know that your
card is going to kick ass in the game
that you want to play I think I'd save
my money and stick to one card now there
are some exceptions if you're a person
out there who's just a hardcore gamer
you've got a shit ton of games in your
library you know that you're going to
have better results because you guys can
see 14 out of 25 scale so it's better
than half so if you have a math library
known so you have a hundred games well
then you can buy be sure they're
probably 60 those games are going to
scale well so if you're that person then
yeah SLI is definitely for you if you
don't have the cash I know it's a bummer
but for you that'd be worth it
but for most people out there getting
the absolute best 1080i you can get your
hands on getting a nice little overclock
one that's your best bet especially if
you're not going to be having a shit ton
of games unless like I said you know
that game is going to work like if
you're a Tomb Raider fan and you want to
rate or just totally kick ass and
everybody on your block then damn skip
Skippy you want to get yourself in SLI
split up into an ATI but if you only got
like four or five games and out of those
four or five games only one of those
games really scales for you then why
waste your money at that point it
becomes like I said many times it's dick
wagon contest so you can sell people
yeah you know I've got two cards so down
to comets when they look like a smarmy
little fuck you can go yeah
I've got two cards but I'm letting that
at all I'm into it's best for you guys
so my bottom line is this if you have a
mass amount of games you've got the
money as
like good only few games not a lot of
money yes so like bad you can tell me
what video that comes from that I just
did I'll send you something nice in the
mail just coming with video that isn't
what band I'm talking about when I do
that thing
I'm Network you guys been watching
Tekken tomorrow hope you guys enjoyed
the video download like button we'll
have links where you get more
information about this card also a
special shout out to my friend mark over
at Babel tech reviews if you guys want
to check out a different video from a
different perspective make sure you guys
check out his written review over on his
site Battletech review love a link to
that down below as well we'll see you
guys back here in Tekken tomorrow we've
got overclocking coming up and then
we've got all kinds arise and coming
stuff rise in an SLI rising in crossfire
risin risin fuckin rising</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
