editor-in-chief over here at the YouTube
channel called tech of tomorrow my
alternate Channel well a few days ago I
brought you guys a little opening thing
of the new MacBook Airs that were
hitting the market so today I'm going to
actually show you what's inside the box
this new macbook air how well it
performs and how it competes against its
other competetive the macbook pro so we
went over a few things again we'll go
over it's got a unibody design it's made
of aluminum it's very light it has an
SSD drive built in to the unit instead
of having a standard hard drive so this
may make it seem very fast because
you'll be able to access programs faster
using an SSD Drive so for gaming this is
a good thing now it also is coming
between nine hundred ninety nine dollars
and coming out at about fifteen ninety
nine so far what we've seen is battery
life is about five hours and standard
running mode and about 30 days is
supposed to be the idle standby time
haven't had it for 30 days so can't
really tell you that one as of yet so
inside of the box of the new macbook air
we get the macbook air itself we also
get the charger now the battery is
actually built into the unit so there's
no actually separate battery and also
the OS comes on a thumb drive since
there's no optical drive you know option
in the unit for those of you wondering
cuz ship with ilife 11 and the latest
mac OS it also sizes in very thinly at 0
point 682 1.1 inches the unit that we're
looking at today is the 11 inch one and
this one has a 1.4 gigahertz intel core
2 duo processor with 3 megabytes of
shared level 2 cache it also has 2
gigabytes of onboard 10 ticket six
megahertz ddr3 sdram it's got 64
gigabytes of flash storage this one has
an 11.6 inch digital LED backlit high
resolution glossy widescreen display
that has a 1366 x 768 pixel resolution
this model features the nvidia geforce
320m graphics processor with 256
megabytes of ddr3 sdram which is also
shared with the main memory it also has
a built-in insight video camera like
most macs it has two external USB 2.0
ports
a headphone jack with built-in stereo
speakers it also has a main display port
Jack ok so here we're going to take a
look at the benchmarks from just the
performance scores as numbers go it's
not as fast as the macbook pro but it
will seem faster a lot of people do to
the SSD RAM and the fact that it has the
SSD when you play games and stuff this
is going to be a pretty fast machine so
don't really take all these scores as
your final decision point because
actually are just on what I would call
the usage test playing games actually
works really good so the numbers don't
count them all into your equation
because the thing really does run pretty
well so we've seen the specifications
we've seen the scores we've talked about
the features so what this really thing
is is it's really an over-the-top
netbook because this thing is just
really lightweight and for a thousand
dollars at 11.6 inches it's a little bit
pricey but there are some really cool
things about it a it will play your
games so to me this is kind of like a
really like introductory kind of gaming
Mac thing you know so it does fit that
criteria so you know it's very light
weight it's very portable the storage on
it it's pretty fast thousand bucks a
little bit pricey but really for those
who are traveling probably the number
one greatest feature of all is that when
you take this thing to the airport you
don't have to take it out of your bag
that's an excellent feature so at the
end of the day here at Tech tomorrow I
give this thing a pretty badass award
it's 999 bucks but like i said it's very
lightweight portable can play games has
a lot of cool stuff so thanks for
watching for those of you are Mac heads
out there you'll be pretty cited out
there for you pc guys who hate keep it
to yourself it's just another review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
