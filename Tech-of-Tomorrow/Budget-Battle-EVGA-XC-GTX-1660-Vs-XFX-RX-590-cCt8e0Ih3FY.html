done it son
they have brought an entry-level card to
market now there's not going to be any
particular founders edition of the GTX
1660 card only all the board partners
will be making them but there will be
cards as low as $219 on launch and I'm
sure with some sales you'll be able to
find these cards right around the $200
mark which brings them to a very
entry-level position I know people out
there gonna scream that's not
entry-level come on
two hundred bucks two hundred and twenty
bucks 30 bucks even I really think up to
250 bucks is pretty much kind of an
entry-level card you know three to four
mid-level a little bit higher I mean
let's just face it the very top of the
line cards are really expensive on the
nvidia side of thing $1200 on AMD side
$700 and things for the high-end card so
those numbers are there now for you guys
who happen to miss the unboxing we did
an unboxing it took you know a nice
close look up of everything about this
car so if you guys happen to miss that
we'll have a link down below
today's video is a battle between this
particular card and the RX 590 now the
RX 590 is currently priced at 249
dollars pretty much a general price now
you might be able to find one that is
very similar um in price you might be
able to find one for 230 this particular
car it's $229 so we decided this would
be a really good head-to-head battle and
I think you guys will be really
surprised now because for once you're
gonna see a car that's actually cheaper
than AMD and in some cases doing a
little bit better
most the time though it's pretty much a
really close battle let's jump in real
quick let's check out our test system
then let's rock out to the new benchmark
song and talk a little bit well I think
this car is gonna be a serious winner in
today's video and gaming market let's go
we upgraded our system at the first of
the year and I know some people think
it's kind of strange that I say that the
i7 8700 K is a CPU that a lot of people
use but it really is a lot of people use
that CPU so we've stuck with that CPU
for our testing we didn't move into the
i9 arena and we weren't gonna really use
an i5 either and we've got a beautiful
brand-new test station you guys can see
this thing just looks awesome it's very
easy to work on we've
got a really nice board from a Zeus
we've got 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
we've got a really nice SSD as the boot
riot and we've got a ste gate Barracuda
2 terabyte drive that we're keeping all
of our games on so all in all this is a
very nice system we're actually using a
liquid cooler I'm keeping everything
running nice and cool I believe it is
one for the people a bit Corsair so all
in all this is a pretty nice test system
on the Nvidia side of things we're using
driver for nineteen point 35 this is
their latest beta driver and on the AMD
side of things we're using driver 19.2
and we're also using Windows 10 it has
been updated to its latest version in
fact all the drivers and everything on
the system has been updated to its
latest and most current driver as
possible at the time of this testing
real quick though Before we jump in and
check out those benchmarks let's take a
close-up look of the card and what all
its specs are specs wise the gtx 1660
features a tu1 1:6 touring GPU 12
nanometer FFM manufacturing process 1408
cuda cores six gigabytes of gddr5 memory
192 bit memory bus it's got a memory
bandwidth of 100 92.1 gigabytes a second
now the base clock on this particular
card is 1530 megahertz has a boost clock
of 1785 megahertz there a v8 texture
units 22 streaming multi processors and
40 rock units alright so there you have
it all of the specs and everything you
really need to know about the brand new
EVGA XE gtx 1660 what that said though
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
a head-to-head battle against the RX 590
from the folks over at XFX the Fatboy
all right I love that song now this card
only got is hot as 71 Celsius under
maximum load that's pretty doggone good
especially for a card that has such a
low power requirement I mean pretty much
you'll need 120 watts to power this card
with a 400 really maximum for your power
supply recommendation you can build a
really low end system and stick this
video card inside of it now the only
caveat the card I would think really
though is honestly like I said before is
this card is really really thick I mean
it is a big thick thick thick card but
beyond that it's really cool for
building little small systems and the
numbers are good now you guys can see
that the XFX Fatboy rx 590 this card
performed pretty much head-to-head
across the board there was only three
games with this card actually beat that
card so that's really cool for a car
that's coming into market at two hundred
and twenty nine dollars think it's a
great thing
this is definitely an editor's choice
product it's an entry-level product
that's affordable it's small it has
great numbers and if you're just
somebody out there just looking for a
great 1088 card you don't have some
exclusive 4k monitor or something that
has such you know grand designs that it
needs a great big powerful card this may
just fit your budget and your needs so
I'm Miller you guys been watching tech
damar like usual we will have a link
down below where you guys can check out
more information or purchase one for
yourself um I would tell you to
subscribe and you turn your
notifications but it seems like those
things don't really matter anymore but
I'd love to see you guys here and I'd
love to see you guys back here and we'll
just leave it at that we also have a
website if you want to check that out
I'm Mel archit thanks for being here
