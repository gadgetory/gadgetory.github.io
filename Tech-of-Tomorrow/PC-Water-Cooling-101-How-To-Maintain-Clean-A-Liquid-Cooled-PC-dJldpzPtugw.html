their new premier pro SP 920 SSDs
feature blazing fast speeds and size up
to one terabyte for more information
check out the link below welcome back my
friends to another tech us out here on
tech of tomorrow what are we doing today
well today we're going to show you guys
how to maintain and clean your liquid
cooling kit now so Michael why would I
want to do that well when you're using a
bunch of different liquids inside of
your kit a lot of times some of the
parts inside there can start to get
corroded and different things happen now
clean that kit out with a particular kit
the reason today which is the Mayhem's
blitz Pro it takes up all the
oxidization all those bad trace minerals
and creates a much better environment
for your cooling system to be in which
actually helps dissipate heat and just
make it run altogether better now this
kits about $49 and it's actually not for
the meek apart this is actually a pretty
professional level type of product you
even have to wear gloves when you use it
so that you don't get any on your hands
or you know maybe you have to do a
proctology examination that day maybe
that's what they're for no but anyways
so that's this is the video today is
about it's about this cleaning kit and
how to use it so with that said let's
jump in let's unbox and take a look at
the kit we'll come inside of it and then
let's talk about how you use it and
clean out your system so that you have a
fresh brand new clean system for your
liquid to go back in and keep your
system running cool huh alright folks so
first off here we go we have the mayhem
blitz pro kit like I said this thing's
about $49 or did the cut and by the way
this stuff comes from the UK so it's
made from those people over there who
love dark beer love their tea and love
the fish and chips that's right just
poke and punch you guys if you guys like
other things I know you do and just
kidding so but from across the pond from
England it heads came and so let's start
unboxing it now there's two parts to
this kit and the instruction matter the
first thing they're going to tell you to
do is they're going to tell you to put
on the gloves that's right so here are a
bunch of sets of gloves
so like I said you can use these for
this or they're good for proctology
examination
you know if you're into that kind of
thing so first thing you do is you put
on the gloves so the gloves come in it
part 1 part 2 these things are also
different ph-balanced here we've got
some glasses oh ok yep ha ha I
gotta say now this is more hardcore than
I thought it was going to be so let me
open the glasses up here
woo ha alright so we even come with
glasses oh my goodness so let me put
these on and get the camera and re zoom
back over here and show my ugly mug with
the glasses so the entire video must be
filmed in mayhem vision so you got your
glasses get your old proctology gloves
here so get one on my hand here umm
cameraman would you mind bending over
over here we're going to make sure we do
your weekly proctology examination make
sure you're OK for filming so have a
little trouble the gloves folks because
actually my thumb is broke on this hand
I need to go the doctrine of the dang
thing fixed and it's a hurting ouch but
we're going to get these gloves on so
okay so now we've got I look like some
kind of crazy surgeon at a hospital now
gloves and glasses alright then so Wow
ok this is crazy this kits well well
well worth the money it comes with a pH
reading kit now this is crazy
it comes with even the solution pattern
everything for you to make this pH
neutral so you'll basically first thing
I want to do to set this thing up is you
want to use this cup right here take the
arrow head or whoever distilled water
you're going to want to put that inside
of here take your pin you're going to
want to insert your pin into the water
there's some calibration things that
read down here on the bottom I have not
seen one of these things since I was in
college so uh I didn't want just snap it
off but it should just slide right off
here most of them do this particular one
if for some reason is not okay there we
go sorry about that folks so you guys
can see inside of here this is how it
measures everything so you put that
inside of the water you'll engage it
you'll put it inside of here you'll pH
balance it to its pH neutral and then
you can use this for testing out this
different stuff now the first thing you
want to going to do is you're going to
want to use part one and with part one
is they basically the pre-rinse for your
system now first off for you people out
there who's never done water clean or
whatever I know this is probably a
little above your head and you guys have
asked for a video on 101 water cooling
we're going to work with anthem rails
we're actually going to bring that to
you so this is kind of more for advanced
people so those people out there know
what's up but basically you're in of a
drain tube we're filled tube and with
with part number one you're going to
remove this and then after you mix part
one follow the instructions and all that
stuff will have actually a link to some
overclockers in UK where they have a
full-blown thing on how to do this so
you guys want even more information
we're just kind of giving you the
overview video so this part you mix part
one you mix it you put it inside the
machine you let it run with your
pre-existing liquid inside of there for
a few hours then you drain it you redo
that step again you drain the entire
system again when that's done you take
everything out of it you start over with
distilled water again and you use the
part two and the part two you can run
for even more hours so basically this is
all at all takes about 24 hours to do
now one thing to take note of when
you're using part 2 part 2 is actually
going to foam up quite a bit and that's
normal because it's actually a cleaning
agent so it's going to go through there
so basically the part 1 is going to go
inside there it's going to get
everything ready and cleaned out that's
like dunkey junkie then you're going to
move up to part two the part two is
going to go in and clean all of those
bad trace minerals and everything out
completely out so part one you put in
your system you run for two hours
rinse repeat
then you move to part 2 part 2 you can
run your system for up to 24 hours no
longer then you completely drain the
system out and you start from scratch
refilling with your new liquid cooling
the really cool thing about using this
stuff is it takes off all of the
oxidation all the gunk and junk trace
metals and everything completely out of
your system so sometimes people say oh
it is this stuff you know create rusted
anything happen well if any of that type
of stuffs happening inside your system
it completely removes it now one thing
to note this is only good for brass
copper steel it's not good for aluminum
whatsoever you do not want to use
aluminum so but basically and how long
and how often you use this depends on
how often use your system now me
personally this system is actually quite
old this is a samurai system we built
this a long time ago in my previous
other channel and it's been around so
we're going to actually take that this
weekend you'll see Anthony Reynolds back
on our channel once again and we'll be
clean this thing out and doing it with
this stuff I'm just giving you guys the
prequel of what's going on with it and
showing you guys what it is so with that
said I'm Eric I hope you guys like the
style of video I know you guys asked for
it I'm going to reiterate once again you
guys want the water cooling 101 we're
going to bring that to you we're trying
to get more how-to videos in house I
would do this whole thing but draining
it out and all that stuff is something
that's a lot of time consuming and even
if I did that and showed you it it just
means the same thing so if I told you
here pour water out of a cup or showing
you pouring water out of a cup it's not
really that much of a difference you
know I'm saying it's just not so you
guys get the whole gist of where I'm
going with this thing
another thing before I actually bounced
out of here folks when you guys are
draining the system you want to make
sure that you fully fully dilute what
you're draining this does actually
eco-friendly but you don't want to get
it and clog your drain up or anything so
when you are draining your system make
sure you use lots of clear normal water
when you're rinsing it down so that all
goes very cleanly down and doesn't clog
anything up so I think this is pretty
cool I know a lot of people out there
say hey you know I don't want to using
that colored liquid type stuff but I got
to tell you man we just got in some new
brand new silver stuff that's right and
so this stuff looks amazing I don't know
if you guys you know your generation
probably not going to know what I'm
talking about but you old scores I know
we used to have these things but
can the damn they still have they're
called lava lamps they have this stuff
spinning around well you could get back
in the swap meet when I was a kid these
things that had all these crazy colors
they were inside of like a Pepsi bottle
you move them around and all the colors
change inside well Michael wouldn't gang
they've actually created something that
you can put inside your system that
looks like this now I know what you guys
think but if I show walking around CES
and I walked up and I saw that I'd be
like Oh totally badass now colored
tubing yeah that's cool but how badass
is it's just colored tubing now I'm sure
you can make that really clean but if
you walk up to something and you're like
oh my God look at all those amazing
colors in that that is awesome and
that's what these guys are really
gearing for I mean you can use the stuff
near normal use as well now but this
does show stuff it's for people who want
to go out and they want to say hey look
at my badass custom build and check out
the stuff I'm losing in my loop yeah
using in my loop and that's what it's
all about folks so I'm Eric thanks for
watching this video I love you guys all
its information by the way we'll be down
there below that like button which hope
you guys it we will also have a link
over to the people or overclockers UK
where they have a full-blown review on
how to do this as well will the
follow-up to this folks cuz we just got
new colors in and the next one I do will
be actually more scientifically based
the first one I admit I was really a
newbie doing it and I was just having
fun but a lot of people complained said
hey you're going to look what the fact
you're doing ok I'll admit to you guys I
really didn't know that too much about
it usually I use this stuff from Swift
Texas hydro next up and I just put it
inside my system and I'm done with it
using all this new colored stuff is new
for me I'm learning you're learning
we're family we're doing it together
love you guys see his back in the
channel
and be with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
