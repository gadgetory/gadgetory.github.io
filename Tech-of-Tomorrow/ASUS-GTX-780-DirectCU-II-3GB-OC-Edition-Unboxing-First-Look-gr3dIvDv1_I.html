back to tech Oh tomorrow I'm Eric your
host and I got buddy the dog my co-host
and we've got a nice part from the
people over at Asus over here to my
right this is their new direct cu2
GeForce GTX 780 now this thing's totally
not based on a reference design features
their direct cu2 cooling has all kinds
of good things that make this card
superior than a standard reference card
with that said let's jump in and let's
check it out
all right folks so here we go like any
unboxing and first look obviously we're
going to show you the cotton-pickin box
so here we go
the Asus logo the direct cu2 overclocked
versions see you being the periodic
table marking for copper you guys can
see the cooling here basically the
direct Cu means that the copper heatsink
is directly up against the GPU for
maximum cooling benefit overclocked
edition three gigabytes of gddr5 memory
the digi+ superalloy power and stable
overclocking the GPU tweak which is
their software windows 8 ready obviously
geforce gtx 780 we're going to flip it
around to the back of the box were they
just really once again go over the
supreme features the direct Cu to the
overclocked edition and when here once
again and see the digi+ vrm + super
alloy power now what this really does is
it helps your components run cooler and
for much longer as long as there's not a
lot of heat variation in your card it
will run for much longer and actually
with the way if the overclocking works
with boost the cooler the card runs the
better it is
they use their GPU tweak for doing the
overclocking let's now just jump in
though and see the card and its
accessories so I'm going to go ahead
just put the top right here will cap get
that out and get our usual box within a
box within a box within a box within a
box within a box within a box on Yatta
Yatta so here we go hey Zeus put the top
right here on top will see all the
accessories let's see if there's any
other accessories over here now a lot of
people always ask me this about a Zeus
cards and I'm going to show you this is
directly from the factory now look the
plastic bag anti-static bag is not on
the card
I've never gotten a card from them with
it it's always inside of this
anti-static foam which you guys can see
inside of here
but for now let's just go ahead and
close that up and be a little teasing
bastard
and let's take a look at the accessories
you want to put the cap here what do we
got what do we got what do we got all
right so we have two 6-pin two eight pin
power converter two six to the eight
we'll toss it off the side here we have
our speed setup guide driver GPU tweak
all that good stuffs in there and then
we have a single SLI bracket pretty far
away - very very far so it gives you
lots of options on how far it's going to
be on your motherboard so pretty cool
stuff that's all the accessories pack
let's move past it and let's see the
card Ton Ton Ton now a lot the bat folks
you guys can see it has two fans on it
so let me just pop this down it's easier
to work up here now when it says direct
see you - what that means is two fans
the - designates having two fans if this
is a direct Cu card it just has one fan
somebody asked me other day after xcu
two-minute was a newer version no it
just means two fans and now you can see
that asus is taking the time though to
actually change the fan structure you're
now getting two different types of fans
on it it's still open air architecture
all the way around the card you guys can
see cleanly all of the heat pipes
running on the side looks like a tricked
out Chevy from back in the 70s you got
your PCI 3.0 interface right there the
plug for your fan is right here will
just keep spending the card around and
running around you guys take a look at
the back here you guys can see some of
the aluminum heat fins so essentially
what happens is the directs you copper
all the heat gets popped in to all of
the fins goes through the heat pipes and
then gets blown out into your case now
one thing though with open air
architecture like this you're going to
want to have good airflow inside of your
case if you have really terrible airflow
the hot air is going to remain inside
there because this just is generated to
blow the heat away from the card so
let's just flip it around real quick
again you see a six pin 8 pin power once
again we see the direct cu2 nomenclature
giant heat pipe going here
now this is something folks that I
always think is totally badass about a
zeus cards and that is this bitchin
backplate i love the out of this I
know most you guys do too I can
basically set my card down anywhere I
can touch my card I don't have to worry
about any of my components getting
strapped shorting out cutting me a Zeus
I got a hat to you folks badass job on
this now you guys can see also there are
a bunch of screws located all the way
across the back here usually you only
have to remove these four screws but I
actually took a closer look and you have
to remove many many more to get this
cooling solution off so it'll be a
little bit more difficult for those
people want to play around that if your
and shower water cooled or anything like
that now we also have in the back here
to SLI fingers obviously this is a top
of the line card so it is going to do
Quad SLI no problem at all then last but
not least let's flip it around let's
take a look at the rear i/o standard
DisplayPort standard HDMI DVI D D VII
everything you need to get up and going
now it's really weird I'm seeing a lot
of motherboards coming out and a lot of
these new motherboards no longer have a
DVI connection on them at all so we're
going to want to DVI to and become a
thing of the past here in the future so
that's it folks
you guys get the card all this lovely
stuff that we have over right here and
that's everything that comes in the box
the brand new Asus direct cu2 geforce
gtx 780 alright folks so there you have
it the unboxing and first look of the
