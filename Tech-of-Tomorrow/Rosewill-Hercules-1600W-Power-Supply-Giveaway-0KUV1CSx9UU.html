get funky where is some honky tonky
heroes well hey what's up guys
Elric here on the ticket of morrow
youtube channel bringing you all the
tech all the freaking time and this time
we're giving away some stuff that's
right that's what this is all about and
I'm just gonna say up front I apologize
the person who's supposed to get this in
the prize but son I'm gonna unbox it
you're gonna win it but I'm gonna have
to take that bad boy out and get it
negative so that's just gonna have to
happen here so anyways I got these uh
three things up here on top these are
about $15 apiece now the whole dumper
camera can see them these are a handy
notebook accessory kit which anybody who
has a laptop can actually use these are
all the runner-up prizes now in this box
back behind me practically to the side
of me I guess it is this is the Rose
will Hercules 1600 watt power supplies
so listen do you guys know who Hercules
was alright check this out there was
this dude with an ego complex thought he
was a god called himself Zeus
alright maybe you know he was a god I
wasn't there but anyways he don't slip
around and you know he bang this one
human girl name escapes me right now you
know and um well they had a child and
his name was you know Hercules you know
he was like the baddest me it is strong
and you know basically he was the best
guy you know of the family you know the
story gods came down they tried to cause
some problems he stuck with the humans
you guys have all seen the movies it's
history man if not check out the movies
they're actually pretty cool some
special effects but I'm rambling so
let's take this stuff right here I'm
gonna take it now and sit it down gently
gently I'm what gently alright now check
that big box right here now this thing
folks weighs bracken done that's right
it weighs a freaking time I mean serious
this thing's heavy as hell it's 400
bucks I mean it's basically an
incredibly power power supply now I'm
just wondering cuz like here in America
we
not have power that goes up to 1600
watts so it must taper off that you know
it what our maximum is and I'm thinking
that so now oh wow this is actually you
guys are lucky man this thing is gonna
be badass you guys are in for a treat
now check this out this is the first
ever that I've seen this power supply it
comes in a freaking middle box maybe
others have done it but man check this
out
boom metal box Kabam see this thing it's
like getting a freaking treasure chest
man I feel like I open just like a I
can't say that in the movie the Pirates
of the something you know because I got
a little treasure chest right here and
look it goes multiple directions this is
like trippy kinda like almost almost
honestly kind of like something used for
like a high end power amp they can look
at a Marshall stack
alright so alright folks so now check it
out I'm about to open this thing up pop
the top here ba boom I check this out
it's completely padded inside of here
there's even cloth inside of here to
protect it check this out
Rosewill felt cloth that's pretty damn
cool stuff and so let's get in here now
semi modular power supply obviously
something gonna go ahead and pull this
bad boy off we'll just take a look at
this Hercules 1600 watt holy crap Batman
right that's what I'm saying so flip it
around right here now obviously this
thing is going to support any type of
stuff you want I sure the hell hope so
is 600 watts it should be supporting
Quad SLI quad crossfire quad people
crossing their eyes I mean how like
should do a lot so it's flipping around
the back here we can see let's see her
make it this better for you guys okay so
here we go here you can see the back of
it all the PCI ease right there in the
red all the SATA and the rest right here
hard drive SATA flopping all power down
here PCIe all up there power
all right here you got your 24 pin here
got a bunch of dual four pins
eight pen you got all the stuff you need
for the power on your motherboard right
here so these are all for your
peripherals so you guys the other side
just real quick so once again the name
and the very back you can see right here
fan control and look at this they have
protection on the power switch now folks
I'm going to tell you why they have this
on here I've asked this a lot before and
I've complained to companies I'm like
hey why doesn't your high in power
supply have an on/off switch and they're
telling me that's because it's actually
dangerous to turn the power supply off
by the button like that if it's plugged
in like this so that's why it's like
that it's actually better to try to shut
this thing off if you have the wall
control like into one of those switches
shut it off there first before you even
mess with this whatsoever so let's get
this out of the way here we've got the
Hercules 80 plus a silver user's manual
that's 1600 watts um you know heaven
silver plus is pretty damn good cuz
you've got a lot of power there so if
it's constantly weren't even 1400 watts
you're kicking ass bang this stuff out
of here sorry guy let me know like tear
your little box up here alright so Wow
here we go leer this all of the cables
are in there holy macaroni Junie Junie
alright so you guys want to see them
I'll try to bore you to down much with
these so I'm not gonna go eh on this
okay folks power supply power cord right

and tons of six and eight pin
connections here enough to do yes duh

alright folks so there you have it now
I've seen a box like this one time in
the past before back in the past
