back to another edition of TECA tomorrow
I'm mark your host my co-host is JJ from
Asus and today we're gonna be taking a
close-up of their new motherboards for
Haswell and now we're gonna be taking a
look at the rog series which is Republic
of gamers geared for those folks out
there who want the absolute most out of
their gaming motherboard so JJ what's up
yeah no definitely what's up is that
what's up is that we have three of our
brand-new rog series motherboards that
are gonna be launching as part of the
z87 chipset so as always you know we're
really excited about bringing our G to
the table in terms of the product stack
because we feel that it's going to be
providing you know the enthusiasts the
best of the best not only in terms of
tweaking tuning performance options but
of course is special set of features
that really complement the gamer and the
enthusiast that khana is looking for the
best the best the most innovation when
it comes to giving them you know
competitive advantages you know more
performance oriented technologies or you
know new layers of flexibility at
tweaking or tuning in their system so
for the core launch we're going to be
having our Xtreme board which is the top
in on our og we're going to actually be
introducing a new board in terms of our
og in terms of the value segmentation
which is going to be the Maximus hero
hero correct hero versus the Maximus
Xtreme and then lastly we're going to
have the gene so if we kind of consider
a little bit of lay of the land
extremists Oracle II always taking
precedence as being that kind of the
flagship board gives us the most
expansion in terms of the amount of PCIe
connectivity as some very specialized
features really geared towards the
tweakers and tuners and overclockers out
there but it's also targeted to the guys
that are really looking for the best of
the best in terms of individual
component Ori that they're gonna expand
upon with the board in the past where
we've had formula which formula will be
coming soon but won't be launching
initially with these three boards
formula and gene have made up kind of
that focus at the hardcore or the real
focused gamer where we've had
specialized technologies in terms of
networking as well as audio and other
specialized designs hero is kind of
aligning with gene at being at a more
aggressive price ban in the past we've
tried to talk about gene being really
the value point for our G at saying look
if you're looking to build and get the
benefits of what an RGB or des to offer
don't just be limited from the
respective the gene as a migrated XQ
look at it from the aspect you know 90%
of users they only use one single GPU if
you're talking about that at the same
price man you're getting a board that
may be just it has a couple extra slots
it could have inferior audio not as
advanced network conductivity it doesn't
have anywhere near maybe the the power
component quality or even the
supplemental RG features so MPEG sound
will be on this gene board yes supreme
effects continues to be there but you
know some people always kind of work oh
you know when I'm thinking about
building an ATX system or you know an
entry-level system for gaming if I
wasn't thinking about doing small
form-factor they weren't recognizing the
gene what's that kind of entry-level
option that we were being able to
provide so that's where hero comes in
here on is kind of divining a real big
point for value for us in terms of being
able to give you all the key things that
make an RG board in our G board but in a
much more aggressive price point so come
with a cape and no it doesn't come so
you're probably the Cape I'm just saying
but you know before we touch on a lot of
things that really make the hero special
board let's go ahead and and take a look
at the extreme on the top inside so you
know and a lot of ways you're going to
continue to see aspects that look very
very similar to what you've kind of come
to expect with the extreme series boards
you're going to have a course a super
high performance PRM section that's our
Xtreme engine GGT power design so you've
got the niche econ GT block capacitors
those are 10k rated if you remember on
the mainstream series those are five
times later it's it has twice as much
life correct and this is actually then
5x compared to what the competitors are
using in the marketplace so that's
giving you an outstanding level of
performance in terms of lifespan plus
they offer significantly lower and
higher temperature tolerances that's
going to be important especially for the
guys that are pushing their systems or
running multiple GPUs
you're just having that much more
comfort in the fact that the components
that are on there can come from be
running more hot or or even colder
environments if maybe you're putting
this unit under extreme forms of cooling
now also jay-z like with cards like the
matrix construct for those still work
the same this you know if those cars up
directly to the motherboard just like
traditionally other series were as well
yes and no we've actually made some
changes that the extreme is actually
smaller it's formal it's actually
fitting within the standard ATX
dimensions but we've gone ahead and
moved some of the specialized functions
like VGA Hotwire and sub-zero sense
which we had before
off the board but that doesn't mean that
we've taken them away we're going to be
touching on a very special item that we
have over there in the corner called the
OC panel that will allow us to go ahead
and touch on a lot of new functionality
that we're introducing for our RG series
of boards but continuing on with extreme
engine DD power design we've got the 10k
caps we have these super high
performance what are called black-winged
inductors so these guys are rated for 60
amps apiece and like always you know we
stress that it's not about quantity it's
about the quality and the design of your
power topology you know this board is
already done over seven gigahertz and
thirty seven hundred megahertz on memory
you know in our maximum performance
testing so it goes to show you once
again in terms of the world record
performance you have capable for you
that the power solution that we have is
unmatched at being able to just give you
outstanding performance and flexibility
of making sure that you have stability
and great power delivery and the great
thing is you're going to get this
consistent high performance power
implementation across all the RG SKUs
even boards like the gene and the hero
so that's that's a really nice touch to
know that you're not getting anything
dropped down just by dropping down to
the board you're still going to get that
great rog kind of DNA consistent across
all of these and from there of course we
continue to use ultra high performance
MOSFETs and drivers to round out the
power G's of your solution now this is
going to be a four-way capable board so
you can of course have three-way and
fully expansion support or if you're
running only two GPUs you get the
optimal layering effect in terms of
being able to have spacing even with two
triple slot based cards so that's a nice
touch of course you got a huge amount of
SATA conductivity ten set of 6g ports
and a ton of expansion now if you
remember in the last generation we had
the M combo module which allows you to
have Wi-Fi and an M SATA we actually
have now a new generation M combo module
which will show you guys to slide up
because we don't have it here on hand
but this board will come integrated with
a dogeleven AC but instead of mSATA
we've transitioned it to the latest
generation specification called ng FF or
what some people are now referring to as
it's correct name which is m dot 2 m dot
2 yes
m dot 2 is a new standard for ultra
small flash storage the benefit of m dot
2 is as opposed to being linked into a
PC H or a SATA port it's actually
directly linked into PCI Express so it
has the officer the option and the
capability of offering you lower latency
and even
higher potential throughput so we're
really excited to be the first vendor
that's interfacing this new MDOT to
support on our M combo modules so MSA is
already pretty much coming on yeah it's
it's transitioning away in terms of
being a specification that's going to be
rolling out and for the extreme board as
well as for the gene and the upcoming
hero they will support the M combo
module so you can have that on board
determines the rest connectivity of
course you get what you would expect in
terms of USB 3 integrated Intel Gigabit
Ethernet and a ton of rest in terms of
the expansive connectivity I mean you
got all your fan headers which once
again our course controllable within the
UEFI or within the software so with that
let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about us very special accessory that's
going to be are coming included with the
extreme board this thing yes this thing
yes some people Meehan is sure why not
alright are you so uh this guy right
here is the OC panel so the OC panel is
really an awesome piece of hardware that
we've been working on for a long time if
you guys remember we've had kind of a
trend of always doing new and innovative
ways of being able to tweak and tune the
motherboard we've had things like the
original OC panel which kind of went
into a bay and had kind of like a screen
we've done an OC panel that was limited
the extreme community we've had ROG
Connect if you even remember back to
like the rampage 2 days we had on board
tweak it controls exact and it's funny
because we've seen competitors copy some
of these controls even on current
generation products and the reality is
we've done more work with the enthusiast
community than any other vendor and on
board controls that give you riff for
real-time control functionality even
though we had a small set of users that
really appreciate it
yeah they found that almost nobody was
using them that's the reason why we
actually transitioned away all the way
back on the rampage to extreme and when
we launched the rampage 3 extreme we
killed all those controls because nobody
was using them and we went ahead and we
integrated ROG Connect which we still
offer on the boards in terms of giving
you that full hardware level control to
monitor overclock and tune your system
via USB enabled product like a tablet or
um you know or a desktop or a notebook
you have the ability to directly control
it while it's in game or what's running
a benchmark but you know maybe some
people don't want to have to be limited
to having to
have that type of device connected in on
hand so we wanted to evolve something
and that's what we have here so with
this little guy it's an awesome handheld
unit that gives you a lot of
functionality we have a full VFD display
that gives you real-time information
such as your temperatures it's going to
have your frequency information your
voltages we now keep the sub-zero sets
in the v-j a hot wire technology but we
integrated on here so you can see right
here this is for the sub-zero sense and
then from there if we pull this off then
we go ahead and we have the VGA how our
technology so you can still link in the
graphics card directly to this and be
able to have advanced level tidge
control you're gonna have even direct
digital control similar to VGA Hotwire
that will work on any graphics card as
long as it's using a digital controller
we've got four fan it who's here and we
even have our advanced slow mode and a
special overclocking related
technologies on here that you can go
ahead and switch on and off so it's your
salute man that's my slow-mo sounds good
sounds good so from there of course you
have the ability that you can
dynamically increase your BC LK or your
ratios you can enter that in and it's
all hardware based no software required
now this is really awesome right but at
the end of the day what happens if
you're somebody like me that overclocks
tweaks and Tunes their system but I
don't bench right I don't I don't
necessarily need something handheld like
this yours is all inside your case right
I run everything inside my case and this
is cool but I might not necessarily want
you know actually be able to take
advantage of it all the time you know I
could maybe connected to my board and
maybe kind of have it sitting on my desk
something like that but you know what we
wanted to try to do is complement not
only the extreme users but the normal
users so what we've does it a
transformer it does actually kind of
transform so it will also come with this
actually five and a quarter Bay adapter
what we can do is we can go ahead and we
can adjust it like this we can do this
and then now you can install it directly
inside your chassis and with the flip of
a switch it will change from extreme
mode into normal mode so normal mode
will give you a whole different set of
information such as CPU temperature
you'll be able to make adjustment to
your primary CPU fan header to change it
from maybe like performance oriented
coolant to silent oriented cooling if
you want maybe a quick one-button
overclock you can go ahead and just
press that button to be able to
overclock your system you can turn on
and off the actual display does it have
any built-in overclocking
profiles that you can set that you can
actually go back to and remember you
actually can you can go inside of our
UEFI and you can define your own profile
so that you can load it at that touch of
a button so it really speaks to actually
the enthusiasts out there not only from
normal everyday users but also the
extreme community so we think that we've
actually really provided a high degree
of flexibility and value to different
people in different segmentations but
with one device a lot of flexibility
yeah 100% so this is a really cool
awesome piece of hardware it will come
included with the maximum of six extreme
but be fully compatible with the rest of
the rog lineup all you need to do is
they'll just be a basic little cable
that connects to the bottom of the unit
and then connects to a special header on
the actual board and from there you'll
be good to go so with that let's go
ahead and maybe move down to the hero
so hero we feel is going to be a really
really special SKU and the respect that
it's going to allow users to be able to
go into the RG product line at a
significantly more aggressive price
point and be able to be able to t still
exceeds we still be able to take
advantage of all kind of the key things
that really make this an orangy board so
you're still gonna get all the ultra
high-end component quality that makes it
rog right you're still gonna get awesome
fan control functionality you're going
to get an Intel NIC you're going to get
our game first packet priority software
to allows you to optimize to get better
performance in terms of reduced ping
lower latency you can tune this for
anything from downloading your
applications to streaming to general web
browsing you can go and have great
management over that high performance
Intel iSeries NIC because just like in
the mainstream is it automatic like
through a GUI we just go ahead and click
it and automatically changes the way
that it work where I packets 100% and
you can also go ahead and manually
optimize it for different game profiles
so if you want to go in there and let's
say modify it for Battlefield 3 and make
specific tweaks and adjustments you can
go ahead and do that
even if a game title doesn't exist
within the application you can go in and
you can map it to any executable you
want to always be able to take advantage
of it the other cool part about game
first is that it's not limited to just
the Intel network controller if let's
say maybe you know six months down the
road you decide you want to buy like one
of our high performance wireless
adapters whether it's a USB bass adapter
like a PCI Express space adapter game
first can be mapped to any network
controller so unlike sometimes other
more limited solutions which are only
specific to one controller we could
that to any type of networking device
that you have on your system you're
going to course get the exclusive
supreme effects audio design as well but
one thing that's going to be really
special is that we've also for this
generation not only maintained the
supreme effects audio implementation and
even brought in some of the higher-end
features that we had on the formula
board like the Elna audio capacitors but
we have a brand new exclusive feature
called sound radar so you guys are
actually gonna see a video that we're
gonna overlay here so keep in mind that
this is not a finalized version of the
video but the cool thing that we're
gonna have within sound radar is it's a
real-time detection of ingame related
sound which shows a really cool thing is
like who are shooting at you how many
people are shooting at you bombs going
off yeah and we can map it for actually
different types of things so you can
imagine right here in the counter-strike
engine you're gonna see that it's
detecting everything from gunshots -
footsteps - bombs and so you could
imagine if maybe you're taking a corner
and you have multi people shooting at
you before you might have not known how
many people were waiting there for you
but now based on sound raters
information you're gonna be able to
prepare yourself and be able to take
those guys out before they're able to
get to you so a whole new level of kind
of functionality and versatility that we
feel it's just taking our audio design
to the next level and really speaking
once again to that gamer demographic and
giving them best-in-class
audio designs and that is going to be on
any one of the boards that feature our
supreme effects audio implementation so
moving past that of course we're going
to continue to have a great layout in
terms of connectivity expansion you know
you're gonna have SLI and crossfire
support you're still going to get eight
SATA ports on the board and you're still
going to course get onboard a buttons
such as debug LED restart power and
reset as well as our advanced like cue
LED technologies USB Boz flashback USB 3
boost so you're gonna get all the
hallmark stuff that you always expect on
now on an Asus class series board but
everything else that makes it ROG
there's even going to be some really
nice software we've made updates to both
daemon tools Pro and Kaspersky antivirus
where you going to latest versions of
those and we've even added really cool
software such as RAM disk we now have
the ability to fully take and map your
memory and create your own localized RAM
disk on your system and it's not going
to cost you anything because the
software comes included with the
motherboard so of course the benefits
and the performance of running something
directly from RAM were pretty
self-explanatory
is very very fast yeah so that's gonna
be a great level functionality it's
offered there so rounding that out we
can take a look here at the gene board
so pretty much you know gene is always
represented the best of the best when it
comes to small constable so if you're
looking to have no compromise in terms
of connectivity overall overclock
ability and just robust features set on
a board the gene takes the cake can I so
cringy is there really any difference
though between these two boards other
than the bottom PCI solder all the
features pretty much the same as I'm
looking at the boards these two boards
look pretty much identical and when you
move up to this one you just take the
sound off you get a lot more expansion
for your video cards and more USB
support but these two look really much
quite a bit alike though they're not
most definitive it's very similar to the
mainstream series that's one of the
things that we pride ourselves on we
don't want you to feel like you're
getting a compromised value right you're
gonna get the same high performance you
know digi digi plus power design the
extreme engine dg3
right with all the same capacitors with
the same inductors and same chokes
technically the gene is positioned above
the hero so there is some additional
optimizations and layout on the hardware
side board is actually considered a
higher skew than that board that is
correct huh because it does offer the EM
combo module where the hero to be at a
more aggressive price point doesn't come
included with the EM combo module so
it's smaller and has a better scale yeah
so I mean even in terms of maximum tweak
ability and overclock ability the gene
boards gonna actually be a little bit
better than the hero but keep in mind
all these boards are all fully capable
of hitting what the maximum is that has
well has to offer yeah you know I've
done personally on every single one of
these 4.8 gigahertz plus with twenty
eight hundred megahertz memory on for
dents on every single one of them
there's no sacrifice whatsoever in the
overclocking element all these boards
are gonna be able to overclock they all
have the same chance of hitting those
same clock speeds would no matter which
one you use yeah it's all coming down to
the CPU quality as well as the thermal
solution if your ultimate looking for
more granularity and even more precise
level of controls as you move up to
let's say something like the extreme
board
you're gonna even have that much more
flexibility at how you can tweak tune
and define your overclocking parameters
but in terms of the capability they're
all super robust although I will say
extreme has some special hardware
designs that just take it to a whole
nother level so what you would come to
expect there is pretty much everything
we've also discussed
with the exception like I said this one
also includes the M combo module like
the Xtreme board but it won't hi I am
saying but it won't come with Wi-Fi
integrated on it so it'll be just like
the previous Jean where you have the M
combo module so if you want to put in
your own mini PCI Express to have Wi-Fi
or your own flash storage so you have
integrated flash storage conductivity
that'll be available to you you're just
a third party manufacturers right yeah
whatever you want to go ahead and
integrate it's up to you whether you
want a 2g 11ac
you want dual bad and you know you want
maybe 120 gigabyte drive for caching or
you want a 240 for full OS totally up to
you
so the jeans gonna be an awesome SKU
comes with the same software set that
we've also described here and also fully
compatible with the the OC panel so that
gives you a bit of perspective I think
on terms of what we're doing with ROG
and on awesome our right series of
boards I mean if you take a look at the
software feature set its unrivaled the
UEFI which we're going to do hopefully
some coverage here I'm talking about all
the new functions we have inside the
UEFI is going to be really impressive RG
has even more specialized options on top
of that one killer one for you guys is
that secure race if you're familiar with
secure racing and SSD we now have secure
race built inside of the UEFI that gives
you like government level encryption
right clears the drive off actually
allows you to regain the performance for
an SSD after it's become degraded over
certain sort of defrag it's kind of like
a defrag type of thing for an SSD
similar a little bit different but
ultimately it allows you to recoup and
maximize the performance getting your
SSD back to about a hundred percent
performance before you had to use maybe
special tool boxes or you would have to
use third-party programs and booted to
like Linux and that's and all those are
just this board built into any of the
rog series UEFI s so we're gonna do
something separately on ua5 make sure
that you check out that video guys
there's gonna be features in there that
you're gonna be totally blown away by
and like said one of those super special
ones outside of things like GPU dimbo
s-- GPU didn't post tweakers paradise rd
ram profiles and CP level up options is
gonna be that secure race so we're
already friggin elected and also JJ you
said there's gonna be one more board
coming up for the RG serious what's that
is that coming out like a month or so
like yeah there's gonna be a slight
delay in terms of that it won't be out
immediate
launched so for a lot of you guys that
have always been interested in the
formula board it's kind of being that
the ultimate gaming motherboard that's
really focused at giving you that super
high-end audio integration great not
work networking technologies built in
we're doing something super special with
the formula so you know make sure to
keep it locked here to take it tomorrow
you guys will get the probably
opportunity to see it before too many
other people and we're really excited
about bringing that but it'll be about
coming about a month after the launch ok
all right on so that's it folks really
exciting stuff coming up from a Zeus and
the ROG family as you guys can see
stayed through the channel cuz we got
lots of videos and it looks like the dog
wants to be in the video so he's hopping
up and making his appearance but I'm
Eric hope you guys appreciate JJ being
here make sure you guys hit that like
button let JJ know you appreciate him
and we'll see you guys back here on
Tycho tomorrow for more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
