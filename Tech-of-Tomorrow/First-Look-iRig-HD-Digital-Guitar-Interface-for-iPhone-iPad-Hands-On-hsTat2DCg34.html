I came multimedia to take a look at the
new iRig HD with star Ackerman one of
their great people over there so she's
going to tell us a little bit about this
great product which you can take
anywhere and record your music so start
what's going on with this new iRig HD
well I rigged a CD it was unofficially
shown at CES last week and we won a
busting show for it even though we
officially announced it at NAMM iron HT
goes above and beyond with 24-bit analog
to digital converter version right
within the unit to keep it really low
noise and recording pristine audio
that's what you're trying to get when
you're trying to record so it doesn't
all of the kind of lots of digital
person inside and also connect via
lightning adapter via 30 min and you can
use it also with your back you can also
plug it right into your phone as well
right that's what's the thing that's
gonna hit the market it should be in the
range of $99 and hopefully should be out
on the market within the next one to two
months and it'll work with like any type
of apps that are out there GarageBand
and if your life like a multimedia it is
it is an audio interface so it is gonna
work with any kind of audio app that
accepts an audio and you know input but
we'd like you to use it with it you know
our our apps we have 59 different apps
we are the leading provider of music
creation apps and accessories in the
market
iRig of course was our claim to fame and
amplitude is the app if you're glad to
play guitar has there been any like big
name artists that you've seen so far
who've like looked at this thing and was
like well because I was just talking to
Michael Wilton the Queen's right and he
was saying that he's really looking for
products like this type of nature to
take on the road so if you guys talked
any like big-name guys are like right
wow I want to use this right now
actually we've had men
many artists that endorsed us really for
these products for I Reagan is the early
years of from yet though 311 was on it
Dave Matthews Band was on it they've
done interviews for me for like four new
year for news and stuff so we have a lot
of very high no I was just making fun of
Josh that he looks like they've Matthews
to the camera lens that's what he does
and folks of you guys when you guys are
watching it it'll be Josh from TLD today

the demo today so thanks very much for
