to the channel I'm Eric your host what
are we doing today well today we're
going to compare two phones against each
other
Apple's latest iPhone 7 and the Google
pixel now the Google pixel a lot of
people say it's pretty much their
favorite phone other than the price
everyone seems de hey the price on it
and the iPhone 7 people seem to be
accepting a little bit more but with
that said let's see who is actually the
more powerful phone at the end of the
day let's jump into it for those of you
folks who aren't following phones let's
talk real quick about some of the specs
powering the iPhone 7 is the a10 fusion
chip with 64-bit architecture but it
also has an embedded m10 motion
coprocessor the iPhone 7 also has a 4.7
inch screen the resolution is 1334 by
750 with 326 pixels per inch the iPhone
7 also has 2 gigabytes of internal RAM
and the unit that we're using has 128
gigabytes of internal storage now let's
talk a little bit about the pixel
powering the pixel is a quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor which
consists of 4 different processors two
of them running at 2.15 gigahertz and 2
running at 1.6 gigahertz full 64-bit
architecture the pixel has a 5 inch full
HD AMOLED screen it's at 441 pixels per
inch and a resolution of 1920 by 1080
the pixel also has 4 gigabytes of
internal RAM on 128 gigabytes of
internal storage just like the iPhone 7
with that said though let's jump in and
let's see who's faster first up we have
Geekbench and you guys can see in this
score the a10 is obviously kicking some
butt on that Snapdragon 820 one next up
is speed test and I have to admit I was
kind of shocked to see the pixel getting
beat so badly by the iPhone 7 in this
particular test you think just going
online and doing that type of stuff that
would be exactly the same but you guys
can see that once again the a10
processor and the iPhone 7 is beating
the pixel okay so now let's do some
real-world testing what you basically do
in your day which is the same as I do
and everybody else we open up a bunch of
apps we check our email
we do all that different type of stuff
now we opened up 16 different apps
opening and closing them and the very
beginning of our testing you can see
there is nothing open the background at
all but by the end there are many things
running in the background and the very
end of the testing you guys can see that
once again the a10 proves to be faster
than the Snapdragon
okay so like it or hate it you guys can
see that the iPhone 7 is really kicking
ass as far as sheer power goes that a-10
processor really seems to do the job
across the board now I would have done
even more testing but last time a lot of
people got mad and said it was really
unfair to test the screen I had a bigger
size in video testing so we left out the
3d stuff but you guys can see in all the
other tests
opening up apps pretty much everything
across the board the a-10 is kicking ass
so like it or hate it
the Apple iPhone 7 is definitely
probably if not the fastest and most
powerful smartphone in the world I don't
know I haven't seen anything yet that is
actually kicking its ass have you guys
always want to see your comments down
below and like usual down below like
button will have more information so you
can check out more stuff for yourself
I'm Newark you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow stay tuned we have a great $4
system bill coming up and I think you're
going to like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
