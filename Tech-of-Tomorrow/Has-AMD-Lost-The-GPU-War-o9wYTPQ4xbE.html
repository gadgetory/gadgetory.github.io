because pretty much the facts are the
facts and with the release of the GTX
1660 cards from video at such a low
price now it seems that Nvidia
definitely has ruled the entire market
all the way from entry-level all the way
to the top of the line now I want to get
something out of the way or that keeps
happening all the time we make a video
every time I make a video you guys got
all mad if I say thing about Andy it's a
company it's business
it's facts that's all I stick to there's
nothing personal here like I'm not going
oh my god there's a person in video who
has blue hair and I don't really like
them because I don't like blue haired
people they just they scare me it's not
like that I stick to the facts and the
facts at this point are is that even
though AMD may have the console market
there's not a lot of money in the
console market for AMD if there was that
much money in the market you don't think
that Nvidia would be over there they
don't even care about that market it
really does not matter they're focusing
on high-end and gaming and that's what
they're doing and now at this point it
seems to me like AMD has seriously lost
the GPU battle I mean there is no doubt
in my mind now across the board that
they are definitely the underdog all the
way they're not even beating in the low
price thing now so if we basically I
think if like tomorrow went out and I
took my money and I bought exact priced
cards now we're talking about the exact
pretty much dollar cards maybe you know
a few dollars between 5 and 10 which I
think that's no big deal I think that we
would see that performance dollar to
dollar across the board for your money
that Nvidia is going to be beating AMD
at this point there's just nothing that
they have on the market that competes
that's just it
so before everybody always flocked to
AMD because they had the lower prices
but really now at this state with Nvidia
planning actually lowering some of the
price than their other cards you're
going to see a lot of changes in the
market because now AMD is not going to
be able to lead in any front
they're not gonna be the low price
leader they're not gonna be the
performance leader they're just going to
plainly be second and that's just how
it's going to be and that's a crazy
thing and you might think that's like
how I wanted it's not how I want it
because it leads us in a very vulnerable
position with those guys at Nvidia
that's just it if Nvidia doesn't have
any competition coming what do you think
is gonna happen
you think the car prizes at $12.99 and
39:9 are bad just imagine if they push
things so bad that basically buying an
AMD card is gonna be pretty much like
going to a steakhouse or getting a Big
Mac at McDonald's and when it becomes
you know that big of a difference in
things it's going to be very hard for
them to compete sure they will probably
have some markets consolo and stuff but
it will really push and be almost out of
the picture now people say intel you
know make em excuse me may come out of
the video car but you guys know as well
as I do that when Intel first jumps into
the market they are not going to just
dump it all crazy they're probably going
to find a car that's right in the middle
of the market that has a good price that
sits right in the middle of everything
that people will buy and it'll go with
then till chips and we're great but I
don't think that we're gonna see
especially right out of the gate we're
not gonna see anything from Intel
bopping out that's just gonna be like oh
my god okay there's this new company who
came you know out of the blue with this
and now has kicked Nvidia out of the
water and I don't really like this I was
really hoping that we'd see this year
better performance cards from AMD night
everybody scream you know they'll be
Navi Oh Rick they'll be Navi ok sure
there probably will be but if you really
are betting your money that nabis gonna
come out and it's gonna smoke everything
that NVIDIA has and it's gonna be at a
better price point I really I really
highly doubt that's what we're going to
see this year I think it'll come out
it's probably gonna be higher than the
Radeon 7 with a little bit better
performance ratio but it's still not
going to be able to touch anything on
the nvidia side of things so AMD now has
a choice that they
do okay as you guys saw with the test
that we just ran against the 590 card
which is pretty much you know the
affordable card I would say on the AMD
side of things if you want you know good
performance you're now seeing this
brand-new GTX 1660 come out it's 20
dollars cheaper $30.00 cases and you
know even more sometimes another case
depending on the models that you get
there's actually you know like a $20 at
least price difference between those two
cards and it's really not beating that
card whatsoever now the card that I had
was pretty much an entry-level card it
was slightly overclocked it wasn't
anything you know radical crazy I'm sure
we're gonna see crazy cards from ZOTAC
and all these companies coming out with
all these aftermarket crazy fans that'll
overclock even higher and that's even
more gonna put a squeeze so amd's really
only battle there are only battles
strategy might I add is pretty much this
lower prices just lower the prices and
lower the prices and lower the prices
because that's really going to be their
only defense I mean if you don't have
you know a strong enough weapon you're
gonna have to get in a defensive
position if you can't be you know the
attacker you're gonna be the guy who's
getting attacked and their only real
strategy now will be to lower their
prices to compete with NVIDIA because at
this point right now Nvidia is
dominating the market as far as now
they're doing it price-wise and
performance wise because if you compare
cards at the exact same price level and
I've said this a million times I feel
like I'm just beating a dead horse out
there and I don't understand why people
don't get this you know when you go out
and you have $200 you're gonna buy
something you want to get the absolute
best for your $200 you're not gonna want
to go to the store and go oh you know
what oh wow you know a couple years ago
I think someone so company did this and
I don't really like that or someone's
gonna be into that and you're just gonna
go ahead and you're gonna buy yourself a
substandard card for the money you're
not gonna do it you're gonna buy what's
absolutely best for your money at the
end of the day the dollar dictates the
market and that's just how it is and if
AMD can't compete dollar to dollar wise
then guess what they're pretty much over
with which means that AMD has really
lost the
pee-yew or how things will be on the CPU
side of things I don't know we'll see us
29:19 unfolds but right now in the state
of things in the current AMD has lost
the GPU battle they have nothing to
compete with NVIDIA at all either price
wise or performance wise and I'll say
this again just to be clear I think this
sucks
I don't like it I'm not in favor of it I
wish AMD was doing better because it
would force nvidia to lower their prices
and be more competitive all this does is
give nvidia a free rein to charge
whatever they want on every card they
want because if nobody compete hey if
nobody can compete they can charge what
they want and guess what we'll end up
buying it so thanks for watching it like
usual I want to hear your comments down
below please don't give me you crazy AMD
you know psycho fanboy comments those
are just nuts stick to the facts stick
to reality stick to things that actually
really matter I mean come on we're in
adult world you don't have to be a
psychotic person sitting behind a
keyboard and lead crazy comments I'm
always open to hear anybody who has
something intelligent to say I don't
claim I'm the smartest and most genius
guy in the planet I have my own opinions
and I share those with you guys and a
lot of times you guys seem to have your
opinions aligned with mine sometimes you
don't so let me know what you think I'd
love to hear your comments we'll see you
guys back in the channel for more tech I
hear on tech of tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
