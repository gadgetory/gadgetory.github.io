now before I start today's video I want
to give a couple of shout outs the first
two Steve McGarry from hack toy crypto
he's another fellow youtuber his site
specializes in things surrounding crypto
currency and all that stuff so if you're
into that type of thing you guys may
want to check out his channel and I'll
have a link down below if you guys want
to do so the second it's the people at
gamers Nexus thank you guys so much for
the awesome t-shirt you sent me and they
actually sent me some other really cool
product which I'll be bringing a review
to the table for you guys really soon
now with that said it seems like there
was a lot of confusion with the previous
video wide said in the video that that
is possible that Nvidia is being looked
at by the FTC and by the EU Commission
and also that I would contact people at
Nvidia to discuss this well before I go
any further I just want to say this the
only difference between war and business
are the tools being used because both
really have the same goal in war you
create weapons to destroy people
populace and the infrastructure and in
business you're pretty much doing the
same thing only you're not killing
people you're killing the business off
and they do that with whatever means are
necessary and that's just the corporate
world because at the end of the day the
results are the same it's not people
they're essentially killing but they're
trying to kill off other businesses and
their competition now few things I want
to clarify before I even was able to
contact Nvidia I actually started
getting a couple of texts from one of my
contacts over there and I'm not gonna
mention their name because as a person
who I've loved invited as a friend for
many years but it was very disappointing
now the first thing I was told is that
Nvidia does not respond to rumors at all
okay I want to say straight up I've
never tried to spread a rumor I read
things online I take that information
and I try to present it to you guys in
the best way that you can digest it also
one thing was pointed out to me is why
am I not referencing where the original
story came from so let's clarify that
right up to
that the original story came from Kyle
Bennett at hard OCP and he fully admits
right in clarification that he was asked
by AMD to go ahead and publish this
information but what I'm also being told
it is that Kyle was paid a lot of money
to do this and Kyle please for watching
this video
don't take offense I'm not accusing you
and in fact if you got a paycheck for
releasing information hey man I salute
you because I'm not getting any money
off this on getting his harassment so
hey hats off to you brother and I have
to say Kyle that I saw you last time and
we met in Texas I thought you were a
gentleman and I actually enjoyed your
company for the first time really ever
in history because I no mean you have
had our odds but you were a really nice
guy and hopefully our futures we can
just be you know ourselves but get along
I like that better
now the FTC is not currently
investigating Nvidia they've had a file
complained about them and excuse me yet
a complaint filed against them excuse me
and the complaint itself is actually
what's being kind of looked into they're
not looking into Nvidia at this time
point whatsoever and in my last video I
never said this was fact so I don't know
why people are you know sending me nasty
messages and all this stuff like I said
we get our news from the news out in the
world and on the internet and wherever
else we can get it and I'm only taking
the news like I said that I read and
bringing it to you now here is my honest
personal take on what's going on oh let
me clarify a couple of points - real
quick so the word gaming I was wrong
when I said that I take that back I was
wrong
AMD can use the word gaming but here's
what's pretty much going on and this has
already happened so in essence this is
past tense names like Strix rog and
other manufacturers who have certain
names those names will only be applied
to the nvidia brand you guys have
already seen that a Zeus has come up
with a new name like eros for AMD cards
and the things and the same thing is
going to happen over with the other
companies with MSI and gigabyte Doug can
make AMD cards but they cannot share the
same nomenclature as nvidia cards now in
some ways I understand
videos position on this because hey they
want all the well-known names to be
going to them but in essence that just I
don't know to me it just strikes me as
not really being totally fair because
everybody knows the name Strix
everybody knows the name raagh everybody
knows the name when force everybody
knows all the main names that go with
these cards which draw people and to buy
them so pretty much AMD and these
companies being forced to change all
their names to something new is a little
bit weird because let's just face it you
don't know what these cards are now what
I've heard though is that all the same
specs same stuff will be going into
these cards so as far as you know you
buying an AMD card that's gonna have
subpar performance excuse me
subpar cooling or whatever will probably
not be happening so the same coolers
that you see on a Strix or raagh these
same type of components will probably go
into the other series of cards the only
thing is that people are just not aware
of these names they're not a household
name like Strix and rod those names are
very very well-known so people like when
they go to look for card like oh my god
yeah I've heard of great things about
Strix cards I've heard great things
about rog cards raagh cards but what the
heck said you know this other name and
that's where it just gets a little weird
now here's the main thing about this
entire thing that blows me away
I've been supporting NVIDIA forever
pretty much since the day their doors
have opened
I've been there reviewing their products
I've always reviewed their products
fairly and in the past whenever they've
had a product or something they've
reached out to me and said hey Elric
would you like to go ahead and promote
this and i've always said yes now this
GPP thing I'm being having a door pretty
much slammed in my face and tell me I'm
spreading rumors and I need to quote the
source now my thought is this anything
that's good in this world people want to
shout from the rooftops and say hey look
this is absolutely great stuff
why isn't Nvidia doing the same thing
with the GeForce Partner Program I mean
there's all this hush-hush there's all
these closed doors if it was such an
open subject and there was really
nothing bad going
why wouldn't nvidia be shining this to
the rooftops meeting with all of us
different reviewers and setting the
record straight so that we all know
exactly what the heck is going on as it
is now all of us are pretty much forced
to go on speculation and rumor because
that's really all that that we're
getting
when nvidia could simply clarify for
every single one of us what's going on
but they don't want to do this and
that's the part to me that it's very
confusing because it was something good
something solid something wholesome you
would think they would want all of us
reviewers to spread the word GPP is
awesome and you need to get into it but
that's not what is happening whatsoever
I was honestly quite shocked get it to
get a text message from my contact
really was shocking first of all I'm not
a millennial you don't need to text me
if you have something you want to say to
me call me on the phone and show me the
respect and talk to me on the phone
about it I could literally take all
those text messages and I could present
them in this video and show them because
there's no legal boundaries about text
messages in emails emails you say hey
this is a private and confidential with
a text message it's open game so if
you're watching this you know I'm not
doing that I'm not quoting your name I'm
not putting the text messages out there
but I was really really unhappy that you
couldn't pick up the phone after our
years and years of friendship and just
do the decent thing and talk to me I
know how to keep my mouth shut
if I was told something in confidence I
would keep my mouth shut but that never
ever happened and my integrity is very
important to me I have never taken a
dime from anybody in the industry ever
to go ahead and say things about this
company positive negative otherwise I've
never ever done this years ago I read a
book it's called the man in the mirror
you might want to check it out if you're
having any kind of personality quirks
cuz it'll really get you straight the
bottom line is this when I go and I look
myself in the mirror I want to see a
person who I'm proud of a person that
who I love and that I can respect and if
I did shady ass things like that I would
never be able to do
that and over the last few years I've
made dramatic changes to my life I've
suffered from anger my whole life I'm
actually gonna make a video to explain
some that stuff to you guys as well and
it took me many years to get to the
point where I could accept that hey I
really had a problem and needed to work
through it and I finally did I'm a
totally different person now everybody
around me who knows me has complimented
in fact one of my good friends and I can
say his name it's no problem
his name is also Brian and he lives in
Texas and even told me I worked for
years I really didn't like you and when
he first said that to me I just really
about broke down I choked up and I was
like wow you know but he said now I can
tell you're a really nice person and
honestly Brian I thank you for that from
my heart it meant a really a lot to me
I've struggled with maintaining my anger
if you guys have followed the channel
you know a long time ago I got angry at
people making comments and I lashed out
and I was totally wrong than that I
apologize to everybody it seems like
it's all in the past now but it took me
a while to get to this point I will
never do anything shady for the sake of
a dollar bill ever I would rather starve
not be able to pay my bills than to take
money for something that's untrue and
NVIDIA I've never tried to spread a
rumor about you we've been working
together for 30 years
when in that time period have I ever
come out and basically blasted you guys
for anything even when the rest of the
world is blasting you guys for all kinds
of stuff saying you're doing this and ER
that I always pretty much kept that to
myself the only reason I even mentored
the g-force partner program is just did
not really sit well with me you know I
understand it's a very competitive world
intell's now getting ready to release
their own video card so the markets
going to change so maybe there's a lot
of worry right there but I've never
tried to kick you guys in the balls or
the teeth ever and you know that so
please if anybody in videos watching
this if you ever want to talk to me
please pick up the phone and call me you
guys know my number it's been the same
for like the last 40 years it's never
change so it's very easy to get a hold
of me so before I wrap this up just to
clarify the source
his Kyle Bennett apparently he was paid
but if it's the truth does it really
matter if you're paid or not if you're
paid to tell the truth like I said man
hey I salute you Kyle that's frickin
amazing to get paid for telling the
truth second thing is as of currently
right now there is no FTC or EU
commission investigation going on what's
going on now is they're just taking a
look at the complaint and seeing if
there's any valid reason to up the ante
that's where things are at as far as the
g-force partner program goes I think and
videos should show transparency and let
everybody know exactly what's going on
because that would clear the air and the
fact that they're not doing that at all
is the thing that I find most
troublesome of all so peace out
everybody out there I just want to
clarify these things thanks for watching
techy tomorrow I'm still kind of getting
over this pneumonia thing but we've got
a lot more videos in the queue that have
nothing to do with rumors or business
stuff it's strictly going to be back to
the hardware thing but some news I just
feel is worth sharing with you folks so
we'll see you guys back here on techy
tomorrow for more video magic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
