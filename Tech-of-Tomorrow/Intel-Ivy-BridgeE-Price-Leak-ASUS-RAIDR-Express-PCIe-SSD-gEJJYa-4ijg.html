this product is the new EP 02 headphones
the people over at alien vibes let's
jump in and take a closer look now these
things are coming to market between 149
150 nine dollars but we're going to have
a surprise for you at the end of the
video now here's the box on the front
you can see the white that's the pair
that we're actually going to be doing
today but on the side here you can see
that these come in a plethora of
different colors so whatever choice you
want they've got a color to match for
the box pretty much the same as the
other side of the box only this time it
shows the black headphones which we
actually have for you as well we'll flip
it around on the side you can see it
says sounds of the universe so I guess
and you plug them in you're going to
hear things coming from the planet Mars
well we'll find out I guess so with that
said let's go ahead and do the unboxing
part of it so i'll go ahead i actually
did bring my old trusty knife today so
we shall go ahead and use that go ahead
and take it here make a little incision
go ahead and just tear all this plastic
off here and I don't like goodness no
probably be you know you're like usually
box through the boxes in a box i know
you guys had you've been missing it so
there you go i didn't go anywhere so
let's slide the top off a box within a
box within a box with their marks
alright so we done with that flip the
top right here coupling kaboom so inside
we see there's a nice little box it's
nice and smooth on the outside and
durable here are the accessories so go
ahead and just pick the box and move out
of the way box is pretty tough too so i
don't know if that matters but i'll go
ahead and pop these open will see the
accessories inside alright folks so
here's the accessory box go ahead and
pop the top we can see everything inside
here is all nice and gold plated so we
have the H n CH 2 3.5 millimeter adapter
there next up we have the gold plated
airliner adapter a couple of batteries
now these batteries actually have to do
with the noise cancellation of the
headphones will get into that then we
have two more cables right here all gold
plated this one right here does not have
any type of volume control this is a
straight plug and then on this one right
here we have the one that has the volume
control and everything else all on it
right there you guys can see all that
nice and very well made we also have
inside of here the user's manual
and a nice soft cloth for cleaning
everything and keeping it nice and
beautiful so that's all the accessories
go ahead and take that and just set it
out of the way then we'll go up to the
headphones got the headphones in the box
here I'll go ahead make a super sound
here let's get the microphone up here
let me zip it so you guys get that nice
sound effect real sound effects not even
fake ones from Hollywood this time
they're the real sounds the real sounds
of unboxing alright so here we go
ba-boom inside the box we see these
things all fold up they have a
40-millimeter drivers inside of them now
talking to our writer kevin about this
he tells me that these are very very
comfortable headphones so that means
that you should be able to put them on
your head and wear them for a long time
so let's take a look inside yeah it's
can see the nice soft padding 40
millimeter cones are back behind their
driving this you can see there's comfort
and pads all the way around as well as
adjustment so you have full-on
adjustment levels then the plugs i'll be
showed earlier we'll just go ahead and
plug right into here you can see that
little thing right here and you just go
ahead and just plug that in and then
plug into your music source and away you
go now i'm gonna go ahead and put these
things on my head right now pull them
all the glasses off and surprisingly i
can't hear a damn thing so and i don't
know the batteries in here so even
without the batteries we're on the
outside it's pretty loud with cars
driving around i honestly can't hear a
damn thing nothing so even without the
batteries they do pretty good noise
cancellation and they're also very
comfortable it doesn't really feel like
i'm wearing them on my head at all and i
don't seem like the fall off very well
so they probably be good for like
jogging listening to music we're
exercising or just you know casual
listening they're not really geared for
gaming since there's no microphone on
them but just for listening to music and
travel and portability they should be
pretty good so that was my first look at
the white edition now we actually have a
full written review of the black edition

attached to it so if you guys would like
