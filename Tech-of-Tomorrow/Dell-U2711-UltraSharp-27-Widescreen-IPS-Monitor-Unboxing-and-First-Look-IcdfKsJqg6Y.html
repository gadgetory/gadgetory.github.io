it's a durable box I'm going to take my
trusty knife the camera is going to zoom
in this is the punisher knife you guys
always ask me where you can buy this
knife you can buy it at em wave wwm wave
calm and know I'm not getting any money
for sponsoring them but you guys always
ask where I buy the damn thing so there
you go it's the punisher knife and it's
pretty cool so i'm going to click it
open and we're going to bring it down
here make my first incision right here
and you guys should head home take up
just you know nicely do couple slices
here sometimes I get I get crazy and I
cut the table today I won't I'll just
move it away we're gonna pop the flap
now picture this as a giant monster
you're scared of clowns and a big clowns
popping out rock no I'm just
kidding haha so here we go it's an open
box down so I'm still following up and
cable is that what you guys can see the
way it comes we'll get to that stuff so
for right now I'm going to set the Box
down I'm going to show you guys on the
table right here where Mr Cameron's
going to focus and I'm going to just sit
down casually and do some hoping to
preamble start bringing out all the
accessories so so hi Here I am posing
like I'm a poser to sex magazines
showing you the unboxing of my sexy legs
yeah first off right here we've got the
driver CD I'm gonna take this little
driver CD and I'm going to toss it off
in the back you've got the power cable
I'm gonna even remove it from the bag
and I'm gonna toss the bag at you here's
the power cable no need for that now
off the side it goes ah here we go
something interesting
this thing has USB ports inside of it to
power here is the USB cable one for the
monitor one for your system Yatta Yatta
go ahead take that put it back here as
well
here is the DVI cable we shall rip and
tear it from the bag DVI cable and once
again we're close to the camera man I
barely missed it that's not going down
Hamlin's getting hit with some
there we go perfect you guys saw that
yeah score some points for me ding all
right I'm excited about this
alright here we go here is the lovely
HDMI cable HDMI cable so those are the
accessories now let's actually check out
the monitor itself and what would any
video be without buddy the mascot right
here decided you hop up here if you put
a video so hi folks
alright folks so now we're going to
actually take the monitor out the box
got one styrofoam thing here which we're
going to toss the Chairman and then we
get to the meat of the matter the
monitor now I think this is kind of
cheesy the standard VGA cable which
basically you know nobody in their
freakin right mind is going to use
unless they're building a server or
something
is going to use is actually connected
come on Dell the are you thinking
get rid of this vga cable thing man but
that is the accessory put it a swipe or
cable in here bros what is up
alright anyways we're to pull this bad
boy out yeah out of the box
oh I must have missed this here's
instruction guide instruction guide
there's also some warranty information
in there as well forget rid of that
here's the giant size box
we shall toss it and camera motion kill
special effects Cameron up you go let's
toss the giant box across the room ready
follow the box cameraman think I broke
McGee's anyways here's the monitor now
we'll start to take it out of its
package bah boom like I said this VV
this little cable right here up okay so
I will write the back remove this on a
central VGA cable that does the folks
will
so graciously connected here for no
perhaps of apparent reason let's get
that out of there come on little cable
you can do it you can be removed yes
okay so VGA cable nine meter cable out
of my frickin way okay let's take the
bottom completely off the stand now
since it's got the protective cover on
it I'm with the cam into real himself
we're going to come over here we're
going to take a look at some of the
features so now let's take a look at the
connectivity of Adel you 2711 starting
right here we have the standard power
plug next to that we have the speaker
power then we have speaker pass-through
the display port two different DVI
connections the VGA connection which you
saw me remove HDMI old-school RGB for
those artists and stuff you want the
purest of color they're gonna probably
be using this some old-school people use
that the connection that goes to your
computer and your USB ports that are
onboard for the monitor so these are all
the connectivities you can actually
switch between all of these on the on
screen display which means you could
actually hook up one two three four five
six different computers theoretically to
this monitor so let's set the camera
mover let's take a look at the bottom
and stand so here we show the base and
the stand I thought this be kind of an
interesting angle so you guys can see
how it turns and this is the standard
pretty high quality it's adjustable
completely as well now let's go ahead
and let's slip the monitor up set it up
let's talk about some more of the
connectors on the monitor here on the
side of monitor you can see we have two
more USB ports as well as a card reader
now the card will come in really handy
especially we transfer a lot of data off
your camera and stuff like that this
little port can be very advantageous so
let me flip it around the front now so
you guys can see it let's go ahead and
remove this front panel cup cover and
here is the monitor and all of its glory
this things come in to market for about
nine hundred dollars you can find it
online anywhere though from five hundred
and sixty dollars used all the way to
over a thousand dollars depending
on which dealer if you buy it through
Amazon you can see on our link below you
can actually get free shipping on this
through your Prime so hey guys I hope
everybody out there like this is pretty
much our first look unboxing video of
vidal you 2711 27 inch IPS monitor will
do a full in-depth review you guys
remember the HP monitor that we had
bought previously well actually the
thing took a total and after four
months just stopped working everything
else but I'm gonna do another video
because actually those people were
really cool and they are made it so
we'll be doing a head-to-head video
between this monitor and the HP which a
lot of people have apps to see so we'll
see you guys back here in TECO tomorrow
