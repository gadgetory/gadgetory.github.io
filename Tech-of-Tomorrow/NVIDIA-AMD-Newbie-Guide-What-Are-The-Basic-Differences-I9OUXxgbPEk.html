once again to TECA tomorrow now if
you're a new buyer and you're really a
first time person going out to make a
decision on buying your video card you
probably have a lot of questions and
probably the biggest question that's on
your mind is should I buy Invidia or
should I buy
AMD so I'm gonna tell you guys in this
video I'm gonna break it down to you
really what the difference is between
buying an nvidia card and buying an AMD
card so we'll start off with AMD first
so AMD has always been known throughout
history to be the price leader all their
stuff is always going to be lower priced
then it's Nvidia counterpart I mean nine
times out of ten this is always the case
even with AMD's products with their
motherboards and CPUs you're not gonna
see them being really more expensive
than their Intel counterpart or Nvidia
in most cases now there are some you
know sometimes there's a change the rule
and NVIDIA had something that's less
priced and an AMD all the more expensive
product but generally AMD will be the
price leader and being that AMD is the
price leader let's just face it there
are more people in the world that are
either I don't know middle class or poor
then there are richer people or
upper-class people so if people can't
afford the higher priced intel or higher
priced nvidia products they're going to
always flock to AMD and since there are
a lot more people out there and vidya
has a lot of true supporters so team AMD
has a great bunch of people that all
support them and do that you know their
team AMD and they're there and they're
big with their fans because of these
things now some of the shortcoming is
with buying AMD are this though whatever
you get from them nine times out of ten
is going to be slower than its nvidia
counterpart usually at the exact same
price point in most the times you're
gonna see that the nvidia card will
actually outperform b and b card now
there are gonna be a lot of times where
the IndyCar Wolff like I said be cheaper
but many times Nvidia is going to have
the faster card also AMD kind of is a
little bit wacky sometimes with their
driver releases for games they don't
have as many game
companies they don't work hand-in-hand
with as many game companies as Nvidia if
you notice when you play a game most of
the games out there say meant to be
played with Nvidia and that's because
Nvidia works really closely with these
companies well obviously to get their
name on that and you do see am be much
less inside of a game being hey this
games for AMD then you do from Nvidia
now there's free sync and gsync now free
sync is AMD solution they don't charge
any money for this and a lot of monitors
actually support this and what this does
is this eliminates all the screen
tearing and stuff on your monitors so
when you're playing a game you won't
getting that screen tearing any of that
ripping it just makes your games play
the absolute best and a lot of people on
the indie side are much more preferable
of that because if you get a g-sync
monitor from Nvidia you're going to be
paying a little bit more money it's just
the way there's things alright now I
don't know why and NVIDIA should
honestly change this particular aspect
of their thing I mean really they should
because if they add more jisuk monitors
at better prices it will be a much
easier thing all around from vidya and
they get a lot more people going hey I
love Jesus but who wants to pay extra
money if AMD is giving that technology
away for free now on the Nvidia side of
things support is absolutely great most
of the time okay most the time early is
they have the latest drivers always for
the games because like I said just a
second ago they work hand in hand with
these companies so they usually have the
absolute best drivers for games
especially right around launch time so
when you get launch time and everything
and you want to get best you know gaming
driver usually Nvidia's gonna have it
and BB right being behind now a thing
that floats around a lot though is that
people say that Nvidia
giimpse their older cards to make their
cards not run you know as fast as newer
stuff now I don't really think that
Nvidia really does that on purpose
because their cards sell so well anyways
there's always a market and look we're
in the market with it right now the
market were in at this particular time
video cards you came and get because
everybody's buying them up so you know
that's probably not true at all but when
new drivers come up what I think happens
is they just don't really worry about
older cards you understand I'm saying so
like the guys in there coating away he's
doing any stuff
he's like oh all this code right here
this is for the 970 or for the
blah blah blah and he's like well um do
we need to bulk up with this code now
probably not let's just let's uh slim
that stuff down and that's probably what
happens more than likely is probably the
new coder guys doing all this stuff
don't have the best support for the
older games and I mean I can understand
that but then again you can always have
an older driver to play your games you
can switch between them it's not it's
kind of a little weird but it's not that
hard to do so I hope out there that are
new this has really kind of helped you
you know Nvidia products always have
been for the longest time the highest
priced video cards that they have you
know that they have out there and that's
because they usually always like I said
have the premium absolute best
performance so if your concern are the
best drivers best supported card all the
way around gonna be able to play every
game pretty much without any hassle
whatsoever and they're usually more
available let's just face it there's
more available then you probably want to
look oh and the last thing you don't
care about price if you don't care about
price and you just want the absolute
best stuff then yeah an Nvidia card
might be really good for you also as a
couple of things I want to mention as
well AMD has their firegl cards those
were actually geared more for the
professional market and NVIDIA has their
Quattro cards but a lot of times people
have been known to flash their standard
cards into quadrille cards I don't
really know that a and B cards are so
successful going from their standard
cards into a pro-level card now with
anything that has to do with direct
compute the AMD card is going to work a
lot better everything for direct compute
right now AMD is just faster at direct
compute that's just how it is but for
other professional things like doing
auto cad and all that kind of stuff if
you're not only going to be doing gaming
then the Nvidia card will do that stuff
a little bit better than less like I
said it's direct compute so at the end
of the day if you're a brand-new guy and
you're going out there to buy a video
card you just really gotta ask yourself
what you really want what's most
important to you if absolute performance
is the best and that's what you care for
and you're not really too worried about
money then yeah most of the time you're
gonna probably be going to go and get in
the NVIDIA car because it's nine times
10 going to be faster now if money's a
key issue D you don't have a lot of
money than hey you don't really have a
choice because you can't just pull money
out of your butt and have it to buy
video cards so in that case you probably
would be more likely to be on the AMD
side of things and AMD has some crazy
fans man like honestly some of the AMD
fans are like those football hooligans
that you see in London they will
absolutely kick your butt if you say
anything crazy about AMD they don't like
they'll come and get you man so just
things to think about so I'm Eric you
guys been watching tikka tomorrow hope
that answers some of your questions if
you new into the PC arena for you folks
out there I know that maybe you just
watch the video but you guys who've been
out there a while you know all these
standard things that are going on with
with with the market so and you know
what you like and why you like it but
for people who have never actually known
this information before I hope it helps
so peace out we'll see you guys back
here on teka tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
