really fuels industry new tech means new
ideas new discoveries and new
territories to be broken now if you guys
follow the channel you guys know that
previously I installed this really cool
thing called an August smart lock which
was basically smart home one point 0
here at TECA tomorrow but now I have
something that's even totally cooler
than that yeah this thing's really cool
this is called the ring and this thing
offers a lot of different things so
basically welcome to smart home 2 point
0 here on TECA tomorrow
so what is the ring you're asking well
the ring is an HD video two-way audio
communication device that also has a
built-in motion detector and night
vision and the ring also works with any
Android or iPhone device via the
internal Wi-Fi of your home now inside
the box you get the ring unit itself the
user's manual a complete tool kit with
all the necessary mounting hardware for
mounting on various services including
wood concrete and other surfaces you
also get the charge plug and the cable
that plugs into the back your ring to
charge the unit installing the ring
device into your home can be done in one
or two ways you can use either your
existing doorbell or you can use it as a
standalone device ever use this a
standalone device don't worry once you
charge the ring it stays fully charged
for an entire year for my installation I
chose to place the ring right near my
little people on my door for me this was
the optimal installation point
installing the unit onto my door was a
very simple process because first of all
the unit came with the right screws that
I needed also it comes with an internal
leveler so mounting it to your door and
balancing is a very easy thing you can
see right here we just lined it up and
then started putting the different
screws in until the unit was mounted
then I just popped out the leveler and
place the ring device on the mounting
unit a nice simple push down and lastly
at the bottom of the unit there are two
security screws and once you screw these
in they lock the unit in place and
another thing it's really cool if
someone does happen to steal your unit
ring will replace it at absolutely no
charge to you so where do all my movies
go the recorded at my front door will
ring offers cloud storage now you guys
can get a 30 day trial membership and
once that's over they offer a very low
monthly price or a year membership to
record everything that's going on at
your front door so depending on whether
using your iPhone or an Android device
next up after installation of the unit
itself is installing the ring app once
you install the app all you need to do
is simply run the app follow the
installation procedures allowing it to
pair with your Wi-Fi on your phone and
then you'll be up and going and ready to
use the ring device once you get the app
installed the ring offers a bunch of
different setup features for you to
change and go through for yourself
deciding how you
the unit to be set up and working at
your home you can set up things like the
motion detector which can be set up
either by a slide scale or by zone and
it actually looks pretty cool while
you're doing it as well you can also set
up three smart alert notifications for
both the motion detector and the ring
doorbell you can set to light standard
or frequent but the frequent says you
will get more frequent alerts and will
wear your battery down pretty quickly so
using the standard setting is probably
the best once you're done setting up the
reins parameters simply hit the Save
button and away you go once the ring is
installed you now have your own personal
security and voice monitoring system
right at your front door gone are the
days of missing packages now when
someone comes to your door you get an
alert and no matter where you're at in
the world you can answer that person and
respond to them and you also get the
option to accept or deny the phone call
when it comes in well can I help you
package what carrier you will all of
them and if for some reason someone's at
your front door that you suddenly just
don't want to deal with you can just
simply deny their notification
completely ignoring them but don't worry
you still can film them and know what
they're doing anyways and like i said
before folks this is version 2.0 of my
smart home update what's really cool now
is I have my August smart lock you guys
seen that previously now if anybody
comes to my door they can use the ring
device to talk to me so I can talk to
them through my ring device identify who
they are and actually unlock my door for
them allowing them to get into my home
so for me this is actually really really
cool and gone are the days are worrying
about your packages being stole because
day or night the ring will record the
action at your front door even in
complete darkness rink and record
somebody going to your front door and
trying to steal a package so no matter
what you've got security with the ring
now I know there's a question that's
definitely going to come out with people
out there watching this three they're
going to say hey man that thing's on
your front door can anybody just come up
and steal it but actually really can't
once you put them those first two screws
that we showed you on the bottom that
secure the unit you would have to
actually have to remove those screws or
actually physically take something to
hammer the
off I don't think very many people are
going to go I want to go up to your
front door and hammer off your security
device so I think it's more secure than
most people even think plus even if that
if situation that someone does happen to
do that hey ring is going to give you
that device for free so you guys can see
the ring offers something definitely
different than other products you can
mount this directly to your front door
like I did it becomes not only a motion
detector allowing you to be alerted with
anybody coming up to your front door and
it also works the toy communication
vitamin you conduct a family friends
deliveries or anything else right
through the ring device and like I said
before this can be done anywhere
worldwide you could be in Connecticut
you could be in Missouri you could be in
Europe and no matter where you are the
ring device will communicate with you
you can see that person through your
phone communicate with them and make the
necessary communications that you need
to ensure your security and your package
gets delivered to your home like usual
folks all the information for this
product will be down there below that
like button hope you guys like this
product I think it's pretty really neat
and nifty I hope you guys do as well so
that's it I'm Eric you guys are just in
purchasing one of these things and more
information hey check out the
information down below and we'll see you
guys back here on tech of tomorrow for
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
