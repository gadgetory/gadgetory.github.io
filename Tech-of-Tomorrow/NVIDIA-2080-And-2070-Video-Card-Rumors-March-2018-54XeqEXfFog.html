prices at the moment are just out
rageous they are off the hook no one can
really even afford to jump into gaming
right now and so it even seems like
reviews of video cards have slowed down
since their solver over you know
overpriced that people aren't even
buying it now I was actually planning on
doing a review today on another video
carp I kind of thought about it for a
second I was like you know what that's
alright since right now the video cards
just outrageous people might not even
really want to see that kind of got a
little bit of flack on the last one but
a rumor has come out da-da-da-dah that
Nvidia at GTC will possibly have two new
cards coming out you know two new cards
who knows now ampere and tuning are
pretty much what the chip says our
supposedly rumor to be and this rumor
comes from tweek town they said that an
inside confidential source is said now
at GTCC they will be releasing these new
cards and I don't know a couple weird
things about that I now I know that
Nvidia really needs to get cards out
there to compete hardcore in the mining
market cuz let's just face it right now
you guys all know that AMD cards are the
first and most sought-after for mining
and then secondary come the Nvidia cards
now in video cards obviously for gaming
are still the most sought-after so it
would kind of make sense you know for
Nvidia to release new cards now at this
point though honestly doesn't video
really need to release a new video card
I mean seems to me like they just just
try to get the stock up on the cards
that are out there so that the card
prices could drop first before they even
think about dropping some more video
cards onto the market now I admit it
would be a smart move for them to have
cards that were really you know geared
more towards doing the mining as well as
gaming the same as the AMD cards now
some other interesting facts is that
last year AMD actually gained more
market share than ever before like
Nvidia had like 16% of the market and
vidi had 14% of the market and video
lost about 16 excuse me sorry wrong
number there
Nvidia lost about 6
cent of the sales why and vidiian creats
there's by a much more dramatic effect
that an even intel lost about two
percent in their sales but that's not
really in the graphics world that's just
like kind of overall kind of wondering
why the number was there now even if you
know nvidia does drop these cards on the
market okay we'll just say that at GTCC
they dropped these new cards onto market
how is that really going to affect
pricing and if they're going to be
geared towards gaming will that actually
just relieve the burden on the five 80s
five 70s you know and all those
different cards out there will relieve
the burden where those car prices drop
and if so how will that actually affect
the AMD market now will these new cards
that and nvidia is going to release will
they really compete with AMD
neck-to-neck as far as the mining cuz
let's just face it right now best bang
for the buck for mining cards best
paying for the buck from mining cards is
an AMD solution it's not an Nvidia
solution or anybody else now if they can
close that gap hopefully things will
change but I mean we have to take this
with a total grain of salt I mean let's
just face it a guy at this site says he
talked to a secret inside guy I mean
what is it's like corporate espionage
are we doing the Spy vs spy type thing
so how actual truth is in this and how
much actual truth is in it I don't know
but the bottom line is that in the
Nvidia for a long time they haven't
really have not had to make new video
cards they've been ahead for a long time
now your AMD fence are gonna scream it
doesn't always been that way and you're
right hasn't always been that way but
for a long time it's been that Nvidia
has been in the lead and they really
don't have to release cards they just
release cards to remain on top and
that's what they do so obviously and
video will release cards this year
hopefully we're going to see volta where
the heck is Volta we still haven't seen
that but with these two new cards that
are being mentioned that are totally
geared more towards doing mining I
really hope that those cards do come out
I hope that it's not just a rumor and
that it becomes fact and that we see
these cards come out because right now
it's just impossible to get video cards
I have people like I've said my other
videos calling me all the time just
wanting my video card ohayo Elric dude
you know I know you that you probably
have an extra ten atti lying around can
you think you can sell it to me like 400
bucks even though they're going like 13
$49
online and what's crazy just bear with
me one second your cameraman is this
particular card I was gonna bring guys
the floor review on so you guys can tell
me are you guys still understood in
seeing a review of the red devil power
color Vegas 64 if so leave a comment
down below because I kind of skipped
that because it's thought okay this
cards a few months old but I really
wanted to test the one one percent lows
all that stuff give you guys four K
naught stuff so if you would like to see
a review on this let me know here is the
unfortunate total biatch slap in the
face about this card though this card is
freaking fifteen hundred dollars on
Amazon fifteen hundred dollars and you
know no this isn't a quadrille card this
isn't you know any this super duper you
know a super high-end cards this is a
Vegas 64 these things are coming into
the market about five hundred and
something dollars took like a thousand
dollars more that's a total ripoff and
honestly to you vendors out there who
are doing this I'm giving you two birds
in my mind and telling you to kiss my
backside because that's just insane and
you're gouging people I understand
supply and demand but when you raise a
price in a video card where it's almost
300% higher than its face value come on
man
that's worse than scalping tickets to a
Led Zeppelin concert and they're you
know one time in town you know it's just
wrong stuff so at the end of the day I
hope that there are these new CPUs
coming out from Nvidia I hope it changed
the market I hope that people will be
able to afford all those lower end cards
once again because that would be nice
that way people could actually get back
into gaming honestly I've even saw the
console prices literally go up over
night they were selling these things on
a new egg for like 200 bucks you can get
a cool game everything else for 200
bucks these same systems are now $500 so
if you do not think that these video
card prices are affecting other aspects
of the entire gaming industry you would
be wrong because even to get yourself a
console now is going to cost you twice
as much as what it cost you three months
ago and that's just totally ridiculous
bullcrap the markets broken something
needs to happen
Nvidia if you happen to watch this video
hey release some damn cards we need some
new cards we need
fresh blood and we need to get this
mining craze in the past so people can
get their gaming cards and be free to
game without breaking the bank and let
the miners spend all that extra money in
their mining cards and go out there and
do what the heck they're going to do so
hey I'm Alaric thanks very much for
watching the channel I love to hear you
guys it panes and stuff would you guys
love to see mining cards mint from
Nvidia that actually you know did gaming
and mining altogether hopefully more
news will come out soon until then peace
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
