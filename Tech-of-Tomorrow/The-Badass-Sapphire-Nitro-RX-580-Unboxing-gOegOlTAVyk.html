and today we're going to be doing a
video here on tech of tomorrow on the
new GT X 1080 Ti so you know in my
experience with the 1080 t weight
euphony but what this pain we're doing
we're doing it already on all right
funny I mean you're not me boy oh boy oh
boy people these days trying to take
your slot on your channel no please
I'll tell you guys what the first person
down below to tell me who today's guests
are and guess photographer filmer audio
expert and everything else will get a
free digital price here on Tekken
tomorrow from this guy with two thumbs
pointing directly at me but check it out
here's what we're actually doing I'm
going to reach back here hold on let me
show you my back of my head look we're
doing this we're doing a video card here
folks alright Radeon are X 580 sapphire
limited edition so let's see what the
hell is inside of this frickin box let's
go so let's start off with obviously the
box it's square like every other box the
Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon rx 580 limited
edition eight gigabytes you guys all
know that so that's the front of the box
not going to focus too much on that
here's the side of the box here's the
back of the box there's going to be a
lot of product features I'm going to be
doing a full review on this so like
don't get too crazy I'm not going to go
over too much of this stuff it's
obviously got a bunch of stuff that all
has to do with nitro nitro named but you
guys want to see actually what's in the
box so let me first pop aside a cap here
pop here we got box inside of a box box
ception that's always happening it's
never going away now one thing I do
remember having actually seen a sapphire
card in quite a while but sapphire box
is open weirder than other boxes usually
like upside down so I think I went to to
get I got it upside down anyways pop in
the cap obviously anti-static little
foam mat on top and then we've got the
card itself but before we actually look
at the card
as far as accessories go before I get to
the card the accessories on here are
pretty mil so first off let's check out
the accessories package and you guys can
see right here on top this kit comes
with two additional blue LED fans which
is pretty cool because you don't really
get many video cards out there that
actually come with extra fans and so
that's a pretty damn cool addition so
we'll cut the cap off take out these two
fans they're also kind of different than
regular fans in the car which we'll see
in a minute because these fans are
actually kind of clear looking the other
fans are black so you could definitely
change the look of your system
we got the sapphire warranty card a
quick installation guide which I don't
think anybody that watches my channel
needs you guys know your very much
sometimes even better than me it's a
warranty card on there and like I show
you guys the warranty number that would
employ the warranty and then last but
not least the driver disk and so that's
the accessories package now let's
actually check out the card itself
so let's first check out the output
something I usually don't do but hey
let's change stuff up cut DVI d3 display
ports HDMI and it is hdmi 2.0 another
question that people keep asking a lot
down the comment section is does this
card support free sync to and yes all
the new series cards do feature that so
you are luck if you like it so take a
look at the front of the card you guys
can see this card is totally gunmetal
grey so if you're like into guns or that
gun like theme or any kind of like you
know even heavy metal or metal type
stuff you know this card's going to fit
that very well now you can see that
these fans are actually a bit different
like I said from the other fans these
pens are black these pens are clear
reasons also features blue LEDs nice
simple layout design no numbers no
nomenclature nothing at all like that
underneath the card you guys can clearly
see a lot of the aluminum heat fins
either you still dissipate the heat away
from the card a lot of the heat pipes
running throughout the entire card like
all the cards that are made with this
launch even though these guys don't talk
about it everything is direct to copper
so all your capacitors your GPU
everything's being directly connect to
the copper to keep everything running
cool and quiet when you run the card
take a look at the bottom the card you
guys can see once again the heat pipes
permeating them from the bottom down
there we get the PCIe interface a little
plug right there that's the plug that's
also going to the cars and giving them
their power and you guys can clearly see
looking at the end of the card those
aluminum heat fins now taking a look at
the top of the card you guys can once
again see those heat pipes are running
around the car they look pretty badass
don't they kind of like the side of a
motorcycle where in those old cars you
see your old man's back from the 70s and
then over here we have the power
connectors a single six pin single eight
pin 600 watts of the power supply if
they recommend but you can probably get
away with using a low
anyone as long as you do not drain the
system with other parts to much and to
the far left we see the sapphire logo so
now here we've got to pretty much the
favorite part of the card and let's see
it seems like anyways everybody loves an
awesome back plate now you guys can see
there's no little copper piece right
here a lot of the cards that we've taken
looked at had a little copper piece
right here which helped to dissipate the
heat directly away from the card as well
but there are little pins over here that
help keep the heat going away from the
card so instead of the heat getting
trapped between the plate and the card
there are a bunch of openings in here so
that heat can actually just go away and
not make this a big hot mess
so all right Tech fans there you have it
everything that comes inside of the box
of the rx 580 sapphire nitro edition
limited edition just a killer card all
in all you guys want more information I
want to purchase one of these for
yourselves there'll be a link down below
like button which hopefully you will go

come to your house and take you myself
