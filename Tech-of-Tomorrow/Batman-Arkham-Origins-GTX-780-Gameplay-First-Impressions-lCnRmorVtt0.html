of tomorrow we're bringing you guys
coverage and all the biggest holiday
game releases this year and today one of
the first ones to land is batman arkham
origins now some of the fans of the
series were a little worried about this
one because it wasn't developed by
rocksteady the guys that may the first
two games but was instead developed by
WB games montreal who did the remake of
arkham city for the wii u there are also
some people that weren't too happy with
the fact that they changed the voice
actors a bit especially that they're not
using Kevin Conroy who voiced Batman in
the past two games and the original
animated series so it picked up a copy
for ourselves today and while I haven't
had enough time with the D of you guys a
proper full review yet I did want to
give those you that can't wait a good
first day impressions of it so let's sit
back and see if this game lives up to
one of the best comic book hero games
ever made
to begin with visually this game is
really solid during regular gameplay the
city is detailed with a grittier dirtier
feeling than there was in Arkham City
and character movements in combat are
smooth when we plan to bring you guys
some more thorough benchmarks in the
full review what I can tell you for now
is that running on our system which
includes the GTX 780 and an i7 4770k
processor well all the settings set to
their maximums I've been seeing an
average frames per second of about 70
for the music also does a fantastic job
of capturing that Batman feeling and is
very reminiscent of the animated series
now right from the start it's very clear
that while this game was not developed
by rocksteady WB games montreal took a
lot of care to make sure that preserved
the same feeling we got from Arkham sea
while still adding up new things to make
it feel like its own game combat is
still the same momentum based style
requiring quick reflexes and awareness
of enemy positioning having players rely
not just on combos but timing countering
of enemies and using special methods for
dealing with more threatening opponents
like knife and gun wielders I've only
played the game for about three hours
but I've already encountered new enemy
types and noticed nice new changes to
returning mechanics one of the most
obvious new additions is the enhanced
evidence scanner which now not only has
you scan objects for information but
even recreates crime scenes and how they
happened giving players things to
discover by watching how events unfolded
in real time the cityscape is large and
origins and definitely retains the same
open feeling that Arkham City had though
there are a few odd invisible walls
between areas making it awkward to try
and make a straight line trip to your
objective at times this one has also
done an excellent job of utilizing
Batman's gallery of villains as several
have been introduced in a fairly short
amount of time but always at a nice even
pacing and is given each of them a good
bit of spotlight which is one of the
things that made Arkham City a great
game I've had about two boss fights so
far and both have had really solid
design slightly on the simplistic side
gameplay wise but this is to be expected
when it's at the start of the game and
both have been great from a cinematic
point of view now for the most part so
far the game has done a really good job
of retaining arkham city's goodness but
there have been a few hiccups along the
way in the first couple hours there have
been a few interesting bugs which can
and will hopefully be corrected with
some patching but there's also been some
issues with the game's actual design and
not always giving the cleanest
directions on the game's control for
instance sticking you in a hallway that
has you pressing spacebar like a madman
to pull on a cord forgetting to mention
that
back that you hit the crouching button
to disengage it's also a little odd that
while the game does take place in the
actual Gotham City the streets are still
for the most part completely bare and
except for the random thugs like it was
an arkham city though it made sense in
Arkham City since it was a prison
district none of these things is bad
enough to sour the whole experience and
as long as the game continues to smooth
out and provide a solid storyline I see
no reason why this one shouldn't be able
to live up to the expectations of his
predecessor now of course this is only
based on three hours of gameplay in
single-player mode Arkham origins does
mark the first game in the series to add
a multiplayer component as well and
that's something I really want to sink
my teeth into as well as finish the game
before I give you guys my full review
later on now if what you've seen here is
enough to already convince you to want
to give the game a try yourself check
out the link in the description for
pricing and availability and while
