year of going to shows in Vegas and
through all these years I've seen so
many people get sick it's just crazy I
was like nope I've never gotten sick
I've never gotten sick but check this
out as soon as we show it up on Sunday I
got sick as a dog literally it was
almost like we rolled into Vegas we
stopped at smashed burger we ate and as
soon as I got back to the hotel room I
was just like oh my god I couldn't even
make the Nvidia launch because I was
having a launch of my own right out of
my gut because I was literally just
puking everywhere I couldn't even make
the meeting the next day but luckily the
crew did because the people over at
Coursera had some pretty cool stuff that
they announced at the show and so like
today I'm gonna bring you guys the
footage of that and talk a little bit
about these products that they're
bringing so you guys can see them for
yourself so with that said though I
finally did get better as the week went
on the other the show and we got a
little bit more stuff I'm actually a lot
of footage but a little bit more
coverage I'm gonna bring you guys
actually one more video I'm showing you
like all the stuff we saw out on the
floor and stuff but for now let's hop in
and let's see what the people over at
Corsair are bringing to the table in
2019 one of the first things we're gonna
be checking out is coursers new

little familiar it's upgraded from the
m65 mouse but it's now equipped with the
same next-generation 18000 dpi optical
sensor as the iron claw RGB sporting a
durable aluminum frame the m65 RGB
