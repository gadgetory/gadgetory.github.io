alright man today has been one hell of a
day now this launch is going to be
probably one of the biggest of the year
NVIDIA had pretty damn crazy timing with
this instead of waiting till Christmas
time they decide to release this shiz
Nick during the summer time so instead
of getting a tan we will remain all
spotty and white and be indoors fraggin
the hell out of stuff now hope you guys
appreciate all the coverage that we have
done today we've been all day long
banging this stuff out it's so real
appreciate if you guys have hit that
like button and show us that you guys
appreciate the coverage so with that
said let's jump in let's check out the
features what the cards all about and
then how it performs against the
competition in our benchmark comparisons
let's go all right so the GTX 780 size n
at 10.5 inches in length a real laser
tousle 4 inches in height and is based
off a dual slot design now the cooling
it's based off the Titan design and
features a copper vapor chamber dual
slot aluminum heatsink and a blower
style fan which combined offers much
quieter performance now the card
features the same gk110 also found in
the GTX Titan it is 50% more CUDA cores
in the GTX 680 with 2304 compared to the
1536 found on the GTX 680 the GTX 780
also features 3 gigabytes of gddr5
memory through a 384 bit memory
interface compared to the GTX 680 which
has 2 gigabytes of memory and a 256-bit
memory interface now as far as clock
speeds are concerned the 780 has a core
clock of 863 megahertz which dynamically
boosts to 900 megahertz via GPU boost
2.0 the original GPU boost 1.0 was
designed to reach the highest possible
clock speed while remain within a
predefined power target but Nvidia
determined that the GPU temperature is
often a bigger inhibitor of performance
than the GPU power so the boost clock
speeds are based on the GPU temperature
target instead of the GPU power target
in Boost 2.0 the default temperature is
set to 80 Celsius so the GP will
automatically boost to the highest clock
frequency as possible as long as the GPU
temperature remain
at 80 Celsius now because GPU boost 2.0
is based off the temperature target you
can raise the temperature limit to
increase boost speeds or decrease the
target to lower boost speeds and keep
the card running cooler as far as power
requirements go the GTX 780 requires one
eighth pin PCI power connector and one 6
pin PCI power connector which results in
a total TDP of 250 watts one thing to be
noted though is this is more than the
GTX 680 which totaled 195 watts of TDP
and only required two 6-pin power
connectors as far as connectivity goes
on the rear i/o we see two dual link
DVIs one HDMI and one standard
DisplayPort connector now Before we jump
in and see the performance benchmarks
let's talk about something else that's
really important that Nvidia wants you
to know not only when you buy the
senator you buying the card you actually
buy all the other things that NVIDIA has
to offer including their new nvidia
geforce experience now previously they
had a beta version of this out and it
actually got 2.5 million downloads from
around the world but now the actual
real-deal version comes bundled with
your gtx 780 now some of the cool things
is this thing make sure your drivers are
always up to date and installed
automatically and it checks and offers
optimized game settings so you get the
maximum in-game detail why squeezing the
most performance out of your card at the
same time now ok I know many you are
going to gawk when you hear the word
optimize settings are gonna be like yeah
yeah whatever that's some total bullcrap
but you know what do some
experimentation and check it out for
yourself I think you'll be pretty
surprised at how this actually works
because it's pretty cool you know Nvidia
goes in there and with the games that it
actually can do it'll go in there and
actually make them perform better and if
you were missing any extra detail that
you could have been getting and didn't
know about it'll let you know that as
well plus if there's a new patch out or
your drivers out of date all the stuff
will be told to you and you'll be able
to automatically update it all through
the GeForce experience so with that said
it's time to rock out and let's hit
those benchmarks
it's I'm still rocking out and this song
has ended okay well that's all rocks I
like to rock out do it now a lot of you
folks always ask what in the heck is
that song where can I get it well that
song is the human Zoo written by yours
truly and my friend Jonathan Morrison
from TLD so we wrote that song and it's
available for free guys let's do it on
Spotify after just him buying it you
guys can check it out all kinds of
places down there below that like button
which I know you guys are gonna creep
out of we'll have links to all the place
where you guys can buy that song it's
usually like between 79 and 99 cents
beware of where you go though so you
don't get it from some weird pirate
place and if you guys want to go pirates
um which you might do that'll hurt our
feelings but hey you're welcome to do so
we can't stop you as long as you listen
to the music and rockin out we still
love you so like I said in the very
beginning video this video was brought
possible by the people over at a data we
want to thank them very much for their
support now before we close out this
video there's a couple of things I want
to talk about just to totally keep it
real right now if you're an owner and
you have a gtx 680 is there really any
reason for you to upgrade well that
we'll have talked about now if you're
doing 1920 by 1080 p and that's all
you're doing then I would actually say
no if you're using a single monitor and
you're doing that there's really no
reason to upgrade now if you're somebody
who actually wants to do multi monitor
technology or you want to play 2560
resolutions well then hell yeah baby
this card kicks in and it works really
really well at those things now also one
thing to take into consideration between
the 7970 in this well yeah the 7970 is
much cheaper and you guys all know AMD
is just basically giving tons of games
with their card but if you're looking
for the absolute highest end card
there's nothing that can beat the
geforce gtx 780 at this price range
let's just think about this the seventy
nine ninety and both the titan are both
cards that cost $1000 this card is
almost four hundred dollars cheaper than
either one of them and has scores that
are very very competitive
I think Nvidia is gonna have a very very
sales worthy card on their hands and
these things are gonna move off the
shelf plus for better overclocking I'm
sure that
many people are going to want to get a
hold of reference based cards because a
lot of the stuff that comes out for
aftermarket cooling such as liquid
cooling is usually based on the
reference based cards now we know as
OOOs gigabyte others they're going to do
their own aftermarket cooling solutions
and release those cards and we should
see those here also on tech of tomorrow
so peace out folks hope you enjoy these
videos today if you missed anything at
all make sure you check it out down
below the like button in the description
because it'll all be there we'll see you
guys tomorrow with more gtx 780 goodness
anyway for them to win right now unless
they use like that time-space continuum
thing and you know travel back in time
with the spaceship err</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
