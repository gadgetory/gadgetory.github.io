once again to the channel I'm Eric your
host now a lot of you guys may know that
the Apple iPhone 5 came out and a lot of
you guys are talking all kinds of
shizmik saying and I was a sellout well
guess what I'm about to prove you frack
and wrong because I just changed from
t-mobile over to Verizon for one thing
honestly Timo bless some shitty
phones and they wouldn't upgrade me all
they've did is basically dick me around
for years and mess with my service and
give my mom and me both crappy phones so
that's about it so that said I switched
over to horizon and I got two phones for
me I got the galaxy s3 that's right here
you guys all know about this one 1.5
gigahertz dual-core processor 4.7 inch
screen high resolution basically
supposed to be one of the fastest phones
that there is out there so this is my
box I'll flip it around the back you
guys can see it's the Verizon model now
for my mom though I actually did get her
an iPhone so I know me you guys are
gonna hate on this but check it out one
thing I've really discovered is that
anything from Apple is really just made
for people who don't like messing with
stuff if you're a person who likes
overclocking tinkering you like messing
with stuff you're a PC user if you just
want to touch something don't want to
mess that ever and just use it you're
more of an Apple person my mom's kind of
old and she wants something simple so I
got her an iPhone 4s hey it was 99 bucks
Cameron's been using it for years it's
always been a good phone for him but
we're not talking about that phone today
we're gonna be talking about this one so
with that said let's go ahead I know
it's been out for a while folks but
let's go into the unboxing and show you
my new phone you guys are always asking
my personal stuff so here's lrx new
personal galaxy 3's in white so let's go
alright folks so here's everything you
get when you subscribe to a new two-year
contract with Verizon you get the
getting started guide you get the phone
itself inside the getting started guide
you can see that it says everything you
need to get started is inside of here
the activation guide the customer
receipt and the SIM card for compatible
devices so I'll go ahead and pop this
open
can see right here it has before turning
on device it has to read the activation
guides it's basically telling you how to
do your phone you get your receipt all
kinds of stuff if you have an old phone
they give you FedEx stuff to send it
back ship it back most importantly
though inside of here is my sim card
so all this instructions any kind of
stuff it's all good here's the
activation guide for your 4G LTE phone
here's all the instructions so go ahead
and close that up let's go ahead and get
out the SIM card I knew I should have
brought a sword for this thing when a
sore finger doesn't do this alright so
here it is right here here's my little
SIM card here's a little start here
thing probably going to give you
instructions pull this thing out here is
the SIM card it's right here so I'm
going to go ahead and just pop this
little SIM card out because what I'm
going to be inserting into my phone so
let me set that down and then let's go
over and let's actually do the phone so
here's the outside of the box we saw
that earlier so I'm gonna waste your
time really with that just go ahead and
try to get the box out and start going
so there we go see how this thing goes
pop top little cap here all right
cow boom so here's the top we go ahead
and just pull the phone out so here's
the front of the phone see one control
here
other controls are here
go ahead and remove the back of this
take this off here you guys can see the
back of the phone Verizon 4G LTE galaxy
s3 front camera seems even got built-in
flash it's kind of crazy got a couple
more piece of plastic here I'll just go
ahead and remove those off the camera so
before I put the SIM card in let's see
if what else came in the box there's
nothing in this one right get stuff down
here's all the accessory kits okay
here's the galaxy s3 here's the start
here guide you need instruction it's
going to be there you're going to have
the wall charger get that out here's the
wall charger gonna use USB cable which
comes included as well right here here's
the USB cable looks almost identical to
the one that I did hunt in the iPhone 5
though the gate looks almost exactly the
same packaging hey it's probably the
same factory only like you guys know
Apple throws into a $75 you know upgrade
charge on it so basically this part
right here is going to plug into your
phone you pull it into your phone plug
it on the charger plug in your wall or
you can use your computer and plug it
into one of your USB slots some
computers actually have really good
powering for external USB gigabyte
motherboards have it a Zeus motherboards
have it so you can check that out and go
to unplug that from there last but not
least in the box we have those we got
here okay we've got the battery for the
fall let me go ahead and get that out of
here too few folks
so here's the battery Samsung battery
damn now I've got a Samsung microwave
Samsung toaster rice cooker TV DVD
player blu-ray player damn I got a lot
of Samsung stuff so here's the battery I
know it's glory and then last but not
least are the headphones you get these
out of your UFOs you can take a look at
them they come with an assortment of
different earpieces right here you can
see all kinds of different one for
different sized ears so you can get your
comfort zone here's the plug the two
headphones camera can just show my head
real quick
I feel pretty comfortable so let's get
that out of the way so that's all the
stuff that comes in the box books so now
let's start to take apart the camera and
start to put the battery and everything
into it so basically folks to get the
back of the camera for your stuff you
want your fingernail up here on top you
just kind of gently pry on the plastic
it opens up so here's the back end of it
I have two things I'm going to be
installing the battery which is right
here
I'll go ahead and put the battery in and
then I'll put the sim card in get the
sim card back up here again alright
folks then last but not least we have
the SIM card and you're gonna want to
make sure to put your SIM card inside
your phone so all you do is let's do
this and slide your sim card in it's
very nice and simple so now the SIM
cards in the phone is ready I'll go
ahead and put the backpack on in here
it'll twinkling back and forth there all
right folks now I've turned the phone
there's a on button here on the side I
turn the phone button on and so now the
phone is turning on for the first time
pretty cool-looking huh I'm liking it
all right so I speak English I think so

bomb and I'm gonna blow up here but if
