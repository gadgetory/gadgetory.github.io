tomorrow and the HTC One m8 has been
with us for the past month or so and
it's time to give this guy a revisit to
see how things are going if you haven't
been around there have been a lot of the
past month Donald Sterling's made some
racist comments and the brand new HTC
One the Encore to the old HTC One m7 has
dropped into millions of people's hands
maybe not quite millions but definitely
a lot of hands and it's definitely one
great device the new I made is faster
bigger and made with more metallic
elements something called aluminium
which is different from the lumen I'm
apparently and it's definitely a
different device because the old m7 was
a device we all fell in love with and
the new m8 is a device but I'm deeply in
love with so far so let's give the HTC
One m8 and revisit one month later the
HTC One m8 whereas people would like to
call it the mate is one sexy device now
being built out of 90% aluminium it has
a texture unlike any other smartphone
out there it makes the one absolutely
the most slippery device known to man
it's like someone who took an iPhone 3G
and smothered baby oil all over it
but where this extra aluminum comes in
if beauty does follow and so far I've
only managed one tiny scratch right
below the HTC logo on the back and one
tiny scratch on the display and keep in
mind I kept the one almost bare
throughout the whole one month one minor
thing to note is about the boom sound
speakers and mainly the speaker holes
themselves I had an issue of debris
getting stuck underneath the speakers on
the HTC One m7 and they're still here
with the new m8 so the phone is still
beautiful good next would be hardware
specs and battery life well the HTC ones
801 chip is now out on a few smartphones
like the s5 fee Oppo find 7 and they
just recently announced oneplus one
device which is a sub brand of Oppo
apparently but I've only used C 801 chip
on the s5 which we've made a comparison
video on that a couple weeks ago which
you can check out in the description
below it's still generation leading but
obviously it mainly relies on how well
the software uses all of that power from
the 2.3 gigahertz quad-core chip which
we'll get to that in just a moment the
other side of this hardware talk is the
battery life with a slightly larger
you'd only imagine a slight increase but
you're wrong I have never managed to get
this one underneath the 20% mark at my
end of the day and you have to realize I
almost practically work off my phone on
a day-to-day basis and that super
battery saving mode is still not active
on any of the US models but really I
just don't need it in the future and
it's not only me tons of tech you two
people have had similar results now
let's switch our focus to software the
One m8 runs Android 4.4.2 kitkat and
sense 6.0 which of a time of this
recording is still the most current
version of Android handsets I figure out
standing with my earlier claims of this
being the best skinned Android
experience to date I've never run into
problems with built-in applications
crashing all the features work most of
the time and I've never had anything
that annoyed me sense 6.0 is still a
breath of fresh air for Android 4.4.2 in
my opinion while some may disagree with
me and may even favor the Google Play
edition m8 I would still stick with my
standard one who sent six now there are
some things I would like to change like
how the app drawer Scrolls vertically
instead of horizontally but that's just
an HTC thing I would also change the
motion launch settings to be less
sensitive and let you use those gestures
with a phone on a table which leads me
into motion launch itself it's actually
more helpful than you may think that it
can help people with smaller hands it
almost gets rid of using the lock switch
entirely because you could just swipe
from the right hand side to unlock your
phone in one motion you can also launch
them to blinkfeed use a voice command
feature and if you flip the phone in to
landscape mode and tap the volume rocker
launch for camera application throughout
my time browsing tweeting watching
youtube videos and playing games I've
never run into major problems of sense 6
I think I've only had about one or two
games crash on me but other than that
it's nothing another major aspect of
Sense 6 is the upgrade ability of the
software HTC is making a major strive to
keep their software up to date on all
the phones over over-the-air updates
that also means we can hope for the next
version of Android to be available on
the HTC One m8 within weeks or even days
of its arrival at i/o this year the last
thing I wanted to mention is the camera
there is no changing the original
verdict of the HTC one fits camera it's
of low quality compared to the s5 to 5s
or really any other flagship on the
market
we all wish it were better
that's just what we have so after a full
month of the HTC one being in our hands
we still love this phone it's still in
my pocket as my daily driver and I think
that's the most ultimate award coming
from a man who sits at work and reviews
tons of phones each and every year the
phone that sits in their pockets must be
the best right but all sorts of people
have different sorts of tastes when it
comes to owning a phone for an extended
period of time the HTC One m8 is not for
everyone there's other flat chips around
and many of them are coming soon like
the oneplus one which uses a very
similar hardware structure yet cost half
as much as the m8 but if you like a
phone that's built like this runs
beautiful skin software like this and
just looks as beautiful as vm8 then this
would be your perfect fit so let us know
what you think about the HTC One m8 and
whether you own one or not also let us
know if you'd want to own one or could
care less because there's other phones
around you can also ask me questions
directly on Twitter - at mark om Hana is
my twitter name and feel free to give me
a follow wire there and as always my
name is marco from Technic tomorrow and
I'll catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
