in YouTube land welcome back once again
to the channel now I just got an email
from the people over Nvidia and I guess
that next Tuesday they're gonna
releasing a brand new driver that's
going to enable 7 more monitors to be
g-sync compatible and that means that
they'll now have a total of 24 models
that are g-sync compatible we'll have a
link down below to all of these but the
news is for right now I hate to be on my
phone but I figured just be easier these
are the models now they've just released
7 new ones
it's the Acer kg 271 BPM IPX that's
number one
the second one is the acer xf 2 4 0 h b
MJ d PR long names here right next up
another racer monitor the X F 2 700 H
BPM IXP rx monitor we have a new one for
may open 2 7h c 1 r p di DP x na zeus
this is the VG 2 4 8 huge e another one
from gigabyte this is the a horas this
is their ad 27 QD and then last but not
least an LG model this is the 27 g k 7 v
0 f so like I said this is gonna be kind
of a really short video but this this
email just came in and I think for a lot
of people out there who you know want to
be able to use their AMD cards and stuff
like that and they want to be able to
use those with an Nvidia you know based
monitor this will be really good news
for those people out there if you have
an Nvidia card I mean here you're
already cool but if you want to be able
to use your existing tech and still you
know have a monitor that's going to be
able to be compatible this list does
keep growing so right now there are 24
total g-sync compatible amount of
compatible monitors that will be out
next Tuesday when Nvidia releases this
brand new drivers there'll be a new
driver obviously it'll probably have
some updates to some games and stuff
like that but it looks like one of the
big things is going to be support for
more of these monitors so that everybody
out there can enjoy the benefits
of having g-sync technology now if for
some reason you're from Mars you don't
know what g-sync technology is
whatsoever g-sync technology is kind of
the same thing as freesync technology
except it's more Hardware based and what
it does is it pretty much syncs all that
you're seeing on your screen with your
video card so you get no screen tearing
no ripping all of your gameplay is just
completely smooth it's nice
no jaggies none of that stuff you just
get the absolute best gameplay that you
can get and in the past it's been very
expensive to get into a pure-bred g-sync
monitor we reviewed on a while back I'm
it it's a really nice motor but it's
like 2k and not many people have $2,000
to spend on a monitor you're I'm saying
I mean if they're gonna have to ran the
probably the first thing they're gonna
do is probably write the absolute best
video card they can get and then worry
about a monitor so a lot of these
monitors are gonna be much more
affordable and now for people out there
if you own these monitors check it out
it's really great news for them plus
since these monitors are gonna be a lot
more affordable you're probably able to
jump into them for a lot less money
we'll have links down below or so you
guys want to go over to Amazon check
some of these out and buy them for
yourselves um you'll know that next week
they'll be working and they'll be
working for you I'm mark you've been
watching techni tomorrow I know this is
a quick video but hey it's good news
