by guns of boom get a little boom in
your game what's up everybody glad to
see you guys back here once again on the
channel now if you guys been following
along we've been doing a lot of
head-to-head battles involving the Vega
cards versus the nvidia side of things
and once again we've got an overclocking
battle that's right the overclocking
battle between the vega RX 56 and the
gtx 1070 f ii card so with that said
though let's bounce right in let's check
out that test system and let's check out
those scores and let's see at the end of
the day who actually wins overclocked
the Vega or the GTX so the parts that we
use in the test bench that you're seeing
in today's video consists of an Intel
Core i7 6700 K at 4.0 gigahertz which
turbos to 4.6 gigahertz now this was
done in an AZ rock z170 motherboard 16
gigabytes of HyperX ddr4 at 3333
megahertz now as far as the drivers go
we had to do something different because
we were having a little bit of
difficulty with the latest driver so we
had to revert to AMD's crimson real live
drivers seventeen point eight point two
to get any great overclock because the
seventeen point nine point one
they just weren't allowing great
overclocks to be set now the driver that
we use for the gtx 1070 efi is the w hql
385 point 41 a lot of you guys have been
asking hey lore could you have two under
voltage well yes you do because in order
to increase that HP m2 memory you
definitely need to under built the card
and we did that to achieve our results
today we did however clock that HBM to
memory as far as it will go that's a
1200 millivolts and that's the most that
you can do right now with wot man not to
get a better overclocking result we
supplied the maximum plus 50% power
limit we also tuned the temperatures to
their highest and maximum values and we
also did this with the fans at a hundred
percent with the Vega 56 we were able to
get a core overclocking score of sixteen
hundred and thirty-two megahertz and a
memory overclocked to nine hundred
eighty five megahertz the temperatures
themselves never even reach close to ADC
but that was at the fan set
100% and let me just tell you guys the
fan is quite annoying said under percent
anybody ever heard of a hairdryer now at
the gtx 1070 we added a hundred and
forty megahertz to the core clock and we
were able to achieve a maximum overclock
with the GPU boost of twenty twelve
megahertz the memory was also
overclocked on the 1070 we added 520
megahertz to achieve a forty five
hundred and nineteen megahertz final
stable memory clock and the GPU remained
relatively cool staying in the mid 70
seeds the entire time alright guys so
before we jump in and check out those
benchmarks and the conclusions I know
that we all love to play mobile games
right I mean who doesn't like a good
game on their phone so with that said
let's check out guns of boom all right
folks
I usually would not say this but I can
honestly say I haven't played a mobile
game quite like guns of boom ever before
I mean it's a first-person PC shooter
game only on your mobile device and with
non-stop player versus player action
including clan battles you can get that
desktop PC shooter feel right in the
palm of your hands and the controls are
super easy and simple to use shooting
and moving around the map was a blast
and with the auto fire option all you
have to do is get the enemy within your
sights and then watch them get blown
away and for an extra challenge you can
turn the auto fire off but even when it
was turned off I could still easily move
around and unleash the lead
speaking of lead guns of boom has a
massive selection of weapons from rifles
machine guns and shotguns to pistols
knives and even grenades this game has
it all you can even click skins for your
guns or customize your character with
different masks and costumes play guns
of boom to collect them all and best of
all you can get guns of boom today at
Amazon Google Play or the App Store now
with that said let's jump in and rock
out to the benchmark song and let's
check out those benches
all right tech fans so there you guys
have it the head-to-head overclocking
battle between the Vega 56 and the gtx
1070 fe now I gotta say this overall
both cars actually scaled pretty damn
well all things considered because we
live in a pretty hot place we live out
in the desert so getting those great of
results in a really hot place I think is
just thumbs up all around now the Vega
card although it does score better it
does require a lot more power and it
requires that fan to be under 100
percent which is actually quite noisy
and let's just face it it takes a whole
hell of a water hole how about a wattage
just to run the Vega I mean think about
it in the old days you over voted to
overclock and now you under bolt to
overclock so things have kind of gone
two steps forward and one step back I
feel at that stuff but still at the end
of the day it's really nice to see that
the RX Vega can overclock that well I
wasn't really expecting it to do as well
as it did but you guys can see as just
as far as overall performance goes in an
overclock state with both cards pushed
to their maximum values the Vega 56 came
on top of the 1070 FV so at the end of
the day if overclocking is your thing
and you don't want to go out and do any
kind of liquid cooling you want to be
able to grab a card take that thing out
of the box overclock the out of
that motherfrakker and get the best
scores you're gonna get well hey you
guys can see the Vega 56 in this
particular battle is the overall winner
and as drivers probably get better and
better and better we'll probably see
even better performance with this card
so that's it folks at the end of the day
the winner of today's battle is the AMD
rx Vega 56 not by a landslide and there
are a couple cabbie it's gonna take
consideration but if raw power and
performance is what you're looking for
it you guys see the results like usual
down below that like button we'll have
more information about these cards if
you want to check out different brands
and models for you to purchase one or
just get more information for your brain
it'll be there peace out my brothers and
sisters of tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
