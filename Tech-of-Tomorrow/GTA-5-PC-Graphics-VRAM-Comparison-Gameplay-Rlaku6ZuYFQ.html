for vram footage means you guys want to
see how Viren was affected in the game
so check it out I have a few cards 9 69
79 80 now all of these cards are for
gigabyte edition cards so right now
let's jump in and let's check out not
only how the vram is affected by the
different settings in the game but also
how it looks I'm gonna take a crazy
fucking Drive go around kill some people
you don't escape the copy copies and
then we'll check it out so let's jump in
this is with 4 gigabytes of the RAM on a
series of different video cards like I
said GTA 5 is here and let's go do this
shit I'm using my aces monitor right
here this is 144 Hertz gaming monitor
and one thing that I thought was really
unique in using this game is that this
is a 1920 by 1080 monitor never been
able to get it to go to any other
setting but check this fucking shit out
I go over here to settings
we go over here to graphics check it out
so we'll just start right up here at the
top of the screen you guys can see that
I have four gigabytes basically of
memory available currently I'm using
almost three of that I have the ignore
suggested limits off DirectX version is
11 if I change that it'll just keep
going lower and lower and lower
but DirectX 11 so we want to be screen
type full screen now this is what I was
talking about check this out
the resolution that's letting me do this
at is 27 15 by 15 27 and it's playing
the game in this resolution otherwise it
would not allow me to sit at this and
it'd be funky I mean I could set it back
to 1920 by 1080 but what the fuck I mean
I'm gonna try this and keep doing it
aspect ratio Auto refresh rate like I
said 144 Hertz output monitor is a
single monitor FX AA's on MSA is off
right now but we have plenty of room so
let's go ahead and let's turn that on
times 2 it starts getting in the yellow
times 4 more yellow times 8 I'm in the
red I've just exceeded all of my
available you know B RAM so that kind of
sucks so we'll toggle that back down a
little bit we'll give it a 2 vsync is on
pause game on focal loss that's really
not gonna have much to do with it
population density I want to keep that
up as much as possible population
variety we want to keep that up distance
scaling you know it's how far things
away keep that fully up texture quality
very high normal high very high how much
room do got to play here so I can keep
it on very high shader quality very high
normal high very high okay shadow
quality high normal very high still got
some room there reflection quality high
very high still got a little bit rude to
work with reflection msaa okay
times eight I'm that's not changing
anything times four times two off times
eight all right that's not affecting
anything so we definitely want to put
that on their water quality high very
high I'm not really affecting anything
particle quality very high grass quality
all right ultra all right we'd have
ultra grass quality I mean I always like
my grass to be ultra quality I don't
know about you guys but what the heck
so we can't get the part of the quality
of that but Ultron that soft shadows
sharp soft NVIDIA PC SS we'll keep it on
that since we got a video card in here
post effects very high ultra normal
we'll keep it on Ultra motion blur I
hate motion blur so to me you can't air
motion blur all the way down and I will
be satisfied that is fine with me in
game depth of field effects off will
turn those on as well doesn't seem to
affect the memory at all aniss tropic
filtering times sixteen off that's not
really seeming to affect the memory at
all ambient occlusion high off normal
high that's fine tessellation aha here
we go
normal high very high still not
affecting anything alright so we can see
that now everything in here is set to
its fullest well if the apply changes
let's go take a little drive around
alright folks so now here we are we're
on the beach let's go check out the
water let me actually use my little
controller here I'm using my little Xbox
controller this thing works absolutely
great so I'm using this little bad boy a
couple pounds in the a button will get
me up here running oh you guys can see
look at everything is amazing awesome
you guys can see their stuff running
through the air birds let's get down
here and take a look at this water
looks simply amazing everything in this
game is actually very realistic and as
you guys can see now we've pretty much
set everything up to as high as it can
go and with 4 gigabytes you can see it's
running just fine there were a few
things in there that we could not set
exactly but everything else is running
great look at this look at the great
shadow effects some of the great things
actually about Nvidia products right now
is that they have this great new soft
shadow stuff and it makes everything
look natural trees your body everything
looks just more like normal like even
the flickering of the light right now as
you can see I'm coming through you see
the flickering and the shadows in the
light it's just so realistic now in
parts of the game when you're driving
around I'm just so blown by how much it
really looks like places that I've been
just trying to find my way up here on
top so we can do something cool but I
guess let's go over here real quick and
steal a car so we can get getting out of
Dodge real quick
ah a nice little drive here we go let's
hop on in take a little Drive
doctor overclock is on its way to create
some problems
whoa-ho Wow some terrible driving that
wasn't it for these people oh yeah
Oh score 10 points shit I bet you in
shit your pants on your side hit
thankful didn't it boohoo I would too
Venice Beach border run oh yeah going
crazy here we're gonna go to the street
in a second here it's like a nice little
foggy morning let's run a red light
oh and now we're gonna get chased by the
police we should probably find a better
car I fell right on my face at some
funny stuff but that's all right
here we go cop chase everybody step jays
whoa
all right here we go everybody cup chase
hey I like this music all right little
piggies can you catch me I've got even a
crap car

broke the law when the women country
music should fight the establishment
that was what heavy metal was for
Brook folks as you can see those police
are not doing a good job of catching me
so your tax dollars at work
are being wasted
and they're shooting at me from a
helicopter now bastards
ain't pretty simple so I'm gonna Dobbs
just trying to show you guys that this
looked like as much as possible
so I figured a quick crazy drive around
the country was the best way to do that
oh here we go folks rogue black rope
lock let's get out and see if we can
shoot some coppers shall we
alright folks this is going to be the
first in a series of videos that we're
going to be doing with the GTA 5 game
there's just all kinds of killer stuff
we'll be doing some comparisons and
technology but you guys asked to see
vram stuff first so today we brought you
vram using four gigabyte within videos
series cards you guys also saw how it
looked we could actually use some other
footage of actually you know capturing
it with shadow playing all that stuff
but we thought you guys prefer to see
live actually footage of me going around
playing the fucking game but having fun
plus we showed you how 4 gigabytes of
vram is affected and that's gonna really
be the same whether you're using an AMD
card or an Nvidia card uh friends of
mine are online talking some crazy shit
I love playing this games I play with my
kid and if you guys want to play with me
it's doc overclock so do see overclock
you guys want to play with me all about
you so you're gonna plan the heist so
anyways I'm gonna get back to the game
like I said this is just series of one
we've got widescreen monitor stuff 2
gigabyte stuff we'll also check it out
on the Titan so just stay tuned is we
bring you more GTA 5 action here on teka
