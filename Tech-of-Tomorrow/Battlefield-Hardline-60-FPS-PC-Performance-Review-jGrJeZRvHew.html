you guys with another benchmark video of
a recently released pc game this time
it's battlefield hardline now being a
big triple a game from EA and easily
turned out every year the results from
this one aren't very surprising we ran
the game at 1080p resolution on our test
system which includes a GTX 780 and an
i7 4770k processor using the game's
campaign and testing it at the for
traditional preset graphic settings of
low medium high and ultra let's check
that out right
so there you have it you know seeing us
how this is based on these same engine
as battlefield 4 and they haven't really
taken any major strides and textures or
effects the numbers we're seeing here
really aren't all that surprising seeing
high 60s at Ultra settings and well over
a hundred on low settings as far as the
game itself so far I've only been doing
the campaign right now and it's okay
it's clearly trying very very hard to
hit every cop show trope it can pulling
a lot from older stuff like Miami Vice
to more recent shows like a law and
order it even has a hole opening done in
the style of a title intro and even when
you leave or enter the game it does a
previously on and next time on which
wears thin pretty fast for me at least
pure gameplay wise it's been walking
this very awkward line of trying to not
be about a field but still be
battlefield at the same time not
throwing assault rifles at you right
away and making you stick with pistols
and stun guns but then it's still
throwing guns at you shortly after no
matter how little sense it makes for a
cop show as well as having some pretty
ridiculous combat scenarios holding off
waves of criminals if this is any
indication of the game's multiplayer
it's basically going to be a lot like
Battlefield 4 with a change of setting
and a tilting difference toward what
kind of guns are more common now with
that said if you're interested in
grabbing the game we do have a link down
below in description as always guys if
you enjoy the video hit that thumbs up
button let us know subscribe if you
haven't yet we're bringing you more
great content soon but until then you've
been watching tech of tomorrow see you
later
and be
will
you
