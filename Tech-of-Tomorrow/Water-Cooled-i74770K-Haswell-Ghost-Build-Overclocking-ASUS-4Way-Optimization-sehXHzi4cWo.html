tech of tomorrow I'm Miller care host
we're here for some swordplay with JJ
from Asus but that's not why we're
really here we're here to take a look at
a suite three and four way optimization
on the latest asus motherboard so with
that said let's hop in and let's do us
some videos alright so hey did you
before we actually jump into the video
let's talk a little bit about the test
system that you brought along to do
today's vid sure we've got an awesome
system here to kind of let us showcase
the four-way optimization technology
which we're going to be showing you and
as part of that we've got of course a
great set of cooling components and some
overclock ability here so let's go ahead
and break this down so of course chassis
wise we've got bit Phoenix's ghost
chassis so that's a great room enclosure
gives us a lot of flexibility cable
management for the water cooling
configuration that's cooling our fourth
generation Core series processor 4770k
you've got coolant cz's EXO's 2 755
fully integrated closed-loop solution
and then we've got Qantas
high-performance water block solution
the 370 and they have a newer model of
380 for the fluid it's a super special
fluid that we're utilizing it's Mayhem's
Aurora gold with a little bit of yellow
dye in there to just give it that much
more luster awesome pearlescent kind of
a fluid that we have here in terms of
the motherboard we've got the z87 deluxe
as far as the GPU we've got our brand
new GTX 670 direct cu mini graphics card
powering the entire thing in terms of a
power supply we have C Sonic's 860 XP 80
+ platinum PSU for Kingston we've gone
ahead and tapped their high performance
hyper X beast memory 21:33 4 dims and
then for the SSD side of the fence who
golf's we've got Kingston's hyper X 120
gigabyte 3k SSDs - in a raid 0 and
rounding it out in terms of our storage
for our OD d is we have one of our bc or
combo blu-ray drives so that pretty much
represents everything we have and it's
also going to give us a great example of
what a high performance system is going
to be able to do in terms of
overclocking when we go ahead and
initialize our 4 way optimization
technology right on alright so with that
said let's transition over and let's
actually check out
by folks who are in the Windows
environment and JJ is now going to show
us the AI suite three set of software
applications right doc a few guys that
have been following us for a long time
you guys are very familiar with AI suite
as a whole if we had our first
generation as suite then we had a sp2
and now we have ai suite three so ai
suite is actually our fully encompassing
system utility which covers everything
from power management to fan control
functionality to offer overclocking
functionality and power management
adjustment so that along with the course
our complementary features like USB 3
boost USB charger plus our network I
control all that is integrated into this
so you can see right off the bat now we
did we've brought up the actual it's got
a whole new screen correctly brought up
ATI Suite 3 and the GUI has been
entirely revamped and redesigned so it
has a much more kind of modern kind of
overlay feel you know it looks like a
heads-up display you know it's very
sharp clean modern looking moves naming
it maybe has a little bit of a gaming
vibe but definitely has a technological
vibe to it and so our team worked very
hard and giving you a great a great kind
of GUI to be able to not only see your
information be able to work through so
at the bottom here we have a persistent
level of information that's presented so
we have CPU frequency we have DRAM
frequency we can go ahead and expand on
that we can show all our CPU utilization
in real time we have all course all our
for spending voltages our temperature
information and our fan speeds now one
thing I do want to go ahead and know is
sometimes people wonder why they
sometimes might see a difference between
our fan speeds and then the fan speed
excuse me on the CPU temperature
information that's reported by our
program as well as the CPI information
that might be reported by a third party
program and this is because we actually
have our own way that we create the
temperature that's reported we have a
thermistor so actual a mechanism to read
temperature built into the CPU socket
and we then take temperature information
that's fed by the CPU and we adjust that
for what's called the T castes the T
caste is the plating that's on top of
the CPU die and then we provide you an
approximated offs that are an average of
that temperature it's much more
realistic than the actual temperature
that's reported just from what's called
the DTS sensors that are inside the CPU
and the reason why this is its internal
well it's it's more representative of
your ambient configuration
the DTS sensors that are inside the CPU
are actually not designed for a hundred
percent accurate monitoring of
temperature they're actually built in
there for the measurement of throttle
like so base of your CPU is getting too
hot it knows a slam back a little bit so
it doesn't burn right down correct as
well as to take advantage of Intel's
turbo technology so it kind of knows
when to ramp up and when to ramp down
because part of that measurement system
is based on temperature so this is an
important distinction because a lot of
sometimes people perceive that it's
always going to be 100% accurate and
that's not necessarily correct so this
is why we have our temperature report in
one way but of course you can feel free
to monitor it in multiple ways from
there of course we have a configuration
parameter where you can go in and make
adjustments to all the corresponding
sensor values in terms of points where
you want it to alert you if there's
going to be a point that it goes below
or goes above and that's all adjustable
within this environment now JG compared
to like the BIOS um what is your
actually control inside of this compared
to like like for overclocking do you
have as much flexibility in this or is
this kind of like a lightweight program
for you just to use in the Windows
environment as you know doc actually all
too well we a hundred percent giving you
really the same level of depth and
control because part of our design has
always been about giving you the same
vs. versatility and flexibility in the
operating system that we give you in the
UEFI so options such as the multiplier
the clock speeds the voltages that's all
adjustable and we're going to show that
quickly here when we jump in the TPU
section so rounding out the initial
interface here we have our forward
optimization which we're going to show
here in a moment
but we of course have our tpo
performance data our fan expert
optimization data DIGI+ power
optimization data information and epu
and all this is going to be calibrated
when we actually go into for
optimization and of course we have some
quick profiles now if we jump into TPU
TPU generally is the focus as part of
our dual intelligent processors for
design to be able to give you all the
flexibility for kind of tweaking and
tuning performance aspects of your
system and this is just like the UEFI
you can go in there and make full
adjustments to the B CLK or to the
multiplier or to with something that's
called the cash ratio which we'll
explain more about when we talk about
overclocking you can even go ahead and
not just do per core tuning but you can
do full tuning and that means all the
CPU ratios can be fixed to the same
ratio as opposed to maybe having like
two cores right at 47 and then two cores
running at 46 with those actually last
two cores being all coarse so you got a
lot of granularity in terms of which you
control of course down here of course we
have all our voltages you can choose an
adaptive voltage or manual voltage
adaptive is a new form of voltage for
most users if they've used competitors
products
if you've used Asus products in the past
our digital plus power design has given
you what's called a turbo voltage that
not a lot of users have been
knowledgeable about and it does have a
difference in terms of how it executes
itself and the advantage that it
represents but we'll talk more about
that in the overclocking video some cool
ways though that we've made this more
flexible for you to be able to just
though it's not just a slider like we've
had in the past where normally you would
kind of just make an adjustment to here
but one you see that we've made a great
color coding mechanism so it allows you
to know what's your kind of your safe
ranges your moderate ranges as well as
dangerous ranges in terms of the voltage
that you're going to be utilizing in
addition to that we also have fully
direct Keon values that are supported so
if you don't want to go ahead and use
the slider you can just go ahead and key
in the voltage that you would like to go
ahead and utilize so that makes things
just that much more easy where you can
go ahead and use the slider or you can
directly key in whatever is more money
ladies your automatic whatever you want
correct so we think that's a great value
at it having not only the color to show
you kind of the ranges that are going to
be comfortable to work in but even just
being able to flexibly and easily be
able to define the voltages of course
this platform supports enhance
adjustment to the CPU strap like the VCL
case so you can make tweaks and tunes to
that you can then jump into the EP you
section which gives you extensive
options for customizing the power
management of your system so if we head
over into something like the auto mode
you can see that you can go ahead and
tune the system to go ahead and provide
less voltage in the CPU that can help
you to provide lower power consumption
when your CPU is idling or at a more
moderate state of usage versus a heavier
load of usage you can go in there you
can adjust all your time management
options in terms of how your system
responds with you away from it whether
it's for your monitor or sleep as well
as even modify your fan profiles for
different times now if we go to let's
say more extensive forms of power saving
we can even fully configure Mac CPU
power now this is really cool because in
the previous generation you could pick
fix target powers of like 45 watts or 35
wotz now here you actually can have full
of range you could adjust whatever
reduced power profile you want don t
even something like 20 watts and will
make all those adjustments for you so
that the CPU only consumes that power
profile table so if you're somebody
that's looking for more optimization and
being able to still keep better
performance but are willing to reduce
them to go ahead and take advantage of
more power conservation right to go
ahead and lower your electricity bill
you know reduce thermals and overall
provide superior ku6 because you're
having less load on your system it's
another great option that you can
provide more flexibility with hey it's
just another great thing to be able to
have correct so if we head back over to
you know the auto options you can see
that we can range through Auto high
performance max power saving in a wave
mode and digi+ power is what a lot of
people have been familiar with it we've
had an AF suite in the past which is all
these same robust UEFI options that we
had available to you whether they're
things like current capability
adjustment of the phase array and how it
responds whether it's undergoing to be
extreme which it's going to run the
phasor a fully 100% whether it's at idle
or at load or optimize where you're
gonna have the phase arrayed drop down
and be more efficient and produce less
thermal load on your vrm assembly and
overall give you a more balanced level
of efficiency on power so you can of
course control that all real time and
then fan expert - of course rounds it
out with giving you the best fan
controls you can get in the industry
fully adjustable for three pin fans for
four pin fans you can adjust real time
profiles you can go to each one of these
settings you can fully adjust gradients
to go ahead and ramp when you want it to
ramp you can fix fixed modes of rpm so
if you want to maybe just have your
front intake fans always set to like
1000 or 1200 rpm so they're always
bringing in air flow you can go ahead
and do that you can even rename each one
of the headers as well as control the
ramping for how it goes between let's
say something as little as like a
thousand rpm all the way up to 3000 rpm
because let me just type here day you're
saying that you can like name the front
fence you can call it front fan one
front fan - correct so that every fan
inside your system you'll know and be
able to see right inside of the women's
environment correct and the great thing
about that is that it you can also
personalize it so that you have an
understanding because sometimes when
you're gonna go into let's say all the
fan controls right if let's say I go to
chassis fan for chassis fan for doesn't
necessarily mean chassis fan for right
maybe it's my side panel fan or maybe
that's
actual I haven't connected a fan maybe
I'm connecting my water cooling pump to
that fan you could name it size right
you could just name that you know you
could name that water cooling pump or
you could name that side fan you could
name that top intake fan so then when
you go into our PC probe information and
you're looking at that you're seeing
something that's a more easily
understood than versus something generic
like chassis fan I see that Asus is
really pushing in the direction of
naming conventions for everything making
it simple for the user to name whatever
they want whatever they want for their
own memory correct yeah we just want to
be able to provide the most flexibility
at how you work with your system and
allow it to be more comfortable and
accessible for how you want to work with
it and rounding it out of course there's
an advanced menu option that you would
go ahead and click into that would give
you all those other functions that we've
seen in the past such as USB 3 boost
Network I control USB bottles flashback
USB charger plus and all that good stuff
so I really love the USB boost I have
some my external drives I got from
Kingston when I plug that bad boy and I
engage with that I get much faster
transfer speeds 100% way it's a great
way being able to maximize performance
for storage devices so moving on from
there one of the biggest things that a
lot of users kind of always are looking
to looking for is how do I find an easy
way to get the most out of the systems
that I purchased now a lot of us were
definitely dyed-in-the-wool enthusiasts
but the reality is not a lot of you guys
have been like me I've had the
opportunity for the last eight months to
work with this platform tweak it tune it
I've gone through tons of motherboards
I've gone through almost 100 CPUs I have
a lot of insight on how to be able to
maximize in Tunis but Dave you're trying
to make us jealous this town that mama
Donna green with envy but you know the
reality is when you get this on day one
you know that's a you've gone ahead and
pick this up from your local retailer
you've gone ahead and ordered from
online you get everything unboxed and
you go through it even when you're
watching videos you're not going to be
fully up to speed with everything and
you know there's always that trepidation
of people wanting to trust an automated
utility but I think we've showed in the
past how impressive and and functional
our programs can be and for this
generation we've tried to really add a
great degree of value to say look take
advantage of it try it out see the
performance benefit that we can offer
that's also going to be system specific
to you that's really what makes four-way
optimization special is that now not
only are we going to provide you
level of performance we're gonna do it
in a safe and effective way but we're
also gonna have it be specific to your
configuration whether that means you're
running a more moderate air cooler maybe
you're writing a high-performance tower
cooling solution or something
extraordinary like what we have here
with this awesome high performance
coolant water cooling system let me ask
you a question that's like in the same
vein since you said that you've like
seen like Cummings of processes and I
understand from what you've seen so far
what would you save for the 4770k is
like an average overclock though you
think that mostly anybody can get
without a problem at all yeah you know
hit that I all did that that's actually
a really interesting question it's part
of reason why we're gonna do a dedicated
overclocking video because there's
actually quite a bit of variance for
this generation
so some CPUs are definitely going to be
capable of hitting much higher
frequencies like what we have here in
this system it can comfortably be able
to get to you know 46 47 48 X
multipliers but there's actually going
to be quite a number of CPUs that we
expect in terms of retail ability you'd
be much more conservative but it's not
just a question of frequency it's also a
question of voltages voltages vary
between the CPU frequencies that are
needed as an example you could have a
CPU that does 4.6 as little as one point
one five volts and you could have a four
point six CPU that requires one point
four volts that's a huge Delta to be
able to try to automatically know and
work with some predefined value to be an
r2 total as well correct and that comes
into consideration that's what we feel
that for optimization can provide a
great deal of flexibility for you where
the system can automatically tune you to
maybe you know eighty-five percent of
the way and are probably a safer way
that you would normally pursue it
because we're not going to use
aggressive
manual vid's which also don't drop down
when your CPU is idling out right
because we all because I mean not
everybody in the worlds of Fugger or
Shannon and Rob or one of those other
super overclocker guys most people they
want to be able to get stuff and they
want to really be able to just simply
you know get it most people just use you
know good water cores you don't really
see the generic user going out and
buying himself a liquid nitrogen set up
for is how quartz of course so with that
let's go ahead and actually show you the
way forward optimization works let's do
it so we're gonna go ahead and click in
now our system we could go ahead and
define it we could pick out each one of
the fans where it's positioned and as I
noted you could go ahead and rename it
if you want it to let's let's let's go
ahead and let's duel
do that just so the user grace can see
let's go ahead and rename the front fan
front fan one so let's let me go ahead
and just pick maybe chassis fan one as
an example so we can go ahead and
chassis fan one right and when we go
ahead and have chassis fan one we know
this is actually this fan right here at
the back so this is actually an exhaust
fan right so we're exhaust so we could
go ahead and call that rear exhaust I
really hate when I have that stuff yeah
so and this actually could also serve
these could deserve to know not only
what the name is but also its position
so when we go ahead and click on this we
can actually start and we can ramp that
fan so as you see that fan has now
kicked on and we'd be able to go oh I
know where that position is and when we
do that we can then assign where it's
located so if you notice we can now
click that that's now the back fan so
this allows you to have much more
flexibility at knowing exactly where
your fan is in relation to your system
and what its function is whether it's an
intake fan whether it's an exhaust fan
whether it's cooling your hard drives
whatever you want to call it a great
deal of flexibility so that's something
that of course you can define here
initially as part of the four-way
optimization process now as part of that
we can also go in and select other
portions now for most of this you guys
have seen fan expert too in the past so
we're not going to run through that full
optimization process that we can explain
if an expert tuned for your in views out
the revenues before it means you can any
of the fans that are on the system can
be controlled through the BIOS or
through this you can go in and change
them all and do it very simply yes but
it's even more extensive than that right
because it's actually going to go to
each fan header and automatically
calibrate it from its minimum operation
to its maximum operation and then link
that together with simple profiles so
once we actually go ahead and let's say
if we had four or five fans attached and
we completed Vanek's / - we could click
the silent button and all the fans would
actually turn off they would actually be
silent it wouldn't just be an
approximation because it knows what the
minimum operating level is or we could
have set it to standard where it's a
balance of being really quiet but still
offering us consistent airflow and of
course as we gain or as we go ahead and
watch something on YouTube maybe the
latest tech of tomorrow video or we
switch over and maybe do something in
productivity the system is going to
cordially adjust in terms of that family
but smaller videos are known to
for heat systems I mean it's some pretty
intense demanding yeah it is demanding I
mean information overload right exactly
so here in the TPU section we've also
made an enhancement to our auto clock
auto auto overclocking application and
you can see right here we have the
ability now to allow it to either auto
overclock exclusively through the ratio
or the multiplier or through the B CLK
so this is also another great option if
you get your CPU you can get a baseline
and kind of get a sense of what your CPP
is capable as well as what it's capable
of on the BC LK side of the fence so
with that let's go actually go ahead and
auto tune our system alright so we're
gonna go ahead and click start now as
you saw we loaded full UEFI defaults so
that means right now that our system is
running at a full stock level of
performance so we're not running any
type of overclock and our memory is also
go ahead and running at stock so we can
see right there a 1333 3.5 gigahertz
that's all going to change though right
correct so we're now going to go ahead
and execute our four way optimization
which I said is a great way to be able
to simply not only overclock your system
and maximize its power efficiency
through the epu adjustments do complete
fan calibration and make all your
adjustments in terms of power
optimization now I'm also going to make
another note that for the EP
optimizations these are pretty cool it's
not just being able to bring down the
total power consumption we can even do
advanced things like be able to go and
turn off the add-on controllers such as
like let's say your cereal a tiara
controller things you're not using like
you'd have to say when the BIOS you
actually shut the power down to that
correct so when your system is not
actually writing maybe to your external
USB 3 hard drive that you attach to that
port or maybe a secondary hard drive
that's connected to the AES media SATA
controller when those are not being
utilized at your desktop environment
when it's idle we can turn down the
power to those devices and only have
them power back on when you actually go
to initialize let me ask you a question
because that could actually come in
handy also in the overclocking
environment so within the overclocking
environment can you shut those things
down so that you can save the power for
your overclock or does that only work
within the EP
you I think it's a pretty yeah no I mean
definitely those options are always
available in terms of being able to make
those adjustments but in terms of form
optimization will automatically make
those adjustments for you in terms of be
able to look at those controllers see if
there's anything attached and if they
are be able to essentially send a
command that when nothing is going on
with them that it can turn them off for
you so right now the systems calibrating
itself correct so it's gone ahead and
executed a quick basic a moderate
moderate overclock at four point three
gigahertz
so now the next step is once this
countdown timer completes its going to
continue to pursue a higher level of
overclocking so this is going to
automatically stress test they're not
gonna self-destruct in 25 24 no no this
is just the countdown timer and the
reason actually why we have the
countdown timer is because to degree we
don't necessarily know what people might
have automatically starting up with
their system so we're essentially giving
them a little bit of time to now allow
these things to come up as well as a
little bit time to figure out hey I'm
already happy with 4.3 gigahertz right
you sure about that because the Camerons
my way if I want to make a b-roll for
the door so no 100% we're gonna be
alright I'm risking my life here for you
guys oh no risk asus is 100% taking care
of you here man
so what we can see right here is now
that the system is actually running a
full course stress test and we can hear
our system ramping up and we can
actually see the seep utilization went
up to 100% because it's dynamically
actually clocking up our system and
stress testing at the same time it's
effectively the same thing you would
normally do yourself right go ahead
enter in an overclock modify the voltage
stress test it crash reboot and start
over again
this is very much the same thing than a
normal individual routine but already
taking our expertise and our design
philosophy of being able to do it in a
safe and accurate and consistent way
that's also specific to your system well
yeah with all the overclockers if you
guys have worked with I would imagine
that all the numbers for everything
gonna kind of have like a balance
somewhere it's if you put all those
numbers in there the computer could
probably predict pretty closely you know
within a parameter I'm doing some decent
overclocking well the great thing is
that there's no prediction here this is
real-time occurring on your system it's
making these adjustments so we went from
a 4.3 to now four point four gigahertz
it's now tree stress testing it and
we're gonna keep modifying it now the
really cool thing is that we've also
integrated per
or tuning for this generation so we're
gonna have some times to be able to go
more aggressively on 1 &amp;amp; 2 course
verses 3 &amp;amp; 4 course so once this actual
process completes its going to let us
know what our finalized overclock is so
at this point we're just going to go
ahead and the let it continue through
its Auto overclocking process and we're
gonna see what we end up with in terms
of our final result so we're now going
to go ahead and enter back into the
desktop and you can even notice that
we've actually modified the restart
shutdown experience that when your
system did crash we've actually made it
even shorter normally you have a more
lengthy shutdown experience where it
tells you hey your system is shut down
incorrectly and we've gone ahead and
make even adjustments for that so you
can see we've completed and we've given
you a 4.7 gigahertz overclock on two
cores and then across four cores 4.6
that's pretty badass though considering
that it's all you know done automatic
this system no headache and I could go
in restart at having your system at all
oh man I gotta go reset the BIOS again
none of that tricky stuff that you have
to do so I have to say that's really a
win-win thing for somebody who's really
new and just wants to be able to get the
best well yeah even from an enthusiast
perspective you'd be hard-pressed to
actually beat this you know what I mean
for someone that even knows how to tweak
them tune their system you're really
only going to talk maybe another number
or something very regular maybe about
another 100 maybe 200 megahertz so
you're really talking about and you're
probably not going to do it anywhere
near as elegantly right if we look right
now we can see that when our system is
dropping down we're using the adaptive
bit policy so you see the CPU is
dropping all the way down to 0.9 70
volts it's very efficient as opposed to
a normal user might be forcing 1.3 volts
always consistently you don't get that
nice power efficiency and you can also
see we've Auto
executed the initialization for the
overclock on the memory as well so we're
running that Kingston HyperX memory at
21 33 so we've kicked up your CPU
frequency we've kicked up your DRAM
frequency and you've now got a great
overclock integrated and if we even
decide that we want to go ahead and
actually stress test it to get an idea
in terms of its performance capability
we can go with something really
intensive pov is a actual full real-time
rendering application it's very
stressful and we can go ahead and go
here and we could take a look let's say
at our CPU utilization if we go ahead
something like this and we could go
ahead and run it across all CPUs and
when we go ahead and do that you're
gonna see that it's gonna hit that CPU
hard you can see now it's at 100% and
we're at 4.6 gigahertz and we've
auto-tuned it now we're locked in at one
point two four five bolts so you can see
very very reliable solid experience I
mean when you're using your system even
when you're gaming you're probably only
going to be executing somewhere between
about 40 to maybe 60% CPU load load
utilization so this is even already out
of the norm in terms of what you would
do yeah this is pretty impressive I have
to say I mean okay well I'm click and
when you go to 4.7 so it was pretty
awesome the last thing that we want to
show here though is that there are going
to be some users that obsess about
stability testing the one thing you have
to keep in mind with stability testing
on this platform is that Intel has made
some changes to the IBR the IVR is that
power regulation technology inside the
CPU if you're somebody that has to
validate using something like prime95 OC
CT even a disability test you have to be
very cautionary because it will force a
higher level of voltage to be supplied
that us we cannot control this process
and if you don't have enough thermal
Headroom in your thermal solution to
burn it it would necessarily maybe cause
a burn to the processor but what you
could have is essentially too much heat
to be able to thermally dissipate and
the CPU frequency would essentially
immediately throttle out so you want to
be conscientious of the reality that you
can't always do these type of tests so
I'm just going to show a quick example
of this so if we head over to this
ability test and we head over to the CPU
and let's say we go ahead and run this
you're going to see that it immediately
shot up to 1.337 volts that's much
higher than the 1.45 bolts that we were
using
if we run any other application that's
going to put a lot of stress in the core
correct and you can see even with our
high performance water cooling solution
we're getting to a point in terms of the
Maxim
temperatures that are being reported
that we could be getting close to a
thermal throttle standpoint so you
realistically want to be very cautionary
about using a stress test utility if you
really think you want to use a stress
test utility our recommendation is
probably check out the manual
overclocking video and you're gonna want
to use a manual vid while it's not going
to be efficient it will allow you to go
ahead and at least fix in a voltage
where you won't have this secondary
voltage ramp if you have to consider all
right excellent stuff with that that
gives you some insight and I think a
really impressive demonstration in terms
of what for.we optimization technology
can provide you as a benefit alright
folks so that pretty much wraps it up JJ
thank you very much for once again being
a guest on our channel you guys can all
see that the new AI suite 3d is awesome
technology one click of a button guys
4.7 overclocked it was easy simple
anybody can do it so with that said
we've got more videos coming up from
Asus and we'll see you guys back here on
the channel
JJ thanks thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
