once again to the channel so check it
out we all know that any of the latest
smartphones always cost a lot of money
let's just face it they're expensive so
today I'm gonna show you guys two of the
latest smartphones on the market and see
which one between the two actually takes
better pictures and does better video
and at the end of the day is there
actually a clear winner I'm gonna take
the iPhone XR 64 gigabyte model at 7:49
against the giggle the giggle it's
pretty funny huh the Google pixel 3 also
64 gigabyte model at $6.99 but Before we
jump in all the testing let's hear a
word from today's sponsor RAF Power it's
a wireless world and if you're looking
for a fast wireless charger then look no
further than the ravpower wireless
charger RAF powers pioneering hyper air
technology delivers the fastest charging
speeds on contact for both iOS and
Android devices all with the same
wireless charger and if you have a
compatible iPhone hyper air accurately
detects it sharing the same fixed
frequency and start charging it
immediately and the rav power charger
charges twice as fast as standard five
watt chargers the ravpower wireless
charger charges the latest iPhones at
7.5 watts and all the latest Samsung
devices at 10 watts the ravpower
features a rubberized nonstick base and
also features a smart battery indicator
that lets you know if your phone is
charging and when it's fully charged as
well and with failsafe security that
prevents any overcharging or overheating
you'll never have to worry about
damaging your device right now you can
get this nifty little device for $29 and
we'll have a link below for you to check
it out
so if you have any key enabled device
the ravpower wireless charger might just
be for you start living wirelessly now I
know one of the main questions that
everybody's going to be asking are about
the tools that you use for editing all
of your pictures and software and all
that stuff and honestly between the two
I don't think that anything stands out
making one of the other better they're
pretty much equal the tools that they
have and what they do you can do all the
normal things
you edit your pictures edit your videos
do all that kinds of stuff they have all
kinds of you know filters and features
on each one that's are really really
nice so if you're just wondering you
know hey which one is going to make my
life easier for editing I don't think
there is a clear winner they're both
pretty much equally standard now first
thing we did is we went outside and
started taking pictures outside no
unfortunately today it's not really a
super-duper bright day outside it was
raining and kind of cloudy today but you
guys can see that while we're taking
pictures outside the Apple XR honestly
takes better outdoor pictures if you're
outdoors and you're taking pictures and
you're doing lifestyle type of stuff
like this the iPhone is just a little
bit better than the pixel three the
pictures just seem to be a little bit
sharper a little bit more in focus
now the tables actually turn though when
we go inside and we start taking
pictures in low level light now in low
level light the Apple phone
honestly the 10 art just does not do as
good of a job as the pixel 3 so what it
comes down to at this point is do you
take a lot of pictures indoors are you a
person there's a lot of indoor pictures
and doing stuff like this do you use
your flats cuz I really don't like using
the flash at all if I can avoid it I
like to use natural and ambient light if
at all possible so you guys can see when
you pull things indoors the pixel 3
actually does things better in low-light
environments so if you're gonna be
taking pictures indoors not gonna have a
lot of stuff like that like you're doing
parties or stuff like that then the
pixel 3 might just be a little bit
better for you in these circumstances
now as far as video goes this one is
kind of hard for me because I want to
just automatically give the Apple the
winning here because it's the only one
of the two that can actually do 4k in 60
frames per second the pixel 3 will still
do 4k but it'll only do it in 30 frames
per second so if 4k at 60 frames per
second is really what you're shooting
for then obviously the clear winner in
this particular department is going to
go over to the iPhone 10 R it just has
that capability which the pixel 3
unfortunately just does not have that
particular quality in it
stabilization is something that you
might not think is that important but it
really is when you're taking pictures
and your hands are shaking you're moving
you want to have the absolute best
stabilization possible in this
department the pixel 3 actually was the
clear winner stabilization getting
things to lock into your picture much
faster was easier done on the pixel 3
the Apple 10 R was still okay but it
just didn't have the quickness and the
response like the pixel 3 does alright
folks so before we bounce out of here I
thought I'd do something a little bit
different now what we're seeing right
now what you guys are seeing actually is
we are using the iPhone 10 R and I'm
looking right the little camera thing
right there and this is at 4k at 60
frames per second we're in the same
studio that we always shoot our videos
in so if you're a person who shoots
videos or something you're wondering hey
how will you know my iPhone 10 our you
know shoot videos at 4k at 60 frames per
second in this situation one well as you
guys can see it does a really good job
so now I'm gonna switch over though and
I'm gonna show you guys what it looks
like at 4k at 30 frames per second since
that's the same thing you're gonna get
on the pixel 3 which will close out on
so give it a second so now we're at 4k
at 30 frames per second do I seem like I
am slower to you know I'm just joking
but here is what it looks like at 4k at
30 frames per second I don't think
visually if you'll be able to see really
that much of a difference but they're
both both the settings do pretty much
the same thing just at 60 frames per
second you're obviously just having it
done at a faster speed so with that said
though this has been the iPhone 10 R
let's check out the pixel 3 and see how
it does okay so now we're filming with
the pixel 3 at 4k at 30 frames per
second I'll actually close the video out
using this particular phone now at the
end of the day like I said earlier the
software and the tools inside of either
one of these phones is going to be
absolutely perfect for you you're not
gonna have like any grand learning curve
or anything and neither one of them is
easier or any more intuitive to make you
go oh my god I really need to have that
one over the other one
they're really the clear differences
like I said before is that the iPhone
looks really great for stuff outdoors a
lot of people do stuff outdoors their
lifestyles are outdoors so if your
person knows a lot about door type of
stuff and your lifestyle well then
obviously the 10r does just a little bit
better than the pixel three but if
you're indoors and you're doing a lot of
indoor stuff like you're taking pictures
of products or you're doing stuff like
that or parties or your family well then
hey in that particular circumstance then
obviously the pixel three is just a
little bit better now as far as the
video goes I believe that both of these
phones have absolutely great video
quality they're pretty equal just as far
as the quality goes but I have to say
that the iPhone having you know the
ability to do 4k at 60 frames per second
has to be the clear winner in that
particular department but at the end of
the day is there really a clear winner
between the two I mean if you were a
person who never saw a phone ever before
you haven't heard any commercials you're
not influenced by any bullcrap out in
the market while their marketing
campaigns and you just came down and you
were like hey I just need a phone I
needed to be able to take a lot of
pictures and do a lot of different stuff
you'd be hard-pressed between the two
they're both really great quality
products 4k 60 frames per second 4k at
30 frames per second equal in the tool
department you know seven hundred and
forty nine dollars six hundred and
ninety nine dollars like usual we'll
have a link below as well to ravpower
and to these so if you want to buy all
these for yourself or check out more
information you can do it if you're not

turn notifications so you can see us
