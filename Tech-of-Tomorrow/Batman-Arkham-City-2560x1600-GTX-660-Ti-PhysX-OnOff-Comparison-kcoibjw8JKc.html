check out the link in the description
below and keep away those pesky buggy
people
no no no no no no no Batman hey welcome
back Tech tomorrow Elric first your host
now you guys know that the new 660ti has
launched on launch day we brought to the
unboxing
and we brought to you the full review of
the gigabyte version now today we're
gonna be showing you some gameplay
comparisons with physics on and physics
off in Batman with everything running at
its most maximum extreme settings check
out the settings right here behind me
you guys can see we've got everything
anti-aliasing turned up to 32 Wow
everything said to as high as you can
get it with physics on in one video and
physics off in the next video so now
check it out as we go in and we see
Batman now this is just the regular
benchmark because we figured you guys to
prefer to see the benchmark it's more
acting to comparative and what's
probably better than you're sitting
there clicking the mouse through a game
so with that said let's go check this
out and see how much of a freaking
difference there is with physics on in
Batman Arkham City here on tech of
tomorrow
all right so they didn't you guys have
it man Batman and all of its glory 2560
by 1600 all the bells and whistles
turned up and man did you guys see the
difference between physics on and
physics off holy crap all the newspapers
flying all the stuff on the side the
flags this the motion of everything
physics make look real now with
physics off we were getting about 30
frames average per second with physics
on about 27 so I'm not really that big
of a hit right there and like I said
before you know NVIDIA doesn't really
recommend this resolution for this car
1920 by 1200 1920 by 1080 is the
recommended resolution for the 660ti but
we decide to push it farther and farther
and see where it can go you guys can see
even if this resolution with all the
bells and whistles hey it's still
playable keep watching to show you more
benchmarks and more cool stuff with the
new 660ti from Nvidia thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
