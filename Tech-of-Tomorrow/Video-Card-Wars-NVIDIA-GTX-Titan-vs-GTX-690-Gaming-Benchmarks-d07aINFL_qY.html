were fast as lightning in fact it was a
little bit frightening cuz I fought with
expert timing
so what's up guys welcome back TECA
tomorrow I'm Elric Parrish your host
we're obviously today we're bringing you
video one of the Titan from the people
at end video so you fans out there who
loved the green today's your day to see
battle one where the Titan takes on the
gtx 690 now I know some fools out there
gonna go oh hey man it's a duel card to
a single card but hey at this price
level
it don't matter baby duel single they're
up there in the expensive card range now
I just want to take note of one thing
you guys are going to be pretty trippy
about how some of these tests work
because the guy live close on a lot of
areas and we've got one test where the
Titan actually jumps ahead so with that
said let's jump in and let's begin them
ok Rumble fans first battle today
battlefield 3 who's the winner well
check it out you guys can see behind me
that we've run the scores in both 2560
by 1600 1920 by 1080 and you can see
that the 690 clearly wins by about 10
frames per second now we are running the
very latest beta driver that they have
out which runs with all cards across the
six series next up Borderlands 2 you
guys know it's some crazy shit Snoke
optical kinds of crazy stuff in this one
once again you guys can see we've tested
again in 2560 by 1600 once again in 1920
by 1080 and you guys can see that the
690 also clearly wins in this as well
next up Unigine heaven you guys all know
and love it it tests out and showcases
the features of a direct x11
we run it on its extreme features you
guys can check this out you can see the
690 is clearly winning by about 12
frames per second in this as well now
last but not the least it's the latest
game in the market and obviously NVIDIA
has taken the time to optimize the
drivers and for a change of pace here we
see the Titan beating the GTX 690 in
both 2560 by 1600 and
1920 by 1080 now it only beats it by a
hair but here you see a single card
beating dual card technology which means
that actually as Nvidia improves these
drivers and things get better you can
actually might see the Titan pull ahead
and more test now let's talk about
temperatures when we REM the fire strike
demo at its highest temperature rating
we can see that there was a two degrees
difference between the 690 and a Titan
with the 690 being two degrees hotter
which really isn't surprising since it
is a dual GPU card now that you guys
have seen what we've got right here we
actually have a lot more over on our
website we have a lot more pictures and
a lot more benchmarks of the 690 versus
the Titan so if you guys would like to
check that out it will all be in the
link in the description below
