another edition of tech o tomorrow I'm
our buddy my co-host here now in the
past you guys have constant requested
videos that were equally priced cards
many people have comments saying hey man
you know these cards are wave spread
apart why can't we have some cards that
are equally priced so we've done that
these new cards that we're checking out
today are very equally priced they're
about 169 to 179 depending on where you
buy them one is from Nvidia one is from
AMD on the AMD camp we have their
brand-new r7 370 card now this thing's
from XFX it's one of their black
editions has a couple of fans couple of
nice features pretty card on the other
side we have the EVGA now this is their
gtx 950 FTW ACX 2.0 version card which
has a lot of crazy stuff and today we're
going to take these cards in a
head-to-head battle to see who truly
wins at this price point so with that
said let's jump on let's check out the
specs the features the scores and then
at the end of the day you folks can tell
me who you think wins so check out the
cards both of these guys have two fans
they both have a black shroud so they
look very similar as far as looks go and
as far as the card sizes go you guys can
check that out right here and you guys
can see the difference between the two
but they are very similar in size as
well some main differences of people
going to talk about on the Nvidia side
we see 768 cuda cores on the AMD side we
see a thousand 24 steam processors now
both these cards have two gigabytes of
gddr5 memory with the AMD card having a
twin and 56 bit memory interface and the
Nvidia card having 128 bit memory
interface now beyond that there are some
differences the Nvidia card is seriously
clocked for over Cline yeah it's got a
1200 5 base clock or I think it's 1200 3
excuse me 1200 3 base clock and a 1400 5
boost clock the AMD card it has a
thousand 24 clocked obviously it can be
adjusted inside there make it different
but as far as our testing and everything
goes today we're gonna be testing these
things right
out-of-the-box now as far as features go
obviously the XFX version of this card
is going to have all of its own features
its own cooling solution and all that
type of stuff
the ebj card also has all that stuff as
well now II PGA's ACX 2.0 however is a
very serious cooling solution I've used
it before in the past when it first came
out a lot of people gave a controversy
but as the years have gone by they
developed and redeveloped it and it
works really really well I think at the
end of the video you guys to be
surprised at the temps obviously AMD and
NVIDIA both have their own technical
ways of coming about things in their
cars they have their own technologies
all that kind of stuff I wasn't gonna
try to bring you guys a video on all
their special features I think that you
AMD fans out there you guys know what
the ante cards do and video fans you
guys know what your cards do so with
that said though let's real quick check
out our test system now some people say
this isn't a high-end system I totally
disagree for me with all the stuff
that's coming out there I feel that this
system is pretty much in the middle of
the road we have an i7 4770k 16
gigabytes of ddr3 memory a one terabyte
Western Digital black drive we're using
Windows 7 and we're using all the latest
drivers from both AMD and NVIDIA that
are certified we don't use any of those
beta drivers we use the same stuff that
you guys can get it home to do the
testing yourself so with that said
though let's bump on in to the benchmark
song and let's see how these karts
perform head-to-head in a performance
pedal
all right folks so there you have it
you guys can see from the scores that
even though the AMD card truly looks
better on paper in the end the GTX 950
scores better and at the exact same
price point I think for my opinion you
guys are looking for the raw numbers and
the raw numbers say that this price
point the nvidia gtx 950 is the winner
now i know some people out there going
to leave some comments and say i'm crazy
or whatever so please i welcome all your
guys's comments so does buddy he'll be
answering most your guys questions this
time around so please leave your comment
if you think the AMD card won for some
reason please tell me why down below in
a very civilized manner and will reply
to you civilized no hating none of that
stuff whatsoever like usual if you guys
are interested in picking up one of
these cards to yourself all the
information will be down there below
that like button which hopefully you
guys will go cosmic crazy on so i'm
alright thanks for watching if you guys
aren't sub hey i'd love to see you guys
back here buddy the dog says peace out
and we'll see you guys back here for
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
