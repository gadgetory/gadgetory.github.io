welcome back once again to the tech Oh
tomorrow YouTube channel I know it
Ferris to your host today we're taking a
look at something brand-new from the
folks over at Apple that's right a new
phone is out the new Apple 4s is out and
this is the first world global phone
from the folks over at Apple time
they're first generation phone now a lot
of people been waiting for this phone a
long time a lot of rumor going around
who's going to be better Samsung them
well speculation is still in today I'm
just bringing you guys the unboxing and
the first look of this phone but there
are some really cool things about it
first of all it's got a 3.5 inch screen
it has a 500 contrast 800 brightness
really cool 960 by 640 resolution so you
can watch all your movies everything on
a very clear screen the camera 800
megapixel camera which has touch tap
locking focus which means that when you
go up there you're going to take your
picture I got to do is touch tap it
locks on the image and then it goes
ahead and takes the picture I think
that's really cool today we'll be
looking at the 16 gigabyte model which
means it comes with 16 gigabytes of
internal storage you also get the latest
dual-core a5 processor this is the
latest greatest thing it's out in the
market it's going to be really popular
so there's a lot of new things with this
phone now 4G oh let's talk about 4G
there is no true 4G 4G right now it's
kind of a pipe dream and I mean you
dream you're getting 4G so you keep
building next to in the mall going oh my
god it's kind of have 30 they're living
a pipe dream no such thing is true for G
now this phone does work at true 3G and
with that said you get eight hours of 3G
talktime or 12 hours of talktime if
you're using so if you're using the 2g
excuse me a lot of new stuff on this
phone so now we're going to go ahead and
just move into the unboxing I'll go
along some of the other features about
this phone it's nice interface some of
the apps that Scott and just to let you
guys know today is just the unboxing and
the first look Shane alright it will be
doing the full review over on Tekken
amara website and then after that you
guys will see my full review after I get
myself even more educated about this
phone because otherwise you guys just
beat me up so just bear with me

going to take a first look at what we've
got here
okay so now we'll go ahead and show you
what comes inside the box you can see
the outside the box got a picture the
camera on the side we got the iPhone 4s
nomenclature our little silver a pearl
here at the side and one a repetitive of
that and then the very end of it right
here it has a little thing that says I
cloud alrighty then so that's pretty
much it you guys probably can't see this
very well this is the back of the box I
need again just like to see everything
so I'm just showing you everything so
now it's actually see what comes in the
box some of the cool things also about
this phone the new video stabilization

actually got a built-in stabilizer to
help get things to stay stable which is
really cool for filming stuff so we're
go ahead and pull the thing off here you
can see the front of the camera go ahead
and move that up good and flip the
rounds also protective cover in the back
remove that you can see it's the iPhone
little thing there here's a little
camera thing right here once again oh
I'm just reading it is an 8 megapixel
camera with tap touch very interesting
technology I can't wait to take a look
at that in the full review now very
limited on the outside for your controls
it's very sleek I'd say actually elegant
you have your control buttons for your
volume you have your silence button
right here
on top you have your either headphone or
mic jack right here which can be used
for either bringing your headphones or
an external mic using the new serie
technology to Syriac technology excuse
me to record your vocals this actually
turns the phone on and off so we'll show
you guys that I'll go ahead and just
real quickly just pop the phone on you
can see right here I slide it over
that's the camera part right there as I
said before dual tap tap on the phone
locks it in I'll get to skip back out
there as I'm just doing you then
botching showing you stuff here are the
applications right here you can see the
keyboard right here very easy to access
and type on there's also a screen on
here that actually protects it from the
acid and oil it's on your fingers to
extend the life of your screen so that's
actually really cool stuff so that's
about the phone then there's more stuff
in the box let's go ahead and pop the
top up here and here all your
accessories right here you've got your
wall plug it adapter right here and then
