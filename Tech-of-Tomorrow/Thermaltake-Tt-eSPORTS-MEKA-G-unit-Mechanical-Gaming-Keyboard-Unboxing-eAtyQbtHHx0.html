YouTube it's me Eric Faris here once
again in the tech up tomorrow YouTube
channel bringing you guys yet another
unboxing of a really cool product from
the folks over at thermaltake today
we're gonna be taking a look at their
latest mechanical keyboard this is their
g-unit it's a large scale mechanical
keyboard that has lots and lots of
features the box is right behind me
right here you guys can see it says ISS
instant shift system I'm imagining this
is gonna allow you to change your macro
keys I don't know for sure cuz like
usual I just got it doing the unboxing
that's what it sounds like
then it says gaming LED backlighting
that means basically you're gonna be
able to change the backlighting on it
change the colors 60 macro keys and then
it says it has a thousand Hertz of
polling race now all these keyboards are
known to have you can hit all the keys
all at the same time in key roll over
all that stuff and that's the one thing
about these mechanical keyboards that
makes everybody want to buy them now
this one's gonna come in to market
probably about 130 140 dollars they are
pricey because they're mechanical and
they're made really well that said let's
jump in and let's do the unboxing and
first look and see what the mega G unit
is all about
alright everybody here we got it we got
the TT e-sports by Thermaltake
this is the mecca g-unit mechanical
gaming keyboard says has gaming speeds
eight times quicker armed for battle
actually this thing's so heavy
that it's not only an armed for battle
you could use it as the frickin weapon
cuz it's that heavy flip it around not
much the back of the box at all flip
around show you guys thing just says you
have normal mode game mode switchable
instant profile switch so I was
corrected as a profile switch so means
you can program it your buddy comes
along he can reprogram it or even for
different games
there's available of USB ports and audio
jacks and you have seven media hotkeys
right here on the board which means you
know you're all that stuff like you know
slow down rewind pause that stuff's all
right here on the thing also got you
WASD keys right here and a lot of the
other keys seem to be that they're able
to be changed and color-coded
that's it let's actually jump in the box
there's a little tab right here go ahead
and pull the tab another tab open the
top up here is a nice big case this will
be for you to take your keyboard if you
want to travel with it kind of how you a
stowaway your sword you stick your
keyboard in that's your weapon carrier
sling it over your back and off you go
into bottle that's right we do get a
little bag right here we'll see what's
in it and a little magic bag of tricks
right here you got going on in here ah
here we go
the power cable so you guys can see it's
modular it's a modular gaming keyboard
you can take the little plug right there
plug in the back of the keyboard and
there's your USB connection no problem
at all that's that we shall toss that
like this oh there's the keyboard the
weight here is a little thing put your
wrist on your wrist pad holder right
there I can open it up and pull it up
for you folks back in there at the home
office this was pretty thick a lot of
these things are just really thin you
guys can see this is actually a very
thick wrist pad right here very tough
very thick see here I don't know we have
some drivers and stuff like that
so we'll get to that real quick before
the keyboard a lot of different stuff in
here trying to open it up up there's a
little tab again go ahead and pull this
little tab in here kind of hard to do
without ripping it in fact yeah it seems
to be impossible I tried doing it and
that's a no-go so there we go
here inside pop that open got a sticker
two stickers actually black one in the
white one depending on what kind of case
you're using on TTS ports the G Unit
armed for battle driver disk and the
mega G unit instruction guide right here
it's all that stuff now we get to it the
keyboard
dun-dun-dun
all right kaboom right here's the
connection that's going to be if that
USB cable we showed you earlier two USB
cables right here you can plugged in for
your peripheral devices you also have
your mic and keyboard here pretty nice
sized keyboard not too thick not too
thin show you guys the side view nice
red stripe the whole color theme while
these thermal take products is the red
and black show you guys that now here's
the keyboard itself this little light up
here when we plug it in that's going to
light up now there are a few things
about this keyboard that are different
than a normal keyboard first of all the
control button is kind of a little bit
small and the question mark buttons in a
different place than most keyboards now
if you're a gamer this probably is not
going to mean jack to you but if
you do a lot of typing this may be an
issue but everything else about this
thing's very clicking if you like the
clickety clack mechanical keyboards I
prefer these type of keyboards they have
a much more natural feel to them I feel
them more responsive and for typing I
just I don't know I prefer them a
thousand times over the regular old
membrane type keyboards now the last
thing I want to do for you guys is I'm
going to take this plug over here let me
talked about earlier and I'm gonna go
ahead and actually plug it into my
system currently I have this keyboard
this is my throw we'll take normal
mechanical gaming keyboard I'm going to
now unplug that one from the system you
guys can hear it my system recognized
that I unplugged it I'm now going to
plug this one in you love that the magic
of the force you can hear that we're
gonna plug the keyboard in like we sit
in the back here boom the keyboard
lights up
I don't know if this light lights up
when you install drivers right now I'm
not getting in those and actually uh you
know Cameron go ahead and hit the light
over there and didn't the lights out
might just see what this thing looks
like and see what it looks like in the
dark
I guess is what they were showing us
earlier all of these keys actually
remain lit up for the entirety every
when you're using it now we're seeing
the TT light come on as well so it came
on and off you can see it's kind of
basically blinking alright folks so you
guys saw it here you guys saw it here
first
this is the new thermal tape TT eSports
this is the new mecca g-unit gaming
keyboard you guys saw it it's nice it
lights up
I mean hey if you like mechanical
keyboards it's going to be the if
you got a problem with where the control
key is or where the memory function keys
you might want to look elsewhere me I
want to use this for strictly gaming so
I could give a crap but those are things
want to point them out thanks see you
guys back here on tech of tomorrow today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
