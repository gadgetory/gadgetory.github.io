again to the channel I'm Eric and today
we're going to talk to you guys about
something that you guys have seen kind
of on the end of our videos here and
there we've been mentioning it okay
we're going to actually show you just
what the heck cam is what it does and
why it's absolutely cool software for
those are totally anal about being able
control their PC from anywhere if your
PC enthusiast and you like a lot of
programs on for one and don't want to
spend a penny let's check out cam so the
first step in using cam is going online
and downloading cam all you have to do
is going to new search engine simply
type in NZXT cam after you click on the
link you'll be taken over the NZXT site
where it simply asks you to download now
and then it's going to ask you to create
an account now don't freak out this is
only so that you can monitor your
computer from any mobile device and
after you download the cam software you
simply click on the icon install the
software click on the icon on the screen
will you be prompted to enter your
account information and voila cam is up
and running as soon as you open up cam
you're automatically in the dashboard
area and you can actually make it
fullscreen but when it's full screen it
gives you just a whole lot of options
you guys can see up in glass come a
corner I have minute hour day week
it totally keeps track of what your
computer's doing all the things about
your CPU temperatures your motherboard
all this stuff is in here if you want
this full screen but I find it when it's
in it's just original form it's a lot
easier to use for most things on the
very first time that you open up cam you
can also go over here to the little eye
next to the CPU and if you hover your
mouse over that it will show you your
idle and load temps on the right you see
the GPU setting you will also see the
cam shows you the type of GPU and CPU
that you're running it also shows you
how much memory you have installed and
how much load there is on your memory
and download the RAM you guys can
currently see all the programs that are
running in the background to the right
you see the different storage devices
how much space is free how much space is
used the C Drive is my personal boot
drive it's an intel SSD and I have a
Western Digital hard drive which is my X
Drive and that's what I use to store all
my games
now down below that is the hue lighting
control you can see there's two
different channels and each channel
controls two strips of lights will be
totally talking about that later but
it's really interesting and the lights
are really cool-looking now the view
that we're seeing here this is the basic
view but there's also two different
views as well there's the advanced view
which I've clicked on now which you guys
can see shows a bunch of different
graphs shows all the different heat
variances that's going on in your system
and then last but not least we have the
expanded view and this allows you to
pull another window up and has even more
information about what's going on with
your system in great great detail now
the stat screen it actually offers a lot
of information it has all the different
variances for the different things
operating within your system starting at
the top you see the CPU and all the
different temps there and as you scroll
down you see the GPU the motherboard the
RAM your hard drive and even things for
your network and this includes both the
upload speeds and download speeds of
your internet and then next let's check
out specs obviously these are the specs
of the system as I scroll down you'll
see it shows everything that's inside
the system from your CPU to your GPU to
your motherboard to your RAM to your
hard drive everything's there and if
you're one of those people who wants to
know all the different apps they're
using what it does they even have a
window for the top apps and another
useful thing is the ability to monitor
what you want when you want via a
drop-down window you just simply click
on the plus sign to expand any window
you want to see so let's pop out of the
expanded window let's go check out the
Advanced tab now as we go into the
Advanced tab this is the area of this
software that is for the people out
there who are crazy
Anil I want to know everything that's
going on about every aspect of their
system and what's really cool is that
you can actually monitor two different
things at once by your choice you can
either monitor your GPU and your CPU or
you can monitor your motherboard and
your GPU or you can monitor your RAM you
guys know what I'm going with this now
going into the CPU tab this is where you
can monitor all your cores and what's
crazy is that you can monitor by the mid
by the hour by the day or by the week
and you can also monitor even a
single-core at a time simply by placing
your mouse over it and clicking and as
we click on the minute tab and hover our
mouse over the graph you guys can see
all the idle and load tabs down to the
second as you scroll it and all the
informations right there to the right in
that little window crazy and you can
also monitor in real time your current
CPU status and CPU load in the window I
currently have open I'm monitoring the
CPU and GPU and the GPU can be monitor
in all the same ways as the CPU by
minute by hour by day by week and
everything shows you the same idle and
load temps now going into the
motherboard tab you guys can see that
you can monitor your voltage your
temperature and your fans and as we
click into the RAM tab you can see it's
pretty much the same thing as the GPU
and CPU monitoring with the RAM status
and RAM load located to the far right
and clicking on the HDD tab you can
first see there's a little drop-down
menu over here this will show you the
different drives that you have installed
in your system it'll also show you the
firmware the start time and the time
that you powered on your drives there
are also various different aspects of
monitoring in the hard drive section and
you guys can see all those as I scroll
through them and last but not least as
you click on the net tab you can see
that you get the same features for
monitoring the minute the hour the day
and the week the only differences are on
the far right-hand screen your upload
activity and your download activity so
that's the Advanced tab you guys can see
it is really thorough and what it
monitors but now let's go and let's
check out the build tab now inside of
the build tab obviously you're going to
get things about your build and the
different types of parts you're using
but this thing gets very very in-depth
it'll show you your model your chipset
what your Southbridge is what your BIOS
is what even your BIOS date is so if the
BIOS is really old it might be time to
looking to update that BIOS and once
again shows you everything about your
memory who makes it what's its default
frequencies the type of memory it is its
timing it shows you your video cards
maximum TDP the default clock speeds the
turbo clock and its shaders and last it
shows you all the information about your
drives which we previously saw in the
tab and the last function inside of the
build tab is this other little tab over
here called the edit your PC and inside
of that tab on the top you can see this
little thing it says upload PC image
this is for your avatar and you can put
whatever you want in there you can also
change your computer name and lastly you
can import a PC parts picker link if you
want to check out stuff like that next
up is the games tab as we click in there
it'll show your most recent gaming
section and just like the other
monitoring features you had we were
looking at the advanced window you can
monitor the different frames per second
at different times playing the game
simply by hovering over the graph and
moving it to the left where you guys can
see in the screen to the right it shows
you all the different frames per second
of the different times of your gameplay
and then down below that you guys can
see your most recent game sessions you
just simply click on them and/or bring
the information up on the screen for you
let's real quick go back to the
dashboard on the top of the dashboard
the first feature you'll see as I hover
my mouse over is the day-night function
the day/night button actually gives you
a whole new look to your cam GUI you
just click on the moon and boom you'll
also see the little camera up here this
is for taking a screenshot of what's
currently on your dashboard next up is
the notification window I guess nobody
loves me because I got no new
notifications and last up is the
Settings tab as you click on that you'll
see a drop down menu comes down you can
change your settings you can switch to
mini cam install and zxe drivers there's
also a tutorial all the different things
about cam you can report a bug or you
can log out now let's real quick let's
switch to the mini cam oh it's a cute
way little cam the only caveat to this
tab is you can only monitor your
temperatures and some features of the
hue let's get back to the regular window
shall we alright so now let's real quick
check out the settings click on the tab
the first thing that you guys see is you
can manage your account online this
allows you to change your name your
password all that different stuff next
is the general tab and inside the
general tab you can change a bunch of
different things as well you can change
your banner change the language change
the color change your boot options your
temperature options all those good
things next up is the frames per second
overlay
tab now inside it here you guys will see
there's a button right up here on top
that says enable cam overlay if you guys
don't want this to come on when you're
playing games you simply click that off
and it won't be in your game but if you
want it to be in your game and you want
to monitor stuff you simply click on
that button now to show the different
stuff that you're wanting to be
monitored you simply click on it or
unclick it depending on what you want
you can also change your font your font
color your font size and you can also
have the font scale to match with your
resolution you can also change where the
overlay position is from top left bottom
left top right bottom right you can even
change the path the shortcut keys which
allow you to toggle the overlay in-game
so as you guys can see if you like
having the cam overlay in-game you can
keep it up and monitor everything while
you're playing which is pretty cool for
some people but if you want it off you
can take it off as well and if you don't
like where it's at you can move it
around to any corner you want alright
and so the last tab is the notifications
tab now inside of the notifications tab
you can set up notifications for your
CPU for your GPU or your HDD you can
also disable them if you don't want to
use them at all and last but not least
is the hue tab cam completely controls
the hue system but that's for another
video now the best thing about cam and I
think all enthusiasts will agree is the
ability to be able to monitor your
system and know what's going on through
your mobile device now this could be
simply done by downloading installing
the cam app then you can monitor all the
same functions and features just like
you're there in front of your computer
you can monitor your CPU your GPU your
hard drive your net and your RAM all
from the simplicity of your mobile
device
you can even use the graph mode if you
want more in-depth monitoring of your
system it'll even show you the specs of
your system and has an advanced mode for
even more monitoring options and pretty
much all the things that you can monitor
and do for the cam desktop you can do
the mobile app as well and that's just
pretty cool overall so that's it man cam
in a nutshell and if you guys want to be
able to win a free copy of cam make sure
you guys check out that link down below
just playing with you can for
freak-tivity
they're already given it to you but
check it out we will have another video
though completely based on the key
lighting system how cool it looks the
goods and the bads and all that stuff
about it coming up in one of our next
videos so you guys like this stuff about
cam let me know down below want to see
all your comments but if you want to go
ahead and download this for free hey
check out that link you guys can do it I
think it has a lot of cool features it's
like one program with a lot of different
functionality man but I want to hear
what you guys have to say and please
don't just leave a comment if you've
never even tried it at least try it and
then give a comment back in or just say
oh no it's sucks bah bah bah that's not
really a valid thing it's free so
there's no harm in trying it it's not
going to mess your system up or anything
like that I think the worst comment I've
heard from anybody is that they said in
a couple of games they thought that was
having a problem with their games but
that's like the absolute worst and like
they never came back so it probably
fixed itself with all the new cam
release stuff but that's it man thanks
for watching well we'll hold another
video on here but totally badass build
with the cam lighting featuring you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
