better for holiday stuff well than a
traditional unboxing a really cool
product now this thing's by the people
over at Corsair and this is the RM 750 X
which means its own I guess we know
certified for the x-men now this thing's
pretty cool it's 80 certified gold maybe
plus certified gold so you know that's
got a high standard it's also as
Japanese capacitors in it that feature
105 Celsius capacity which means these
things can get really hot and still run
really good so basically everything
inside of this power supply is made
really well so let's do kind of a little
traditional / untraditional unboxing and
check this thing out so I'm gonna hold
the box up for you guys what the Cameron
breeze readjust we'll go real old-school
on it so you guys can see the front of
the box real quick and I'll just show
you guys the box up here in the air
different than we've done in the past so
here's the front of the box for those
who really care whoop here's the back of
the box thing actually weighs quite a
bit on the side shows you what kind of
connectors we have and then once again
on the other side we just see more
information so it's gonna be a little
different camera is not going to be able
to focus on the box while I'm doing the
whole unboxing cuz it's going to be a
little different so I'm going to go
ahead and just pop the cap here though
and you guys can see there's a box once
again inside of a box it's kind of the
theme everybody puts a box inside a box
for protection so go ahead and get this
one out of here and let's see here
what's it like to be in a 4k phone at
the camera in here come you guys heard
he blocks it he thinks he's like some
kind of goalie at a hockey game or
something take it like a man we'll see
all right so once again we have a box
yada-yada gonna go ahead and pop the cap
here where the snaptun at the done fit
into the all right let's hear what's the
best angle alright so here we go it's
going to be like a monster dun dun dun
dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun so
what we got in here on the top we've got
all their rmx series I guess this manual
covers them all no matter what your
power supply no matter what the power
you seek the manual is here this is the
manual you're looking for for you Star
Wars
let's see here uh warranty guide it's in
there as well yeah what else we got
power cable big-ass sucker - this is no
cheesy one this one's big thick solid
ready to handle your power all right
then we got okay in here we got the case
badge all different types of screws for
doing different things with your power
supply they're all right here there's
also um sorry excuse me I'm getting old
and blind these are things for cable
management these are little zip ties
sorry about that and there are some
screws in here as well so it's a mixture
of both
you want to miss that then we have all
of these cables and let's real quick
talk about the power supply and these
cables now as far as the connections go
you get a single 24 pin ATX cable you
get a single 8 pin ATX 12 volt cable
there are two eight pin 6 plus two PCI
cables with a total of 4 connections
there are also three SATA cables with a
total of nine connections there are 2 4
pin peripheral cables with a total of 8
connections and a single 4 pin floppy
drive adapter and the cool thing is it
comes with this bag so you can use all
the cables you want the ones you don't
want you can just stick back here and
you don't have to use them so let's move
past that let me once again just grab
the box down here take this up out here
all right so here we go moving on inside
of a nice velvet bag which you guys can
use this for something else once the
power supply is that it'll hold my stuff
in it you don't have to keep your
evening in there once you use it so
we'll take out the black bag and like
magic we get the power supply as things
completely modular I do mean all the way
modular everything that's modular know
hooked up power cable no nothing so on
the top we see the courser name once
again we see the RM 750 X that's a
nomenclature nothing new there we'll
flip it around to the back you guys can
see where the power cable goes in and
there is a nice on and off switch for
this power supply both sides of the
power supply contain the name and once
again the nomenclature of the power
supply and on the bottom we see a single
fan for keeping that power supply at
running cool and lastly on the back side
you can see where everything hooks up on
the top you have your peripheral and
SATA connections next to that you have
pcie and cpu on the bottom your
peripheral and SATA and then finally
your 24-pin ATX connection the bottom
line is if you need a nice power supply
and you don't want one that's like
completely over the top this is a really
solid one to take a look at it's pretty
well priced and you can hook up a lot of
SLI and CrossFireX connections with it
now you're not going to be able do any
like super Quad SLI stuff or anything
like that but if you're using two cards
and you have a pretty much general
mainline system you're going to be fine
that these things are pretty nice like I
said this thing is made of great
Japanese capacitors all the components
that are high in so it should last you a
long time especially being that it's 80
plus gold not a whole lot to say about a
power supply I mean it does its job and
you folks out there know about these
power supplies there's all kinds of
great ratings across the world about
them so what else they're really for me
to tell you guys it's the unboxing and
here it is and next I'll be building a
system with it though yeah so thanks for
checking out the channel all the
information for this will be down below
so if you guys want to check out one for
yourself and buy one hey we'll have that
information down there below hope you
like the video um it's the holiday
season so we're trying to keep it kind
of light but it's not too light actually
it weighs quite a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
