horizon this time from AMD
today AMD announced seven brand-new SKUs
that will be released to the market but
Before we jump in and we talk about all
these new CPUs let's hear a word from
today's sponsor 0 &amp;amp; 9 it's about that
time again folks back-to-school season
is upon us and if you're a student on a
budget then 0 &amp;amp; 9 has got you covered
right now you can get Microsoft Office
2016 for under $25 including Word Excel
PowerPoint and more Microsoft Office has
everything you need to keep your perfect
GPA and with a special coupon code for
our fans you can save 10% off your order
so if you need office and want to keep
your grades in check just use the code
TTM m at checkout and start saving today
all right so if you're looking for an
office key on the cheap there you have
it now like I said AMD has just
announced seven new SKUs of their cpu
line the first up is their brand new 200
GE they also have a 220 GE and a 240 GE
but for some reason this particular
information hasn't hit the market yet
now AMD's time that the big things about
this CPU is it's gonna be much faster
than their previous generation CPU in
this type of category okay that's kind
of a no-brainer on it's kind of
expecting that I wasn't really expecting
it to be slower you're not gonna come up
with advertisement say hey our CPU
slower than the last one buy it
obviously so that right there is kind of
a no-brainer I did expect it to be
faster now the big thing is those are
saying it's going to be about 84 percent
faster though in gaming which is good
news which means that basically you know
an Intel processor with their onboard
graphics the onboard graphics on this
particular CPU line is probably going to
be much better and play better games now
these new GE CPUs feature Zen core
technology and Vega technology all on
one die now they call this
system-on-chip technology and I don't
know if it's new but it kind of sounds
reasonable because you're putting a chip
onto a chip right you're having the
graphics right on there now this
particular CPU the 200 GE how
is very low priced coming to market at
$55 really low price that's seriously
entry-level money for PC stuff now
unfortunately though it only has two
cores for threads it has three graphic
compute units and it's 3.2 gigahertz so
I mean it's not really slow and I mean
obviously for some older games and stuff
that don't take advantage of you know
multi-core technology you might actually
get some really good gaming experience
playing the older games for a fact now
in addition to the first three SKUs that
we just talked about which are very
entry level and honestly at the price
and the performance that they're touting
it should be a very good deal left to
see when they actually get it how they
test but honestly for that price point
it seems like they're gonna get a good
market share of buyers because it's just
honestly really cheap and it looks like
it's going to have good performance now
there's also four other SKUs being
released and the first one's kind of
weird because it's an Athlon pro right
it's still a two hundred GE but it's an
Athlon Pro GE now everyone I don't even
know what you guys would say but I hear
the name Athol and I feel like we're in
a car we're gonna reverse or just
peeling out going backwards and reverse
because Athlon to me like speaks of like
you know the previous days and having
the CPU with the same type of name 200
GE so we have a pro version a non pro
version might be a little bit confusing
to some people but the specs are pretty
much identical other than the five
megabytes of cache it's still you know
two cores four threads three points two
gigahertz 35 watts of TDP so I mean it's
pretty much the identical chip just with
a pro thing tapped onto it now what the
price exactly is on this they haven't
announced it and what the performance is
going to be you know is it's gonna be
really that much better than the other
version I don't know we'll have to see
when it gets here now the next CPU is
the 2700 X now this is the new rise in
Pro 2700 X now this features 8 cores 16
threads a hundred and five watts of TDP
and a twenty megabyte cache so all in
all really nice CPU now right underneath
it though is the 2700 now this to me
seems like the really sweet spot about
everything because it still has eight
cores
16 threads 65 watts of TDP so the power
requirements much law which for you know
people like to overclock and stuff
that's gonna come across really really
well in fact you're probably hear people
saying just buy the 2700 and overclock
it because obviously with that low of
power you've got a lot of room to work
with to overclock that CPU and since
it's pretty much identical I mean it
really is now they're really only two
differences between these two CPUs is
that on the 2700 X it's 3.6 for the base
and then 4.1 for the boost and on the
2700 the base clock is 3.2 and the boost
clock is 4.1 so they're really almost
identical and since the CPUs probably
going to be running it's boosted mode
most of the time the 2700 to me sounds
like it is the really sweet spot now and
last but not least we see the rise in 5
pro 2600 now this particular CPU has 6
cores 12 threads only 19 megabytes of
cache which is a little kind of crazy
right there
this particular CPU has a base clock
speed of 3.4 and a boost of 3.9 and we
still see 65 watts of TDP so all in all
all of these CPUs sound like they have
potential now AMD is obviously saying
that you know these CPUs are gonna be
faster than the competition you know we
always hear that I always wait until we
actually see the results in-house
because you guys all know that everybody
hypes their product up that's just how
things are the computer industry it's
like we've discovered go we've
reinvented the wheel we've discovered a
new religion I mean it's almost like
that all the time in the PC industry
everybody just hype stuff up but looking
at a CPU the 200 GE that's coming to
mark it's only gonna be 55 dollars if
you're building any kind of computer
just for surfing the net even like
gaming and all that kind of stuff
55 watts you can get a motherboard for
probably around $80 and you can get some
cheaper memory so the only thing really
a building assistant that's gonna cost
any money at that point would really be
getting the memory since memory prices
are kind of high beyond that you can
build yourself a really really really
cheap system I mean only 55 watts of
power drains the dog shaking in the
background by the way Furman with that
particular sound it's he's giving us the
flea shake or something you know but
that's what that was you can build a
really cheap system which means you can
probably get a case with even a built-in
power supply I know people are gonna go
my god those suck Eric I know but if
you're building something really cheap
for somebody that's just you know they
don't have a lot of money and they want
to get an entry-level system hey man
that 200 GE combined with lower in parts
can be a great bill now how the other
you know processes are gonna pan out I
don't know personally from what I'm
looking at though I feel that the 2700
is like the perfect out of all of them
it's that perfect spot in between
everything else the 65 watts of TDP vs.
105 TDP to me that's a big difference
and gives a lot of room for overclocking
and if you've no one overclocking you
just want to have the system running
really really cool the nice liquid
cooler hey the lower your power draw the
cooler that CPU is going to run now I
don't know exactly when I'll see these
CPUs in the house I'll try to get them
here as soon as possible as you can
bring you guys the testing but they
announced them today they're coming to
market so if you're an AMD fan
especially there's good news on the
horizon and the numbers they're looking
good for more information we'll have a
link down below if you want to get
yourself a cheap office key hey you can
do that as well
peace out we'll see you back here on the
channel for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
