you a rockin episode here on tech of
tomorrow we're gonna show you guys a
really cool amp from a company called
Panama now these guys are based actually
at the bottom of a volcano in Panama and
all of the woods that they use are all
very very unique very exotic woods they
don't use just your standard
run-of-the-mill stuff all of the amps
are boutique hand-built dams that are
made their Factory in Panama and today
we're going to be checking out the
fillet go hot rod 18 watt amp and this
particular ramp is really made to be
versatile now a lot of times a lot of
guitar players including myself I look
at an amp it's only 18 watts and I'm
like oh man it's not really gonna have
like the cojones that I want it to have
you know I mean it's not gonna have that
really low end you know brow that you
really get with those higher end tubes
well this particular amp has actually
been completely redesigned so that even
though you're only having 18 watts it
still has that bottom end like a hundred
watt amps it's pretty crazy
now this particular amp features three
different channels there's a clean child
that offers you two different types of
things in the clean channel you have a
bright mode then you have a mode that's
just game and then you also have a high
gain mode now on the two different
channels you can actually make a lot of
different sounds now in the particular
clean channel you can go all the way
from pristine cleans to all the way to
driving up to where you're getting like
ac/dc type sounds and on the main drive
channel the overdrive Channel that's
really built to sound like the early
Eddie Van Halen amps so if you're
looking for that early you know Jose or
the Cameron Brown sound this particular
amp really kind of meets that mark and
in fact as I've been playing around but
I've noticed you can get a lot of
different tones just from the amp alone
with that any type of pedals whatsoever
and the amp
also does work really well with bells
will forget into as we go further into
the review now on the front of the amp
you can see all the controls are really
easily laid out every different channel
has its own base its own trouble its own
mid-range you share a couple of other
features between the two channels
you can change the way the drive is the
way the game is literally a lot of
different things that you can do now on
the intro that you heard that was me on
the dirty channeled the game Channel and
I have it actually in its high game mode
and I had the middle knob turned right
to 12 o'clock I had the treble turned to
about one o'clock and I have the bass
pretty much all the way buried as far as
it'll go because that's just how I like
my particular sound especially on this
particular amp so let's go in real quick
now let's take a real close up of the
amp what it's made of and those type of
things and then we'll get in to the
tones take a look at the front of the
amp you guys can see it this thing just
looks really nice it's not your
run-of-the-mill thing at all the cab is
very well made I really like the red and
black and the spalted maple front just
looks really nice and the Panama logo
also fits just perfectly on there now if
you're wondering hey man how big is this
particular amp they lurk well it's 18 by
9 by 10 inches and it weighs 20 pounds
but the cool thing about it is it
actually comes with a five-year warranty
now starting off the left-hand side you
guys can see there's the input jack this
is where you put your quarter inch plug
for your guitar now another thing you're
gonna notice is that most of the
controls for this amp are the same on
both the clean channel and on the gain
Channel you get your gain your treble
your middle then you also get your bass
and then you get your volume now there's
one thing about both of these channels
that they share and underneath the
little brightness switch this is the
presence control if you guys know what
the presence is it kind of adds a little
bit of treble to your mix now the
brightness button that's right above
that that's for actually changing how
bright the clean channel is now you're
gonna notice that in between both of
these sections you have a couple
different buttons that change it from
clean to drive and then on the drive
channel you have high or low gain so on
your clean channel you can run it all
the way completely pristine clean or you
can give it a little bit of Drive and
crank that gain up and get that ac/dc
type sound now if you're looking for
like high gain stuff you're looking for
like Van Halen all the you know early
eighties bands that's all gonna be done
over on the game Channel and you can
change that like I said from a high gain
or too low gain
now this particular amp I don't think
does like new metal and stuff like that
but if you're do
iron maiden ringing that type of stuff
this app is definitely gonna be able to
hold its weight now underneath the gain
control knobs you're gonna notice
there's a little button now this is for
your selectable tone stack frequency on
your gain channel it changes the range
from vintage or to modern now taking a
look at the back of the amp
you guys can actually see the tubes
clearly through the back of the amp now
on both sides of the amps you see the
two separate transformers to the far
left you see the two el84 tubes then you
see the three different preamp tubes
there's a single EC 83 and two 12ax7
tubes to the far left of the amp is the
power connected then we have the foot
switch and then you're gonna see the
speaker output now this particular amp
does all the way from 4 ohms all the way
up to 16 ohms so no matter what kind of
cab you have this particular app is
gonna work with it because 4 ohm 8 ohm
and 16 ohms those are the standards now
you also have a standard effects loop
plus you have a pre in and pre out so if
you like running your effects in an
effects loop and also like running pries
at the same time you can do this with
this app making it very flexible so
those are the basic specs of the amp and
what the amp looks like now one thing i
really want to point out about this
particular amp is that you can actually
change the tubes in this amp and i mean
the power section to different tubes now
it does require that you send it to
technician so they can make an
adjustment to the amp but if you want to
make this amp an even more powerful amp
you can change out those el84 tubes and
actually increase the power of the amp
and take it from you know what it is
that 18 watts all the way up to a higher
power amp so that's actually something
pretty cool so now we're gonna go into
the sound demos and what we're gonna
show you today is strictly the amp
itself i'll show you a couple of
different things on dirty channel and a
couple different things on doing clean
stuff and you guys obviously know
there's gonna be a lot of flexibility so
for me to go over every single solitary
different tone thing about this amp we'd
be here all day long the main thing that
you guys really want to know is the
flexibility between the different sounds
of the amp that's really what's most
important and I know a lot of guys they
just bring a video to you or they're
just they they show them playing
something and they show the drums and
then they really don't talk about the
amp and they consider that really a
review I don't know if that's really a
review maybe you want mic you want to
call it a sound demo but everything that
we're bringing you guys today
I am not using any type of patches any
type of filters anything unless I'm
telling you so so we're gonna start off
right now we're gonna bring you guys
some stuff in the clean channel then
we'll bring you guys some stuff in the
dirty Channel with a couple of different
things going on so you guys can hear how
it sounds we're using an sm57 microphone
we're going into my iMac and we're using
Logic Pro and that is all there is in
the channel so it's the amp to the cab
to the mic into the DA into the
recording with no BS and we're not
adding anything to it no effects so what
that said though let's jump in and let's
check out those tones on the hot rod and
here we listen to a little ditty played
on the clean Channel let's check it out
in this next particular set of sound
demos I'm gonna be doing something a
little bit different first of all I'm
using my bugera power soak and if you
guys don't know what that is it's a
power attenuator it makes it so that you
can turn your amps volume all the way to
its maximum so you're getting the best
tube soap that you can get but you can
also play at a living room volume so
right now we're gonna show you the game
Channel we're gonna show you it in a
couple of different ways we're going to
show it to you with everything set at
its 12 o'clock position and we're also
going to be showing you guys this in
both the modern and the vintage game so
when the switches to the left
it's the vintage when the switches to
the right it's in the modern
then I'm going to show you guys how I
use the amp which is I prefer to have
both the bass and the treble turn up to
full blast and leaving the mids in the
middle
and then last but not least we're going
to show you guys what it sounds like
with that scoop mids ATS type sound
I know some people wonder hey how does
this particular ramp sound in a mix and
I have to say that inside of a mix it
sounds really nice although what you're
going to be hearing now is with all of
the effects and everything turned on and
also I eacute it so it's a lot more
trouble than you're hearing directly out
of the amp
alright so there you guys have it the
Panama bow a go hot rod an 18 watt
little boutique amp um
actually right now I'm kind of blown
away I saw that on this company called
reverb I'll have a link down below they
have one of these amps on sale right now
for like 420 bucks
normally easy things are like in the six
and seven hundred dollar range but they
actually have a couple that are four
hundred and twenty dollars right now so
we'll have a link down below
now this amp is kind of unique in some
ways because like I said it is
completely built out of very very nice
tone woods you guys can see on the front
here it's just really really nice this
is a mango type of wood
who's the root of a mango and a building
an app you know I mean it looks really
nice the tones that you can get out of
it are definitely a little bit different
than your standard run-of-the-mill amp
now what I say this is like the absolute
best amp in its price range I couldn't
say that I'd say this amp is probably a
BM there are some amps that I've tried
before that I really didn't like
whatsoever some that I really thought
were really great I think this amp sits
right in between all of those other
ramps for the price level especially if
you can get this amp perform 20 bucks
it's literally a steal if you're having
to pay $6.99 $700 maybe not so much but
check this out
Panama is really cool too um reverb is a
really good place to get the Panama amps
because you can make these guys offers
they even have some on eBay as well and
if you guys make Panama a decent offer
they're liable to just accept your offer
and let you have the amp because they're
really right now into getting the name
out there and getting the amps in the
hands of the musicians out there so they
can play these amps and just know what
they're all about
overall I'd have to say that I give this
amp an 8 out of 10 it's a really nice
amp um
me personally I kind of like that
there's you know reverb inside of an app
this app doesn't have any type of stuff
like that but you know with the effects
loop and everything else that you can do
with it and the way the pedals sound
inside of the amp I definitely think
it's something solid you should check
out so if you're looking for an amp
that's very portable that's very
original looking and something that
really not a lot of people have this
might be something that you want to
check at him by the way throughout this
entire video
we've been using one of their scarlet
cabs now this particular cab I have down
here this cab has 2 D 3 speakers in it
these are kind of like European 30
speakers but the really think ool about
this particular cab is not only is it
book matched and you know totally
matches the amp head completely it also
has a feature on it where you don't have
to worry about playing super loud in
your house that's right it's got a
built-in attenuator inside of this
particular speaker which makes it really
interesting so that means you can crank
up the volume on your amp use the
attenuator and see how it sounds so
we'll bring you guys a separate amp of
just the cab itself so you can check
that out today we really want to just
focus on the head and let you guys see
it but just to know what we were playing
through hey it was one of their matching
cabs now like usual with every video I
will have links down below for all the
different stuff so if you want to check
out more information see more vids
there's a lot of guys out there doing
vids on these things right now I think
you'll be pretty impressed with what
you're seeing so if you want something
original something that's not totally
run-of-the-mill check out Panama amps
I'm at work you guys been watching taken
tomorrow we'll see you guys back in the
channel cuz we got lots of more stuff
coming here on the channel peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
