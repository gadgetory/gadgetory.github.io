Alaric Faris here once again on tech of
tomorrow continuing on our gtx 660ti sli
adventure that's right
yesterday if you guys missed it we
showed you guys dirt 3 today we're
bringing you max payne 3 a lot of threes
out there so what this is is we have the
EVGA card the SC addition and the PNY
version put together in sli mode you
guys can see a picture our test station
right here now we're going to go through
and show you all the settings of Max
Payne 3 as you can see we have
everything set to its highest maximum
value we've kept the resolution at 1920
by 1080 per your guys's request that's
right you guys asked for it we listen so
here it is so with that said now let's
jump in I'm playing arcade mode level 1
and I actually do pretty damn good this
time so let's jump in and do some
freaking killin in kill time let's go
that was the boss lady only this time
she wasn't calling for more liquor
she was out on one of the balconies
might have been stupidity talking both
acting insane risks trying to save fall
now to run recon I don't know
fine
I imagine the elevator doors opening to
a firing squad of muscles far as I can
see the one thing my plan had gone was
that no one else would be stupid enough
to pull this
dragging Bronco along would slow them
down but not much
it looked like they were taking him out
through the base maybe I still had a
shot
Rodrigo was too rich prize in the throw
away I'm sure I have more Carly came
back by the bad guys more than four
survived
they weren't far ahead once I opened the
door I'd actually have to come up with a
plan
great thing about being famous as well
as Richie there guys know that kidnapped
another parking lot rattling with
gunfire
it's gonna be alright
yeah I could ask that uh now you know
y'all shit talkers gotta shut up now cuz
like I did some serious killin in there
I got a really good score and kicked
some serious butt right there in arcade
mode I thought I did pretty damn good
man so hope you guys liked it you guys
can see it's actually ripping and
tearing through this game at 1920 by
1080 which is where these cards are
really meant to be anyways you can see
that these cards in SLI tear a hole
through Max Payne 3 we'll see you guys
back here in TECO tomorrow for more tech
