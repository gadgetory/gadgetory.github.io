YouTube land l/r affairs editor in chief
over at the tech of tomorrow YouTube
channel well the people of art Apple
they've released the new IMAX they come
out new 21 and 27 inch models but today
we're gonna be focusing on the
introduction to the 27 inch models now
the 27 inch models that you start off at
$1,900 they have an i5 2500 k CP u in
them now the i5 does not support hyper
threading it supports turbo boost but no
hyper threading now some people don't
know what hyper threading is hyper 13
takes the for real cords that are on
your GPU your CPU rather and gives you
an A for additional and virtual this
adds for accessing your programs and
learning your programs much faster now
the model that you're going to get right
at a box for $1,900 it has a 69 70 M
video card on board with one gigabyte of
video memory one of the really cool
things about this is this features
Intel's new z68 chipset the z68 for the
Pentium crowd and for the Intel crowd
isn't even out yet it comes out this
coming Wednesday so it's a little bit
early now some of the really big
features about this that you're gonna
see is the new Thunderbolt technology it
offers two ports they're twice as fast
as a USB 3.0 device that you get under
standard PC now all these models come
out of the box you get a a one terabyte
Western Digital caviar drive that's a
really good thing it's really fast keeps
all of your stuff going in you've got
standard audio onboard but you do have a
digital connection for using SP IDF
device if you want to use digital
speakers now the model that we're
looking at behind me though this has
been upgraded this is actually the new
3.4 gigahertz model it's about $2,200
now this one behind me this one actually
has hyper 3 the new 3.4 gigahertz CPU is
the 2600 K by Intel now if we add
overclocking we could actually overclock
very well right on a Mac now this might
be something that might be touched upon
because in the Intel world the 2600 K
comes with great onboard graphics and
you can overclock the living out of
it so this is the bad boy right behind
me 27 inch screen 2560 by 1440 standard
resolution everything looks really great
the only drawback to mac monitors is
that the refresh rate is only at 12
milliseconds you know for gaming and
stuff like that it's going to be about
five but for general things it's really
good but now that you can take the 6970
you can actually upgrade it to two
gigabytes that's four using multi
monitor technology you could actually
have two these monitors sitting
side-by-side in our recording studio
this is something that we're seriously
considering there's an extra things
would be really cool that we're gonna
have to these nice monitors so look at
everything that we're doing what about
thinking of all of our tracks the other
could have the actual program we're
looking at now for you guys out there in
the PC world I know you guys are really
mad about Mac's but Mac's do have their
place here in our recording studio
having an iMac and a Mac Pro makes all
the difference even people that are
using the new Pro Tools 9 are still
using Mac's max just run that type of
stuff much better and there's new final
cut coming out in a few days and that's
also going to be running great on these
new Macs so let's just basically go over
the specs once again the entry-level is
and basically is an i-5 to 2500 K does
not have hyper threading you get a 1
terabyte hard drive from Western Digital
you get 4 gigabytes of ddr3 memory
upgradable to 16 gigabytes through Apple
and through other companies like Go WC
up to 32 gigabytes you get your standard
firewire plus you get the new
thunderbolt ports which are going to be
twice as fast as USB 3.0 ports upgrade
ability is pretty cool you're very
flexible also with some new generation
ones that are becoming out in the future
here they're going to have the new SSD
technology where you can use an SSD
drive internally to cache all of your
programs now there's been a lot of
confusion about this so I want to
explain this
this new caching is not really for your
OS what this caching is going to do is
all your favorite program that you run
out there they're going to be driven
onto this Drive so when you go up and
you open Photoshop up or any these kind
of programs it's all going to be cached
to this drive making those programs
access faster and process your
information much faster so today we took
a look at the latest from Apple this is
the new i7 27-inch iMac coming in to
market at about $1,900 thanks for
watching we'll have a video soon on
gaming on this thing and actually gaming
is pretty
cool with a 6970 m-series video card see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
