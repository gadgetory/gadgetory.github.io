guys all know you guys it's everywhere
over the net right now that video card
prices are off the freakin hook across
the board due to mining other things
like I said people have been contacting
me asking me for my video cards and a
fine new era to get ahold of crazy
amount of video cards to do all these
mining systems and it seems like a lot
of youtubers are doing mining Elias is
doing it
Kyle joked about it from bit with a few
shows video card and said should I mind
so I'm actually I think will probably
build a mining machine tubes I mean
he'll everybody else is doing we should
just jump on board but there is a way
I've been watching all your guys's
comments and checking things out and
thank you guys for your information
appreciate it I'm always learning from
you as well as for me so I have to thank
you guys now you can beat these high
prices of video cards right now and
that's gonna sound kind of strange
because I know everybody out there who's
a do-it-yourself guy is gonna be like
screw that I would exclude these guys
but check it out buying pre-built
systems or buying gaming laptops right
now is the absolute best bet to solve
your problems I know it sucks you're
like dude I don't want those other parts
bla bla bla bla bla but since these
video car prices are so bad if you can't
get a car for a reasonable price you can
still get a system probably sell the
system off and just keep the video card
if you want it or if you want to be kind
of a tricky guy you could buy a system
sell the video cards and part-to-whole
things out and probably make money off
the video card but ganna be you know
semi dick move probably but you know you
could do that you know and gaming
laptops right now they're pretty low
price you can get a really good gaming
laptop now that will really solve your
needs I don't know if you guys happen to
see in their video we talked about this
brand new thing from vidiots called
g-force now we're like the information
is stored in a cloud and even on a cheap
low-end machine you get still great 60
frames per second and now a whole lot of
games figures like a hundred and ten or
hundred eleven games right there just on
that so buying a pre-built system
although it may not be your first choice
for getting a PC right now I know if you
already have all the parts sitting
around everything you know this video is
gonna be a high pressure off my video
corner
but unfortunately right now the video
card prices are really off the hook like
we showed you before a few different
cards that we're selling for
extraordinary place that prices excuse
me 10 50s come on
going for 700 800 bucks we saw 1080i for
like $1400 like this is crazy stuff
now you guys also make comments in that
video about a lot of these people were
third-party sellers selling through
Amazon and selling through you know
through Newegg now there might be some
some truth to that as well and it's kind
of funny because Nvidia claimed that
they were even mad about like this whole
crazy thing about buying cards but
probably honestly you know a no offense
of it yeah but probably in videos the
only reason they're mad because they're
not the one making all this money off
these cards because they're not sitting
there raising their prices I'm sure
they'd like to because you know supply
and demand you guys also said hey a lot
of you that hey that's just the way
things go so in the supply and demand
market if all these cards really are
being sold for thousands of dollars you
know or you know a few hundred dollars
more in most cases you know for these
cards why shouldn't they charge more why
should an AMD directly charge more none
of us want that and if that actually
happens then honestly we're all
completely screwed that's just gonna be
like holy crap nobody will be able to
afford anything we'll probably see the
PC market as it goes for gaming kind of
take of which few console people out
there will be like a thumbs up for the
PC master-race you guys will be
completely screwed because you won't be
able to afford to buy a video card
without selling naked pictures of your
mom no just kidding I'm just kidding but
just selling your arm or a leg you just
won't be able to do it that's just how
it's going to be so right now the best
solution is to buy a gaming laptop or
buy yourself just a prebuilt PC with the
video card you want it and if you don't
want the rest of the parts and but you
know what a lot of these companies I
have these systems will probably work
with you and you could probably get a
system with some of the things that you
want you may not be able to get it
exactly how you custom want it but if
you get that you can modify and change
around the system you get to make it so
it suits your needs and just sell the
rest of those parts so the temporary
solution for the moment folks
hey pre-built gaming laptops so unless
you've got a bunch of extra cash
babies outstandingly or you know
overpriced and overinflated prices you
got to do what you got to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
