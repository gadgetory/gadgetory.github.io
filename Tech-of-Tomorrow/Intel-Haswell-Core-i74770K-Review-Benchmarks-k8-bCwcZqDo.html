and we'll noncorporeal friends if you
may be watching it's once again seven
o'clock in the morning here on tech Oh
tomorrow and we're here with another yet
another do you believe it launched but
this time it's not about graphics cards
this time it's about CPUs you guys have
all been waiting for it and now Intel's
Haswell has finally hit the market
that's right there are actually 13
different models that are hitting the
market the lineup starts off with the
Intel i5 4570 now this cpu is 3.2
gigahertz and it's about $200 come to
the market and it goes all the way up to
the new i7 47 7 r now the one that we're
going to reviewing today is the new i7
4770k this is the only unlocked chip of
the entire i7 line there's actually one
of the i-5 that's also unlocked and
we'll talk about that in a second so
that's it its launch day let's jump in
talk about a few of the different CPUs
then jump into the test station and then
finally on to the benchmarks and then
let's see hey is this thing worth your
money alright folks so like I said
there's going to be 13 new CPUs for the
desktop environment starting off with
the Intel Core i5 4570 that has 4 cores
4 threads a base clock frequency of 3.2
gigahertz and a turbo speed of 3.6
gigahertz there are a total of three
different varieties in this series as
you can see in the charts
two of the models offer no hyper
threading but the i-5 45 70 T has that
feature I'll beat that it has a clock
speed of 2.9 gigahertz and a turbo speed
of 3.6 gigahertz
it also has only 4 megabytes instead of
6 megabytes of level 3 cache the i5 4570
t however is the only desktop i 5 that
does have hyper threading as all the
other models are seen with its absence
all the 4570 models feature intel's 4600
graphics the TDP is also pretty high on
these skews with the i5 4570 having a
TDP of 84 watts now I'll keep talking
folks and go over every single one
the CPUs that are there you guys can see
there's also four more i5 CPUs and then
in very last we have six more of the i7
CPUs now we have the forty seven seven
series in many different flavors we have
the T the s the vanilla as well as the R
but the CPU that we're reviewing today
is the i7 4770k processor it comes
unlocked it's hitting the market at
about three hundred thirty-nine dollars
has a total TDP of 84 watts has four
cores
eight threads has a base frequency of
3.5 gigahertz a turbo frequency of 3.9
it also features memory of 1333 and 1600
megahertz has eight megabytes of level 3
cache and features Intel's latest HD
4600 graphics for those of you who are
wondering what we're testing with we're
actually using a testbed that we were
given by n when it's the X frame it's
actually a pretty nice thing so we
decided to go ahead and use a sis's new
Maximus 6 that's right there max mixes
Higa roll motherboard in combination
with our new 4770k we're also using a
cooler called the Heligan by the people
over at silverstone we're using 16
gigabytes of Kingston's HyperX memory
that we have an XMP profile set at 21 33
megahertz for our boot drive we have got
a patriot wildfire 120 gigabyte SSD and
for our main drive our media drive we
have the Western Digital 1 terabyte now
this is basically the same test assume
that you guys the users chose for us to
use on a video card only moved up to as
well so for those people who would like
more information on our test system the
CPU or the chipset check out everything
over on our website
www.stampingmadly.com
hey all right wake up ha okay well at
this point after breaking up multiple
days doing this stuff I could actually
sleep to the benchmark so I'm gonna find
it relaxing now we actually got our test
kit late so we didn't really get a
chance to do when you're overclocking
stuff with this we'll get to that later
for you folks what we did however get
was a lot of good comparisons for you
guys to go with so let me take off my
own glasses here because actually these
things work better when I'm trying to
see things up close and see far away so
Haswell whoo okay za7 and Haswell will
you want it do you want it and why would
you buy it now if you're somebody who
you have technology that is Sandy Bridge
or older technology then you probably
definitely want to consider upgrading
for a damn fact because there's all
kinds of new stuff that makes it great
you know what I mean
power efficiency off the charts really
good stuff the graphics that are on
board they're a little bit better the
new HD 4600 in the HD 4000 that's for
damn sure
now you're somebody who owns an i7 3770k
though however and you're a gamer I just
I can't say my right mind wild recommend
to you why you need to go out and spend
a $500 I mean you'd be better off buying
another video card and just pumping up
your game in your video thing because
there's just not that much of a
difference and by $500 I mean because
you have to purchase both the CPU and
the motherboard
your LGA 1155 mother but we're no longer
work you are going to have to purchase
an LGA 1150 motherboard to make that new
Haswell CPU have a home so you guys saw
in our test bed we used the GTX 680
because we know lots of folks own that
card and we saw between one and three
frames per second increase between using
Haswell and Ivy Bridge now I just don't
feel like that's even enough reason to
give an upgrade to all the great
benefits that I see with has well really
you're going to benefit more people in
the mobile segment things like you know
power efficiency I mean that's really
cool but when you're plugged into your
wall do you think saving you know a
couple cents here and there really going
to matter all that much I don't think
people going to go WOW hey man check it
out man
upgraded as well my bill was like $1,000
less not happening you know I'm saying
so but on the other hand though here's
somebody who's taking that stuff on the
road and you get yourself an ultrabook
or something like that
that would be really awesome technology
because long battery life not getting
hot being able to run for long periods
of time hey that's very great stuff I
just don't see for the desktop if you
already have some is very current really
needing to upgrade but if you don't
learn anything at all hey I would
definitely be jumping into as well with
the 11:50 then jumping into the older
stuff just because the new technology
involved we saw that with encoding and
stuff like that you actually saved a
little bit of time so in that arena
there's actually a lot more improvements
if you're somebody does video editing
you're somebody who does Photoshop and
that type of stuff a lot of productivity
you're going to see a lot better results
with as well and those are some reasons
to actually look into it
so I hope you guys really enjoyed this
review I apologize we didn't get you
guys overclocking stuff we promised to
get to that really really soon but we
want to change it out to water cooler at
least maybe something better we'll see
what we work out but I hope you guys
like this video and appreciate all of
our time for stand up and do it and if
so you guys know what to do I'm not even
going to say it everything they also
will be down in the link in the
description below we have our full
written review on this if you guys want
to check that out make sure you do if
you're not subbed and you'd like to be
subbed and always see this stuff here on
techno - Marlon hey make sure you hit
that button
see you later brothers and sisters I'm
off to get some sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
