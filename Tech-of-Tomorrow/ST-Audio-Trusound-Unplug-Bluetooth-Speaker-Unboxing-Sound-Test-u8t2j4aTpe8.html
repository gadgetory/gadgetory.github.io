Tech fans welcome back to tech Audemar
we have all the tech all the time
I'm Elric your host and today we have
something very interesting to look at
the other day I had to go to the mall to
get my phone trance over to my note 2
and I had to get a new screen protector
put on it but while I was there the guy
was working there said hey man we got
this new speaker that just came out from
true Sam that's actually a really really
good product and I was like what is it
he's like oh you know you see all these
other products out through the pill and
like the one that we previously did here
you know we've showed you some of these
little mini speakers well this thing is
actually really really impressive it's
right here
it's the St audio true sound now this is
a wireless Bluetooth digital subwoofer
speaker system that's right now you can
put a little micro SD card in it or you
can do it wirelessly through your
Bluetooth which makes it actually kind
of cool because all you got to do is
store all your music on a little tiny
thing pop it in here and then away you
go now
this thing's coming to market about
sixty to eighty dollars but from what
I've seen and heard I think it's
actually a really good product for one
thing it's more portable than anything
you've seen out there battery life is
extremely long eight to nine hours and
it charges back up in about an hour
that's pretty cool so you get USB charge
in about an hour and you're back up and
going for eight hours not bad at all
right so anyways this is pretty simple
like they have a bunch of facts on it
you know I'm going half blind but hi-fi
Bluetooth mini sub woofer speaker 3d
digital dynamic bass engine technology
super shock high quality sound 35
millimeter auxiliary in Jack micro USB
charging micro SD card stick LED light
on an off switch and a built in
microphone all as well so I'll show you
guys the box you can see that choosing
for yourself but there's a front of the
box here is the side of the box that's
actually important two of the cameramen
zoom in there and get a nice close-up
angle we'll leave it on the screen so
you guys can check that out now folks
let's move over to the table and let's
do the unboxing not much to it but
anyways let's do it alright folks so
like usual always a box
than a box so here's the box and then
inside obviously we're gonna have
another box
voila run out the back we have a little
black magic bag
nothing's inside oh just a pointing you
know I'm just kidding all right so we
got the nice little velvet black bag
we have instruction guides for the st
audio instruction guides all that good
stuff our cabling right there we got our
little 35 millimeter jack and our micro
USB 2 standard USB for our charging and
then we have the unit itself now this
thing is very very heavy in my hand it's
not lightweight at all so much Charlie
get the camera numb and set this down
now with the camera and get nice
close-ups of everything for you folks
all right folks so right here on the
side we have all the control buttons
right here you have your volume up and
you can you actually hold it the volume
will change we'll get to that in a
second when we do the sound test power
okay see it turned on right there now
there's a little switch on it also we'll
turn that off we'll do the soundcheck
afterwards yeah a little premature there
we had a little premature sound sound
ulation they're going on there you guys
didn't see numbers all the way across
here here is the micro sd 35 millimeter
spend around this like we said is the
power and control it actually chooses
between having the SD card at which I
actually open it up earlier and put the
micro SD card out with some of my music
so we could do a soundcheck but it works
with that or your Bluetooth so if you
got your phone or whatever you hook it
up now one thing folks check out the
speaker this is the speaker right here
it's inside here it's you know up we're
shooting the bass is actually down here
in the bottom
and if you hold this in your hand you
can really hear and feel the music it's
very very loud and fills the room so now
let's move on I'm gonna set this thing
up and then we'll give it a sound test
for you folks so you can let me know
what you think alright folks so now
let's give this little thing a test
drive give it a little turn on right
here gonna reset itself and here we go
like I said the boy ah all right I see
how it's going now folks I'm a little
bit blind here so let's try this again
that kind of volume down there little
volume down here volume up here
hahaha
I like that song alright folks so you
guys heard this thing personally I feel
that for the money and for the size this
thing definitely wins an editor's choice
here our hunt echo tomorrow man I mean
I'm impressed with this thing it plays
music very loud very clear even at full
volume it actually does fill a small
room with sound I was in the mall and
they have a little train running around
the Puente Hills Mall and even though
the train was running I could still hear
this thing playing music with the train
going wrong so you know I say this
thing's a solid product check it out for
yourself at the mall they'll turn went
on for you and let you hear it I think
you'll be impressed see you guys later
