once again on tech of tomorrow bringing
you guys nvidia geforce gtx 770 coverage
now what's on the table right now we you
guys always ask and this time we're
bringing it to you on launch day what is
that
that's sli performance of two gtx 770 s
now we took these cards and one is the
reference base card and one is the a
zeus direct cu2 card and we basically
clock these cards exactly the same using
GPU tweak and then we began all of our
tests we also tested these cards against
a bunch of others we test it against the
7970 against the titan against the 780
just all kinds of good stuff so with
that said let's actually jump in and
let's take a look at some of the
performance
hi folks so there you have it the quick
down and dirty of SLI performance of the
new geforce gtx 770 now you guys can see
from the scores that these cards really
really kick ass in an SLI configuration
I mean look a Titan cost $1000 a pair of
these cards cost 800 dollars and you get
superior performance I mean that's
something to really consider now the GTX
780 it cost about six hundred forty nine
dollars but obviously this still totally
blows that away what I'd really like to
know from you guys is you guys feel that
it's worth the extra money and all the
extra power that it requires to actually
use an SL configuration or would you
prefer just to go ahead and buy a really
high-end card now one way to break this
down as you guys all know that the GTX
690 is basically two 680 s on a single
PCB and since the new 770 is nothing but
a souped-up 680 the cards performance is
actually quite incredible so there you
guys have it folks I hope you guys
enjoyed this video of SLI performance on
the new geforce gtx 770 if so i hope you
guys can pound the hell out of that like
button as hard as you rocked out to the
benchmark song also for those people
into overclocking we have an
overclocking video of the new zeus
direct cu2 card you guys can see it in
the screen back here behind me as well
as an unboxing of the new EVGA SC
edition guard which features the new AC
ex cooling which is their active cooling
extreme I'm Eric hope you guys subscribe
the channel if not make sure you do so
and we'll see you guys back in the
channel for more coverage of the geforce
gtx 770</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
