to the teco tomorrow youtube channel i'm
mel work your host and today we've got
something pretty exciting to announce to
you folks now you guys all know though
that there's been a giant storm going
over on the east coast and these
products were actually done in a silent
launch on monday but due to the storm
everything that's going on New York this
thing kind of got pushed back a little
bit so before we even start this video I
just want to send out my heartfelt
remorse for all the people back there in
New York and the East Coast have to
suffer through all this stuff everybody
here is praying for your folks and we
hope that you guys really get over this
soon now the stuff they're going to be
looking at today is the new google nexus
10 and the google nexus 4 one is it
tablet and one is a phone and both these
projects are supposed to be released in
mid-november so with that said let's
jump in and let's check out what both
these new things have to offer I think
for people out there who are haters of
apple products you just found a tablet
that's gonna make your day let's go
so now let's take a look at the Nexus 10
this bad boy is designed by Samsung and
features the 10-inch 2560 by 1600
Corning Gorilla Glass to display it
features a dual core a 15 CPU 16
gigabytes of internal storage and 2
gigabytes of RAM has a 5-megapixel
rear-facing camera a 1.9 megapixel front
camera now as far as connectivity goes
it features a microUSB a magnetic pogo
pin charger micro HDMI out and a
standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
now this monster features a huge 9,000
milliamp hour lithium battery which
should equate to excellent battery life
and many hours on the road between
recharges just like the Nexus 4 it also
ships with Android 4.2 jelly bean but
with minor tweaks to better suit the
tablet interface but the best feature of
all is it will ship for 399 dollars and
seriously give the iPad a run for its
money welcome into the game Nexus 10 now
let's look at the nexus for the Nexus 4
is designed by LG and looks very similar
to the previous Galaxy Nexus features of
4.7 inch 1280 by 768 Corning Gorilla
Glass to display and those extra 48
pixels are for software button since
there are no physical buttons usable so
the real real estate is 720 x 1280 it
features a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro CPU 2
gigabytes of ram 8 gigabyte storage
option is 299 the 16 gigabyte internal
storage option is 349 you get an 8
megapixel rear camera and a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera this also
ships with Android 4.2 which is still
jelly bean with minor improvements like
photosphere quick settings improved
notifications pinch to zoom in Gmail
gesture typing and enhancements to
Google now now here's where it gets
weird there's no LTE way but it's clear
Google is pricing this very aggressively
starting out at three hundred dollars
unlocked when most of the top
smartphones cost at least twice that
amount unlocked alright folks so tell me
where your thoughts on this video and
these two new products that are coming
by Google my main question for you folks
is since a lot of you guys are total
people who want to piss on Apple do you
find yourself jumping on this tablet
right away and all honesty on the side
I'm going to get one as soon as it comes
out now here's a question I really want
to pose to all you guys LTE do you guys
feel that on this new google nexus 4
that having no LTE is a deal-breaker let
me know what you think about this down
in the comments below because this seems
to be a very common thing about people
not liking this so I hope you guys liked
the video if you do please give me a
thumbs up make sure that you're always
subscribed to challenge them in case you
miss anything you'll make sure you get
it in your mailbox and that's about it I
thank you folks for watching and I'll
see you back here on tech of tomorrow
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
