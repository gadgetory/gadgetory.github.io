Tech fans welcome back to CES 2014 and
we're with Travis of SteelSeries they've
got a whole bunch of really cool stuff
to show you guys here at this year's
show including something that you fans
out who like Apple products are really
gonna be happy with so let's hop over to
Travis right here next to me and let's
see what he has to say about these new
probably at CES so what's up man what's
the Stratus so the Stratus is our iOS
gaming controller it's a mobile product
so you can see the size it's relatively
small it's meant to fit into your pocket
you know on the go when you're using
your iPad your iPod your iPhone etc to
do some mobile gaming with you know the
dual thumb sticks a true programmable
buttons VR SteelSeries software you know
the battery life is 10 hours on it so
with you my own battery takes about an
hour and change to charge and so it
charges really fast in the last Oh more
than half a day to play your game so I
mean it's meant to be used on the go and
like for example when I was flying out
here six hours of GTA san andreas on a
plane I mean how your hands
so basically no 14 hours of games you're
playing more than that you're gonna get
carpal tunnel kids to knock it off take
a break from it so these things are also
gonna come in multi colors correct yeah
so we have a black one available for
pre-order right now we also have a white
one available what about any other
colors possibly coming out of you guys
it's gonna stick to the basic something
we're keeping open to I mean if there's
a request you know for a hot pink one
you know obviously we'll explore that
route so we're open to anything right
now right on so real quick now let's
just jump over and show you guys a
little bit of gaming with the Stratos on
a little iPad Mini and go so the first
question Travis I want to ask you it's
kind of personal but how does it feel in
your hand it's really smooth it's easy
to be able to you know play racing games
playing playing GTA san andreas like I
mentioned before you know with dual
thumb sticks and this games what again
now this is Riptide - it's a jet ski
racing slash freestyle you don't kill
anybody no not in this game
unfortunately I want to shut it off it's
time for since they don't kill anybody
what's the big deal here come on man I'm
just kidding
it'd be cool if they did like a road
rash
that would be awesome yeah road rash
jetski see you almost did it right there
okay so big it is really easy to use
this comfortable in your hand the
controls are easy to access and
everything
yeah and it's super easy to setup right
let's go into your Bluetooth settings
you recognize the device and just auto
auto sakes you don't have to go anything
program or anything doing anything right
just hey this device is there click it
exact is a little handshake you're good
to go we want to make it as simple as
possible right so you don't want to be
fumbling all over yourself when you're
at an airport that can totally just like
bring the experienced bum yeah so we try
to make it as simple as possible and I
think we pretty much succeeded right on
will he make the next thing oh oh
tricky tricky tricky try my folks so
there you have it the stress you can
take it anywhere play games on whatever
I device you have available for
pre-order will be out pretty soon we've
got more product so stay tuned detector
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
