elric Ferris here with my dog Buddy once
again on tech of tomorrow bringing you
guys Metro 2033 on the PNY gtx 660ti at
2560 by 1600 on the old dell 30-inch
monitor back here behind me why am i
testing of this resolution well anybody
out there can test the thing you know at
1920 x 1080 almost everything their
brother-in-law has one of those monitors
not very many people can actually test
at this resolution and a lot of people
want to know that we will however be
running all these tests in the standard
resolutions for you guys next week but
first we're doing these videos then
we're doing sli and then we'll jump back
in some other stuff as we cover the 660
ti series so but that said let's jump in
you guys will see now on the screen we
have metro 2033 turned up to its
absolute baddest-ass badness can't get
any better than this got it all turned
up I know the card is going to lag a
little bit on this but that's kind of
the point we're trying to knock the card
to its knees but it doesn't fall to its
knees it does pretty good so now let's
jump in let's check out the pain
cylinder song this song is also called
so you guys ask every single solitary
day this song is pain cylinder something
to believe in we're actually going to
upload it onto amazon in the next few
days and then you guys can buy it as the
benchmark song so that's about it let's
jump in and let's see metro 2033 in all
of its splendor
you
that's all right you guys saw it there
now obviously the 660 ti it said right
in the reviewers kit that it's only made
for 1920 x 1080 or 1920 x 1200 so I'm
going way outside the specs there but
you guys see it still runs it pretty
damn cool and it looks pretty cool as
well so we'll be back here tomorrow I'm
not even thinking to move positions and
we'll go ahead and just get the next
video ready for you guys that one is
going to be the heaven benchmark with
everything turned and boy heaven almost
knocks it all the way out so that said
we'll see you tomorrow with heaven until
then go to hell not kidding whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
