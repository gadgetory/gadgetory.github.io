to tech of tomorrow now a long time ago
we announced it but now I have it in my
hands this is the new AT&amp;amp;T exclusive of
the new Nokia Lumia 920 now this phones
got lots of great features but
unfortunately at this time it's only for
AT&amp;amp;T there is going to be kind of an
unusual unboxing because the things
actually been opened before is I
debarred from a friend of mine from
another channel because a you guys kind
of know my financial situation but I got
it here so you guys could just see
what's in the box and some of the specs
anyway so let's focus down here and
let's start unboxing this thing now this
little phone is pretty interesting we'll
go ahead and we'll go ahead and pull
this out and I'll show you this
afterwards we'll just go ahead and go
through all the stuff in the box first
to get back to the phone so brought the
baton here you can see this little key
here this is for removing out your sim
card you pull that little bad boy out go
ahead and remove it on the bottom we've
got hey whoops a touch to connect nokia
so we've got to what is this one day
what do you want to learn more about
here's the basic product and safety
guide next up the Quick Start Guide this
is where the sim card was but it's now
in the phone next up we have the micro
USB to USB cable and then last but not
least the wall charger so boom that's
all that stuff now let's move on to the
phone now this phone is actually a
little bit thicker and a little bit
heavier than most the other phones this
is a due to the carl zeiss technology
inside the fact that it has actually two
flashes built into the camera so you
guys can see it's a little bit thicker
than your average phone it's actually a
little bit heavier as well now I'll go
ahead and I'll remove this off the front
here
yes you can see that now move the side
right here we have the volume rocker
bars we have the power lock and sleep
switch can I go ahead and hit this go
ahead and turn the phone on now this is
a windows-based phone and it uses
windows tiles now this thing also has a
qualcomm 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor a 4.5 inch purevideo HD Plus
display that features some of the latest
gorilla glass 2 point 0 technology now
this thing's supposed to have some kind
of new curved thing to it that actually
makes reading the text much better on
the phone now one of the really great
things about this phone though is the
rear camera features a 26 millimeter
focal length also features an 8
megapixel camera with dual-led flash and
it also shoots in 1080p the camera also
features stabilization features so if
you're shooting out and doing stuff it
won't look all bouncy and stuff so
that's some pretty good stuff now let's
bounce back and let's go ahead back to
the front again this phone is also
supposed to be one of the actual easiest
phones to use my friend Jonathan from
TLD is on the phone told me that it's
actually much easier to use than his
iphone so something it's going to be
user-friendly that's going to be
friendlier than iphone is going to be
something pretty interesting I think a
lot of people are going to be wanting to
buy this phone to check it out I'll be
giving you guys a bunch of different
tests where I test the photo
capabilities on it one thing also cool
guys a lot of people are on the go
working it does include a version of
office on here which is very very cool
great for those people who work and this
phone is actually very very well priced
with a contract this phone is only
ninety nine dollars making it very very
competitive now after usage if this
thing finds out that is is all the
things that says to be I think this
might be actually one of the hottest
phones on the market from first looks
the new Lumia 920 seems to have a
winning combination of a lot of
different stuff if you guys liked the
video please hit the like button if you
guys aren't subscribed please do so

it please look in the link in the
