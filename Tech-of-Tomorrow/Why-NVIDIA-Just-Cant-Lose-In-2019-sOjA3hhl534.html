under $30 we'll have a link down below
the first quarter of 2019 is almost
coming to a close one more little month
and we'll be actually a quarter of the
year end of 2019 and so far we've seen
some definite changes in the industry in
today's videos well I'm going to let you
know if there's absolutely no way that
Nvidia could lose this year know before
you go sound oh my god you've been
paying to say it all this stuff
absolutely not it's just the facts of
the matter right now
Nvidia is totally dominating the entire
gaming spectrum and they have even more
cards coming out that I can't tell you
about right now but believe me there is
even more cards coming out all the way
from the lower end all the way to the
higher end which means that Nvidia in
2019 is not going to be able to be
touched and I know some people out there
gonna say well Elric you know AMD is
going to have these other cards and you
know and they're gonna absolutely blow
and video way I can tell you right now
that's not going to happen even with the
Radeon 7 it's not going to be blowing
anything out of the water I've said this
before and as the years go by and
especially 2019 goes by we're gonna see
more and more companies actually taking
advantage of the DL SS and the RT X
technology now right now everybody knows
that the top in line cards remedy just
cost a fortune they're really expensive
and we've talked about it a bunch of
times it's like beating a dead horse
ain't no RT X and DL it says aren't
really quite here so you know alright we
know that you know and a lot of people
are saying oh my god it's like the
physics thing all over again I don't
know it's a little bit different but the
bottom line is even though Nvidia now
came out these you know strange new
technologies of the ray-tracing that
nobody's really you know putting into
all their games this technology will
eventually catch on and for most people
out there when they want the best they
always turn to Nvidia they don't turn to
md i've never once
conversation with anybody ever in my
life and they go hey dude I want to get
the absolute best gaming system I get
and I knew it to be all IMD bro like you
know I need you to build me like an D
student that blows away and Intel
you know Nvidia system I just haven't
really seen that now AMD has come quite
a long way on the CPU side of things and
the CPU side of things I think it's very
very possible that they may catch up and
they may pass Intel in 2019 but on the
GPU side of things absolutely not
it's just not gonna be happening there's
just too many other things going on over
at AMD some are gonna say oh I'll wreck
no way man no way no way but yes it's
absolutely way bro totally way because
AMD right now is spread very thin I
talked about this in another video if
you guys wanna check it out also have a
link down below where I talk about AMD
actually fighting on two fronts and how
it's really hard to win a battle with
any you know one enemy let alone two
enemies when you're fighting two fronts
and this also translates in today's
video because saying this there's really
no way in 2019 that they're going to be
able to beat Nvidia at any level we now
see and video releasing cards and
there's another card soon to be released
that's gonna have Nvidia totally
dominating all the way from entry-level
all the way to top-of-the-line and
they're gonna dominate every spectrum of
this which means that pretty much as far
as gaming goes Nvidia is going to rule
the roost now yes there's gonna be AMD
cards out there hopefully more Andy
cards come out this year but they're not
going to be able to compete at all which
means that for the entire year of 2019
we're not gonna really see any great
advancements in the GPU division from
AMD it's going to be subpar and it's
gonna obviously be cheaper and this is
where you know AMD strengths always rely
you know they sell stuff and it's
usually at a lower price $6.99 for the
new Radeon 7 mm I don't know they're
probably going to lower their prices and
here check this out so let's just say
we'll just say for the record that AMD
does come out with something they come
out with something out of a magic out of
their hat they
pull it out of a rabbit out of a hat
whoo we've got magic and all of a sudden
they come out with a car well all and
video really would have to do at that
point is take a deep breath lower their
prices a little bit and then BAM they
would be at the same prices only
performing faster so it's really really
hard for AMD to compete in 2019 unless
they're just always going to be shooting
for the second tier and having a lower
end lower cost
you know card for those people out there
there are many people out there I don't
know why they do this but they always
get involved in the business aspects of
things and pretty soon they're gonna be
looking you know at what cheese and VD
eats and well you know what burgers the
guys eat at AMD and making their
decisions because your only decision
when it comes to buying your video card
should be what works the best for you
and most people out there there are a
few are gonna just be saying hey no way
I like AMD I feel that AMD just performs
better
they aren't tied to their opinion but
when the numbers at the end of the day
when they hit the deck you know that the
Nvidia cards are going to be a faster
card and if the RT X and DL SS stuff
picks up and a lot more people out there
in the gaming company start you know
enveloping this technology and
implementing in the games that's gonna
make a big difference it'll once again
separate AMD from Nvidia not only at a
pricing level but at a technological
level as well I mean let's just think
about it there's all these games that
start coming out and they support all
this stuff and AMD didn't support me in
this type of technology and games do
gamers are gonna frown on AMD they're
gonna be saying hey no you know I want I
want a game that supports all these
great features so I'm not only getting
the best performance but I'm getting the
best visual as well now I know that a
lot of people feel that like the RT X
stuff is really just shiny stuff and one
time when I was talking to a friend of
mine at Nvidia like he said well hey
isn't really life about shiny stuff and
well even though I agree a little bit
with him I disagree with him a little
bit as well I agree the whole world's
not shiny like I'm looking around my
room right now and like yeah the
monitors shining where the lights are
hitting shining cameramen he's not
shining the light poles not shining that
my boxes aren't shining
so in essence know the whole world
isn't more shiny and when you walk into
a game just seeing everything in the
whole street shining everything he
really isn't that much of a
technological jump for me I'll be honest
with you because not everything does
shine the stuff that does shine however
should actually shine I think there's
somebody at my door because the dog is
now giving us his defense his warning
there is somebody here to see it's
probably just the postman so I'm not
even gonna stop and it's gonna keep
rolling alright but come on you protect
this enough come on but anyways this is
really it I know that people out there
are going to probably be like really
angry I'll probably angry at the video
and go rah rah rah but the only thing
that I ever look at when I do these
videos are actually the raw numbers and
how the people in the public intercept
these numbers and do their purchases and
this is how it goes when NVIDIA has the
fastest performing cards even though
they are higher priced than AMD people
are still going to buy them it's a
proven fact they sell them over and over
again it doesn't matter if you say oh
they're cards break down their cards do
this they're still dominating the market
so no matter how much really dirt you
kick over on to Nvidia it just seems
like they just shake their head and keep
moving down the road because they're
just so far ahead people really do not
realize how far ahead and Vidya is ahead
of AMD and I'm being honest with you
right here they are so far ahead it's
just mind-boggling they released all
these cards these 2060s it's just a
stopgap there's nothing coming from AMD
to compete with them so when nothing
comes from AMD to compete with them why
should they spend a bunch of money on
R&amp;amp;D and waste money doing more
technology when they can go on vacation
or buy more stuff or buy other companies
and isn't it also really a strange thing
that Lisa hmm who runs AMD is actually
the niece of Jensen from Nvidia kind of
a strange thing there right I don't know
in the future I hope that AMD can make
some changes but in 2019 there's no way
that Nvidia is going to be touched by
them looking at the market trends
looking at the releases that NVIDIA has
planned and knowing that Nvidia isn't
even really breaking out their big guns
just shows that there's absolutely no
way that AMD is going to compete on the
G
pee-yew side of things in 2019 William
do you have some cards that come out
cool will they probably be cool for some
part of the market yeah they probably
will be but for the mainstream market
it's going to be Nvidia and things could
get a lot worse like I said if more
people start implementing into their
games the RT X and the DL s technology
more people are going to want to jump on
the Nvidia bandwagon and all this is
going to do is just keep separating
things separating things separating
things until AMD and video are really
far apart there have been a lot of times
in the past where AMD's jumped ahead a
lot of times there pretty much knows and
knows but in 2019 AMD is being shuffled
over Nvidia is way ahead of them in 2019
and I don't see anything changing
whatsoever
if you're interested in checking out the
latest cards or you really don't know
anything about them all of some link
down below to some stuff at Amazon if
you want to check out what all these new
Nvidia cards are about you can do that
I'm Mel work you guys have watched
Tekken Maru like always I want to hear
your comments I know you guys always
have a lot to say try to keep it cool
there's no reason to get a big heated
battle over anything but honestly I feel
that in 2019 and I think the market is
going to agree with me as we see things
AMD doesn't have a chance in the GPU
market but let's hear what you have to
say I love you guys peace out if you're
not sub K mixer your sub do the ways we
can't see you back here if you don't
have notification turned on well then
you won't know what's going on
notification is let you know what videos
are coming out if you happen to like the
music inside of our videos we'll have
links down below where you can check out
