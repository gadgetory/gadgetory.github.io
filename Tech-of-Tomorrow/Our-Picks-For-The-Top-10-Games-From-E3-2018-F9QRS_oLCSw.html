a week of tons and tons and tons of
games in fact there were so many games
that were released that trying to cover
them all is quite insane and honestly
probably not every one of them is going
to be the game we're gonna go wow this
is so awesome
but we've narrowed it down to what we
feel are like pretty much the top ten
whether it be PC or console we weren't
even prejudiced what its gonna bring you
guys what we think are those top games
from e3 so let's start off right off the
bat with the Nintendo's switch so first
up we have Super Smash Brothers ultimate
on the Nintendo switch and they're
bringing characters over from Metal Gear
Solid so you're gonna see not only all
your favorites Zelda and all the rest
which is kind of how that game is this
games pretty much a fighter game that
involves all of your characters from the
Nintendo universe so anybody that you
knew that was a Nintendo universe that
you were a fan of no matter who it was
Pikachu whoever even all kinds of other
crazy characters they're just all gonna
be inside of this game and now you're
gonna get Ryu and snake from Metal Gear
Solid as well and why we're talking
about the switch currently even right
now you can get fortnight's of those
fans out there who love fortnight you
can jump on that and there's also a game
called Mario Party coming out now Mario
Party what does that gonna involve a
bunch of mushrooms but anyways that's
what's going on on that frontier so you
guys that there who like the Nintendo
switch these are some of the top things
that are coming for that platform I know
most you guys out there like PC guys but
for you guys out there who still you
know dabble in the console stuff even
though honestly in my opinion most of
the Nintendo stuff is kind of
kitty-kitty-kitty
still these are some pretty cool games
for that platform so next up a game from
Sony for the PlayStation 4 called the
death stranding and this has Norman
Reedus in it you know the guy from all
kinds of movies including the Walker
let's check it out now death stranding
is kind of a really trippy game it kind
of looks kind of like a third-person RPG
it's got disappearing monsters all in
all from what I've seen for the ps4 this
is definitely one weird game so if you
like weird and you like different you
may really want to check out this game
death stranding now like I said it
features Norman Reedus there's a new
trailer and a gameplay footage for you
guys to check out so if you guys are
into this type of game and you own a ps4
you should definitely check it out
because this is actually one of the
coolest games at e3 this year now this
next one there's not a whole lot of
information about it but it looks really
really cool features a brand new
slipspace engine for doing its graphics
rendering all that stuff now this game
is Halo infinite and I know fans of halo
out there like hey yeah some more hey
let's get it on but let's just face it
that games been around a long time it's
like almost one of the og tiles on the
newer Xbox themes and it's been a really
great game to play now even though
there's not too much information about
release dates and really that kind of
stuff the trailer does look really
really cool so if you're totally into
your xbox one and you're looking for a
new game and you're a fan of Halo
well.when halo infinite probably hits
the streets you'll probably be buying it
next up once again on the PlayStation 4
is Ghost of Tsushima now the Mongols
invade in 1294 and you're gonna play as
a samurai now who doesn't like to play
as a samurai let's just be honest how
many people out there can honestly say
to yourself you know passing me a
samurai because when I think about
playing as a samurai I want to get out
my sword and I want to chop me some
stuff up so let's just face it the game
trailer on this looks amazing you've got
to see it and this game is going to be
really cool because like I said I mean
any chance that I can get to play a
samurai get to swing around a sword and
cut some stuff up I'm totally totally
down with it there's also actually a
really trippy Batman movie out for you
guys are just like fringe things that
features Batman
as a samurai so it's pretty crazy you
guys ever get a chance to check that out
you should check it out so when this new
game ghost comes out I'm gonna be
playing it because I want to play a
samurai and let's just face it the
Mongols they were some badass dudes that
was Khan and his gang you know what I
mean and they could be ruling the world
now and maybe we can too but check out
the trailer because this thing looks
like it's gonna be pretty awesome a lot
of fun
now this next guy I know everybody at e3
and all of you know them as well and
that is spider-man that's right the
webslinger the one and only who in some
versions is the ultimate and other
versions he's just Spider Man but either
way you guys all know who spider-man is
now there's a brand new Spider gang game
excuse me spider-man game coming out for
the ps4 as well in fact there are so
many actually honestly more console
games than PC games it's mind-boggling
but don't worry we're getting the PC
games pretty soon but real quick though
let's check out some game footage and
let's see this game because AHS is
supposed to be set eight years in the
future of his origin story and he's
fighting all kinds of new villains and
old ones as well you're gonna see
villains such as electro rhino scorpion
vulture and mr. negative that guy
relieves to change his attitude now this
game will be available on September 7 so
for you fans of spider-man who have a
ps4 and want to get into some web
slinging action keep your eyes open for
the new spider-man game love it or hate
it Assassin's Creed is one very popular
game due to its awesome gameplay all of
a spying and the cool things you can do
in the game plus the extremely nice
graphics that are always accompanied in
the game in fact if you have made a
movie movie wasn't all that great but
hey the game series really kicks butt
and now we're getting a brand new game
Assassin's Creed Odyssey that's right
Odyssey coming out October 5th for the
Xbox one PlayStation 4 and for the PC
that's right all the way across the
board now check it out you're gonna play
as an outlaws
Barton in the days of Greece so this is
going to be really really crazy stuff
now you guys all know this this is
probably gonna be kind of like you know
almost like 300 themed at least I'm
hoping so you know since you're in
ancient Greece and you play as a outlaw
Spartan it should be really crazy stuff
I mean personally this is one of the
games I'm looking forward to I mean I'll
probably play it on my xbox and on my PC
because it's me ah see with this kind of
game the controller for me is a little
bit easier now when it comes to racing
in these kind of games I love my
controller first-person shooters got to
be on my PC I'm a little bit old-school
but either way this games coming out
October 5th so if you guys love
Assassin's Creed like I do
well then Odyssey is probably gonna be a
game you're gonna want to play now
number seven on our top ten is from the
makers of doom this is doom eternal now
if you guys don't know what doom is doom
was pretty much like the OG game of
moving forward in a game killing stuff
and going around blowing up stuff it was
one of the seriously OG games now
they're claiming with doom eternal
that's and not only will this game look
good but it'll left twice the demons of
the other version so if you love you
know going around and just blasting the
crap out of stuff and this is your style
of game then you will obviously love
doom eternal more monsters more guns
more boom more bang more death all for
your buck so get the most deaths for
your buck with doom eternal no I'm seein
that sounds pretty funny but if you're a
fan of doom you guys know what I'm
talking about you guys know what the
games all about obviously this is gonna
be probably PC and probably every other
title as well so they can jack as much
money out out of the fans as possible
but when this game hits I'm pretty sure
that a lot of people will buy it so you
guys know the John we you know the
series you know what this game is like
if you're a fan of this series then you
know what you're getting into it's just
supposed to look better and have more
monsters and fallout is in itself a very
unique game because it started out as
one type of game and through all kinds
of different iterations of it it's
changed to something completely
different now the new game that's come
out it's supposed to be set in the era
before any of the other Fallout games
have come out so it's supposed to be
basically back in time so maybe it'll be
like you know set in 2102 or 2076 I'm
thinking since it's fallout 76 is the
name of the game that maybe you know
you're gonna start out in 20 76 so if
you're listening out there game
developers that would be a cool thing
wink wink wink wink
yeah so you know 2076 based in 20 76
maybe they'll even have vans like they
had a 1976 you know big-ass band the
woman's whoa get it on man no but just
kidding but check it out if you're a fan
of fallout you guys know what goes on in
the game you go around you search for
things you build up your weapons you
build up your character and you go out
and you destroy and you take things and
bring them over to your side of things
so obviously this game is going to be
the same type of game I'm thinking there
wasn't a whole lot of information about
I do know that on November 14th it's
coming out for every platform so it
whether it be Xbox Playstation 4 or the
PC you'll be able to get your hands on
this game and play it I know I
definitely want to check out it I've
played all the rest of them so why not
just keep going that's what I say so if
you're a fan of the series you guys know
what it is
hey on November 14th you guys will be
able to get that game so there's nice
game footage the game looks really nice
not too much totally different than the
prior stuff but hey it's gonna
definitely be an interesting version of
the game now number 9 of our top 10 is
called gears which I thought maybe the
script was wrong but no they've removed
of water so it's Gears of War but now
changed just Gears 5 why they're doing
this I don't know but it's coming in
2019 so for you fans of the game in 2019
you'll be able to get this game it's
obviously gonna be for Xbox one and
presumably for the PC as well since
that's usually how it goes they also
have a couple of games that are going to
be released for the mobile app one of
the tactics version one of those is like
something pop but either way for the
mobile environment you guys be able to
get a couple different games for your
mobile phone as were so if you
excuse me for your mobile world as well
you can get that all off our mobile
world is what I'm mobile Ross Ellet five
times in a row but anyway see you for
guys who like your mobile games you'll
be able to get that on there as well but
further fans who love gears of war love
the strategy of that love all the
characters well up in 2019 there'll be a
new version of it coming out so we'll be
able to get our hot hands on it and play
that game now number 10 is by the
company CD Projekt RED and this game is
cyberpunk 2077 now these are from the
same guys who brought you the witcher 3
and obviously it's gonna be in this
giant world where you go around killing
collecting things RPG style it's gonna
be available for every platform but
honestly the trailer for this game just
looks amazing all kinds of robots neon I
mean this is gonna be one of those games
obviously that you're either gonna get
totally immersed and sucked into or it's
just not your style now me personally
this game looks like candy and I want to
eat it right now I want to munch it down
or probably give me a diabetic coma but
still this thing looks totally awesome
in fact even though it's number 10 I
have to say though for the PC realm of
stuff cyberpunk 2077 is looking to be
one badass game and I can't wait til it
gets here to be able to play it and test
it out on all of our computers here and
see how that baby runs so there you guys
have it the top 10 what I feel are the
most killer releases right now coming
from e3 obviously there are a lot more
out there in the gaming universities
let's just face it
III is all about gaming gaming gaming

brand-new footage that they released for
shadow of the Tomb Raider I don't know
