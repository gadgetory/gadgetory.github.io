Samsung and all and look the people at
eight games let's check this out so this
first story is pretty crazy and if
you're going to want to get one of these
things I hope you have a serious goal
run those black ultra credit cards
because you're going to need it because
this product from Samsung is rumored to
be coming to market at about five
thousand dollars that's right five
thousand bucks for a 16 terabyte SSD now
eight to 10 right now is the biggest you
can get your hands on those things are
currently going from was like two
thousand dollars and more but this thing
is going to be five thousand dollars and
it's all going to be packed in the same
2.5 housing that the current ones are in
so that's simply incredible stuff now
will this thing be the absolute fastest
one in the market I don't know we won't
know till it hits the ground but it's
rumored to be but 16 terabytes of
information think about it I mean I
don't even think there's any 16 terabyte
hard drives really out there so now
you're going to get an SSD with 16
terabytes often people at Samsung so the
first news isn't about phones but hey
it's definitely about storage so if you
got you know five grand you want the
most ultimate storage out there look for
brand new look for Samsung's latest 16
terabytes SSD coming to market soon at a
whopping five K no free dog included the
next story now Samsung yesterday release
this news the general public they have a
brand new s 6 plus edge and a brand new
note now a lot of the features are still
the same you're still going to get that
same badass 5.7 inch screen internally
though they're going to be some
differences and let's check those out
and why maybe if you're into Samsung you
want to check this out so like I said
the note 5 it's keeping it stunning 5.7
inch quad HD 1440p Super AMOLED display
same one as they had before but now it
surrounds it with a thinner bezel and it
curved back which should help for those
people who like to use their phone with
one hand it was for one foot I'd be in
but now for the first time the galaxy
note 5 lets you write on the screen even
when it's off by using the included
stylus the s6 edge+ offers the same a
5.7 screen but it's
a lot thinner it actually weighs a half
a pound lighter no I'm just joking it's
only a half an ounce later there's a
half a pound that would be amazing but
still a half an ounce and you're talking
phones is still pretty incredible stuff
it's not on that much of a diet another
caveat is with this one you have to
sacrifice the stylist so if you're
wanting the stylist and that's important
to you make sure that you go with the
note the big news is that both phones
have a 2.1 gigahertz exynos 7420
octa-core processor inside of them this
is a bump which brings the galaxy note 5
on par with the s6 and it also includes
4 gigabytes of RAM both run android 5.1
lollipop contain 3000 milliamp hour
batteries another caveat is the battery
is non-removable so if you have problems
with the battery here down the lunch
you're out of luck pal the
batteries however do offer fast charging
and wireless charging capabilities they
both have 16 megapixel rear cameras
5-megapixel front-facing sensors and you
can get either one of these phones with
either 32 gigabytes or 64 gigabytes of
internal storage but there are no more
micro SD slots for external storage now
I know a lot of people that's going to
be a big deal because if you like taking
music and stuff and you want to take
your phone with you you love having that
it's great for pictures and stuff me
personally I'm kind of shying away from
that I don't like it what do you folks
think I want to see you guys as comments
down below but hey Samsung's released
new stuff for those fans of samsung's
new stuff for you baby for fans of the
liquid cooling company EK WB there is
good news for your people now i know a
lot of the hard core tech guys out there
they're going to be saying hey man and a
I oh it's a total total pile of junk I
don't want anything to do that but EK
has taken some of their technology
including their brand new vader fans and
they've incorporated into this brand new
water cooler of theirs now it's their
first day I'll coming to the market
there's going to be a 240 millimeter and
three and sixty millimeter virgin coming
out so you get some choices there now
this thing is going to be no joke at all
DK predator units include EK barter high
static pressure fans and pwm controls
like Moe say I OS the units are
prefilled and preassembled before
shipment other components include 10 x
16 millimeters ear
maintenance rubber tubing g one and a
quarter threaded ports and integrated
quick disconnect QDC the latter of which
allows the Builder to expand the cooling
system without having to drain the
reservoir so let's talk about that for a
moat because that's actually a really
cool thing that means with this
particular unit you can actually shut a
part of it off add other components to
the unit without having to drain you
that means you can fill it continue
using it with your new component but you
don't have to actually completely drain
the unit to keep using it this is a
really cool thing it makes it much more
ergonomic when you're building a system
and if you guys out there know it can be
a real pain in the butt when you got a
completely drain your system and start
from scratch especially your building
systems for shows and stuff like that
you want to use something that you can
get into get in really quickly get out
really quickly easy to assemble but hey
still works so that's pretty much it
folks these things are gonna be coming
to the market really soon and i think EK
will have a hit here because this
company's very very big in the water
cooling circuit and them to come out
with their own aio oh I gotta say it
Swift take you may be having yourself
some competition however with every
grand news always kind of some bad news
right just seems like the way the world
and D fans team red will give you guys a
little mini violin right here you guys
will not get to see this unit until
later in 2016 because right now they're
currently focusing on all the Intel CPUs
and their sockets come on EK no love for
Team Red sad no I'm just kidding that's
just the way the ball bounces but hey
for you AMD fan that's kind of a bummer
but there are all kinds of other
solutions out there for you guys until
they get here so it's all good to go
looking forward to seeing that product
