time alright then folks I gotta say I'm
chillin right now you can see this is
the Cougar armored chair and this thing
is so incredibly comfortable I is
literally falling asleep in here on the
chair just and the computer go in the
background tell you man that ambient
noise just makes me pass out so I just
want to start off by saying this chair
that I'm sitting in or laying in or
whatever it can double almost as a big
that's so comfortable the Cougar armor
is pretty damn cool
I weigh like almost 230 pounds this
chair can take a giant person up to like
265 pounds in this chair because it's
made of such great stuff honestly it's
comfortable all that let me hop back
into position here oh by the way in this
position there's two different ways you
can do it there's a locking button down
here on the bottom it's locks it means
you can't fall all the way back and you
can put it in just the recline position
to sleep or you can make it flip floats
all free flow all the way back up and
down so let me try to hop back up here
or folks oh okay
four-oh got a girl's going to sleep in
this damn thing so that's kind of our
little weird introduction for this
armored chair now they're calling it the
throne of gamers not the truth but I
think it have a little porta potty cut
down so you sit down you know don't have
to go nowhere just cut a hole out of
your trousers sit here with your snacks
over here and you're look for poor thing
there you can play all night so anyways
the first thing about any gaming chair I
feel is the comfort level before
anything about how it's built what it's
made out of anything else if you sit in
the damn chair and it's not comfortable
straight up to that I'm like screw it
this chair right when I set it
incredibly comfortable super duper soft
so let's start out by just starting at
the bottom so the bottom you guys can
see the wheels and all the plastic it's
made of heavy-duty PVC and the gas
cylinder unlike many other gas cylinders
that I've seen out there this one has a
completely iron body now the plastic
ones if you've owned a lot of chairs you
know this crap breaks all the time
they've broken on me
times in fact half the chairs I think
I've ever owned it end up being that
that's telling your casing broke in your
chair is just to crap that and the
wheels are using the two biggest
cabinets of any chair regardless of what
their features are this chair however is
made like a tank I know it said about a
few products is when something's made
good we always compare it to a tank
because obviously tanks going to battle
so that's our comparison beyond that
though this chair is very nice
everything on it is adjustable you can
adjust the height you can adjust how you
saw me before going up and down the tilt
in that you can make it so the z-axis is
completely free-floating or you can lock
it it's made out of leather and another
cool thing about it is that the logo on
this chair is actually embroidered on to
the chair
no iron-on decal no patch no crap like
that this is actually made into the
chair so it's going to last as long as
the chair is made now a lot of people I
think might balk the price could be like
oh my god 250 bucks but if you look for
things on the market you check things
out of the materials that they're made
out of you'll notice that this chair is
actually made of superior stuff all the
stuff back here is made of really good
top-notch soft leather that's right and
as far as being comfort on the back of
the chair it comes with lumbar support
and a neck support the armrests
themselves you can change them to any
access that's why they called in 3d
armrest you can move them from side to
side you can make them go till tea till
tea goes back and forth you can move
them back and forth pretty much any
direction and turn the damn thing upside
down you can do with the armrest you can
also adjust the height so no matter what
you feel comfortable with you can adjust
it up to your complete heist level you
like your arms up high you adjust it all
the way up high this is kind of how I
prefer my stuff but if you know the
person who likes a different way you can
push them back down fully adjustable any
way you want there are a couple of other
things that I really like about the
armored chair for one the placement of
the adjustment things for doing your
lowering or raising the chair are in a
very nice place there's absolutely no
way that you're going to smack these
things with your arms your body and
break them and I like that quite a bit
being completely unobtrusive on the
chair means that no matter what your
going to be doing the controlling you're
not going to like hit the button on
accident' and break it or send yourself
flying back and smack your head when you
least expect it and just to reiterate
about the weight capacities in the
product weight the weight
capacity is 120 kilograms and the
product weight which is how much the
chair weighs without your acid is 21
kilograms or 40 6.30 pounds another
feature that I think it's going to be
very important to a lot of people out
there is how easy is this thing to put
together what's actually really easy to
put together we put the chair together
in less than 20 minutes so from out of
the box up and going was pretty much
about 20 minutes you know that's pretty
easy stuff none of us are rocket
scientists are either but you can easily
look at the directions figure out what
you're doing and have this thing up and
going really quickly now obviously it's
just a chair so I can sit here and like
tell you like yes you know it has this
much of gigabytes of RAM it does this
and that it's a chair to me the bottom
line is this the chairs made of really
nice
all leather plus high grade PVC and like
I said before the gas cylinder is made
very well it has an iron casing so you
know that shit's not going to break on
you it's comfortable it can take a very
large person up to 265 pounds I know
there are some people out there that
weigh 300 350 pounds I'm sorry but it's
kind of hard to find a chair less you
get one it's like really really
SuperDuper made for that type of stuff
this is made to be the ultimate gamers
chair now is it the ultimate gamers
chair it's pretty damn close now I have
one from Noble and that chairs actually
really really comfortable it's a little
bit more than this one I think it's like
almost $500 so there is a significant
price difference but this chair is right
there with that and it's only 250
dollars so if you're looking for
something that's not junk whatsoever I
understand 20 bucks a little bit of
money for somebody but if all you do is
pro gaming or you spend all day long in
your chair doing that's in the gaming
watching TV a lot of blah - blah - you
know what I'm saying
you want something that's comfortable
and like you guys saw the very beginning
of the video you can completely lie back
in this and use this is all lounged here
so you could be gaming doing whatever
get tired turn the lights down you know
use your Google homes which is pretty
cool I got to say well touch back on
that again that later but you could just
basically the hey okay Google shut out
the lights lay back and boom you can
sleep in this chair and I mean you can
sleep in it very comfortably you can
troll Ralph you're one of those people
but if you're most people just lays back
and can shut their eyes I think you're
going to be very
so I'm Eric you guys have been watching
Tekken tomorrow we got lots of stuff
coming up with risen we got lots of
stuff coming up for NVIDIA so this is
kind of like you know one of our videos
in between all that stuff but like I
said if you want a chair that's not
going to break the bank it's not the
most expensive it's not the cheapest
comfort level is high
you guys saw all the adjustment features
so no matter how tall you are how short
you are how wide you are whatever you're
going to probably like this chair quite
a bit so we'll have more information
down below that like button hopefully
you like the chair Hey
if you don't let me know why you don't
because I want to hear your opinions
we'll see you guys back on Tekken
tomorrow for more video goodness
tomorrow and with that said get the hell
out of here let me go back to sleep damn
you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
