you guys back here on the child now we
know that video cards are still
overpriced that's just how things are
one thing I did want to point out before
I jumped in the video is that power
color themselves told me that they have
no control over what the e-tailers and
retailers sell their card for they told
me specifically that they're selling the
cards to them at the price that they're
supposed to be so that means that you
know if this card selling for $4.99
they're selling to new wake for $4.99
and the new eggs raising the price up to
whatever they want it to be they say
they have nothing to do with the price
gouging and they want to make sure that
I related that information to you folks
so I did so we've all seen the power
color Red Devil we've seen both versions
we've seen the Vegas 56 we've seen the
Vegas 64 well now we see something
different we see the red dragon version
you guys are going okay Eric what's a
red dragon version well the most
important difference between the red
dragon version is the other is power
consumption on the red devil 750 watts
is needed on this card 650 watts now
beyond that the boost clocks are a
little bit different now this particular
one comes to market at eleven seventy
seven for its normal clock and 1478 for
its boost and the memory clock speed is
at 800 which is pretty much exactly the
same as the red devil card so that's
what you get you get a card that
actually has a smaller PCB it has a
different cooling out brass and they're
saying that even though this cooling
apparatus is actually smaller than the
previous one
it actually cools much more efficiently
which we'll find out as we jump in and
do all the testing but for right now
let's jump in let's see what comes in
the box in this brand new red dragon
Vega 56 from the people at power color
so first off let's take a look at the
box if you guys don't know this is an 8
gigabyte card featuring HP m2 memory the
further box nothing much there on the
back you can see it supports free sim 2
it supports wot man all the good stuff
that's with an AMD card for overclocking
it's got all the stuff for doing your
streaming all that stuff all included
when you're on the AMD platform all good
right ok that's not what you're looking
for you're looking for the card so let's
pop it to the side of the box here I
will go ahead and remove this carton
take the carton out of the box set it
off to the side we won't try to assault
the camerman today
a little cap over here and let's see
here what we got here
okay so right off the bat we're gonna
see the card everything comes inside of
here with an anti-static bag so you
don't have to worry about your card
getting shorted out let's go ahead and
let's remove the card real quickly get
it out of there
now let's see what accessories come in
this box now in the front this is
usually where they keep the accessories
I don't think there's really anything in
this box so this time it's not really
looking like there is no absolutely
nothing in there so no additional cables
nothing like that you do get their
manual and the drivers but we all know
that everybody's gonna download the
drivers off the internet if they can
because that's always the latest and
greatest drivers and it's what you
definitely want to do you can use if you
don't have internet connection but if
you have one definitely download the
latest drivers so let's get that out of
the way move on to the card itself I'll
set this down here just a nice little
any static area you guys can see a nice
seal here so I'm going to go ahead and
break this seal and devirginized this
card the seal has now been broken the
sacred seal of the red dragon so let's
pull this baby out now this card still
is a huge card you guys can see this
card is extremely long three fan design
pretty much the same as the Red Devil
now what they're saying though is this
card is though a little bit shorter and
you guys can see it is a little bit
shorter now not only is the Red Devil a
longer card it's actually thicker as
well you can see this is just a simple
two slot design so this card is not only
thinner it's actually shorter and it's
supposed to cool even better than the
previous generation card you know three
fans on top you guys can see the GI and
giant heat fins all underneath the card
on the side you can see the same thing
tons and tons and tons of heat fins in
here to keep this card running cool and
I suppose that since I did take the time
to redesign the coin all that it
probably will function better here on
the end you can just see more of the
cooling apparatus take a look at the top
of the card you guys can see that no
longer do you need a dual eight pin
power connection now it's a single eight
and a single six and there are also two
buttons on here one of these is obvious
is going to be for the dual BIOS and the
others
for switching the card into gaming mode
at least that's how it was on the Red
Devil card so I'm assuming that's kind
of going to be the same I looked online
and there manual no actually information
but I'm betting that that's what they're
for another thing that you guys might
notice about this is even though this
car does have a very nice backplate
there's actually a slot back here that's
completely opened up furling the heat
dissipated from the Kart and you know
that many of the cards the whole shroud
covers the entire card and sometimes
that creates heat issues but the design
of this card all that heat is being
dissipated out of the rear of the card
through these vents also crossfire is
completely done to the PCI so you don't
need any bridges anymore no more cables
no more nothing I'm not you know not
really sure why NVIDIA hasn't gone over
the same thing and everything still
requires a cable and all that stuff this
is so much easier to do so much less
hassle you plug your card in you go into
your BIOS and you go into your control
panel for all the AMD stuff and you
enable it and it's that simple
no mess no fuss whatsoever now let's
check out the rear plate in this with
the outputs are we have to display ports
two HDMI ports the card does support
Eyefinity so if you want to use multiple
monitors you'll be able to do that
without a problem
now the actual pricing on this
particular card I haven't seen it get
out yet it's probably gonna be released
over the next week or two but hopefully
we'll see these prizes at a lower price
point than we've seen the Red Devil now
the 56 cards have been going online I've
seen on eBay and stuff anywhere between
700 and $1,000 which is just ridiculous
this card should come to market at about
$500 now whether we're actually gonna
see that price or not from the gougers
out there I don't know I hope we do also
since you guys know that this card is
not being sold for 1,100 or 800 euros
prices if you see in a new way gorillas
places honestly you should boycott it
that's why I'd recommend doing I know
that we're bringing this card and all
that stuff but right now this card isn't
in the market for sale but when it does
come for sale I would make sure the
people that you buy this card aren't
ripping you off in charge and you double
the face value which is just completely
completely BS do you guys know what I
know it so if you see this card for a
nice price sure go ahead and get it but
if you can't find this card for anything
but these thousand dollar prices for a
gamer that's just read
Kilis I'm Miller you guys been watching
Tekken tomorrow whatever information is
available for this card love down with a
like button you guys know what to do and
hey if you're not sub sub the channel
because we got lots of stuff coming up
testing this card we got far cry 5 and
all the high end cards just lots of
stuff coming we'll see you guys later
I'm Network thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
