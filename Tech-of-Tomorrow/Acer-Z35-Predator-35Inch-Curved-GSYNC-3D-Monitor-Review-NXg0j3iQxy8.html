on techno Mar to show you guys one hell
of a bad ass monitor now this is the
Acer predator Z 35 you can see that bad
boy back behind me and I gotta say this
is just one simply incredible monitor
for those people looking for like the
absolute best of the best now you guys
all know the other day we got the white
lightning system from main gear and so
obviously with that system I need a
killer monitor to play my games and do
it and Acer fit the bill many you guys
out there know about this monitor it's
curved
35 inches 21 to 9 aspect ratio just the
most intensed thing for gaming the
curvature screen is 2,000 r i'm they
makin between $2,000 and $3,000
depending on what type of monitor you're
looking at but this thing really does
immerse you in the game it almost
reaches the total outskirts of my
peripheral vision if it was just maybe
42 inches it would be totally phenomenal
but at 35 it's really really nice for
millisecond response time means that
everything on that screen along that
refresh rate is just killer and also
check this out you can actually
overclock the refresh rate to 200
megahertz that's right overclocking this
bad boy is going to be a lot of fun at
144 would have set at right now I don't
get any headaches I get nothing wrong my
eyes don't get hurt at all what's really
cool too is that you can almost fit
three complete webpages on the monitor
at the same time doing two of them
simple easy doing three of them you can
almost get it on there but you could
have like two different things on that
you're working on another one that
you're monitoring and it will do that
absolutely totally perfect also if you
don't want to have speakers on your desk
and you just like some nice simple audio
there also - that's right
- 9 watt speakers that feature DTS in
the back of the monitor you can't see
these things cuz they're built into it
and they sound pretty good for standard
gaming obviously if you want to immerse
yourself all the way you're going to
want to get headphones you can hear
people walking around all that but for
standard gaming and sound when I jump in
and we played the new Star Wars you guys
will see it sounds really good and we're
just playing stuff with nothing in the
way nothing hindering your
ESCA make it look nice this monitor is
really excellent some other really cool
features it features complete pivot mode
you can also adjust it between five and
twenty five degrees and it has a tilt up
and down that goes like think to one
hundred and thirty three millimeters so
you have a nice - judgement
you can adjust the monitor back and
forth tilt it do whatever you want which
is great for doing productivity now
although the z35 predator is geared
towards a gaming monitor I can tell you
right now that this thing can actually
work for productivity as well it has a
three thousand to one contrast ratio so
you know that all the colors and
everything in here are going to be
pretty much matched to the RGB spectrum
so it'll work for your gaming monitor
and it'll work for all your productivity
and it is true black so the screen is
really nice and black and so you see all
your colors and everything is very very
vibrant on the monitor now as far as
connections go on the back for cooking
up most of your main stuff it's going to
be very very easy there are nice easy
access connections for both your display
port your HDMI and also for your USB 3.0
connector and there's also a built-in
USB hub that features five USB 3.0
connections so you're totally hooked up
you can up your mouse your keyboard
everything you want pretty much right
into the monitor if that's what you
choose to do so
let's see am I missing anything I don't
really think I'm missing anything guys I
think that's pretty much all the pretty
much the basic specs of this monitor
more thing to do now is pretty much and
show you guys what it looks like what it
sounds like and why I like it so let's
check out some Star Wars so here we go
man
gaming I'm using those onboard speakers
gonna have to kick some ass here wish I
could go a little faster hop there we go
a little faster we're going here
arriving shortly
oh the big guns are coming in
there's a giant field
all right folks now this is something I
know all of us know Endor with the Ewoks
and now we get to do some speeder racing
that's right speeders oh yeah baby
Oh
whoo boo aah oh no wait oh my god you're
going so fast okay gotta slow down a
little bit there that was so fast oh my
god
whoa oh man this is crazy fun I go
through oh oh yeah more firepower baby
whoo yeah maybe go thank for those Oh
oh this is crazy
oh this is gonna be way more fun once I
get used to really doing it oh but you
guys can see look how awesome the colors
and everything are on this monitor it's
really incredible and like I said it
pretty much does stretch my entire
peripheral there oh I don't want to die
so I better back up here and back we go
whoa trap back out of the gorge
oh oh we oh man all right here we go
again yeah whoa
Oh
that's um it's hard to get
whoa

where are you
I don't know I thought I'd go for a
fricken joyride with the heck
Oh
this is really crazy with mouse and
keyboard
the hem
damn
yes
winding hawk on the missile
yes bah boom all right man so there you
guys have it the Acer Z 35 predator huh
I don't wants to say I mean is this the
absolute best g-sync monitor you can get
your hands on in the market right now
let me see your guys's comments down
below I pretty much think that it is I
mean I met an $1,100 it is a little bit
pricey but this monitor is like simply
incredible it looks great it feels great
there's no screen tearing there's no
nothing going on the game with that
g-sync locked in you can even lock the
vertical sync inside the game which even
locks it even tighter and 144 you know
frames per second put you're going to
match up 144 Hertz refresh rate
everything just looks phenomenal 2560 by
1080p in that big old widescreen format
of 21:9 is just incredible looking so
that's pretty much it folks what the
link down below where you guys can check
one of these eggs out for yourself or if
you want to buy one for yourself because
I know some people out there gonna want
to get one I'm actually going to talk to
you sir and try to borrow a few more
monitors so I can actually do that huge
surround sound thing but honestly for me
for my personal gaming preference I'm
pretty happy with this I'm really
immersed in the game I don't have to
move my head all around to do it I mean
yeah I suppose that's cool but I mean do
you really want to be gaming and going
like this think about it because if but
you had these monitors all the way
around you and you want to do that
you'll be pretty much going like this
the whole time so you'd have to actually
kind of change the dynamic of your
gaming area so for right now I got to
say I'm pretty impressed blue I'm pretty
impressed with the Z 35 this thing is
incredible man so like usual hope you
guys liked this video if so you guys
know what to do down below a like button
will be all the information peace out
I'm going to play some more Star Wars
because I like
