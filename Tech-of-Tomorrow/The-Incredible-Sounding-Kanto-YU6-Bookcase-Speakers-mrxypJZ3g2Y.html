a really great set of bookshelf speakers
that aren't over-the-top expensive but
will actually fill your room with sound
and literally kick your ass with it I'm
serious about this today we're gonna be
checking out the yu6 speakers from Kanto
you guys may have seen that yu4 is they
were the white speakers that we had in
the desc for a long time but now we've
upgraded to the yu6 but real quick
before we dive in and check out these
awesome speakers let's hear a word from
today's sponsor PDF element from
wondershare dealing with PDF used to be
such a pain there's no easy way to
modify the content on the PDFs or
convert the scanned PDFs but with PDF
element it's a totally different story
you can easily create edit convert sign
and OCR PDFs to simplify your document
task work smarter faster and easier
experience PDF element today now to try
PDF element it's absolutely free and
we'll have a link down below if you want
to do so now let's jump in and let's
check out the yu6 speakers so when you
open up the Box the yu6 speakers here's
what you can expect to see inside
obviously the speaker's themselves then
you get a standard audio cable an
optical cable the power cable the remote
control the batteries for your remote
control and last but not least the feet
for the speakers now if you're wondering
hey man well these yu6 speakers fit on
my bookshelf we'll check it out there's
six point nine inches wide 8.1 inches
deep and ten point seven inches high and
each speaker weighs about 10 pounds now
the design features of the yu6 speakers
are also very very nice they're made to
last a really long time and bring you
really solid loud audio that doesn't
distort whatsoever now the makeup of the
speakers is you have a one-inch silk
dome tweeter and a 5.25 Kevlar based
speaker this produces a mass amount of
sound I'm serious these speakers before
we get in farther I gotta say are some
of the best that I heard and they're
definitely going into my room as soon as
this review is over because they are so
so amazing now another thing about
Kevlar if you've ever had paper speakers
you've owned your speakers for years and
years and years if they ever get any
kind of heat or change of weather they
tend to break the foam around the
outside it disintegrates and the paper
itself rips and your speakers are done
the way these are designed with the
Kevlar will last for much much longer
time and give you years and years of
great music value the can't see why you
six speakers also feature Bluetooth 4.0
connectivity and you connect them just
the way you connect any other Bluetooth
device you get your Bluetooth device
they make a hand shake and you're up and
going it's very very simple another
thing about these speakers I think is
really cool is that when you're not
listening to them and no signal comes in
the power cut so it's not drawing any
power and a lot of people have asked hey
when the speakers go into standby mode
do I lose my settings no you don't lose
your settings whatsoever your settings
are completely separate and if you
happen to lose the remote control and
you can't use the remote control you can
still change everything with the volume
knob and dictate the sound exactly how
you like it on the back of the can't you
I use six speakers you will see a
plethora of connections I mean there are
a lot of connections here right on the
top on the left hand side you can see
this RCA left and right jack now one
thing about this is the RCA jack also
doubles as an amplifier for a turntable
sweather use a turntable from yesteryear
or turn tip from now it'll have the
power built inside of it to make it
sound awesome and below that we see the
auxiliary input and then below that we
see a sub out and I think this is really
cool me personally I prefer having a
system that has two speakers and a
subwoofer so myself I'm gonna be hooking
a subwoofer up to that real quick let's
jump over to the right hand side on the
right hand side you can see the opto
connections there's actually two of them
there's an opt one and an opt to jump me
back over to the left hand side you guys
can see there's a ground connection now
what this can be done is you can connect
the wire to this and then connect it to
something in your house that's grounded
to eliminate any noise whatsoever right
next to that is the input selection you
guys can see it's phone or line easy to
change and then next to that we see the
right channel out now you connect one
end of your speaker wire this and the
other to your speaker easy and another
really cool thing about these speakers
is if you happen to need a USB charging
point guess what there's one there as
well last but not least on the bottom
you can see the power on button and
right of that where the power cable
plugs in now real quick though let's
take a look at the remote on the top we
see the power button below that all the
different options for you to select for
your inputs then you have your volume up
and down your treble and bass up and
down below that you have your balance
and then last but not least you get play
previous track and next track controls
okay so those are all the specs and
everything about the options that you
get with the yu6 speakers but with that
said let's check out some audio clips
one of the hardest things for me as a
reviewer to do is actually translate
what the audio and sound of a certain
product sounds like to you guys out
there because when you're listening to
speakers through your speakers at home
it's obviously not the exact same thing
as I'm hearing on my end and I have to
say that these speakers for $279 are
serious editors choice speakers these
things plainly straight-out kick frickin
ass and they sound good no matter what
type of music that you play from it
doesn't matter what you play through
these speakers it sounds good all the
bass is clear if you play flutes all the
instruments are clear if you're playing
guitar all the guitar parts are very
very clear and the best thing of all is
that you can turn these speakers to max
I mean maximum treble excuse me maximum
trouble maximum bass maximum volume and
the speakers are barely moving I know if
you've ever been like a distort esting
out speakers and whatever and you see
the basically bass speakers is like
moving around like this like it's trying
to move all the hair you know the hell
the hair I say so many weird words
sometimes all the air not the hair
and I think gotta know they must been
blown away by the why you sixes but you
know you will be just blown away by that
if you've seen it before the speaker
just moving real big and just like what
the heck it looks like the speaker's
gonna break these don't do this
whatsoever in fact honestly these turned
up to full volume sound their absolute
best I mean if you could literally play
these things at maximum volume all the
time it's badass
obviously not everybody's going to be
able to do that now the turntable option
there are a lot of people out there who
still listen to audio on vinyl let's
just face it there are people who
collect the vinyl and if you're a vinyl
collection you have a really nice
turntable but you're looking for a set
of speakers that you can set on your
bookshelf just forget about and get
awesome audio then these yu6 is will
definitely cover ground for you with the
preamplifier that's built inside of them
everything in Charlie's doing vinyl is
gonna come through it's gonna come
through very very nice so if you've got
it go to a store if there's one around
you and try to check it out and listen
to it because at the end of the day I
think these speakers are honestly
amazing lots of connections
lots of durability they're made very
very well in fact they're really made
like little tanks you know they're ten
pounds piece basically they're made like
little mini
and you can connect so many different
things to them with its optical standard
audio you can Bluetooth it I mean any
word that you can go that has a power
plug you can also take these speakers
with you now I know some people might
say wow dude two hundred and seventy
nine dollars that's a lot of money for
speakers well maybe it's a lot of money
for some gaming speakers that sound good
for explosions and but when you
want music speakers that are for audio
files that sound good at $279 the yu6
that are honestly a steal these guys
paid me absolutely nothing for this
review I've had the other speakers like
you guys saw my desk for months I
totally believe in this product and
these ones honestly blow away the why
you force the why you force were really
nice and they did all the same features
and everything the only thing is that
the bass response and the bass signal in
these is just much bigger these will
fill an entire room even a really large
room with plenty of sound so if you were
a deejay guy and you just want to have
like a little small deejay thing or a
party to be able to play your records on
or whatever and have it to these
speakers without any problem try it you
will be impressed like I said at the end
of the day I really believe these
speakers and here on Tekken tomorrow I
give them an editor's choice if you guys
want to check out more stuff go check
out more reviews about them online and
we'll have a link to and will excuse me
and we'll also have a link down below
where you can check out these speakers
for yourself once again special thanks
that people are winner share for
bringing today's video possible we'll
see you guys back on the channel for
more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
