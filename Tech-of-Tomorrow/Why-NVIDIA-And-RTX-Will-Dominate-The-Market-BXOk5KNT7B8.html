Vidya isn't going anywhere and at this
point they really can't lose and I'll
tell you why but real quick let's hear a
word from today's sponsor Corsair let's

edition is available as well so if
you're looking for a kick-ass gaming
keyboard check out the Corsair k70 mark
2 today Nvidia is a company that has
many fans around the world I mean they
sell the most video cards they have the
most video cards and there are a lot of
people out there who hate them for
things that they've done you know
business-wise now I'll be the first to
admit that Nvidia is a very aggressive
company and they probably will do some
things that you know you and I probably
you know in a handshake agreement
probably wouldn't go hey that's cool bro
but that's business like I said before
and it's just like war at a different
level and NVIDIA has actually set
themselves up now in a position where
there's really no way they can lose and
I'll explain to you wive a little bit of
history when I was a kid now I was a
teenager pretty much on every corner of
every street there was a stereo shop
everybody had a stereo shop man they
were instead of installing car stereos
there were huge speakers by 50 different
companies they had giant buildings I
mean they had crazy commercials man Fred
rated from Frederator group was like my
favorite back in the day and evil tour
guides you know I'm talking about that
was some funny with that guy like
everybody had a commercial it was big
stuff honestly I would say that the
electronic business of
four was even bigger than the PC
industry is right now honestly it really
was even though PC gaming has become a
phenomenon and changing of the way PC
things all the way around pcs really
don't get as much actual popularity as
electronics did back in the day there
are more things to do with it and it's
changing and now when I was in my 20s
things changed all of a sudden were gone
all of these places that sold
electronics all these places that used
to sell you know Sony Kenwood Onkyo all
these different brands well guess what
almost all of those particular brands
are gone except for the people that were
on top the people that were on top names
like Sony they still around still making
stereos but most of the people back in
the day that we're doing that are out of
the business and only the ones that had
a big name back then survived okay
now in my 20s and my 30s
there were PC stores everywhere
everywhere they sold pcs they had huge
conventions that took up mass amounts of
Vegas way more than we see now if you
think the show now is big you ain't seen
nothing the old shows back in the day or
way way bigger than the CES shows now
they honestly were they were just
absolutely huge compex was giant size I
worked there for many years and then we
saw the PC industry do the same thing
right we've seen it shrink no longer are
there a kazillion companies out there
making pcs there are a handful you know
there there's there a few out there but
there's nowhere near as many as they
used to be a lot of companies just fell
by the side of the road gateways one of
them I mean you know what I'm talking
about a lot of companies just went away
and now you can only buy early PC stuff
at a very you know limit amount of
places you can get some but like a
Walmart you can get some at Amazon you
can get some at Fry's Electronics
there's a few places out there but no
longer are there like you know pcs being
sold in PC parts being sold especially
dedicated places for selling PC parts
that stuff's all gone to the
you've only really got very you know
very limited amount of those stores
around now and the PC industry is still
shrinking now as we go into the future
the reason that Nvidia is not going to
be able to lose is they've already
positioned themselves right now as the
number one company right now like I said
love them or hate them Nvidia is number
one the new RDX cards that have come out
almost all the pre sales have sold out
already they're almost all completely
gone now you guys have heard about a
vacuum right and the reason this is
happening is even if these cars you know
aren't the greatest thing you know since
flavored soda you know I mean you know
then I like the invention the wheel
there's been no new technology for so
long that people are like just screw it
I just want to buy it to have it cuz
hell it's something new and the people
who got the cash flow to do this well
hey they're going to go ahead and
they're gonna buy these cards regardless
of whether they're better they're faster
or any of that other stuff and the
reason there's this vacuum is because
AMD hasn't come up with anything that's
really competitive to them whatsoever
the only competition that NVIDIA has at
this point is Nvidia real Nvidia is
their only competition you know I mean
the only people they're competing with
are themselves and we can tell by this
launch at least I can tell by the launch
the way things are going that these
cards probably are just a stop gate
Nvidia had released something people are
bored with the other cards so you know
they needed to get something out to the
market and they did and in the future as
the market completely shrinks and
shrinks and shrinks we're probably only
going to see these companies maybe
forever and there may even come a time
you know I hope it never happens but
there may even come a time when Nvidia
is the sole game where they're the
people making video cards chips and
everything else you don't know really
how the future is going to pan out but
at this point there's no way that unless
something drastically happens
that nvidia can fail there ahead now
they'll be ahead for a long time in the
future and on the note of you know
technology you know taking longer and
longer longer but kind of thing about
this head award this exactly but really
before you know the aliens Lander you
know have we made these a great
technical breakthroughs you know in the
last few years before that technology
didn't jump ahead of itself that much
honestly like we're all really mad
because it took you know two years to
get to get a new a new video card from
Nvidia but think about it how many
thousands of years probably literally
the technology not even move an inch you
know the same horse-drawn buggy
same wheel same chassis same stuff you
know all pretty much stayed the same
nobody like you know really came up with
anything new it wasn't like hey man
check out this new you know horse-drawn
carriage I did it run smoother it does
this I'm sure there's probably a little
bit going on but there was never
anything like you know super blown
changes within that stuff so we've
become spoiled as a people because we're
so used to getting things you know
bam-bam-bam with this new technology all
the time we'll check it out folks the
technology in the PC world is going the
way of electronics it's going to slowly
and slowly shrink more Mornay yes there
will be PC gaming that's going to save
the industry you know thank God unless
unless like I said somebody comes up
with a console that's like a hybrid
between a hybrid you know PC you know
and a computer night other processors
similar to like that but I'm talk about
something that's just really completely
dedicated to that right out of the bat
where there's a chip read and pull it
out put a new video card into this I've
actually spoke with Nvidia about this
too it's a really good idea in the
future you should really be able to just
have almost like a portable computer
they take with you everywhere you come
home you dock it up you have a big
powerful computer possibly at home but
you should be able to change out your
graphic cards and all this stuff for
whatever want to do pretty much with
just card just slide them in and out and
upgrade what you want to go and I think
that's the direction that stuff will
really start to take off with and let's
just face it if you're at a PC
tournament you really don't want this
giant big old huge
computer that be used to look around
back in the day you want a computer
that's nice and small that's super
freakin powerful for you to play your
games and that's the way things are
going and the way NVIDIA has set
themselves up now
with the market and everything whatever
happens in the future like I said unless
something really drastic drastic happens
with the company they're going to be
there and they've expanded off into
their technologies as well so at this
point right now Nvidia has lots of money
in their bank they're the number one
company in the world for GPUs they're
their only competition really at the
moment and they're actually happened to
hamstring themselves probably in order
not create a big giant market vacuum
that you know AMD can't compete with it
all because like I said before if Nvidia
really did release some card let's just
face it that just did everything so just
super awesome that AMD couldn't even
like hold a candle to it that would
really affect AMD's business big time
bad it would hurt them and I don't
really think that that's the way things
are going to go they're going to give
them pretty much a breathing room a
breather right there for them to go
ahead and catch up hopefully AMD will
release something newer and we'll see
newer better stuff but if AMD doesn't
create newer technologies and keep
making Nvidia you know competitive it's
not really a Nvidia's fault if they
released you know a stop-gap card in
between that just to keep the market
going like I said at this point right
now they can't fail help people don't
even know what their new cards do and
they already bought them all see what I
mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
