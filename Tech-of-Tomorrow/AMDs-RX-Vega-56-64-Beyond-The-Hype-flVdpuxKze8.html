by a Hanson robotics
alright tech fans it's the time you have
been waiting for that's right two
performance cores of the rx 64 and 56
Vega cards we've got them here in-house
so let's first check out those cards
what they look like let's check out the
specs the performance and see at the end
of the day if they're worth your hard
earned cash let's go one thing I want to
mention right off the bat is that the
reference 64 and 56 cards look totally
identical a lot of people made comments
on my unboxing videos saying why didn't
get their silver shredded one well the
silver shredded one that's just a
special edition card these are actually
the standard reference cards on the
front you guys can see it's a completely
black shroud covering the entire card
there's a single blower style fan with
the R logo on it and at the top of the
card you guys see once again the Radeon
name spinning the card around to the
rear you guys can see there's absolutely
nothing there just the shroud still
covering it then we'll go ahead we'll
take a look at the top of the card we'll
spin it around you guys can see it
easily says the Radeon name again there
are two eight pin power connectors on
both cards now this is where the cards
differ a little bit and we'll get to
that in just a minute now taking a look
at the top of the card the first thing
you guys are going to notice that up on
top there's a little switch now this is
the bio switch and what's really cool is
you can set up to three different
profiles inside of the control panel
underneath that we see the Radeon name
once again and both cards feature two
8-pin connectors now the difference is
though is that the 64 card requires 295
watts and the 56 card requires 210 watts
on the back of the card you guys can see
they have a pretty nice heat shield on
there and they also have the GPU being
open so that it can be air cooled as
well as cooled by the fan on top over on
the right you see a little on and off
button and this also changes the color
of the lights you can change it between
red and blue and right below the lights
which is something called GPU tech and
what this does this shows you by a light
how much power the card is using and
taking a look at the cards connections
both cards feature three display ports
and a single HDMI port underneath the
hood both cards of the Vega 10 series
and they're both 40 nanometer process
now the transistor count on the RX Bega
64 is 12.5 billion that's exact
the same on the 56 now this next spec I
think this is exactly how they named
their cars because the RX Vega 64
features 64 compute units and the 56
features obviously 56 now as far as
stream processors go the 64 has 4096 and
the 56 has 3584 the base GPU clock on
the 64 is twelve hundred and
seventy-four megahertz and the base
clock on the fifty six is eleven hundred
and fifty-six megahertz
the boost clock on the sixty-four is
fifteen forty six megahertz and the
boost on the Vega 56 is fourteen hundred
and seventy one megahertz the memory
bandwidth is also a little different on
the Vega 64 we see four hundred eighty
four gigabytes a second and on the fifty
six we see four hundred and ten
gigabytes a second peak a single
precision performance on the 64 is up to
twelve point seven teraflops and on the
fifty six it's up to ten point five
teraflops both cards feature 256 texture
units both cards also feature 64 ops the
memory interface on both cards is also
identical at 2048 bits all right so
that's what the cards look like and all
their features now let's talk about some
of the software features that come with
Vega frame rate target control or F RTC
is a Radeon software feature meant to
ensure that your graphics card isn't
consuming power in ways that will
necessarily contribute to better
gameplay F RTC allows the user to set a
maximum frame rate the game shouldn't
ever exceed you can enable the F RTC and
choose the frame rate cap for each game
in the gaming section of the Radeon
software control panel users may choose
to use F RTC in different ways depending
on their preference for instance a
particularly eco-conscious gamer mix
decide to memorize power draw and noise
by choosing a 60 frame per second cap to
correspond with his or hers displays 60
Hertz refresh rate this makes sure that
no more frames are rendered than
necessary to update to display in each
cycle meanwhile an esport enthusiast
might choose a capital 120 FPS on a 60
Hertz display in order to maintain quick
response times and some users may not
wish to impose any performance limits on
their GPUs at all however F RTC is there
if you want to use it another feature is
Radeon chill Radeon chill takes GPU
power savings a step beyond a four
TC by adopting a dynamic approach to
ingame power management Riddhi unchill
offers users inputs in order to
understand when fast action is taking
place on screen and when it isn't when
there's not too much action and the
users view it's largely static chill
reduces frame rates in order to save
power and hopefully this will be done
without the game ever noticing anything
is happening as soon as the key press or
mouse input starts the action radion
chill ramps up the frame rates
instantaneously to keep gameplay feeling
fluid some of the biggest titles in
eSports including dota 2 league of
legends and overwatch are ideal
candidates to play with Radeon chill
Radeon chill also pairs well with AMD
freesync technology you may want to try
tuning your favorite games Radeon chill
minimum and maximum FPAA rates to
correspond to your displays refresh rate
for instance if your display can range
from 30 to 90 Hertz try setting the
Radeon shield minimum to 30 frames per
second and the maximum at 90 frames per
second
Radeon shows minimum and maximum frames
per second range is set to 40 to 144
Hertz by default for most gaming titles
and if you want to navigate through
different game profiles you can check
these out in the gaming tab another
feature of the AMD Vega is enhanced sync
and hand sync is a new vsync mode that
seeks to combine the optimal display
refreshing behaviors for multiple
situations when the game's framerate
exceeds this place peak refresh rate
enhancing doesn't limit the game's
performance instead enhance sync shows
the most recently completed frame on
each display interval this reduces input
lag without introducing the usual
tearing art effects commonly vsync is
disabled another feature with Vega is HB
CC or the high bandwidth cache
controller Radeon rx Vega cards are
capable of using their advanced memory
subsystems to benefit gaming in a unique
fashion the first wave of radian rxt
eiga cards all ship with 8 gigabytes of
HBM to a high bandwidth cache which is
enough local GPU memory to satisfy the
requirements of virtually all today's
most visually demanding games however
things change and game requirements tend
to grow over time
the high bandwidth cache controller is a
forward-looking option built into the
Radeon software control panel that lets
you turn on the HPCC capability built
into all Vega GPUs when enabled
feature will allocate a portion of the
host systems main memory for the GPU to
use the amount of memory used is
selectable via a slider any system
memory devoted to H BCC will be paired
with rx Vegas cards onboard memory to
create a total HB CC allocation for
instance four gigabytes of system memory
plus the RX Vega cards eight gigabytes
of HP m2 would result in a total pool of
12 gigabytes of graphic memory all right
tech bands real quick before we jump
into our test system in the scores let's
check out a word from today's sponsor
Hanson robotics professor Einstein is an
amazing expressive and playful robot
that can teach you science and even
train your brain not only as Professor
Einstein a learning tool he can take a
walk he can smile he can point he can
even go crazy and turn his head and
blink and when you connect to the cloud
he can talk to you about science math
people and anything in between professor
Einstein makes it easy to understand any
of the facts that you ask him to from
astronomy to physics to geology and so
much more the possibilities are really
endless if you can think of it professor
Einstein can answer it to interact with
professor Einstein all you need to do is
download their app this works with
either an Android or iPad device
professor Einstein can keep your brain
active by playing fun addicting games
that you can learn from as well as
simple and difficult quizzes to keep
your noggin in shape this is a win win
in my book because you can learn and
still have fun so if you were looking
for something to bring the whole family
together and something that anyone can
learn from I would highly recommend
checking out professor Einstein now
let's get to work
alright so if you guys follow the
channel the system that we use for all
of our testing is called the producer
system this is a pretty much over the
top AMD system we've changed a few
things in it however the main thing that
we change was the CPU it used to have a
700 X we put in 1800 X in it and we also
put a really nice liquid cooler and that
will have a shot of it so you guys can
check it out now one thing of note
before we actually jump into the testing
is that AMD recommends these cards to be
rented 1440 ultra-wide which means at 34
40 by 1440 and if you
use vsync at 144 monitor you'll be good
to go
we tested at 1440 and we tested it 4k
and with that said let's jump into the
benchmark song let's rock out
do you do
now as far as the tents go you guys can
see that the 1080i is running the
hottest out of the bunch you guys can
see the RX Vegas 64 running at 85
Celsius and the second hottest of the
bunch
now the 1070 which is pretty much the
direct competition to the 56 it ran at
83 Celsius but you guys can see that
Vega 56 rented amazing 77 Celsius so
even though it actually takes 60 more
watts of power it actually runs cooler
alright Tech fans so there you guys have
it everything you need to know about the
brand new AMD rx Vega 64 and 56 video
cards now right off the bat I want to
tell you guys that the 56 is pretty much
geared to be competing with the 1070 and
you guys can see in the scores that
pretty much across the board that this
thing competes and beats it in almost
every case and it's also a little bit
cheaper actually about 50 dollars
cheaper so if we're going to do a price
comparison this car would actually
definitely win against the 1070 at this
time point now the 64 comes to market
and a hundred more dollars and to be
quite honest with you if I was going to
spend my money I would probably buy the
56 the difference between the two cards
isn't that great to me to be paying that
extra money so at the end of the day if
you're really looking to get a great
card from AMD that's not going to break
the bank it's not like five hundred six
hundred dollars it's right in that
middle spot of about four hundred
dollars which is quite fair I think for
the stuff that it does now the only
caveat however and some people are going
to bitch about this I know is that the
56 does take 60 more watts being at 210
watts that you need for power
requirements and the 1070 only takes 150
so that's like the biggest factor in
your world then you may want to consider
that but beyond that as far as outright
scores go and you guys saw the
temperature it actually runs cooler and
faster in most instances than the 1070
and even in some cases it's keeping up
with the 10 H depending on the game now
the 64 in the other hand it's a little
bit faster like I said I mean if you're
looking for great performance you don't
want to buy a liquid-cooled card or you
don't want to buy that special edition
card this might be the sweet spot for
you now one thing I also want to mention
that AMD really pushes that the best
that you're going to get is on a free
sink 144 Hertz monitor so if you can get
your hands on one of those you'll get
the absolute best gaming experience
across the board now if you just have a
regular monitor it'll still be fine
actually we did all of our testing on a
regular monitor I meant took the free
sink monitor from the beginning but we
started testing I was like whoa we're
halfway done that's not the biggest you
know deal in the world anyways but you
guys can see these cards run very well
no they're not the 1080 TI killer but
also they don't cost anywhere near as
much as a 1080i 1080 is are about six to
seven hundred dollars depending on who
you buy it from these cards are well
below that at $4.99 that's a good price
for the 64 but for me the sweet spot is
definitely the AMD rx 56 and like usual
download like button hope you guys liked
this video we'll have more information
and links to all the parts in our build
i'm network you've been watching taken
tomorrow
Vega it's finally here there are the
numbers let me know in the poll will you
buy this card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
