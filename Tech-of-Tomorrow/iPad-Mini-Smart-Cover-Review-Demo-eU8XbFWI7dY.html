the tech odom our youtube channel it's
me and buddy dog my co-host today and
we've got something interesting today to
show you folks now we're going to look
up now this is the new magnetic iPad
Mini smart cover now this thing is going
to obviously come with the Apple price
tag but it actually has some pretty good
functionality it's really interesting
when we did the samsung one the samsung
one had a few things that we didn't
really like but this one's actually
pretty cool and it's very easy to use
you guys see it's got a bunch of little
folds and stuff all in it these can be
used for a couple of different
applications now as far as using it goes
well you guys saw I magnetically headed
up there so check it out just goes right
here take your magnetic slider it's on
there now some cool things about it when
you close the unit it puts the unit to
sleep and if you open it back up it
wakes the unit right back up so that's
pretty cool thing it can also be used
for a couple of different things as well
and let's show you those first of all
you can use as a stand to use for doing
typing on as I'm doing right here check
out the message to all you folks right
there tell me how you feel now let's
check it out where you can actually use
it to watch a movie or to play a game so
for 40 bucks I know it's a little bit
pricey but hey it actually does have
some functionality let me hear what you
guys have to think in the comments down
below but I mean everything's pretty
pricey nowadays it's pretty durable
though it's magnetic I mean you could
take it around to any other one you
wanted to not that you might but if you
wanted to you could but it's simple it's
40 bucks and it's got some good
properties to it let me hear what you
guys think let me know if you like the
video if you do do me the favor always
