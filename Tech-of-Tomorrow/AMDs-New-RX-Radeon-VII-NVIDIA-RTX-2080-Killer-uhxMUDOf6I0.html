going to be a very exciting year lots of
stuff was announced at this year's CES
we got new video cards coming we've got
new CPUs coming just lots of stuff
coming from AMD including you know cloud
gaming they're just they're really
jumping into it this year so basically
unless you've been living under a rock
or living at you know
in a cave or just ignoring what's going
on in the PC tech industry you guys all
know that AMD has now announced the
brand-new Radeon seven card okay now
this card supposed to gonna have 60
compute units supposed to be about
thirty percent faster than we've seen
with the Vegas 64 and that's where I
want to stop right there so we're
talking 30 percent better than a Vegas
64 where were that performance exactly
set this this card at that's what I'm
kind of really exactly wondering cuz I
was honestly thinking that if AMD was
gonna be releasing a card this year that
it really would have been at least
trying to compete with the 2080 Ti and
it seems it the release of this card 16
gigabytes of high bandwidth memory
they're not specifying exactly what type
of memory and 1 terabyte a second of
memory bandwidth like I said it's
supposed to be 30 percent better than
the Vegas 64 for content creation
blender DaVinci Resolve 15 Adobe
Premiere open CL against the Vegas 64 at
4k max settings it seems like it's doing
about 35 percent better in battlefield 5
25 percent better in fortnight 42
percent better and strange Brigade this
is using Vulcan technology so all in all
these numbers do look pretty good for
battlefield 5 of DirectX 12 we're seeing
in RTX 2080 with the score of 61 they're
saying the Radeon 7 is gonna have a
score of 62
obviously right you know one better one
up on them right whether it happens
we'll have to see far cry 5 DirectX 11
61 for the 20 80 62 again for the Radeon
7 this number seems to be repeating
itself here and for Strange Brigade with
the Vulcan it says RT X 20 80 at 73 and
the Radeon 78 87 so actually more than
10 frames per second
you know when it comes out now it's
supposed to be available February 7th
for about $700 so let's swallow that up
right now $700 okay now I understand
that this is going to be the very first
card in the world to be made on the
seven nanometer process I was really
thinking that the RX 590 was gonna be
made on this process because that's what
a ham dia led me to believe but instead
you know that came out with still the 12
so I was kind of like okay so now it's
finally coming so that's the big deal
smaller dies mean better yields which
should mean better pricing is let's face
it if they can make more chips on the
same wafer that should be able to
translate into lower prices into your
pocket right well if a cards gonna be
coming now to market at $700 from AMD
sure with Nvidia pricing off the
roof I mean we've all heard everybody is
really pissed off at Nvidia for a lot of
reasons right now I admit that the r-tx
the 2060 if you are upgrading from
something near the catches I think it's
a pretty good up trade choice if you're
looking just to play games some of the
stuff about it's not gonna really be
that that future-proof some users
schooled me send me some some links to
some articles so I checked it out so it
does look like some of those features in
the card are going to be you know not
the best thing so that cards gonna be
$350 so you can't sli those cards so you
can't take two of those cards to compete
against this new seven card whatsoever
so that's just not going to happen and
with two of these seven cards we don't
know how they're gonna do in crossfire
but maybe two of them in crossfire would
be faster than a twenty atti r-tx card
right it's possible right we all know
those numbers always don't translate it
really depends on the game developer how
close they work with the company and how
those numbers are gonna translate across
the board but since we all know that you
know if you want the top of the line
founders Edition card it's going to cost
you all you know like almost $1,300 you
could almost buy two of these cards now
$6.99 is what they're saying it's going
to be priced at maybe it'll be a little
bit lower than that I know that AMD fans
traditionally do not like paying
SuperDuper high
prices for video cards so at the end of
the day I'm gonna ask you this though is
your hate for NVIDIA so strong that even
if Nvidia had a card at the same price
level as AMD and it totally just made
that card look terrible would you still
want to buy the AMD card I mean excuse
me buy you know the Nvidia card instead
of the AMD card or would just because
you hate the things that go on with them
you just say just screw it because I'm
gonna be on so a lot of people think
that I favor and Vidya it's not that I
favor and Vidya people get this
completely wrong I favor the best
technology so whatever technology I can
stick inside of my PC or my son's PC or
any of my clients pcs that I know is
going to give them the absolute best
performance that's usually what I try to
direct people and what I like to use
myself now AMD even though they've had
great pricing and they have really good
stuff
another really crazy things to just
throw in here real quick I went up this
morning I was trying to look up prices
on the rx 40 and I was completely
utterly blown away because these cards
are going for like four hundred and
fifteen dollars and up depending on
where you buy them and that's just
absolutely crazy especially when you can
get yourself an rx 594 around two
hundred and fifty bucks
it's like okay really crazy stuff I
think the 590 is a really nice card I
really wish that it would have come to
market about $200 if it would have been
a $200 card
honestly I would have said it was like
the greatest card since sliced bread and
sliced cheese for the entry-level market
unfortunately pushing into that 250
range and knowing that for $100 more you
can get a car that actually is a lot
faster
that's where once again it starts to me
to get to get things going on because
this car that's coming out from AMD
right now but it's gonna be coming out
the Radeon seven it's going to be their
top-of-the-line flagship card at $700
and it's rumored to only be like what we
saw like one number better or maybe a
few numbers better than the 2080
I mean I don't know I don't know we're
gonna have to really see when the card
hits the market what it is but for me if
two cards are priced identical
the same I myself personally I'm gonna
buy the card that gets the better
performance period that's just how I am
I don't care if it's a few dollars more
but if you know I see a card for $700
and I see another card for 700 maybe 720
even 730 and that other card is much
faster that's the card I'm going to go
with I don't really care about company
politics unless I start reading stuff
about people being harmed or children
being slaved we all know that Nvidia
plays hardball Intel plays hardball
these guys always do crazy stuff that
pisses off everybody in the world
because they're like wow why are these
guys doing this yeah I admit some of the
stuff is probably a little bit on the
shady side I try to pretty much stay out
of that if I started reading stuff about
anybody Nvidia AMD like enslaving
children or causing pain to people or
hurting people my opinion would change
but just seeing people do kind of just
devious business things that to me just
falls in the category of corporations I
mean if you watch any movie anywhere
corporation's I've said this a thousand
times are evil AMD is evil - you don't
believe but they are all corporations
are evil they have one goal in mind to
get your money in their pocket into
their shareholders pocket and they want
to win the day when it comes to making
money that's their goal they're like an
army but instead of going out and taking
lives their goal is to take sales that's
what their job is what I'm really hoping
though that this year I'm really hoping
that AMD delivers on their promises
that's what I really hope for I think
that AMD has been an underdog a long
time I always like the underdog to win I
would love to see AMD come up and smack
Intel and smack Nvidia it would be great
anybody who thinks otherwise out there
about me you really don't know who I am
or what I am about if AMD
could produce those numbers and produce
those products I would be totally behind
them saying hey awesome awesome awesome
the only thing is my experience with AMD
for the most part is giant hype like a
giant rock concert and then you get
there and it's not exactly what you were
expecting you're expecting pyrotechnics
explosion and you get there and it's a
drum set in a guy with a guitar you know
I'm saying that's just been my
experience I'm not saying that that what
they bring to the table is not
or solid products because most the time
all their products are good and solid
but when launch time usually comes AMD a
lot of times to me fails on their
promises I hope that would this new
Radeon seven that they keep it their
promises I hope their new CPUs that come
out are really good I'm hoping this is
the year for AMD but we'll have to see
so until then we're just going to chill
back and wait this new cars are gonna be
here right around the corner my
birthday's in February I'm a Pisces so
February 22nd I'll be 54 years old
that's right I'm getting up there in the
years so I am I've been around a long
time in this industry but that's it man
let me hear your guys opinions down
below are you looking forward to all
these new AMD products and do you think
that this will be the year that AMD will
actually catch up with both Intel and
NVIDIA and slap those boys around a
little bit I want to know what you have
to say and at the end of the day are you
looking for a company that you just feel
like they're the nice guy or are you
looking for a card that really kicks ass
in your system be honest with yourself
and me peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
