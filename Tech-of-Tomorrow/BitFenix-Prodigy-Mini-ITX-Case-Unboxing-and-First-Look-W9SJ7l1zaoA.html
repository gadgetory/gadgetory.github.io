the tech demo YouTube challenge to bring
you guys an unboxing the first look at a
really interesting case by the people
over at bit Phoenix
this is their new prodigy case it's a
micro ATX case it has really cool
features it's all white and supposedly
has like some really nice rubber touches
on the outside they're supposed to make
it nice and soft and it's totally
portable
so beyond that let's just jump in and
let's see what comes in the box
first off I'll take my little army knife
right here it's like a little helicopter
knife
take that go ahead make a quick little
click make a incision here make the
incision there make another incision
here now let's just show you guys some
of the stuff here let's sit the camera
to zoom in show you guys from the box
right here and wrap it around what you
guys see the back of the box here is one
of the nomenclatures he tells you this
is the arctic white version then we have
the specifications on the side here
which we'll go over after we do the
unboxing so let's pop it open case top
pops open right on top and here we have
the prodigy quick installation guide now
if you guys remember this but in the 80s
there was a band called prodigy and they
were like one of the craziest bands I
have ever seen they were all keyboards
wild hair some crazy guys from England
that's the first time I saw a project
that's what it reminded me so I'll go
ahead and set that off to the side then
we'll bring the case out set it right
here we're gonna have to go out a camera
range for this one just go ahead and
take it pull it out the box take the box
and throw it at the cameraman all right
now let's flip this bad boy around you
guys can see it all comes completely
sealed plastic wrap all that good stuff
so let's start slowly taking it apart
more stuff to throw at the cameraman you
guys know how we love that one more to
say that the cameraman alright then so
this thing's pretty lightweight you go
ahead and take it out of the bag now the
unbagging of the case it's an unboxing
slash unbagging I hate these bags cuz
they get caught on everything in the
case and just ended up ripping them off
anyways alright then cop boom so let's
start off let's flip it around to the
front doubling so here's the front very
very simple elegant a single Bay right
here for your CD player everything else
is all
back behind see if there's anything else
out here to take a look at all righty
then toke the front of it that's it got
you little bit peanuts logo flip to the
top two handles so you can carry it
around also on the top you see there's a
grill right here there's a little switch
right here you just switch that so you
can remove this this is where you'd melt
the top to 120 millimeter fans will show
you now this side ruin nothing to that
side go ahead and we will remove the
side door Bay now this one's very easy
some of the other ones that I've tried
to get off were hard you guys have made
some comments about that but these ones
are little tiny little rubber little
feet these particular hand screws are
very easy to turn they have a big rubber
base around them to grip on your finger
and so they're very easy to remove I had
no problem with that whatsoever I'll go
ahead and remove the side of the case
you see the inside completely white on
white let me go ahead and just take that
set that back to the back let's look
inside of here here's our accessories
little thing right here pop this open
let me use the trusty knife one more
little time over here here's the
accessories package this has all the
different stuff that you need to mount
bands and stuff inside the case now one
thing that's really tripped by those
cases if they say that this is made so
that you can use a water cooler now
that's gonna be really interesting if
you put a CD player in here on the top I
don't believe you're gonna be able to
use the water cooler here now we take a
look at the interior of the case now
inside the project you can see that you
can mount a dual rad right here on top
but there would be a drawback to that if
you put the dual rad in here you're not
gonna have a place for your CD player so
if you don't care about having a CD
player and some people don't you can put
the dual right in you can have it
completely enclosed water cooling system
this little tiny thing all the bays
easily pull out they're all type you
just bend place your drive inside of it
easy lock completely tool free slides
back in you got there sliding stuff you
can actually
entire cage out of here the entire cage
pulls out so you guys can see we can
remove the cage
additionally then when I move the cage
we can see the front fan mounted right
here on the Front's a little bit hard to
see but you guys can see that there's
the front fan that comes with it has an
adoption if you want to use another one
in there I don't know where you put it
but that one should be enough you can
see down here is where the power supply
is going to mount it comes with all the
screws and everything right here so you
just put it in there
now that close it you're good to go now
we show you the rear of the case you can
see there's a single rear fan here so
the front ones gonna be bringing in air
in this one's gonna be taking air out
for airflow now we'll go ahead and
remove the other side panel once again
we see these little two thumb screws
very easy to use now before I move the
side panel I just want to swing it
around I want to show you guys this here
on the side we can see we have the power
button the reset button the mic button
headphone button and two USB 3.0 ports
now let's go ahead and remove the side
panel okay I was gonna try to remove the
side panel which you can move I would
not suggest it I don't know if the
camera can get the camera inside there
and see this but you can see that all
those connections are wired in there so
at this point there's really no reason
for you to just pull this off I don't
want to take a chance of taking the
wires out but at least you guys can see
that it's kind of a strange design to be
on the side like that maybe it won't
hurt anything later on so last but not
least let's flip it around now let's
talk about the features of this new
little project case by a bit Phoenix now
the materials the case is made of steel
and plastic it comes in two different
colors these are black black or white
white it's dimensions are 250 by 404 by
359 millimeters it's mini ITX only it
has one removable 5.2 Bay it has five
3.5 bays three plus two or modular it
also has a his Explorer hard to believe
but it says it has x 9 2.5 inch drive
bays five plus two plus one plus one now
as far as the cooling goes you get
options it comes with a sink
120 millimeter fan but it has an option
for an additional one as well cooling
through the rear it includes a 120
millimeter fan but it also has an option
for 140 millimeter as well on the top
you get 120 millimeter but these are
optional none come with the case PCI
slots there are two the i/o is USB 3.0
by two HD audio the power supply
supports ps2 ATX on the bottom it says
multi-directional
it also says it comes with a little bit
of extras it comes with the fiber flex
composite handles soft touch surface
treatment filtered intake and tool free
drive locking so that's it folks if
you're really into small stuff
and you want a case it's totally
portable that's white you like that
color this might be the thing for you
now the only drawback I might see is if
you want to do water cooling you will
have to sacrifice that's right you'll
have to sacrifice the CD player if you
want to use a dual rad beyond that the
little project is you case is nice there
are no sharp edges in it whatsoever it's
made nicely it's very easy to use I'm
looking forward to building a system and
checking it out further so see you guys
back here in TECO tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
