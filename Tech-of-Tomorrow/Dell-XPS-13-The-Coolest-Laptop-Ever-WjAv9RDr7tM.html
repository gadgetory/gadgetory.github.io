back to another edition of TECA tomorrow
I'm Eric your host today we're gonna
look at something that's really cool
something we usually don't look at a lot
here at Tech Oh tomorrow and that's
laptops why does because mainly I work
at home all the time and don't really
have a use for a laptop all that much
but this one is actually something
really incredible this is the brand-new
Dell XPS 13 now this thing's totally
geared to compete obviously with the
products from Apple like everything
that's pushing it is like hey this
things better it's faster it's lighter
it basically it's kicking ass on a damn
Apple notebook that's right and actually
it is it's actually the world's smallest
13-inch laptop and it's really
incredible has a touchscreen with
Gorilla Glass backlit keyboard and just
all kinds of killer features one of my
favorites actually though is the touch
screen that's right and the resolution
on this is 3200 by 1800 so it's pretty
incredible it also weighs only three
pounds I got really lucky I get this
thing sent to me by Dell to check out
and it actually had a lot of accessories
inside this premiere backpack we'll talk
about those later but right now let's
jump in and let's talk about the
features on the new Dell XPS 13 the Dell
XPS 13 is the world's first and only
laptop to feature infinity display which
is totally cool it's a touchscreen
features edge to edge Corning Gorilla
Glass and is actually one of the coolest
things I've ever seen on a laptop just
the touch screen alone is really awesome
when you're on a webpage and things like
that you can very easily just touch your
fingers on the screen and increase the
size you drive to go in any settings
make any changes whatsoever and it's
actually one of my favorite features
like I said of the laptop starting out
looking at the laptop the entire outside
of the laptop is made of matched
aluminum and carbon fiber so you know
this thing's gonna be one tough mother
taking around the road as we move down
from the screen down at the bottom of
the left-hand side of the screen you can
see the little webcam
halters of the far right is the power
button down the very front is the
precision keyboard which also features a
carbon-fiber resting-place for your hand
as we go down to the front of the laptop
we can see the keyboard which is totally
backlit which is really cool for working
in dark space and other things like that
because you can actually see what you're
doing as we spin around to the right
side of the XPS 13 we see the first of
the two stereo speakers the SD card slot
USB 3.0 with power share and finally the
noble lock slot as we take a look at the
left-hand side of the laptop we see the
AC power a mini display port for
connecting external monitors another USB
3.0 with power share headset jack and a
battery gauge button and indicators
showing you how your battery level is
doing and then last but not least the
second of the stereo speakers under the
hood of the XPS 13 is a fifth generation
Intel Core i5 5200 u processor now this
is the latest broad willyou processor
features a 2.0 gigahertz CPU which
features with 2.7 gigahertz in boost the
actual nomenclature of the display is a
13.3 inch ultra sharp qhd+ infinity
touch display this is also an IPS
display panel which features 170
wide-angle viewing it also features 400
nits and a thousand to 1 contrast ratio
the XPS 13 model that I got features the
capacitive touchscreen option which
features 10 finger touch support the XPS
13 also features 8 gigabytes of dual
channel ddr3 l RS SDRAM at 1600
megahertz
it also sports a 256 gigabyte SSD and
Intel's embedded HD 5500 graphics one
thing that's kind of strange about this
laptop compared to other laptops is the
battery because the battery is actually
built into the laptop and cannot be
replaced by the customer at all but it
does feature a 3200 watt hour battery
the XPS 13 features a variety of
wireless connections including Bluetooth
4.0 it's also miracast capable and
features Intel smart connect technology
a quick note on the onboard audio the
stereo speakers are professionally tuned
with waves max audio pro so there you
guys can see this new Dell XPS 13 boasts
a host of features just all kinds of
things like I said some of the really
awesome
things about this are the backlit
keyboard this screen is just amazing I
can't say enough about it
3200 by 1800 resolution that's higher
than any MacBook MacBook Air the only
thing that's got more resolution than
that is some of those new 6k monitors 5k
monitors and obviously the brand-new
iMac you know that's out from the people
who are at Apple that was a 5k display
it's got a little bit higher resolution
but for laptops and especially 30 inch
laptops the Dell XPS 13 is obviously the
winner it's got the highest resolution
it's totally touchscreen which I don't
know I just can't say enough about that
like one cool thing about that is when
you're going on the internet your old
guy like meanie got failing eyes you're
going out there and you're viewing a
webpage all you have to do is like click
on here let me give you guys a quick
example so check this out
here we go we see the Ken Suzy model so
this is kind of small write the text
well so you can't see you just keep
making it bigger and bigger and bigger
until you can see it which is totally
awesome like I'm kind of getting a hold
and blinding at diabetes this is
something I just totally love about the
XPS 13 also you know you can see up Ken
Suzy's nose look I think he's got a
booger right there no I'm just kidding
now another cool feature along with that
awesome touch screen is a virtual
keyboard and had some variety of
features inside of it so if some reason
your keyboard onboard here takes a dump
on you you can actually use the virtual
keyboard you just click on this button
down here gives you a variety of options
you click on this button right here you
can have your standard keyboard you can
have a thing where you type your name
inside calculator letters all kinds of
different stuff so like I said folks
that to me is like my favorite aspect
about the laptop the XPS 13 is just
incredible in that respect I read and
browse and search the internet all day
long now I have a lot of computers all
over the house you guys know even the
computer industry since the dinosaur age
and so I've just had built up computers
up the butt but lately I find myself
going back and back and back to dumb XPS
13 laptop because that feature if I want
to read something online it's too small
I'd have to go do any adjustments go
make any fonts bigger
I just put my fingers on there boom make
it bigger I personally love
a lot the backlit keyboard is really
good if you're working in a dark room or
whatever that'll give you a lot of good
productivity time now talking about
productivity let's jump in real quick
and let's take a look at the Geekbench
score and see how this thing does on
that which is actually comparable to
lots of people out around the world I
would give you folks kind of an audio
test but it's kind of hard to do with
the laptops and the speakers are on the
side but I can tell you the speakers are
pretty adequate
such silly fools wasting
the sound of this thing is pretty decent
if you're watching a movie streaming
videos watching you - and that stuff
there's two watts per sign the speakers
it's enough for a laptop trust me I mean
it's not blaring you're not gonna be
able to go and you know fill the arena
with it rock out but for your bedroom or
anything else you'll do just fine and
also since it's a headphone jack if you
want it louder stick a headphone in and
rock out you know until the note oh you
want to rock out okay so that's all the
great things about the XPS 13 earlier in
the video I said people that dealt kick
me down some cool accessories let's talk
about some of those things right here we
have the dell premium sleep it's a
magnetic bag put your thing in there
it's all nice and velvety inside here
this thing comes to market at about 49
bucks it's pretty cool
we have Microsoft Office no disk at all
there's just a code so you go online
download it into your code and you're up
and going with office we've got the USB
3.0 2 Ethernet and USB 2.0 adapter and
last but not least so that things about
like I think it was like 59 bucks and
then last but not least we've got the
12,000 milliamp battery so think about
you're on the road or whatever all of a
sudden your laptop runs out of juice
you're like freaking out I was in the
middle of a project what the frak do I
do you use this bad ass boy right here
that's right automatically charge up
your laptop and once again you'll get
that 15 hours now the battery life on
this thing was about 15 hours if you
were on the net and stuff like that if
you're doing other things like watching
videos it's a little bit less but for
surfing the net just general you should
zall most 15 hours so pretty good
battery life actually so let's put it
over there then we also have the Bell
premiere backpack and this thing's
pretty awesome because it's got nice
straps very comfortable padded
everywhere on the front it has a place
you can actually put your laptop inside
of here and still charge it why it's
inside of the bag a little hole for the
cord to go through and all that really
cool stuff I think that's a actually you
can see in society here I'll let you
guys see inside there it's kind of hard
to see everything but there's actually a
lot of different pockets in here here on
the inside features a lot of different
zippers more pockets and all kinds of
stuff inside of here again a big huge
area with more pockets lots of padded
stuff so you put your laptop
here books in here all kinds of cool
stuff be on the road traveling around so
those are the accessories like I said in
the very beginning of the video I'm not
usually a laptop kind of guy unless I'm
going to CES or traveling or something
I'm usually at home I don't really have
that much use for a laptop but since
I've got this Dell XPS 13 I find myself
going back to it more and more and more
in the living room it's pretty awesome
I've got it up to my wireless network I
can surf the internet and do all that
stuff and do my work sit and watch a
little TV be a lazy couch potato hoe so
I mean I don't know three pounds that
screen was amazing touch screen like we
saw before a lot of power inside this
thing it'll power all the latest
programs out there so if you're using
Photoshop using premier all that stuff
your productivity would be really good
on this eight gigabytes of RAM Twitter
thinks these could go buy an SSD I 5
processor 2.2 gigahertz right off the
bat that 2.7 in the boost I mean I don't
know this thing's pretty good now the
way this thing is configured it's $1,399
so that's a pretty mid-level price and
where those MacBook Pros and stuff like
that they have not as a good of
resolution with a bigger screen they're
heavier and they cost a lot more money
so I really think that dell has had a
really success story here because like I
said it sold me over I've never really
wanted a laptop like this one I like it
I really do so at the end of the day I
just think that's really what's
important the keyboard is awesome I mean
I don't know what else can I say about
this thing I mean I'm not really a
laptop person but yet I love this laptop
so my work here on TECA tomorrow and I'm
gonna play smo with the Dell XPS 13
because it's simply fun and productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
