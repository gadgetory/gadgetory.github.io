again to my studio here on tech of
tomorrow now today we're going to be
taking a look at a product that I feel
that any entry-level musician out there
and in fact even some pro musicians
would probably get a great kick and find
a lot of use out of this brand-new
product for Mike a multimedia now this
is the axe IO it's a 24 bit 192
kilohertz interface has a dynamic range
of 117 DB it's got all kinds of great
features on it it comes to market at
about three hundred and forty nine
dollars and for the price I think by the
end of the video you're gonna be going
wow this thing really does have a lot of
great features for that price range now
sure there's stuff out there that's a
lot more expensive and they add stuff
out that might be a little bit better
but this particular product I think
fetching this perfect niche especially
for people who are entry-level like I
said who don't have a lot of money but
need the functionality to be able to do
everything they want all in a little
tiny box now this particular box hooks
up by USB it also has a power unit that
you plug into the wall so it does need
it doesn't need the AC power it doesn't
work off strictly just standalone um USB
power but it will work with a PC it'll
work with Mac it's very easy to simply
open up and use so when you open up the
box and you check the product out from
usually getting the product there's not
a whole lot in the box you get pretty
much the product you get the user's
manual you get a cable for hooking it up
to your computer and that's pretty much
it
all of your drivers all the stuff that
you're doing you'll be downloading off
of the iocai multimedia site it's very
easy you just register your product
install it and then you're up and going
now also before I jump in just short
knew all the features the software pack
that comes with this is pretty amazing
because you get the amplitude you get
their latest their latest software and
it's the deluxe version of amplitude 4
so you pretty much get all this great
software you get this t rack stuff and
we'll jump in that a little bit later
but all in all inside of this box you
get actually almost as much software
as the value of the unit and a lot of
ways you could pretty much say hey I'm
buying this unit and the little BOTS
itself is almost free you get all this
software so let's jump in real quick
though let's check out the unit and just
talk a lot about how this units really
cool what it can do for you guys I've
already got the unit plugged in and
everything this way you guys can see all
the lights and all the stuff on it but
you guys will see right off the bat on
the front it's very easy to see and use
now on the front you'll see it there's
actually two different quarter-inch
inputs and as you travel down you'll
also see it there is a headphone jack as
well as a place where you can actually
react everything which is really
incredible now what's very interesting
on the very far left on the quarter inch
input you get some very interesting
stuff for one thing you get this feature
called Z tone now Z tone actually only
does work off the cordilla input to the
far left it doesn't work in the
secondary one although both of those
actually have their own separate game
the Z tone is only for the very first
plug-in and what's really interesting
about this is you can actually change
the impedance of your microphone and
this is something that you really do not
see on units that are this inexpensive
honestly this is something you see on
things that are really expensive and
it's a really cool thing because let's
just say that you plug in either a mic
or your guitar and you're not very happy
with how the sound is you think it's
either too dead or it's too bright with
the Z tone you can actually change the
impedance of your microphone to make
either hotter or less hot until you find
the absolute best sound that you like
now also right below that you can see
there's also two other sets of controls
now one is passive active I think most
people are going to know what this is
for this is if you have a passive or
active guitar and if you actually have a
passive guitar and you plug it in and
you turn into active you're gonna notice
that the volume automatically drops
because it's being padded by 10 DB
automatically for active pickups now
right next to the active passive switch
you'll see there's another switch next
to this is the pure and the j FET switch
now when it's in the pure mode this
means it's not coloring your sound
whatsoever you're getting just the pure
sound of the guitar
and when you engage the J fit button
you're adding a little bit of mids into
the mix although I couldn't really hear
that much of a difference
I'm sure it's doing something on a sonic
level or it wouldn't be there now as we
move on to the middle of the unit you're
gonna see right here that there's a
button that says preset and then you're
gonna have a tuner right next to that
now one thing I want to talk to you guys
about the preset is that this particular
function does not work unless you have
it hooked up to the MIDI controller even
though it seems like it should work I
tried using inside of standard features
I end up calling the people over at Ike
a multimedia where I was informed that
this particular button the preset button
which allows you to scroll through all
of the different settings can only be
done if you have it hooked up through
MIDI that is actually one aspect of this
unit that I thought was just a little
bit kind of which I say is kind of a
small caveat I honestly think you should
be able to use it you know when you have
it hooked up to USB you should be able
to control and scroll through all these
things but I guess it's kind of meant
more for if you hook it up to like you
know an iRig type pedal or something
like that that you can scroll all
through them so it's not the end of the
world because you're at your DAW you can
actually scroll through all that stuff
without any problem whatsoever and if
you're using a microphone that happens
to need phantom power just below the
preset knob is the 48 phantom bolt power
button and right next to that is the
tuner button and even though the tuner
may seem like a trivial function to some
people it's actually not you really do
need the tuner because when you're in
the studio you want to make sure that
your guitar is as tuned up as possible
so when you're doing your recording
you don't know if somebody listen to it
the other end and say my god did this
dude even tune his guitar so it's
actually a very important feature now
sitting right next to the tuner you can
see there's a button that says monitor
control and one thing that I think is
really cool about this unit is not only
can it be used for your direct inbox and
for all your effects you can also use it
pretty much as a standalone interface
because you can hook up your speakers to
it and you can control the volume with
it through the monitor control and next
to that you also see a headphone jack so
you can use headphones to listen to
everything now one thing that I thought
was just a little bit confusing about
the unit is if you look
at there I guess what you want to call
their description they claim that the
unit has two inputs and five outputs and
that's actually technically incorrect
when we go around and we take a look at
the back of the unit you guys can see
that they're actually five on the back
yes there are there are four outputs for
the speakers and the USB that makes five
but Plus on the front you have a
headphone out and you have the amp out
jack
now the amp out jack is somewhat
important a lot of people might say oh
my god that's not that big of a deal but
honestly I think this is one of the
biggest deals about the ax i/o is the
very fact that recording both a digital
signal and a live signal has been proven
if you watch online to give the absolute
best clarity and the best sound so once
you go in and you find the preset and
everything that you like and you record
it on to your DAW and then after that
you can use the amp out connection on
the front and you can put this directly
to your cabinet so then you can mic up
your cabinet and record your live sound
and mix it with your digital sound in
your dog this is actually a really cool
feature I have a much more expensive
it's called a one torpedo this
particular product was about eight
hundred dollars and it has less features
than this product at three hundred and
forty nine dollars and to the far right
you guys can see there are actually two
XLR jacks now these use pure mic preamps
and they sound really nice are they the
absolute best on the market
probably not but for somebody who wants
an all-in-one box these particular
connections can be a lifesaver because
inside of the software there's actually
all kinds of different effects that you
can use to mix your vocals compress them
and make them sound exactly like you
want them to sound without spending
really any more money on software or
hardware now next to that you can see
there are four output jacks these are
all four different types of speakers and
then next to that there are actually two
more inputs and these are for expression
pedals so you can actually hook up two
expression pedals at the same time so
one could be a volume pedal one could be
expression pedal and you can use those
directly into the axe i/o then we see
the USB plug in all you do is hook your
speak up to this and then plug it into
your system install the drivers and like
I said you're up and going then to the
left of that you can see there are two
MIDI controllers you have MIDI in MIDI
Aden and like I said once again earlier
in the video to use all of the functions
and to be able to scroll through all the
different settings that you have you
will need to have it hooked up through
the MIDI device next to that we see the
power connection and then the far left
we simply see the on and off button and
there's also a little Kensington switch
so if you want to lock this up so
someone doesn't steal it from your
office you can do that as well alright
so there you have it you guys can see
that the unit itself actually has a lot
of features there's pretty much
everything that you can need on the unit
with us you're plugging in a guitar
whether you're plugging in a mic you
have all the features you need to go
into your recording studio and actually
Accord your band and get up and going
now let's talk about something else
though because the software package that
comes inside of the Axio is really nice
you get amplitude 4 deluxe this is a
great software package it has so many
different guitar emulations cab
immolations just pretty much anything
that you can think of for your vocals
your bass or guitar you're gonna find it
inside of this package and if you want
more stuff you can go you can go buy it
until you build up your library to have
as much as you want now you also get tea
racks as well and tea racks is really
cool because these are all the different
effects the different effects excuse me
that you're gonna want to use when
you're recording like your guitar your
vocal like I said you can have things
like compressors delays Flanders any
even it you want you're gonna be able to
find in here and you're gonna be able to
use it in your mix now the one thing
that I found to be a little bit of a
caveat is the fact that when you
actually do record with amplitude and
you're recording it into your DAW it
doesn't actually print what you're
recording so if you actually took that
that you know you took your your
software and you took your project file
and you took it you know somewhere else
to play it when they went to go play it
back there's not gonna be any guitar in
there it's just gonna be the raw guitar
tracks with nothing printed on it so
you're gonna have to render the track to
actually get the track you know done but
then afterwards with that with being
able to react everything you just simply
use that jack in the fron
plugged into your re-record and you can
have the best of both worlds like I said
before but the software package itself
is worth a really a whole lot of money
now right here you guys can see what the
interface is gonna look like on your
computer it's very simple to use you can
scroll through everything there's
actually like a control panel which
tells you what's hooked up and what's
going on it's very intuitive and simple
to use you don't have to have any kind
of rocket science degree everything is
right there in front of you and it's
really simple to use
in this particular video I could
honestly be on here for hours talking to
you guys about all of the different
sounds and plugins and everything that's
inside of the Axio but I want to focus
today really on the hardware features of
the axe IO and what it has to offer but
for those people out there who are
wondering hey was it kind of sound like
we'll check this out Jesus the cameraman
he decided to write a little ditty so he
programmed a little bit of drums and
record this little ditty and it was very
simple and easy to use so let's just
real quick let's just take a listen to
this little ditty written by mr. G
another thing that's actually really
cool about the Axio software package is
let's just say you're a person out there
and you're totally starting off and you
don't even have any kind of recording
software whatsoever well guess what I
can multimedia has you covered here as
well because you get Ableton Live light
inside that's right
so right when you get the unit even if
you do not have any recording software
whatsoever guess what you'll have it now
so all you have to do is go ahead and
install the Ableton Lite live and then
you've got yourself all your DAW
software that you need so as long as you
have your computer whether it's a PC or
Mac it's probably better if you have a
newer PC or Mac the older you know units
that are out there will probably run
stuff it'll probably run it a little bit
sluggish so you know if you're you know
wondering like hey will this run on my
really old computer well it probably
will but it'll probably run a little
sluggish it's probably better if you get
a newer computer but all in all the
software it's up I just have to just
like them countless to the ground is
worth almost as much as the unit if not
more than the unit itself and the unit
just has so many features like I said to
the entire video from the ability to
change the impedance of your microphone
to the ability to change it to Jay Fedor
pure to be able to use active passive
this is pretty much like a di box that's
also gonna be your main interface and
everything else all in a package that's
three hundred and forty nine dollars
using it is very simple it's an
absolutely great product I kept trying
to find things to really like you know
beat this product up because I know that
you guys don't don't like it if you say
good things about stuff they always want
to have some negative in there so the
negative things really about this unit
are really just this the fact that it
doesn't print on the first time out when
you're recording I think that's a
particularly I wish it printed right off
the bat but that's really no big deal
beyond that the very fact that you have
to use the MIDI controller to scroll
through all the presets I wish that was
a little bit different I wish that no
matter what you're doing you could just
use that preset button on the front of
the
but that can only be used with the MIDI
that's not actually quite explained
anywhere clear on their side or any
other documentation so that is something
that you guys should definitely know so
if you're giving it you're like oh I
want to be able to scroll through all of
these presets in the front of the unit
well you're going to be happy to use
those two MIDI input output jacks and a
MIDI controller to be able to do that
not the end of the world but you know
just something to take note of the
bottom line here though is that this
product is three hundred and forty nine
dollars and for three hundred and forty
nine dollars you get a box that's
completely functioning for everything
that you need it'll work like I said as
your di box you can have active you can
have passive you can change the
impedance of your microphone you can
hook up speakers you can amp it out I
mean there are just so many features in
here for the three hundred forty nine
dollars and with all the software bundle
you get on top of this I have to say
that for anybody out there who's looking
for an all-in-one solution doesn't want
to spend a money this is a very quality
product is it the absolute most
expensive and you know you know most
most uber grand product on the market no
it's not but it's definitely affordable
it works great it's easy to use the
software package is great here on TECA
tomorrow I definitely think that the
Axio is a serious editor's choice
product it has everything that anybody
needs to get up and going in their
recording studio simply easily
efficiently and effectively like usual
we'll have links down below or if you
guys want to check out some more
information about this unit or purchase
one for yourself will do so also if
you'd like to see a video digging more
into the sounds and that type of stuff
let me know and I'll bring that video to
the table but I just thought that you
guys should definitely know what the I
came multimedia Axio is what it does and
what a great price it is i'm Elric
you've been watching teching tomorrow
we'll see you guys back here on the
channel for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
