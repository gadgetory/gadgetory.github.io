YouTube all the way back from
motherboards or until now even from the
hospital this is the video that I really
never ever wanted to make I've been
wrong actually about a couple of things
and I'm going to talk to you guys about
that like almost every video a lot of
people make comments about my shaking
and why am i shaking and all this stuff
welp I found that last week why I'm
shaking so bad and the news pretty much
has devastated me and I'm really
struggling to try to deal with it
because I would rather just honestly be
in self denial than deal with it but
I've been diagnosed now with early onset
Parkinson's disease so the fact that I'm
like 54 years old hopefully they said
that you know it's not going to get so
bad where I can't talk and I shake so
bad that I won't be able to do anything
but it's affected already a lot of
things in my life I can really barely
even play guitar even if I play guitar
for like 15 to 20 minutes my whole left
side is just aching and my chest is been
aching lately to the muscles in there
from shaking all the time and everything
have gotten damaged and that's only just
one of the few things which has been
going on since I'm diabetic not only
have I been diagnosed this early
Parkinson's disease which is scaring the
holy crap out of me my doctor actually
upped all of my insulin intake because
they were giving me steroids for the
pneumonia well when that happened I had
almost a complete overdose from insulin
something that I never even knew could
even happen whatsoever I woke up a few
mornings ago I was so freezing cold my
hands were colder than ice like I
literally stuck him in a freezer my body
was aching and my heart and my chest was
beating so loud that I thought was gonna
literally blast out of my chest because
I had given myself too much insulin in
fact they said that if I would have
given myself just five more cc's I
probably would have had a major heart
attack and been a lot worse I used to
take just ten and ten a day so I take
ten cc's in the morning 10 cc's at night
and I was doing okay but then they up me
to 20 cc's twice a day and that
literally just wiped me out I've never
ever felt so sick and then it doesn't
even end there
if you guys follow the channel you know
that I've had both of my feet amputated
already well now my foot on the right
hand side has an infection in it and it
doesn't seem to be going away which
means it probably next I'll be getting
my leg amputated so honestly I'm gonna
tell you right now I'm pretty much
scared out of my wits I don't know what
to do because there's nothing that I can
really do I've been taking care of
myself if you guys see they're telling
you see how much weight I've gained I
barely even need anymore
I can actually hardly ever even hold
food down anymore because I've been so
sick so all these things are really
starting to weigh on me and honestly it
hurts in the comments and people are
just like making fun of me and talking
things about my shaking I mean think
about it if someone told gee you had
Parkinson's would you really want to be
like made fun of and like I'm a person I
have feelings just like anybody else and
seeing all those comments down below and
like saying things like I'm on meth and
all this stuff is just ridiculous
anybody who knows me I don't mess with
drugs I take the only drugs I'm taking
are the drugs that they give me to help
my pain
that's the oxy that they give me and I
have to take it every day in order just
to be able to live my day so even just
to be able to get up in the morning get
out of bed and just do anything I've got
to be on this oxy stuff and if any of
you've ever up there been on it you know
how bad it is it's SuperDuper addictive
I'm not gonna lie to you I'm obviously
addicted to oxy now because if I don't
have it I literally start flipping out
my body just completely shuts down I
don't use the bathroom I can't do
anything whatsoever so recently my
health and all the stuff that's going on
as almost overwhelmed me like I feel
like there's just a giant weight hanging
down on me and what's really weird is
that my whole life I've been hardcore
dedicated to God I'm not saying that I'm
a Christian person I don't believe in
going to church and all that because
I've seen all the magnets that goes on
in churches but I've always had a deep
personal relationship with God and for
the things that I've done wrong I know
for a fact that I've repented and I felt
sorry for the things I've done and
really did it so I'm actually less
afraid to die than I am to get my leg
cut off thing about getting my leg cut
off literally just scares the hell out
of me the Parkinson's yeah they've given
me some medicine so
some days it's better than others but
the very thought that I'm gonna get my
leg cut off and I didn't be able to
stand up to go pee or walk up the stairs
to my room or do anything it's got a
cloud over me and I really really don't
know what to do about it so honestly I
know that a lot of people out there are
atheists you guys don't believe in
anything whatsoever you know that's your
choice you know but honestly for me I
feel believing in a higher power I don't
really put this in exactly words but it
gives me something to to like better
myself believing in God the way that I
do and the way that that things are
supposed to be I really don't like doing
bad stuff I really don't like a long
time ago guys know I got mad and I said
said the people it was because I was
really freaking out I had lost both my
feet I mean people might think oh yeah
you know it's really no big deal but I'm
a guy he was a physical guy I used to do
stuff all the time and then it went to I
can barely even walk so thinking that
I'm gonna get my leg cut off is like
literally freaking me out like I don't
know what to do
I took infection medicine antibiotics so
much that I destroyed my gut yeah
completely destroyed my gut and I found
out for my doctors that's one of the
reasons why I'm not really able to hold
any food down is because I now have to
balance my gut out with probiotics in
order to take the right stuff going on
in my stomach because the antibiotics
have killed me so I had to stop using
the antibiotics and as soon as I stopped
using those antibiotics my foot just got
repeatedly worse and worse and worse and
worse I behold right now my foot about
this big around it's not as big around
as the original thing that made me get
my foot amputated but the fact that I'm
not getting very much blood flow to my
hands or to my feet because of Raymond's
disease I'm just not healing and I don't
know what to do with this stuff I really
don't like I don't even know how long
I'll be able to keep doing YouTube
videos to be honest with you I want to
do this this will I've always wanted to
do I've always wanted to bring stuff to
the table to people help people out
that's always been my goal but if it
gets to the point where I can't even
walk I don't know what's gonna happen
from one thing in the house I live in my
room and everything of mine other than
my studios and stuff is all you know
upstairs I got my recording studio down
here and we have one room downstairs but
I'll probably have to have Anthony come
over tear
that a whole room down move stuff
upstairs and I'll be stuck down here and
I'll be honest with you I don't like it
down here I don't like the bathroom down
here I don't like being down there I
just I don't know what it is I just
don't like being down here when I first
moved here the guy who was living with
me his dad owned the house and they
literally had me and Buddy behind fences
if you guys paid attention to channel I
made a video about that a long time ago
they literally had me blocked in in
cages I was in this little area that you
see right here and you can about maybe
15 feet that way there was a giant cage
and pretty much me and buddy were stuck
in a cage for the first eight months
that I lived here it literally drove me
nuts my depression level just rose I was
suicidal honestly I was thinking every
day I just want to end this life the
only reason I didn't kill myself is I
didn't really want to hurt my parents
and friends who care about me and just
do that especially I can't really go
into things other people get upset but
I've had friends who've had their
fathers pass away from suicide and I
really didn't want to lay that crap on
their plate so I just keep struggling
and struggling and struggling to keep
going but it's honestly it's starting to
get too much from me and like I said I'm
less afraid to die and then I am to get
my leg cut off now I know suicides a sin
so I can't really commit suicide or I go
straight to hell according to you know
the powers that be so even that's kind
of a gateway that's even blocked to me
so no matter how much even if I feel
that way I know that I'm not going to do
it whatsoever I think about it but even
to think about that and have that in my
mindset that I would rather be dead than
be dealing with this stuff is a terrible
place to be it's really really hard for
me it just is and if any of you guys out
there and I know there's many of you
because you've contacted me you guys
help help those shoes you know what I'm
talking about when it gets the point
where your bad health keeps you from
even living any type of a normal life
you're really not living anymore and I
feel like I'm really not living anymore
I'm just existing many times Jesus comes
to work he's got to sit around and sit
down here and just pick his butt or do
whatever and so I'm ready to get up and
do the work and that's really unfair to
him I feel like about it but
there's nothing I can do because my
hell's so bad so please the future when
you watch the video I'm shaking it's not
because I'm on drugs and it's not
because of my nerve damage anymore it's
because I've been diagnosed with early
onset Parkinson's disease and hopefully
with the medications it won't get any
worse I'm gonna try to stay here for you
guys as long as possible to make as many
videos as possible until I can but the
way things are looking
I honestly feel that I'm not even gonna
be alive very much longer I feel like my
body's gonna shut down and I'm going to
die I'm in constant pain 24 hours a day
I'm always freezing cold all the time I
don't know what's going on I'm going
back to the doctor again on Monday where
I hopefully can figure some of this
stuff out but honestly things are
getting really scary and really hairy
all at the same time so I really never
wanted to make this video I didn't
really want to say anything to anybody
about it but the fact is that everybody
like if he seems like they're mocking me
or making fun about the shaking and and
that's just got to the point where I I
have to just say something you know when
friends of mine and family who don't
know about to see this they're gonna
probably freak out and probably be angry
at me and wide it and share this stuff
with them but honestly if I had it my
way on this particular subject I would
lie to everybody including myself
because I just don't want to face the
consequences of what's gonna happen with
my body I don't know if this parks and
stuff kind of like in a year I'll be so
bad that I shake like a leaf and can't
talk or if the medication and it will
help me and the fact the infection is in
my foot I don't know if they're gonna
have to cut my whole leg off part of my
leg you know I don't know exactly what's
going on there but all in all it's a
very scary road to be on so please when
you watch the videos please have
consideration like I said I'm a person
like everybody else out there I have
feelings and to see all those comments
like that it really hurts me a lot I
don't try to do anything to hurt anybody
in this life I never had that's not who
I am
so please honestly I asked you from my
heart please please be considerate and
not mocking me about this stuff it's
hard enough to deal with on its own it's
scary enough to deal with this on its
own much less having to have people
making fun of you and accusing you're a
meth and all this stuff when you're
shaking I'm not shaking because of drugs
I'm shaking because I have Parkinson's
disease my health is really bad I want
to be here for you guys I don't know how
much longer I'm gonna be able to be here
for you guys so until the time that that
I asked you be courteous I try to be
courteous to you I try to bring you guys
the best videos I can so please have
just that wee bit of respect for me and
I'll appreciate and love you all more
than I even do now so thank you I never
wanted to make this video but I don't
want to lie to the entire world anymore
it's time you guys know what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
