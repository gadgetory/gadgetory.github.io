back here once again now we know that
the 1070 TI the card has come out a few
months ago but now the aftermarket cards
are all starting to flood the market and
we got our hands on one from ZOTAC and
this is their mini version the cards the
brand new ZOTAC 1070 TI cart that's
right that so if you're like building
one of those little mini pcs it'll work
great for that this is one of the brand
new cards that have come out so let's
jump in let's see what comes in the box
so like every good unboxing hey it
starts with the box here's the box we
got here ZOTAC gtx geforce 1070 TI card
really nice car what's inside is what's
really important though here's the back
of the box and that's really about it
I'm sure you guys don't want to see
every side of the box and bore you to
hell but with that said let's go ahead
and let's open the box up and see what
actually comes inside so let's pop the
cap here they'll always be a box inside
of a box for that box deception we'll
pull that out set this out to the side
maybe we'll even just throw it at the
camera man oh I missed him by that much
all right so here's the box and then go
ahead and pop the top on it open it up
so you guys can see what's inside there
so tech pull er it up and inside you
have a driver CD and ignite more
possibilities the solid choice kind of a
little advertising thing inside of the
card that way they can make more sales
make more money and make more cards
alright take the foam top off nothing
much there once again let's chucked at
the Cameron oh god I'm getting so close
alright so what all do we got in here so
you turn this box wrench you guys can
actually see it a little bit better as
well so there's nothing underneath there
here's the car which we'll get to in
just a second so really the only
accessories that come in the box are
this cable right here which is to molex
six pins to an eight pin this is in case
you power supply doesn't have the right
connections you can get them with this
but beyond the drivers and that little
sales that thing that's all that comes
in the box
other than the card itself so now let's
check out the card take a look at the
top of card you guys are going to notice
there are two fans and each one of these
fans is a different size now this
particular fan right here this is
covering at the GPU that way
keeping the GPU cool and down here this
fan is actually keeping the cooling
apparatus cool so you've got one
actually dedicated to the GPU itself and
one dedicated to the cooling apparatus
making sure that all that heat is
dissipated away from the card on the end
as far as the connections go you got one
DVI d3 display ports and a single HDMI
port new you guys can see on the back
there's a very nice backplate and this
is very solid very smooth it'll keep
your card really nice no way you're
gonna cut your hands or add stuff I
really love this type of design you can
also see there's two sli fingers on the
top if you want to do an SLI
configuration and down here on the end
you guys can see all of the heat fins
and the heat pipes rating out from the
card and you can see these pretty much
all around the side of the card if you
spin the card over this way you see more
copper heat pipes radiant from the card
single six pin power connector and on
the bottom of the card you add the PCI
insertion and you also see more of those
copper heat bytes emanating other side
of the card so really not too much comes
in the box
the 1070 TI was a very good competitor
to AMD's latest cards I'm pretty sure
that's exactly why you know and video
released it on the market all in all
it's a very nice card it's smaller than
your average card so if you have a
smaller case or a case it's actually
shorter it'll be able to fit in that a
lot better so you get this you get the
manual little sales add your six pin
power connector and that's it okay for
you unboxing fans out there there you
have it everything that comes in the box
and the brand new ZOTAC 1070 TI and mini
card will bring you guys the scores and
benchmarks very soon but for now that's
it we'll have the link down below if you
want to check one of these out and buy
one for yourself and if not we'll see
you guys back on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
