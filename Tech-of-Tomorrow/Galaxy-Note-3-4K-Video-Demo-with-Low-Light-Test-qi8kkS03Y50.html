tomorrow now you guys all asked for I
got my brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 3
and last week and we're the first thing
that you guys did is hey we want to see
4k in both standard and low light well
taking what you guys say into
consideration here is the video the
close-up in 4k
what's up everybody I'll reckon 4k look
I even shaved for you look how smooth it
is smooth there's a baby's bottom
yeah that's right so let's just walk
over here off Jonathan follow me was
trying to come a little bit of the
videos there's no stabilization we'll
just try some different angles right
here behind me out of my rose bushes I'm
try not to trip over the hose and fall
on my keister you're in the yard but
back every Jaime you guys can see here
some rose bushes and some different
color features
all right so before we bounce in and do
the low light video just one last thing
this here's my static or in the front
I'm pretty proud aspyn had this thing
actually for uh 25 15 years imagine that
a plant that you've carried around
through all those years
this thing's old it's huge but it
actually gives some cool color variation
also for the camera so this has been the
4k video in normal light let's bounce it
now and let's see low light alright
buddy so before we boogie I hear you
guys all apps for low light on the note
3 and we're here bringing the low light
4k video got the Tron right here we're
gonna be doing that do you assume but
before we set up all the lights it's
pretty dark in here so we thought we'd
bring that video to you guys so you guys
can see now what it looks like in low
light some color variations between the
blue shirt the dog injury things you
guys can see color variation in 4k and
low light
