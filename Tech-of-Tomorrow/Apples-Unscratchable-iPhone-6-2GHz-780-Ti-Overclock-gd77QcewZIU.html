we're here to rock you
Saturday
you
today's video is made possible by
audible.com audible.com has over 150,000
downloadable titles across all different
types of genres for your free book head
over to audible.com forward slash
tomorrow alright folks to the first
story this week involves virtual reality
man that's right you know you guys all
saw the lawnmower man that was some cool
 Nick right guy from that headset
everything was just completely wacky in
fact I think by the second movie homeboy
like took over the world now hopefully
this won't happen as well
but now Samson's releasing their gear VR
now back in June and Gadget done some
reporting on this and said hey this
thing's going to be coming out now this
is not to be confused with any other
other products not their Google glass or
oculus rift or anything else like that
this is a whole new product from these
guys it's going to be introducing VR
from the Samsung world now this thing's
supposed to have two screens and be
twice as good as the Rif so that in
itself is actually pretty cool so let's
jump in and let's just check out a
little deeper about what this is about
like I said this thing's not the rumored
galaxy glass but a different project all
together device has two AMOLED screens
rumored to be equal or if not better
than the second rift development kit
what is unclear however is how the
device connects to smartphones
presumably this will be a wired
connection and another thing is if the
headset tracks head movement by using an
external camera it's also reported that
Samsung is also looking to undercut the
oculus VR and Sony in price what the
price will be is unknown at this point
although the current second generation
oculus rift development kit is three
hundred and fifty dollars and obviously
since Android is the system that's
running on all these phones they will be
focusing on Android gaming it's rumored
that this device will be released
alongside the Galaxy Note 4 at the IFA
2014 convention that will be held in
Berlin on September 5th to September
10th this headgear will also allow users
to connect to a galaxy device via USB
port so all in all this is going to be
pretty cool stuff so if you're looking
for that type of product it will soon be
hitting the market for people to put on
their heads and check it out next up in
the news EVG
hey there new GTX 780 Ti actually blows
a world record let's jump in and see
exactly what was there so check this out
a couple of renowned overclockers
kingpin loose IDEO and Illya 10 Semenko
accomplished the feat with an EVGA
GeForce GTX 780 Ti graphics card these
guys have blown past the 2 gigahertz
barrier which is pretty impressive they
did this using an EVGA x79 dark
motherboard and it was also powered by
up guess what an EVGA branded power
supply in doing this the overclocking
team were able to coax the GPU to run at
2025 megahertz which in itself is a
record at that frequency the team
completed a successful 3d marked fire
strike Xtreme run and posted a
record-breaking score of eight thousand
seven hundred and ninety three points
here's how its scored by category the
graphic score was nine thousand two
hundred and thirty the physics score
twenty thousand eight hundred and
ninety-six in the combined score of
three thousand nine hundred and fifty
four once again though this clearly
shows EVGA a dedication to the cause of
making their cards unbelievably well
made I mean otherwise how else would you
be able to overclock a card that well
and not just blow it out of the water
right off the bat so just them I haven't
the ability to do that shows their
dedication of the overclocking community
and shows EVGA still in the game so I
guess good job you guys and ruin folks
actually they're in Brea I could almost
throw Rock and reach their office me and
Anthony's to go hang out there all the
time because they're so close but you
know how things do things change but
anyways that's incredible in itself so
these guys have been able to break a
world's record and hey there's nothing
better than breaking a world's record to
get one up you know what I mean next
story next up this one is for Apple fans
we have the new iPhone 6 sapphire screen
League now if this shows to be true
Apple's upcoming iPhone 6 might just
change the smartphone game with an
unscratched bull sapphire display it was
put through a torture test and withstood
it brilliantly talk about how regardless
if you hate Apple or not this is a big
leap forward in the smartphone market so
hey if you want something that can never
can you like Apple you're in alright
