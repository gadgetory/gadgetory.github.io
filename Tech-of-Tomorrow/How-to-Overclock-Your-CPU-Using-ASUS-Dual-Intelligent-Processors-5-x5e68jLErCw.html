detective tomorrow we're today we've got
something kind of cool to show you with
our guest Jay Z from Asus now I don't
fly to you guys know about optimization
but now we're going to show you some
from these guys which is five-way
optimization all software oriented on
their mainstream and WS series
motherboards for 2014 so without me talk
anymore let me just hand the floor over
to JJ and let him tell you all these
great things and how you can optimize
your motherboards the absolute most that
you've ever been able to do now well
thanks as always meant for having me
appreciate it one thing to clarify
though definitely is that this is a
software level functionality in terms of
how you interface it within the
operating system but this is hardware
based so this is not a question of just
you thinking that it's software
overclocking this is working on you know
a hardware and firmware level so there's
full interaction this is actually making
full adjustments to the UEFI just like I
don't know is that actually from the
users actually faces alright for the
users themselves actually going to
making any hardware changes they're
doing it all through the 100% but I
think it's also important that we
clarifying that too because I think you
know we both known that even though
we've now shown you guys here at taken
tomorrow and in the past in other videos
as far as showing you guys our automated
auto clocking technologies there's still
some people that sometimes might only
think that this is just a pure software
implementation and I think it's really
important because the complexity of how
we have this work and the effectiveness
of how it really works really only comes
through because of the advanced
combination of it being firmware
hardware and software base so it's a
process of really leveraging all aspects
of how the system comes together so like
your messaging mentioning here you know
real big focus that we did when we first
designed and developed Auto tuning as
well as now with forward optimization in
the z87 based platform and now 500
optimization for z97 is trying to make
sure that when a user takes advantage of
one of our you know mainstream series
boards or WL series boards that they're
going to have essentially the easiest
way to be able to fully take advantage
of their system get it overclocked
get it calibrated in terms of fan speed
so that it's cool it's quiet it's easily
adjustable in terms of all those points
as well as even be able to have more
advanced levels of functionality
how they can take performance and even
assign it to specific item always in the
Windows environment correct all easily
so that's what I meant when I said by
software not for the user they're
basically for them they're going to
speak either clicking a mouse for them
it's very very easy all the technology
thing you guys have already done all the
hard work double user there's going to
be click on the GUI going oh wow cool
that works awesome yeah no definitely
it's it's a very seamless process for
the user so what we've gone ahead and
done here is we've opened up the a sp3
system utility so this is pretty much
the same as the last generation we've
gone ahead and overhauled and made some
changes here and what we've gone ahead
and done is if I just click back and I
go here to this big button that says 500
optimisation this is pretty much
integrating each one of the individual
modules like the TPU the fan expert the
digi+ the EPU function and the turbo app
but it's all self-contained in one
program so we're just going to go here
and you can see right here we have fast
tuning extreme tuning and we're going to
select extreme tuning because extreme
tuning is going to allow us to
dynamically overclock the system just
like a normal user would where it's
going to increase voltages it's going to
increase the multiplier it's going to
make setting adjustments to things like
the power of erm and you know phase
response the phase loading policy OCP
and a whole bunch of other you know
technical parameters if you were
manually overclocking a board inside the
UEFI right and we're going to do through
the ratio which means it's just going to
increase increase the multiplier but if
you wanted to do BC CLK overclocking
that's also supported but for this
generation we've taken a lot of the
feedback from the community and also
from our experience and really evolved
how we can go about the auto tuning
process in the past what we've
essentially done is we fixed a maximum
target voltage of one point two seven
five we did that because that was the
realistic limit of what probably most
cooling solutions on the market could
handle even though you could maybe put
more voltage than that it really
wouldn't make sense because you wouldn't
be able to thermally control that level
of voltage so this is us also keeping in
mind hey we're keeping your guys's
safety on your hardware and also
relating that to what the real cooling
solutions are out there in your
ecosystem right now in addition to that
if we run it's once again reference the
older design it would dynamically
overclock the system up to whatever the
CPU and your cooling solution your
memory your power supply your line level
quality from your wall all those things
would allow for that could be maybe four
point two it could be forty three it
could be forty
forty-eight it all varies but the great
thing is exactly it's specific to your
system but we've gone ahead and done for
this generation is even taking it
further - a lot for some really cool
granularity and control so you can see
right here we have ratio start from that
means that if I want to start the audio
tuning process from a specific frequency
I can go ahead and do that so instead of
it starting from just the pure stock
frequency if I wanted to start from
forty one and then just ratchet up from
there to short maybe the auto auto
tuning process you could go ahead and do
that now if you want to go ahead and
even get a little bit more specific
there are some users out there that
we've seen in the community that
sometimes they buy their hardware and
even let's say if they oughta tune their
system and it could do 4.6 they actually
don't want 4.6 for some reason maybe
some users feel more comfortable saying
I only want to shoot for 4.2 or 43 or 44
because I think they think it's going to
make it last longer it's a possibility
whatever your preference might be what
we've decided to do is evil to give you
guys the flexibility to do that so what
you can do now is you can drive towards
a specific target frequency so let's say
I only want auto tuning to go up to 44
well I can do that I can pick 4.4
gigahertz as far as my target frequency
and what audio tuning will do is will
attempt to dynamically tune up to that
now if your CPU and your cooling
solution and everything can do up to 44
you'll get to 44 but if let's say you
can really only do up to 42 because you
know it hits that that voltage wall or
the CPU margin just isn't good enough to
get to that frequency that'll only go up
to 42 but essentially you can define now
will this tell you if it does that
though if you try to go for frequency
that it won't hit what tell you hey
we're only going to be able to go this
far correct but we won't know that until
the end of the process right because of
course it doesn't have any any way of
knowing what the CPU is but as it's
going through the tuning process at the
end outcome it's either going to tell
you that you've hit that target
frequency or that it's only been able to
successfully achieve you know 4.2 but it
allows you guys to even have more
flexibility and how you want to define
your overclocking but we've even done
more than that for this generation we've
added in temperature target based
overclocking this is pretty crazy
so the morning which means if you only
want the thing to go 247 Celsius nothing
higher it goes to that point and then
throttles down from there correct for
all intents a pretty interesting thing
actually
nobody would ever pick such a
temperature that low but most I'm not
just getting an example yeah but for a
user what they might target would be
something let's say like ADC right you
know a lot of overclockers they set to
something because I don't ever want my
system to go over ADC so now what you
can do is you could go in there and same
thing if I want to go ahead and set this
to ADC it will only overclock up to ADC
so what it will do is it actually tracks
the temperature as we're doing the
overclocking and doing the stress
testing and it's accounting for what the
temperature it's running at and if it
gets to the point that it goes over ATC
it says oh that's it
not going to go any further I'm going to
stop so it's not even frequency based
it's temperature based so that's a low
these means guys is like basically if
your CPU goes to three point five and it
breaks that threshold it's gonna
throttle down that's right pretty much
but if you've got a great cooler you
know like here we've got this coarser h1
10 right this is going to be really well
cooled even at higher frequencies so
this might allow us to get to like you
know forty seven uh you know forty seven
or maybe forty six right as far as our
multiplier and still have that be a DC
even under full stress tests but
essentially here you're going to have
that flexibility to be able to target in
your specific temperature yeah that
gives a lot of flexibility to a
different type of using what they're
looking for
correct now if you don't want either one
of those it'll fall to the default
option which is like I said it's pretty
much just going to go to what the
maximum that the CPU will allow for and
it will still target still track the
temperature but we're only going to be
accounting for what's called thermal
throttle so essentially we're just
making sure that that CPU temperature
never reaches essentially the throttle
or the breach point so what is like
pretty much the four point seven is the
top target CPU thing that you guys have
in this as evidence they're technically
is no limit it would be the limit would
be imposed by the cooling solution and
by the voltage that would allow for that
frequency now in our experience one
point two seven five for the best CPUs
will probably realistically be somewhere
between four point eight to four point
nine gigahertz but you know the majority
of CPUs are probably going to be much
closer to maybe you know 43 to 45
somewhere in that range as far as what
they would be able to achieve at one
point two seven five because voltage is
ultimately what's great heat and what
allows you to scale keep scaling higher
exact keeps you stable yeah the voltage
baby so an additional item that we've
added for this generation is something
really cool we've also added full system
memory stress
testing what forces of memory service
testing so the cool thing about this
with the memory stress testing is that
we can dynamically now stress test
memory with also stress testing the CPU
and this is an important consideration
because sometimes what happens is is
that users when they dynamically
overclock their system they don't
realize that the CPU frequency can
affect the actual stability of memory
and so sometimes you might have a CPU
thing to do 4.6 gigahertz but it can't
do 4.6 gigahertz
and ddr3 2400 it might you only be able
to not fighting time yes correct
it might only be able to do four point
six at 21 33 at the same time versus at
stock it could do stock frequency and
2400 which is true which is why actually
those pro overclockers spend so much
time doing and trying to find that
balance between all the highest of
everything exactly stable exactly and
that's also why actually all the memory
kits that you buy the generally don't
test the memory kits at high CPU
frequencies the XMP profiles are always
designed to be run at CPU stock
frequency versus running it at a high
frequency because you can never insure
that that memory could run at that speed
at a stock value but see makes that XMP
profile so many users still out there
don't even engage XMP they just stick it
in their system and go and then then
they go and they look they go oh why is
my system not running it that just
cracks me up and the really cool thing
about Auto tuning is Auto tuning will
automatically apply your XMP profile for
you so you don't even need to do
anything when you run the actual proof
yes when you run the auto tuning process
right here we've got some Corsair
Vengeance Pro ddr3 2400 kits when it
goes to the auto tuning process once it
reboots it will have automatically set
that for us so not only we didn't get an
overclock but we're also going to have
our memory overclocked as well yeah I
mean I personally this kind of stuff is
great because so many users out there
don't really know a whole lot about
their system or how to use it they know
they might have bought the absolute best
equipment but with this you get honestly
when with all this stuff in there you
can pretty much get everything to go as
best as you want without having a really
tweaking thing that's going to go oh my
god I just wrecked my system that's what
makes it awesome yeah and we've also
taken into thing a consideration a lot
of things that users don't always also
realize too that we talked about last
generation our voltage policy unlike a
lot of other um you know
it might be on competitor solutions when
we default our Auto overclocking
technology it's using efficient adaptive
voltages which means we're now using
like fixed manual vids so even though
we're limiting it to one point two seven
five
that means when your CPU is idle guess
what the voltage also comes down we're
not always forcing this consistent
manual vid which is going to produce
more heat it's going to actually consume
more power as well as over the long term
we could also produce what's called
voltage segregation so right all the way
around you'll notice uh for you for the
overclocker who like who's like the
really extreme guy like all those
guys but they can still go in the BIOS
and change the voltage to any damn thing
they 100 percent of course all our
boards whether it's tough whether it's
rog whether it's ws to the mainstream
series all of them have the same class
of manual level overclocking
capabilities so however you want to be
able to achieve your results our goal is
to be able to make that happen for you
yeah we're in a tense guy where the guy
wants to lay back and click a button
right correct
so at this point we rounded things off
with like I said a saying that we added
in the memory testing and one last new
option that we've also added in is the
ability to go ahead and extend the
stress test duration so in the past we
had a fixed interval of essentially that
would run approximately 15 to 20 seconds
in between each step increment uh now
you can change it to a longer shutter so
if a user wants to if they want to do
one hour in between each increment where
it's running that full system stability
test they can do that so we can you
can't fall asleep on your shoulder if
we're going to do that guess we're going
to be royal don't worry we're not going
to do that we're going to keep that at
the default and we actually find that in
the majority of cases especially with
the improvements that we've made for
this generation with the memory stress
testing and even further advancing the
actual system stability tests that
probably over 85 to almost 90% of you
will find that this will give you full
system stability but for you guys that
want to just take it to a little bit
more kind of extensive measures and be
able to feel a little bit more confident
you can now go in there and customize it
so that if you want to have it go take
longer in between each interval then you
can go ahead and do that I personally
think though for most people unless
you're out there really you're trying to
break a world record I think this is
just the way to go it's just so much
more easy for the user you just click a
couple buttons do a couple restarts get
a nice solid overclock you know your
systems not going to be burned up
breaking down and you get good results I
mean I think that actually most people
are going to choose to go this route
well we've been really happy with it you
know we invented Auto tuning technology
in p55 and we've
we progressed upon it and we feel it's
absolutely the best audit overclocking
technology out there and I actually
really challenged it even guys that are
manual based overclockers in most
situations you're not going to really be
able to get more out of the system
manually than you would be able to do it
in this way we're doing it effectively
efficiently and also with great level of
scaling that correlates to your hardware
well plus all the testing that goes
involved in doing this like so you're
not a user experimenting this is
actually a stuff that's been tried and
true methods to actually achieve a
result where a lot of people if you're
new to overclock you might go in and
click the wrong thing and the next thing
you know boom bye-bye CPU I mean no yeah
I mean your hundred percent right I mean
there's definitely safeguards that we
put in to protect the users but at the
end of the day you know we've put in
literally tens of thousands of man-hours
collectively from our team doing a lot
of this work and analysis to make sure
that we've got something that's
functional useful and ultimately
beneficial to you and especially if
you're buying a board right now at the
launch of a chipset Pike cycle you don't
know what the voltage ranges are you
don't know what the parameters to do a
card doesn't need a speedometer but it's
sure nice to have lime sure so let's go
ahead just kick this off or so we're
going to go and click the start button
and we're going to go ahead and allow it
to go through the auditing process
alrighty so at this point what's going
to head out how I work broader tuning
yes we are totally Auto tuning so it's
not going to be a bad rap song we
promise that totally totally um so
what's happening now here is that the
operating system has sent that
information over to the UEFI and the ufi
is now acknowledged okay I'm ready to go
ahead and start dynamically tuning the
system so what it's going to do is going
to apply an initial profile overclock to
start the actual audio tuning process
off and once it now it starts out Auto
overclocking process in the operating
system it will then begin to dynamically
scale everything upwards so we're going
to be increasing the multiplier we're
going to be increasing the voltage we're
going to be tracking the temperature all
these things are going to be happening
in real time and how many restarts would
you say that it actually takes before
you get the absolutely best results in a
single one two or three it actually
because because it depends on your
configuration right I would say if you
were running like the intel retail fan
you know and you had a very poor quality
cpu in terms of the margin it could
maybe take a
one reboot and it would be done if you
had a great system like ours where we've
got a good quality CPU great quality
cooling good quality power supply on
average I would probably say maybe takes
about 10 to 12 minutes maybe up to 15
minutes so it could be probably in the
vicinity of maybe 2 to 4 reboots but
probably I'd say average users are
probably going to be having the Auto
Tune process take about 10 to 12 minutes
and it's going to probably be in the
target range of probably about 2 to 3
reboots
right on I just know about a whole lot
of time well when you think about manual
overclocking at a minimum would at least
take you a couple of hours and that's a
few probably new start and that's a few
if you knew what you were doing exact
for somebody that doesn't know you
probably have to spend hours to research
go into some forums look at some videos
you know look at some guides and try
that I mean what does that do I think
I'll change it oops and then you have to
reboot set go in stress tests find out
what's wrong and keep going through that
same exact process so you can see here
our system is gone ahead and already pre
defaulted to 4.3 gigahertz because we're
actually not using an integrated excuse
me we're not using a discrete graphics
card the IGP you also got overclocked so
it went ahead and set our XMP profile to
2,400 we overclocked to 4.3 and we
overclocked the I GPU now if you want to
stop at that point you could and we
could just click stop but we're now
continuing the overclocking process so
you can see right now what's happening
is that the fans are revving up because
the system is actually under full stress
tests so we're going to open up our task
manager right here and if we start to
see we can already see that of course
the load occurred right it shot up to
100% load and now we're going to 4.4
here we can see active cores at 43 still
because we're doing the two core
stresses because do you have what's
called per core overclocking sometimes
you can have higher frequencies on one
and two threads versus you having them
on three and four threads so we're
checking all this stuff for you and you
can see right here we're even tracking
the temperature and we tell you what the
maximum temperature is and we even
subtract the maximum temperature based
off of what's called a thermal junction
so you know how close you are to the
thermal junction directly below that you
can see how much voltage is being
applied in real-time to your system and
will even tell you what the maximum
level of voltage is that's applied but
like I said it will not exceed one point
two seven five in terms of the voltage
and then lastly we even show you how
much wattage is being taken up because
what is generally correlates the heat
but also helps you know how much power
consumption increases occurring on your
system as well so it covers everything
so yeah you're getting everything so you
can see right here our memory hit up all
the way up to seven point eight gigs in
terms of active memory usage our CPU is
pegged up on multiple occasions here up
to a hundred percent and we're throwing
all kinds of complex instruction sets to
the CPU just like complex real
applications will so overall you're
getting this full dynamic real-time
audit overclocking processes are
occurring and as you can see here we're
now continuing to scale up we're now at
four point five gigahertz and it's going
to now just continue to keep tuning now
like I said depending on the now I must
put on this particular system that
you've been using JJ what are you
generally saying I know because I know
that eventually it probably does change
every so often but when you when you
reset this a default and then you redo
this again what is the average overclock
you're seeing on this particular so on
our specific system with this CPU and
this cooling solution it's probably
going to hit I would say probably with
4.8 gigahertz it's probably a pretty
damn good overclock yet well I mean for
4770k it's probably about the best you
could actually see well I mean and
there's I mean this water coolers are
very like inexpensive water cooler it's
considering it's not like going on
buying one of those break apart system
that cost you $100 that's an all one
system about 130 bucks yeah yeah
definitely I mean it's it's probably one
of the best closed-loop water cooling
solutions but I definitely could tell
you you could probably mimic similar
results of this you know even with you
know coarser h80 so the double wide
radiator would still give you comparable
results but overall that's really the
big benefit that we're trying to tell
you guys is that the great thing that
you have here is regardless of what
parts you're buying whether it's you
know a twenty dollar cooler whether it's
a forty dollar cooler or a hundred
dollar closed the water cooling solution
right you're going to have a customized
result that specific to your system and
so this just feels ultimately like
you're getting really that like you said
I think that's the best way to interpret
this the don't various turn this over
you're getting the best experience
possible right you're getting ultimately
an experience that's tailor-made to the
hardware that you've purchased so like
you said you can buy some great quality
hardware and even if you don't
necessarily know how to fully take
advantage of it or even if you're a
veteran like me that's been building and
tuning systems for a long time I feel
comfortable I won't you know my system
at home I've got one that should I
mainly tweaked in tune just for my own
kind of inside
in edification but I've also got a
system I totally let auto-tuning do his
job because I felt confident in what it
was giving me because it was efficient
it was effective and it overclocked it
very competently you know ever since the
beginning when these program first
started coming out I've always actually
liked them quite a bit because going in
there and tweak a bunch of stuff I mean
it's cool if you're really you know just
trying to try push things to the limit
but if you're trying to get some really
solid results without app to give
yourself a headache this is just always
the way to go yeah well if it works
right and I think both of us have been
in the game a long time that we remember
that you know way back when
first generation ought overclocking
technologies weren't really that
reliable they weren't that stable and
they weren't effective but I mean at
that point though a lot of times back
then like in Tony the companies didn't
really embrace overclocking as much as
they do now either so now like even the
companies themselves like oh okay we're
going home for overclocking more in the
past they were kind of like oh
overclocking so I think it's me I think
it's made easier to for everybody yeah I
mean overall you know there's always
been different kind of perspectives that
how overclocking has been evaluated been
embraced but you know our goal is
ultimately regardless of how you guys
are integrating or considering your
systems we just want to give you the
flexibility so we can see right here
we're probably about to get at the top
end and systems actually going to
probably get ready to crash so we can
see we've gotten to four point nine Giga
it's now on it's not it's not going to
burn is it no it's going to four point
nine gigahertz on one and two cores and
four point eight gigahertz on three and
four cores right eventually though we're
going to hit a wall where the voltage
that we have supplied or the CPU margin
or the cooling isn't good isn't gonna
loud there's going to be one that will
cause an issue at that point the system
essentially is going to acknowledge that
fact because it's going to register the
crash I think because you hear that it's
just gonna hit 5.0 no I don't think so
so you can see right now five point nine
folks what do you think you know seven
point no I mean with it we're going for
the extreme overclock you know so at
this point once it goes ahead and
finishes up it'll reboot and then it'll
finish out and provide us its results
we'll see but I don't think it's gonna
go Oh 5.0 folks what'd I tell you see
here taking tomorrow we take that
just a little bit
there okay oh I read your restart yeah
so I can see now it might be maybe
actually your house is fairly warm so
I'm surprised it got to that because
sometimes in a cooler temperature my get
to that level right because like I said
it's it's system-specific
right but now what's going to happen is
that the system is going to gone it's
going to realize the fact hey I got to a
point that there was too much
instability and it's going to go back
and it's essentially going to revert to
settings so whatever when we get now
though is the one that is right yes so
what it's going to do now is it won't
continue the audio tuning process it's
essentially going to go I've reached
that maximum result now what I need to
do is roll back to actually the last
very verified stable setting that and
give you that setting as your default
Auto overclock so it's now going to come
up here in a moment and then actually
after that after that it will then
progress to the second portion which
will be the automatic fan tuning process
so then calibrate all of our fans that
we have in our system allowing us to go
ahead and make sure that every single
fan we figured out the minimum and
maximum so we can see right here it's
moved straight into the fan expert we're
tuning every single one of the fans all
you see all the fans have ramped up
really high but they're also now going
to ramp all the way down to effective
zero rpm so they're going to be pure
silent and the reason why is every
single one of these headers are going to
be manually defined so that we know
regardless of what type of fan you have
on there we know what it's minimum
maximum operation is now the really cool
thing that we're not showing here but
definitely you know make sure to check
out more information that you're going
to see here on the technodrome our
Channel is that these motherboards for
this generation we've given the ability
to have full DC and PWM output control
for every single header so not only can
we control every single type of fan that
you connect to this motherboard but we
can set to control it in the most unique
and configurable ways possible and just
adding a splitter you could add even
more fans that's the awesome part so
like in this Corsair chassis with the
side panel and having actually
additional fans that be mounted there
the motherboard only has six fan headers
but having that ability to set it to PWM
like I said and you noted you can go
ahead and plug in your PWM splitter run
three more fans to that and they could
be powered by the power supply but they
can be all controlled by the motherboard
so a really awesome level of control and
flexibility that also for this
generation we've given you the ability
to map multiple temperature inputs to
different headers so you can map to
chassis fan header the vrm temperature
the PCH or even on some of our boards
and optional temp sensors on the
motherboard delay okay so then you could
increase the rpm in that particular area
to cool that area them for whatever
position you put that optional temp
sensor so on the back of your GPU or on
top of your SSD whatever it might be so
we can see here it's the gone ahead and
actually finished the effective
overclock 4.8 4.8 gigahertz ddr3 2400
it's gone ahead and fully calibrated all
of our fans and it's gone ahead and
given us that complete 5 way
optimization so I think some pretty
impressive
come on 4.8 from from a programmer you
hitting a button it's totally stable
that's really actually quite amazing so
we're just going to go have been a
aida64 here to confirm that our XMP has
gone ahead and also been applied and so
we can see right here you can see right
there ddr3 2400 it's gone ahead and
automatically set the timings the
voltage the frequency and this is the
kicker look at the efficiency we have
all the C states enabled we have the
adaptive voltage policy so when the
system is idle guess what it's dropping
on to that lowest CPU frequency and it's
dropping down to the lowest voltage so
that we get that best balance of not
only high speed high performance but
great efficiency and low power
consumption cool and quiet and cool and
even for those fan controls after the
fan calibration we've gone ahead and
integrated a great new option here for
this generation where we can go ahead
and click easy profiles to dynamically
change your fan profiles so you can go
ahead and go from silent to full speed
if you want you don't even need to jump
into the full program so the last
portion that we just want to show right
here is going to be the app tuning
portion so after you've already gone
ahead and completed your Auto overclock
well guess what we're giving you an
ability to do application specific
overclocking and profiling now what does
mean folks that means that you can
launch a certain application and you can
have all the setting gear for that
particular application you can set for
single core all the way perked up multi
core perked up however you want to do it
right yes it's totally for me when we
realized giving you this flexibility I
was totally like ok mind blown I was
like totally surprised by this level
functionality and
just to quickly show you what it would
be example let's say you did it for a
game we're opening up Marvel heroes here
but it could be battlefield 4 you could
go ahead and refresh the tab you click
over into this and let's say you know
that that game utilizes all those cores
well you want to set it to the maximum
frequency that could be advantageous
because let's say if you jumped into
Adobe Lightroom Lightroom is more maybe
single-threaded
right I want energy but one thing you my
folks might want to do is you might want
to go out and do some research on your
program and find out you know how it
runs best because then that will lead
you to the road of how to set this up
correctly correct because some
applications are going to be more so
than others but the advantage of this is
with perk or overclocking maybe you want
to go ahead and have one program running
out 4.8 gigahertz on a single thread
where your CPU can't do 4.8 on all cores
but for the other application the other
application can do more frequency across
all course so you know premier could do
4.6 on all cores and then light room
could do 4.8 on a single thread and then
lastly what we can also go ahead and
adjust is audio we can go ahead and
customize it so that you can go ahead
and automatically set a specific audio
preset to that application that will
change automatically as well as the land
prioritization so once again if we have
Marvel heroes it's a game we would want
the audio to automatically set to the
game preset and then the land we would
want it to have high because since it's
an online game we want the lowest want
make sure you and Lois Lane seem exactly
and that would all happen dynamically so
that you can go ahead and map this to as
many programs as you want and be able to
have this dynamic system specific
overclock and presets lebreton so some
pretty awesome functionality we've
introduced here with five optimization
it's amazing stuff so there you guys
have it folks
never is optimization been easier so if
you want to build your system be you
know as flexed out as you want it to be
hey it'll do it here automatically for
you without headache foes you guys that
were like the extreme overclocking
guides we know that you're not going to
be using this but for people out there
who are new to this and want to take
their time and work their way into doing
that this is the absolute best stepping
stone I think you're gonna be able to
get yeah it's awesome and I'd love to
see your guys's comments I'll definitely
follow up and respond into the comments
section but I definitely love to hear
what your guys's feedback is on what
we've done for this generation of
optimization so as always thank you guys
so let us hear your comments down below
like we
the information about this probably down
there blunt like but in the description
I'm Eric Whitacre tomorrow this is a JJ
from azuz thanks for watching TECA
tomorrow we'll see you guys back here
