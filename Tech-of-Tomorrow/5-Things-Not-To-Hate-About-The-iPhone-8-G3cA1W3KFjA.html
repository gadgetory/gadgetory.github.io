once again to the channel now I know
that most of you guys out there are PC
master-race guys there are some console
dudes out there but most of you guys are
generally Mac haters you guys are you
hate anything Mac anything Apple
whatever that comes out here they are I
hate it now the new iPhone 8 and iPhone
8 plus though they just dropped today at
10 o'clock in the morning Apple
announced a bunch of new stuff they
invents there they've you know they said
there had a new watch they had a new TV
thing it said 4k they had the iPhone 8
iPhone 8 plus and them another video
will talk about the new iPhone 10 or the
iPhone X as they're calling it but
either way now we have two phones that
are coming out right off the bat that
you guys will see really soon here the
iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus and a lot
of things actually about these phones
are very similar but there are five
things not to hate about the iPhone 8
now right off the bat I said you know
there's gonna be two different malls
which means two different price points
now there's only going to be three
colors as well silver space grey and
gold those will be all you can get as
far as your colors go no more white no
more black no more red no more no more
anything else except for those three
colors out of the gate now as far as
storage goes they've actually upped the
storage you can get either a 64 gigabyte
version or a 256 gigabyte version now
the iPhone 8 it's 64 gigabyte version it
comes to market at $6.99 and 839 dollars
for the 256 and for the iPhone 8 plus
it's coming to market at $7.99 for the
64 and excuse me and 949 for the 256
gigabytes so that's a lot more pricey
the cameras and stuff are pretty much
identical across the board that stuff's
pretty much the same but with that said
let's jump in and let's talk about five
reasons why you don't need to hate the
iPhone 8 okay so the number one reason
to don't hate the 8 is this is the very
first device that we've seen from Apple
that features the brand new a 11 Bionic
CPU that's right the a 11 Bionic this is
a 6 core CPU it's supposed to be up to
like 25% faster it has a lot of
different things inside of it but what's
best of all is the
ability to do all kinds of augmented
reality all kinds of 3d games you're
gonna be able to do this by it metal to
and core ml these technologies to make
that very very unique and that's
something that Apple you know they've
really been leading with the a-10 but
now with the a11 Bionic the bionics like
the bionic man right that's just crazy
 all the way across the board though
this CPU is going to be the fastest one
that you've ever seen in fact of all the
videos that we did in the past pretty
much anything that we ever tested
against the a-10 the a-10 beat it so I
gotta say in the foam in the phone world
it's a little bit different like in the
PC where we all know the AMD Nvidia
thing like Nvidia is just kind of
chilling but now we see Apple they're
just like throwing the book out and
bringing technology even though they're
already winning they're actually
bringing some innovative technology to a
brand-new CPU in the iPhone 8 so that's
pretty good stuff right there
the a lovin Bionic has six cores and 4.3
billion transistors it also has four
efficiency cores that are up to 70%
faster than the Aten fusion chip and to
performance cores that up to 25% faster
but best of all about the a11 Bionic is
that you can harness the power of all
six cores simultaneously if you need
that turbo boost
another thing that Apple is introduced
with the a11 banach is their own GPU nez
a 3 chord g pu that's gonna bring all of
your gaming and everything on your
screen with much more clarity and much
more dynamic range now the number 2
reason not to hate the 8 is the fact
that it comes with its own very unique
design that's completely glass that's
right it's completely made of glass and
it features these brand-new stainless
steel bands for your Wi-Fi that make it
really unique and in fact the way
everything blends together it just looks
so smooth and so nice now if anyone out
there happens to remember the old Star
Trek movies a long time ago they this
episode were they had to go back in time
and get a whale and bring it to the
future because you know whales are
communicating with outer space whales
and the earth was going to be destroyed
well the only way to do this was to come
up with this technology where you had
glass that was stronger than steel to
bring the whale back up and so they did
this they made this glass that was
stronger than steel so when I saw this
all glass
designed for some reason in my but that
just popped into my head and I thought
okay that's pretty cool what if they can
actually make glass that's stronger than
steel
now with the brand new iPhone 8 and
iPhone 8 plus we'll have to get the
phone in here and do some drop test and
test it out but it'll be very
interesting to see how tough this new
design actually is in real-world testing
reason number three not to hate the 8
wireless charging that's right for the
first time you get wireless charging
right out of the box and not only that
you get up to 50% of your charge and a
half an hour so it's the actually the
fastest charging because it has fast
charge capabilities than any other
iPhone that's come out before so if
you're looking for that type of feature
you love the wireless charging and you
want your phone to charge up really fast
that waiting around hey that's another
thing not to hate ok
reason number 4 not to hate the 8 and
this is a real favorite of mine man
slow-mo at 240 frames per second that's
right man
complete badass slow mode so if you're
into doing that type of stuff and your
guy does a lot of videography and you do
it to your camera these kind of features
are gonna be awesome and check this out
4k at 60 frames per second
right on I mean to me being a video guy
that just sounds completely awesome
there were a lot of pictures and stuff
that they showed during the presentation
and it just looked really awesome so for
me being able to get a phone that has
you know 4k that you can film at 60
frames per second that's like some of
the high-end cameras out there so if you
have that right on your phone that is a
badass feature and for like filming
stuff at concerts and stuff or crashes
of motorcycles or for stunts or even
jokes
having that slow-mo feature at 240
frames per second is just really cool
and that's something definitely not to
hate about the 8 and while we're still
talking about cameras and stuff reason
number five is portrait lighting and
this night not sound like it's all that
much more like an oil portrait lighting
or if that's like an but it's actually
really really awesome because just think
about this now inside built into it and
they say that's not an app or anything
else this is actually built-in hardware
features in the eye
and iPhone 8 plus is this new lighting
feature and what it basically does is it
changes the different lighting around a
portrait picture so you can change the
way it looks you can change the lighting
on your face you can just do a lot of
different things as far as the lighting
aspect goes and this is pretty cool
because if you've ever been into a
professional photography studio then but
a ton of lights all over the place
and they have all these techniques that
they use to get these different effects
when they're taking portraits will now
Apple has stuck these inside of the
iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus and like
I said even though the cameras
themselves are still just 12 megapixels
this technology is really awesome so if
you take a lot of pictures of people
landscapes you'd use all kinds of
different stuffs the new software and
stuff a lot software but the new
features that they have inside of the
iPhone 8 in the iPhone 8 plus just what
taking photos all together is definitely
something not to hate about the iPhone 8
so there you guys have it folks like I
said in the beginning I know that a lot
of you people out there you guys are
like ant whatever but there are five
really cool things about the 8 that you
shouldn't hate and that's why I brought
those to the table today the pricing on
them yeah they're a little bit pricey
but it just seems like cell phones these
days are just off the hook and if you're
a person and you just like living in the
Apple world which I'm sure some people
out there they love that whole Apple
environment you know they love
everything Apple for you folks out there
this is great news for you people out
there who might be interested this is
probably good news but at the end of the
day hey five reasons not to hate the 8
