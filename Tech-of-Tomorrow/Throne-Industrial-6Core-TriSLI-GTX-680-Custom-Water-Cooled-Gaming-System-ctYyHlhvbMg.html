not succeeded I'm still the king of me
through with my mighty sword I take the
lives of those in grudge be my kingdom
now the things I do for these videos and
hey you guys got to get a serious thumbs
up for that intro right I mean that was
just some awesome shizmik now today
we're going to be showing you the throne
and industrial hence the funny makeup
and all the crazy stuff I was kind of
going for like the unite movie priest
like the priest not quite Judas Priest
but can that be cool to get the leather
vest going but nope today we're here to
bring you the throne Industrial that's
right inside of it whoo 3 GTX 680 s and
SLI incredible 39 70 X from the people
of Intel and also in an Intel
motherboard also 48 gigabytes
that's right 48 gigabytes of Kingston
HyperX beast memory so you know this is
just one totally badass system so now
the main focus of this build is the case
let's jump in by to check it out right
here at the front of the system you guys
can see it's incredible right on the
front door you see there's a power meter
that shows the voltage of the system
this is trippin plus the only way to
turn the system on is by a key you
actually have to insert a key turn it
and that's the way you start the system
just really kind of crazy stuff now
we'll go around to the side you guys can
see it says the throne industrial this
thing was made by Bob from PS mods up in
Washington State that's right thanks a
lot Bob now this thing has total modded
out fans as well all these fans that we
see here on top they are completely
actually industrial
fans and if you guys can hear the thing
running you'd know exactly what I mean
this thing sounds honestly like a jet
plane getting ready to take off or maybe
and in flight your choice but it's
really really really loud and if you put
your fingers through these fans will
slice your fingers off there is no
protection what so ever now as far as
like all the mods there's quite a bit of
stuff going on real quick we'll take a
look at the back of the system you know
there's not really too much there now
with the door on you can see the other
side matches up once again saying the
throne industrial but if you pull the
door off that's where things start
getting very very interesting now you
guys can see this thing is totally
modded out inside to look like you know
something industrial you guys can also
see inside of the system there is custom
swift tech cooling throughout the system
swift tech is entirely cooling this
system the case is also the Rosewill
case it's the Rosewill throne what's
been totally modified out to become
which you see here the throne in dust
real now check it all out all custom
lint everything inside the system just
looks awesome so there you guys have it
the throne and dust drill sponsored by
rose will and hand-built and custom done
by Bob Stewart of B as mud who by the
way is also making a case for us here on
tikka tomorrow so that should be really
awesome it's going to be the blue
thunder you guys will love it now like
usual we don't list every single
solitary thing in the video because some
people feel that's too tedious but if
you're a person who wants to see every
single solitary Park everything that Bob
did in the mods you guys can check that
out in the link in the description below
or you guys can check on it right here
next to me on the screen so I hate you
guys know you have to like this video
this thing was really awesome make sure
you guys hit that like button you know
what I mean hit that like button and if
you're not subscribed you guys want
sure you do so because Roseau is also
sponsoring along with gigabyte and a few
of other people a 100k contest and you
