far is looking pretty good and the
product I have in my hand is called the
neuro phone and they claim that it is
not a headphone and I guess in a lot of
ways it's not just a headphone because
it's multiple products in one and you'll
hear why's we go along now these are
completely noise cancelling headphones
and the only thing that I can say that
the market that's competitive against
them are the Bose noiseless headphones
and I'm gonna tell you right now from
the start of the video for all those
naysayers out there sonically wise these
headphones blow away the Bose and the
noise cancellation is just as good now
these particular non headphones features
something called ANOVA technology now
what ANOVA technology is is inside these
headphones you have an in-ear headphone
and an outer ear cup that's right - and
140 millimeter driver on the outside 15
on the inside so what you're getting is
you're getting all of your high and all
your treble going directly into your ear
drum and all the bass surrounding your
ear drum and the sound if I could have
shown you the picture on my head the
very first time that I put my on my head
I think it would have been priceless
because the first time I put him on my
head I was completely blown away by the
sound of these headphones honestly I've
never in my life and I want to state
right up front I have been paid any
money nothing else at all for this
product nothing so my opinion is my own
and what I say is what I mean I never
bring you guys product and just say oh
hey they're good because they're not
good I'm not gonna do that ever these
particular products if you ever have a
chance to put them on your head you're
going to be totally blown away by the
sound now Before we jump in a little bit
more let's talk about what comes in the
package because you get the nerve phone
headphones you get a little package that
has extra tips for different ear sizes
or you know if different people in your
family want to use them you can change
them out so you don't share that ear wax
with all of them it comes with the USB
charging cable and it also comes with a
very nice carrying case to take the
headphones around where
where you go the nura phone also
features a technology called clean a and
C and what this means is that there's no
sound going in and no sound going out
now it features passive noise isolation
or active noise cancellation and what's
really best about these headphones is
that everything can be operated by these
outside buttons on the headphones and
another unique thing is the headphones
only turn on when they're actually on
your head that's right when you put the
headphones on your head the headphones
automatically become active now you can
do all kinds of different things by
single and double tapping on each dip
inside of the headphones you can answer
your phone you can change the way you
listen to your music all kinds of
different options which is pretty cool
because it makes everything completely
hands-free and let's just face it if
you're running down the street or you're
on a treadmill and you got to answer the
phone you don't want to really have to
use your hands very much you just want
to be able to go up hit a quick button
and be able to answer your phone call
and go back to your music and go on with
your day without any hassle and what's
even better is that you can also
customize all of these options within
the app and let's just say that you have
the noise cancellation on and you're
listening your music but all of a sudden
someone comes up to you and they want to
talk to you and you can't hear them well
they also got a mode called the social
mode you engage the social mode and all
of a sudden you can hear everything
around you and you can pop back into
your isolation or cancellation it's up
to you now as far as connectivity goes
these particular products are completely
wireless they run off Bluetooth
technology it doesn't matter whether you
have an iPhone whether you have an
Android phone with it's a tablet as long
as it has one of those type things on it
just connect up to the Bluetooth and you
are up and going it's very simple to do
makes a quick handshake and you're good
to go the neuro phones also feature a
lithium ion battery that has up to 20
hours of active use now this is quite a
long time but what's also really neat is
that it honestly tells you out loud in a
spoken voice how much battery life you
have left so if you're doing something
and you're busy and you're not really
paying attention all of a sudden your
headphones are gonna die on you they're
gonna give you a warning
you a you need to charge these
headphones up they're about to die it's
too bad you couldn't customize the
voices that'd be pretty cool you about
to lose your headphones your sock no I'm
just kidding but that would be pretty
cool right if you could actually
customize the voice mmm thoughts of the
future no thoughts for the future now
let's talk about the sound of these
headphones now for me just to talk to
you about the sound and the sonic
abilities of these headphones I know to
you it's just gonna come across and be
like hey it's just a bunch of words mr.
Elric that's why I say that for stuff
like this it's really good that you go
someplace and you can test these out and
hear them for yourself but really
interesting factor about these
headphones the very first time that I
put them on my head I was honestly blown
away at the clarity and the bass it was
like it was unlike anything I had ever
heard in my life before these things get
so loud and you can adjust the bass so
far up that it literally sounds like
someone's sitting there kicking a bass
drum onto your ear really incredible
stuff the sonic characteristics about
this are just unbelievable that's why
say boast up to me is pretty good but
it's very flat sounding I feel that most
up is dead
I know opinions vary but me as an
audiophile musician I've never been a
fan of both stuff other than it is
high-quality but to me sonically wise
it's very flat and dead which some
people actually like but me I like
options and with these you can turn the
treble way up you can turn the bass way
up but check this out these headphones
actually learn that's right there are
actually a smart product as well and
even though they really don't actually
say that directly on their website they
are a smart type product now you're
probably wondering okay Jarek how can a
headphone you know be personally for me
well there's a way these headphones
actually learn and they make the
headphone exactly for you they have two
different modes you can turn on there's
normal and then there's a personalized
mode and I think what this is doing is
pretty much you go in and you set a song
to how you like it whether it's pop rock
jazz you're gonna have sonically so much
bass so much trouble so much mid-range
so these headphones are gonna sonically
look at that and the next time that you
go play a song they're going to try to
recreate that same environment for you
with that song right that totally makes
perfect sense basically it's a I think
it's kind of an EQ memory that kind of
once that here's what you like and the
sonic things that you like every song
that comes on you can hear in the
beginning as it kind of makes it
selection and then it changes it and
makes it to the way that you want to do
it so instead of having to go into the
headphones and every song go in and
change the equalizer around go mad okay
that's not doesn't sound good to me well
with these headphones sory these non
headphones the neuro phone it does it
for you automatically and that's really
an excellent feature I've never seen
this on any other product in my life
ever and this is the truth you can look
around and see something like this but I
have never seen anything that acted
sonically like the neuro phone neuro
phone however they described the
technology a little bit different
they're claiming that a sonic signal is
sent into your eardrum and then that
sound comes back into the headphone and
then it takes that and remembers it and
maps the sonic capabilities of your ear
but even saying that that still has a
lot to do with the equalization of the
song so I think that what they're saying
is true but I think that what I'm saying
- about the equalization is also true I
think that we're probably both right on
this particular subject but at the end
of the day if you want to set it
headphones that are completely noise
canceling you don't want to hear
anything around you have options to turn
them on very very easy to operate by
simply clicking buttons on the outside
you can answer your phone it has a
really nice microphone in it when you
talk to the microphone and talk to
somebody out there it's not like it's
booming so it almost sounds like it has
a compressor inside of it so your voice
comes across you know evenly when you're
talking to people so for the price of
these it's very interesting you can get
these for about 300 I think 76 $79 on
Amazon right now I think they're 399 on
their site but truthfully this is an
editor's choice product for 2019 these
are one of the most unique and awesome
sets of Nan headphones that I have ever
seen in my life
sonically they
are amazing now one thing I was kind of
bummed out about the connectivity
however is that I wanted to be able to
hook these up into my studio behind me
and try them out as studio monitors
because sonically wise for listening
music they're amazing so I thought hey
how would these things sound in my
recording studio but unfortunately the
design for the connectivity is
completely proprietary and even though I
guess they're going to have third-party
devices nobody's actually going to have
the connectivity for the cable except
for the people at neuro phone and they
also have a plethora of cable choices so
whatever device need to hook up to
they've got a cable for you
unfortunately though you have to buy it
but I'd buy that for twenty bucks so
here are my final thoughts on the neuro
phone product these are very very
comfortable the headband is nice and
soft you can adjust them so they can fit
anyway on your head I really like the
fact that they only turn on when you
actually put them on your head when you
put them on your head you get them in
your ears they'll turn on everything is
operated by the buttons on the side of
the headphone you can keep all the noise
out go into social mode talk to people
20 hours of battery life it always lets
you know and then as soon as you take
the headphones off headphones
automatically turn off on their own
there's no technology that I have seen
out there on the market anything like
this product right now and like I said
for 2019 as far as headphones go this is
a serious editor's choice product I
really wish that I could bring the sonic
value and everything across to you but
unfortunately this is a video and it's
really hard because of the way the
headphones are designed for me to show
you both ways of the sound with
traditional headphones I can put a
microphone and just put the headphones
around it but these headphones work
different because you have to insert the
ear cups into your ear and I can't
really do that with a microphone so the
simulation wouldn't actually be a true
representation of the sound but like I
said trust me on this if you listen to
these you'll agree that they blow the
bows away they're cheaper than bows
we'll have a link below you can go to
their site check out more information
about the product and if you want to buy
one for yourself you'll actually be
blown away and like I said I honestly
can't wait to buy the
they're cable hook these up in my
recording studio and see how they sound
monitoring the music that we're making
here at Echo tomorrow
like usual will have a link down below
if you guys want to check out any of my
music we've got it over on iTunes we've
got our patreon site going if you want
to be subbed I'd love to see you sub
here in the channel 20:19 is gonna be a
different year for us we're gonna be
doing a lot of musical stuff as well as
tech just because I'm a musician and
that's what we're doing and I don't
really feel like doing ten different
channels on YouTube so things are going
to be neat we're gonna try to combine
music and Technology all together by the
way any of the music that you ever heard
on Tekken tomorrow we are the people
making our own music we ride around
