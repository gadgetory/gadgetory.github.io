it is it's time for another video here
on tech of tomorrow this time the top 5
cool tech ideas for under $200 not 150
not 50 not 15 but no 200 for you people
out there who've got a little bit of
cash and still want that cool tech idea
so with that said let's jump in and
let's check out the top 5 under 200 here
on tech of tomorrow the first product up
today is something that can help solve
all of your Wi-Fi problems in your home
if you live somewhere where your Wi-Fi
is weak or you're just not getting the
performance you want maybe it's time to
upgrade that router and get everything
going now the router that we're gonna be
checking out today this is the Linksys
wrt54g mo technology and this provides
blazing fast Wi-Fi speeds and it does
this to multiple devices at the same
time without getting a degradation in
your speed the AC 3200 is also open
source ready it features open Word and
dd-wrt s for complete flexibility and
customization Linksys also has a new
smart Wi-Fi app and this is used to
manager and monitor everything in your
home and your Wi-Fi from your devices
anytime and from anywhere internally the
AC 3200 has 256 megabytes of flash
memory and 512 megabytes of ram memory
now this helps deliver improve data
transfer speeds and allowing you to do
more things at faster rates the design
of the AC 3200 is also very nice looks
kind of like a little blue and black
spaceship you guys can see in the front
it has all kinds of different lights
which tell you what's going on and as we
move to the back of the AC 3200 you guys
can see on top that there are a lot of
holes on top to help radiate all the
heat away from it on the back you can
clearly see there are two antennas in
the back two on the side and then the
far left there's a reset button for all
of your Wi-Fi then there's four Ethernet
connections and Internet connection now
USB 2 is a standard USB 3.0 port but USB
1 doubles
USB and an eSATA port next to that is
the reset button the 12 volt power
adapter and then last but not least the
on and off switch alright folks so there
you have it product number one the AC
3200 router from the people over at
Linksys if you have any type of problems
at all with your Wi-Fi or you're just
not happy with the speed this is
something you want to seriously consider
right now it's on sale for $50 off make
it under $200 and hey it's a cool
product if you guys know Linksys they're
very easy to hook up and use and they're
very user friendly so now let's move on
to product number two this next product
is definitely something for those people
who are always on the go and have an
active lifestyle this is the tick watch
2 now this will work with both iOS and
Android devices so if you happen to be
one of those people you just snub your
nose than anything Apple you can have
your own Apple watch just not made by
Apple it'll be made by the tick watch
two people now with that said let's
check this watch out because I think at
the end of the day you guys are gonna
think this thing's pretty doggone cool
the features are nice you can see it and
broad daylight and it's very comfortable
so with that said let's check out the
tech watch 2 and really does the tick
wear the tick watch first off there are
a few different colors of the tick watch
2 that you can get your hands on the one
that we got today this is actually one's
black I think it works perfectly because
it matches everything to me personally
the biggest thing about having a tick
watch 2 or an Apple watch or anything of
that caliber is the ability to take care
of everything for your daily life your
health your needs your notifications
everything all on your wrist now
obviously you're still gonna have to
have your phone with you somewhere but
you have to admit that having everything
right on your wrist to access is much
easier and the way that you access
things in the tick watch 2 is very very
cool all you need to do is slide your
finger around the side of the edge and a
lot of the options are available now I
haven't really seen this on any other
watch they may have it on some of the
things I'm the biggest watch guy in the
world but that to me is highly
convenient you don't have to worry about
pounding any buttons pounding any
screens you just slide your finger
around the edge and then you could
access all the programs and things that
you want to do one cool thing with any
of these actual digital watches that I
like is the ability to change the face
so if you get bored with the face on it
you want to change it heck you don't
have to go out and buy another
watch you just simply change the way
that face looks you can have it digital
you can have it analog different kinds
of looks anything to your custom way
that you want to see it now for some
people this might just be like yeah or
man but to me I think this is a really
cool thing because if you get bored hey
you can just change the way it looks and
when you get bored with that change it
again another feature that tick watch
too is it actually comes with its own
wireless charger that's right all you
have to do is plug in the charge of the
wall set your tick watch to on top pin
and all your charging is done Wireless
this is not only cool it definitely
falls into the tech of tomorrow category
to navigate through all of your
information and your apps the tick watch
- actually comes with its own unique
tick wear OS it's already installed
inside the watch and you don't have to
mess with it whatsoever the tick watch -
really features three things
it features simplicity quality and
craftsmanship and it brings all this to
the table for under $200 so if you're a
person out there you're looking for a
smart watch that can handle all of your
daily activities you can program it to
do whatever you want you can monitor
what you want monitor your walking steps
everything you do in the gym your heart
rate everything so pretty much anything
that you're doing on your daily life can
all be monitored the tick watch - I want
to hear what you guys have to say down
below I'll be looking for your opinions
this next product you guys know the
company is creative labs they're really
known for all of their sound cards and
all that type of stuff but they've now
developed and pushed their company into
all kinds of gaming peripherals and
kiding keyboards mice etc so let's check
out their latest keyboard and see if it
attracts your attention The Sound
Blaster X Vanguard ko 8sc gaming
keyboard comes in black it's currently
on sale for one hundred and fifty nine
dollars and it has a lot of features
that you guys are going to like now
obviously most keyboards are going to be
somewhat alike because it's not like
reinventing the wheel you can't say hey
here's this wheel it's a new wheel so
what keyboards layout and that kind of
stuff it's pretty much kind of set in
stone people move a few things around
but beyond that you guys know what a
keyboard is now the Vanguard ko8 se is
also not a mechanical keyboard it's a
gaming keyboard but it has its own Omron
switches just like me the keyboards that
we've seen lately like the Tesoro and in
the real force RGB every single one of
these is having its own switches so
what's going on our cheery things just
going out the window because it's
kind of weird that everybody's coming up
with hey we've got our own key switches
now these switches feature double cross
point technology for over 70 million
failsafe keystrokes so you know this
thing is gonna last a long time
all the keys in the KOAT SC feature a
responsive tactile feedback a low 45
activation force and short one point
five millimeter pre travel distances
offer a rapid-fire input yet silent
keystrokes so few people out there who
prefer the MX blue switches I think to
be very comfortable with this they don't
make any noise whatsoever so you don't
hear that clackety-clackety-clackety-
clackety clack which a lot of people
find just annoying with 26 key rollover
anti-ghosting technology and low profile
key caps you get accurate commands every
time one feature that I know you gamers
out there are seriously going to like is
that the ko8 has a hundred and nine
fully programmable keys and it also has
dedicated media controls so operating
your music and your movies is very
simple as well RGB lighting is something
that has become very subjective either
you totally dig it and you're into it
you're like hell's to the no I don't
like that well luckily you can turn all
the lighting off if you want but if you
like that stuff this ko8 comes with all
of its own software to totally program
all the lights sixteen point eight
million colors so if there's a color out
there you can find it and for you folks
out there who love to have an extra USB
connection on your keyboard hey the KOA
se has a single USB port located on the
back another nice feature about the
Vanguard ko8 is it actually comes with
its own wrist rest so a few people out
there that that's a caveat it comes with
it you should be in the happy campers
lounge
alright tech fans so there you have it
the Vanguard ko8 se keyboard not
mechanical but still very very nice now
personally I didn't get a lot of time to
game on it Jesus did but from what I
seen it was very very quiet and to him
keyboards are pretty much all the same
so he's like hey it's like all the other
keyboards it works well like we really
haven't had mounted keyboard yet we're
like I hate this thing so in that
respect it's pretty much on the same
level if you're a fan of creative labs
you're looking for some that's really
cool under 200 bucks
hey this
cool to check out okay I've said it
before I'm gonna say it again I know
that the mass amount of my audience is
the hardcore PC gamer guy the guy who
loves a giant PCE lots of liquid cooling
multiple video cards PC strength but
what about if you don't really need that
what about if you got a big TV in your
living room and you want something it's
not gonna be obtrusive it's gonna be
able to just sit in your living room and
not really be noticed a stick PC is the
ultimate thing for that now today we're
gonna check out a bundle from the people
over at Azul it's pretty cool it's under
$200 and heck I think if you're one of
those people who just couch potatoes out
you want to check your email surf the
web do all that stuff but you want the
convenience if not even be able to see
it have it out of sight and out of mind
I think you're gonna like this
the bundle that we're gonna be checking
out today is called the quantum access
on Windows 10 fanless mini PC stick
bundle with the logitech wireless touch
keyboard K 400 plus damn is that a
mouthful first off let's talk about the
stick PC now this is market is the only
PC stick in the world with a LAN
connection now this feature is pretty
cool ever because say that you have the
wireless problems that I was talking
about earlier we were talking about that
Linksys router well this thing will
eliminate all that because you can
actually hardwire plug it in you're not
to worry about me and that Wi-Fi signal
decoration whatsoever that in itself is
actually pretty cool
now under the hood of this mini PC stick
is a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom cherry
trail processor the PC stick also
features two USB ports so users are
easily able to connect their while it's
keyboard mouse printer camera or any
other external device and the features
don't stop there with an embedded Intel
HD graphics card eighth-generation it
allows you just to enjoy a
high-definition 1080p video playback all
from the stick the access plus mini PC
stick comes in two different flavors two
gigabytes of RAM with 32 gigabytes of
storage or four gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage
unfortunately there's no 64 gigabyte
storage model available at this time but
with the added microSD slot it's
definitely not the Achilles heel of this
product and for you folks out there who
need totally hands-free connectivity
this bundle does come with the logitech
k400 plus wireless keyboard it's
laid out very nicely it's easy to use
and if you just want something that
comes in a bundle don't have some mess
with anything whatsoever this bundles
the e-ticket and best of all you can get
both these devices for under a hundred
and sixty dollars right now so that's a
pretty cool deal you're looking for
something that's totally unobtrusive
this is it baby
all right folks now last but not least
is the Google home now this particular
device I actually got from my girl Shan
she came over and for my birthday she
kicked me down this really cool Google
home thing now what the Google home is
it's basically a speaker that's also
voice-activated it works with the Google
assistant to control every single
solitary smart device in your entire
home and it's all done by voice
activation that's right
all you have to do is go up to them go
hey ok Google and it'll be like yo what
up bitch what you need why you bugging
me man like I'm a robot I don't want to
be messed with I need my own personal
space no it's not gonna say that but I
thought that was it was pretty funny so
I just threw it in there but basically
what the Google thing is is that it
controls your entire house and it
doubles as a speaker as well so you can
be listening to your music through it
doing all that stuff but if you have any
kind of devices in your house that work
off smart technology they can all be
controlled through this device and like
I said you don't have to worry about
doing things on your phone or anything
like that unless you want to everything
can actually be done through the Google
assistant through this little tiny
speaker now I know it's a whole lot of
stuff to talk about it all right there
so let's get him and let's just show you
guys just a little quick a little shot
of how this thing's work and then we'll
talk a little bit more about it in a
second so let's go okay Google
turn the lights in the little room red
okay google turn the lights on the
living room green all right folks there
you guys can see it max and you can
control all of your Philips smart lights
like I said you can control your TV if
you have any other device in the house
that actually is smart technology you
can control it and that's the big thing
about the Google home now personally
I've only had it up and working for a
couple of days and I will say it's kind
of interesting I think there are some
things that they're still working on to
make this thing like the total uber
ultimate thing they're competing very
much with Amazon's eco-project which is
kind of like the same thing at the end
we'll attack sorry at the end we'll
actually have to see who wins the battle
you know who the smart home king is
going to be but for under 200 dollars
this is a really cool and nifty device
and if you want to be able to brag to
all your friends and go yeah man my
house is smarter than yours well
this be the product my man so that's it
top five from top ten ten ten I feel
like we're watching it oh boy you guys
