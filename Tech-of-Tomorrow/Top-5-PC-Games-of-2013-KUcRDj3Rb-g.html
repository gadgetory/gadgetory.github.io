check out Hulu Plus com /t ot what's up
Tech fans Kevin here on tech o tomorrow
now the end of the year is approaching
really quick here and one of the biggest
questions that always comes up in the
gaming community is of course what is
your pick for game of the year or even
what are your top five picks and that's
exactly what this video is about now
just to be clear these are my top five
personal favorite PC games to come out
this year that are big-name titles I'm
not trying to say that these are
objectively the best games I'm not
trying to say that I've played every PC
game out there and these are definitely
the best ones I'm just listing out my
personal favorites that I want to share
with you guys so if you haven't played
them you should check them out now
another thing about me is that I am
really really bad at picking favorites
and while picking five is easier than
picking one ranking them from first to
fifth is just even worse for me so I'm
just not even going to do it I'm just
gonna tell you guys my top 5 favorite
games no particular order so let's go
ahead and check out that list right now
so to kick things off I'm going to go
ahead and just cheat just a little bit
here by listing a game that is
technically DLC but it is standalone and
worth every penny of its 15 dollar price
tag Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon what you do
is you take the solid gameplay and
terrain design from one of my favourite
games of last year Far Cry 3 kick out
the multiplayer and add in a parody
focused storyline that keeps you
laughing and grinning the whole way
through now as a warning how much you
can enjoy this game is heavily reliant
on your knowledge of 80s action movies
and cartoons but there is a healthy
number of flat-out gaming jokes to to
round these out if you have no idea
what's going on throw on some new
weapons and some bloodthirsty dinosaurs
and the fact that the game doesn't
require far cry 3 at all to play it and
you have a standalone FPS worth picking
up not just for the action but also the
comedy honestly guys I can't emphasize
enough the fact that for 15 bucks this
game is really worth picking up you
should really just give it a shot or
even try picking up if you ever see it
on sale because then it's just easily
worth it now next up I'm still cheating
a little bit this game is actually an
expansion for another title where you do
have to have both but it adds enough
single-player content and redesigns the
multiplayer and up to be on par with
many games that are released on a yearly
basis and then a Starcraft 2 heart of
the swarm featuring the loved RTS
multiplayer mode of the series with a
new chapter in the campaign that runs a
great balance of traditional RTS with
more simple top-down RPG mechanics with
plenty of special units of content to
help make the experience of the
single-player very unique compared to
the multiplayer whether you're a skilled
player looking to actively compete
online or just a novice looking for a
solid and generally flat-out fun
single-player campaign then this one is
worth the purchase even if you have to
go out your way to grab wings of Liberty
first now the next three games on the
list are all actual brand new fully
released titles no more DLC no more
expansions I promise and the first one
is one that I think a lot of people are
having a hard time leaving out of their
top 5 lists and that's BioShock Infinite
featuring a new story and setting with a
healthy number of nods to the first game
infinite is in many ways the sequel to
Bioshock that many of us had been
waiting for giving the main character a
voice personality and companion
alongside some new mechanics and a well
written though at times super convoluted
story and placing it in a beautiful city
in the skies helped to make this title a
favorite for many this year with some
particularly zealous fans going so far
to say decade well I'm not too sure
about that myself I still have to say
that BioShock Infinite is a
tastic singleplayer FPS title worthy of
your time if you have yet to experience
it now the next game on the list is one
that's going to seem like a bit of a
curveball for some of you and that's
probably because you've either never
tried the game or never tried its
predecessor and that's rayman legends
now this one follows up the amazing
Rayman Origins legends continues to
prove that light-hearted silly
platforming can still not only be fun
but also rewarding challenging and that
2d styled cartoon istic games can still
be just as gorgeous as a title
struggling to be photorealistic it can
prove to be a challenging experience to
fully complete if you're going at it
alone while taking its multiplayer might
lighten the burden but result in an
overall hilarious and fun co-op
adventure now if you're the kind of
person that just saw that game playing
thought to yourself why the hell would I
want to play something so childish
all I gotta say is I feel sorry for you
because you're missing out on one of the
most potent concentrated forms of
happiness I've ever seen in a video game
really you need to actually give it a
shot if you don't want to put down 40
bucks for this one try out origins first
it's only 20 worth every penny now last
but not least on the list is a game that
definitely caught me off guard the most
this year not that I expected it to be a
bad game just that I didn't expect to
find myself loving it as much as I did
and that is the reboot of Tomb Raider
now we'll admit the game starts off a
little shaky because it looks like it's
just going to be a quick time event
marathon but then the rest of the game
just opens up to have this great
exploration of height forming combined
with solid third-person shooter and
melee combat mechanics add on to this
great visuals a solid story and puzzles
that while shorter and supply that I'd
like make for some fantastic sidequest
content the multiplayer experience it
offers is nothing to rave about but it
does nothing to detract from how great
the single-player game turned out to be
like I said this game caught me
completely off guard I remember seeing a
lot of the early on previews for it and
gameplay thinking okay new tomb raider
that might be fun will give it a shot
once I got my hands on it I absolutely
fell in love with the single-player
campaign totally worth picking up so
those are my top 5 personally favorite
PC big-name titles come out this year if
the game that you love didn't make the
list it's either because I had the
unfortunate luck of not checking it out
and missing out on the fun or just
didn't make the cut for me personally so
let us know in the comments let us know
what your pick for game of the year is
or even a full top 5 list if you want to
now I know that when I'm in between
playing lots of games
one of the biggest activities like to do
that I share with friends and other
gamers in total is I love to binge watch
in my favorite completed shows or catch
up on currently airing ones that I've
just been falling behind on and the main
site I use for that is Hulu Plus
now a lot of you have probably watched
something on Hulu but not all of you
have tried Hulu Plus which just gives
you way more benefits if you feel like
taking a break from a computer desk but
still want to watch a show you can do it
either streaming in HD on your TV using
one of numerous devices on the market or
even part of Lea in your hand with a
tablet or smartphone with the Hulu Plus
app on top of that you'll get access to
shows on available on regular Hulu
including older seasons of big hit
classics or Hulu exclusive original
programs such as the wrong mans or
behind the mask now if you want to give
it a shot
