your host and today we're going to be
taking a look at a new product from MSI
now this thing is a 1920 by 1080 all and
one that's supposed to have the thinnest
and first completely flicker flicker
free screen see I can't even safely with
the flicker free eye flicker but this
monitor parently cannot flicker so even
though I flicker like that and I had to
do it this monitor is supposedly is
supposed to be the first one that does
not flicker at all that's an all-in-one
unit
it also comes with Windows 8 already
pre-installed so it's going to work with
all a touchscreen fanciness and all that
good stuff
it also has sound blaster technology all
bit done so as speakers that are all
stereo and sound blaster in there so
it'll probably be you pretty good for
gaming as well the full specs and
everything are actually on the side of
the box and I'll go ahead we'll get to
those in just a second but basically
this monitor comes to mark it's going to
be around twelve hundred and something
dollars you can pick it up on Amazon if
you're a person who's out there looking
for a monitor that's completely Flickr
frame
sucker for he once again to do it this
is going to be something you want to
look at now why will flicker-free be
good for you for one thing
i String when you're looking at a
monitor all the time and flickering all
the time your eyes are going to feel
strain you're not going to be able to
look at the monitor for as long a period
of time so if you're somebody who spends
a lot of time hanging out in front of
their frakkin monitor well then you're
going to want to get one that's flicker
free and that is this bad boy so I'm
just going to bring it over here you
guys want you to see this I'll just
flick it over to the side here real
quick and I'll tell you guys the specs
on this one as I bang the desk up now
this one has an Intel Core i5 320 DM 2.6
gigahertz one terabyte hard drive a
gigabytes of RAM a blu-ray writer
Windows 8 multi-touch panel color is
black and silver and it comes with the
keyboard and mouse wireless accessories
hope for those come in the box so I will
just real quick turn that over real
quick so the cameraman guy can zoom in
there and check it out and I'm not
actually going to do the traditional
unboxing because this bitch is just too
damn big I'm actually going to take it
out of the box and then we'll check it
out together so let's move forward
alright folks so like I said I didn't
traditional unboxing all you really
missed out on was just the packaging
stuff this thing was big and bulky it
was kind of hard to film and do it all
at the same time so we took it out it
came all packaged everything else these
are all the boxes though and everything
that comes inside the unboxing what's
really the most important thing it's not
really what's important you know I was a
packaging packaging was all well and
good and nothing was broken as you guys
can see so it comes with this all-in-one
a door 24 series comes this little thing
right here on try to separate it right
here for you folks this is there a
little guide that comes with it just
shows you the stuff on the other side
and it just has a QuickStart guide and
all that stuff LED all-in-one PC get out
of the way got a little box right here
I'll go ahead and pop this open inside
of here we see the wireless keyboard and
mouse so we're going to plug this thing
in all the way we're just going to take
it take this thing all the way to the
stream here's the keyboard out
completely Wireless you can see has two
little places right here
well actually one little place right
there sorry for your battery compartment
so that means I'll probably actually
have to get a battery if I want to use
this particular keyboard I'll probably
use one of the ones I got sitting around
and here is also their mouse up you know
what actually folks never mind
everything is just right here I even got
those out without tearing anything so
we've got two batteries right here I
will grab back my trusty knife which I
even left open and I will take a little
slit right here and then we shall use
these batteries right here and said
components unless these batteries are
just for that I guess we'll do as we go
so little thing right here and let's see
here which way the batteries supposed to
go trying to look inside of here to see
looks like they go like this though so
one battery I guess there's a bullet for
this so those are both in there plug
that back in go around let's see is
there an on switch anywhere I don't
particularly see an on switch anywhere
for this okay well maybe does it
automatically here's the mouse there's
also compartment right here
it looks like well okay for even two
more so are there more batteries well I
don't see any but anyways here's this
stuff we'll get to that as we move along
I feel like I'm being sluggish yours I'm
trying to discover this with you folks
because I like I just said I just saw
this right now along with you guys so
let's set that off to the side and move
on past that yeah there's only two
batteries in there that I see wait nope
I'm wrong folks all right here we go
I was wrong
my apologies there are two more
batteries right here so these batteries
will be for the mouse obviously so all
the batteries do come I don't want to
achieve the guys at MSI so yes all the
batteries do come inside of here with
tricky to get out there but yes so now
we have a full batteries up for both the
mouse and the keyboard once again I'll
remove this take a look inside to see
which way they go and it's actually kind
of hard to see in there but two now one
thing folks remember I just saw this
together as well as you now this is kind
of interesting here right here is the
dongle almost miss that but there right
there is the dongle so now I have the
dongle to plug in and once we get the
batteries and their folks the mouse
automatically activates put the top back
on we're good to go with all that stuff
so we got the mouse keyboard the dongle
we'll go ahead and just get that out of
the way continue going on now got the
next box down here we'll open that bad
boy up is obviously going to have the
power brick and all that kind of stuff
go ahead and take that out the boom so
yep that's what we see here you see the
entire power brick which is going to be
plugging it in I will go ahead just take
complete yeah whoa alrighty then fun
stuff kind of like a roller coaster
without a roll alright then we got the
power cable in the bag here to get it
out there we go
alley-oop kaboom kaboom kaboom inside of
here we have all the drivers LCD wipes
all kinds of stuff inside of here let's
go ahead and just take it out and show
it all to you folks blue all right then
I have a slippery hand say they're going
to call me butterfingers this video
so everything just keeps slipping
through my fingers and racking up on
that all right here we go kaboom
we have LCD display wipers to clean the
display
we've got your wind top drivers this has
all your driver utilities for the system
warranty information a wind top series
little registration thing and all that
good stuff right there
system products warranty card and the
series manual alright so we got that all
the power stuff we've got that we've
also plug in the power all right so now
let's focus on this big-ass bad boy look
at this giant to spray take all that
plastic stuff off so you guys can see
the front looks very beautiful has their
name over here
TenPoint touch flicker free ultra slim
you can get an SSD in at Full HD 1080p
1920 by 1080 and Sound Blaster cinema
like I said the two speakers are down
here the things must be very loud and
very clean up here you have your
built-in camera so you guys can see real
quick here is very very slim look at
that it's then in space you'd call it
Flaco or Flocka depending on you know
how you see it
we'll take all this the back plastic off
here there's lots and lots and lots and
lots and lots and lots of plastic on it
now check out the back the back is
pretty badass though check it out you're
not going to see it too much but it does
look pretty damn futuristic so let's get
all the plastic off you also the thing
it says please note read user's manual
before using the stand alright so maybe
if you're going to do jumping jacks or
something they don't want you to mess
the stand I'm sure it just pops in pops
out it says not to mess with it so I'm
not going to make it too much but still
are you guys can see right here down the
bottom of this little thing right there
that's your Kensington lock so if
anybody tries to rip this thing off but
you can Oh make sure you lock it down if
you in that kind of environment you also
have two things down here to let out the
heat so that you will dissipate out the
back of the unit flip it around again
your
over here is all of our controls and all
of our buttons you have all your on and
off switch restart your adjustments for
your monitor and all that stuff
card reader USB 3.0 once again I feel
like there's more plastic and yes
there's more plastic it's unbelievable
much plastic is on here
you could eat pretty to recycle this
plastic and start your own company I'm
just kidding it's not that much but boy
this is there still a a lot every time I
turn around there's more and more so
here we go
a little more that plastic off hopefully
you guys can clearly see it suit it see
that very very easily like I said this
one comes in an Intel Core i5 processor
has a terabyte hard drive inside of it
you can upgrade it get an SSD prices do
vary but it's very thin very lightweight
even though she'll need to give you
instruction manual basically obviously
the stand just folds in and when you
want to use it thanks little spring
clear I see why they say that they take
a little strength to maneuver the little
thing out so so far the cool things are
the thinness of it it's pretty
lightweight and everything once you get
out of the box it looks very very
elegant it is a little bit heavy ah here
we go as well the blu-ray writer and
that's something pretty cool you don't
always get to see a blu-ray writer
inside of a system this bad boy has a
blu-ray writer built-in automatically so
here's the bottom of the unit we have
even more stuff at the bottom of the
unit so let's try to get the cameron if
we can see that maturely they're going
to flicker that around there you go you
can take a little good look there down
here you have your power HDMI output to
another monitor 4 USB 3.0 hookup for the
internet through your rj45 additional
mic and headphone outs
lots of connectivity with this you guys
see this connectivity on the side
connectivity down here so I will go
ahead and begin a little process here we
will plug the little power thing in here
already then and I will go ahead now and
plug in this little dongle down here
with this dongle so I'll plug in the
dongle down in here and one of these USB
3.0 s hopefully that that will work we
won't use using anything else we turn
this bad boy on so
ooop it around up to the top apologize
on this videos probably little bit
longer than most videos but there's
quite a lot of stuff here and I'm just
kind of just you know skimming over some
of the main parts of it I mean there's
probably you know a lot more to talk
about as far as performance and
everything it's got you know built in
Nvidia graphics so you know it's going
to be able to play some decent games now
we shall turn it over to its side again
and let's see here
there we go
powers on I have the keyboard and the
mouse supposingly all wireless divid
honorable and if the screen is truly
flicker free up we should be able to
tell pretty soon here alright folks so
now we are in the basically starting
mode of the screen I've got it all
plugged in and going click the old
english button that's language I speak
pretty much with the old Next button the
agreement license I'll go ahead and
accept that I guess I got a quick little
thing over here - it's going to ask me
the color I want to do whoo that one's
pretty
oh just joking you wish alright let's
see here um mm I don't know I guess I'll
make it that that looks kind of
interesting so we'll move past that
wireless obviously my tech of tomorrow
is my wireless I'm going to be on
oh boy folks so after a short nap so
let's just be honest the entire setup
process took about 20 minutes altogether
so when you first get it be patient and
everything right here
they have quick settings for you device
and stuff you can click any corner you
can click on and move stuff around at
you can instantly get to stuff you want
to go to the internet click on the
internet I click on it twice three times
I guess let's just get on the internet
one so here we go make this bigger
everything is completely touchscreen
let's see if I can type in YouTube there
we go YouTube is the second one down you
can use you the mouse or you can use
your keyboard either way you want to do
it hit the old tech of tomorrow site
right here go check that out we can see
some audio here too so we see the audios
up we working audio buttons down here
we'll turn that up
all the way up and here's our video so
now see if it's flicker for your name
keep changing the settings we can only
HD
Shayne's at HD now they say some flicker
free screen so let's see if it's
actually flicker free audio sounds
pretty decent
so the audio set here here's a full
blast though
yeah
how's it coming from the camera camera
is it flicker-free
alright then so as they said obvious
these things flicker free if we can
record it and you're not seeing a
flicker its flicker free remember we try
to do this at the Nvidia booth when we
were in Vegas and you saw the foot or
difference well here you guys can see no
flicker alright guys so there you have
it now this thing's pretty cool 24-inch
monitor totally touchscreen flicker-free
cameraman confirmed it we were recording
it you guys will obviously see that in
the video I don't just see it yet
because I've been edited yet but right
now I'm from the video for you folks so
obviously this thing is going to be a
pretty interesting product very thin
very lightweight options you can do with
it if you're into this type of thing and
you want to have something that's
totally easy to take and on the go
and plus the graphics on board it has
NVIDIA has Nvidia the mobile graphics on
it I'm not gonna actually test that
right now because this is the unboxing
first look kind of the overview and
stuff with that will get a better stuff
later but you guys can see what it is
right there it's pretty cool it actually
is flicker free so it does what it says
the audio sounds pretty good
hey it's up to you folks for all more
