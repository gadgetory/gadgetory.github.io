which is the keyboard and the surface
three hits the market starting at four
hundred ninety nine dollars to the
entry-level model now I don't know about
you but if I spend four hundred dollars
on a product I want to make sure that
it's well protected and choosing a good
product can be really daunting with so
many different things and so many
choices but with urban armor gear you
get something really awesome urban armor
gear offers unprecedented protection and
a really well-designed and easy to use
case that offers protection like that of
military-grade hardware so you know it's
made to take a beating and still protect
your surface 3 from damage not only does
the UAG offer superior performance it
also offers a really cool three-way
adjustable stand and an ultimately cool
pin holder on top so not only do you get
economics you get protection all-in-one
design and we'd like to thank Orban
armor gear for making today's video
possible and providing the surface 3 for
today's review Microsoft Surface three
gives you the best of both the laptop
and tablet world it features a solid
shell a ten point eight inch screen with
1920 x 1280 resolution and features
Intel's Atom x7 processor the
entry-level model is a 64 gigabyte
version but you can also get 128
gigabyte version as well as a standalone
tablet the surface 3 is pretty cool and
it offers an adjustable back stand that
folds into the unit and is totally
unobtrusive you can also use the
Microsoft type cover and the pen to turn
the tablet into a portable laptop the
surface 3 was made to last utilizing a
strong light frame and is ergonomic by
its design with a simple but elegant
look it's also the lightest surface yet
weighing in at six hundred and twenty
two grams and thinner than earlier
versions as well with the ability to run
Microsoft's latest software and office
the surface three can now be your office
on the go on one side the surface 3 we
see the power and volume control as we
flip it around to the other side we see
the USB 3.0 main display port and micro
USB charger port and for those who want
to hear their audio on the go there's
also a headphone jack
there's also a microSD slot for
additional storage the surface 3 comes
pre-installed with Windows 8.1 and you
can easily install the office update if
you so choose accessing your apps has
never been easier and you can categorize
your abs my name category most views and
date installed or even search for them
pinning apps the taskbar is as simple as
holding the related icon the surface 3
can be controlled by either your touch
or the optional pen and in some apps
like paint you can use the bend like a
paintbrush or write your name or
something cool like I did scrolling is
easy simply slide your finger and the
search bar arrives the bottom line here
folks if you are familiar with Windows 8
you will be right at home with the
surface 3 because it's pretty much your
PC just in a smaller little place and
like I said early in the video if you're
going to go out and spend four hundred
ninety nine dollars and more on a
surface three you're going to want to
make sure that that thing is totally
protected and the urban armor gear does
just that this thing is really
incredible it's tough as nails seriously
it's really tough mate or like military
grade stuff to be as tough as military
grade I think it's a really awesome
