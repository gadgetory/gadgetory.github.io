Eric Ferris back here on TECA tomorrow
bringing you guys the latest tech
goodness now we've got a brand new
product called the notebook ergo 360
from the people over at coolermaster now
this product is a two and one product
why is it two in one well not only does
it provide you great cooling for your
laptop it also has a breakaway side
panel that you can use at the same time
that you can use your iPad on or any
other type of tablet so you can call up
your laptop and your tablet at the same
time now some of you might say why they
hold you even do that but hey believe it
or not some people do you could be
running your tablet like so you've got
new Kindle Fire you want to have that
you want to run movies or whatever and
you could have your laptop for games
just all kinds of options so with that
said let's jump in and let's check this
bad boy out so here's the box you can
see it's the note pal ergo 360 that's
the actual nomenclature flip it around
the back real quick or talks about
storage for cable management so it means
you can put your cables everything
underneath it there are two fans as you
guys can see that are prevalent right
there says as 360 degree rotatable stand
serves as a cooling pad adjustable angle
and you can use both parts
simultaneously so that means like I said
before you can use the core and the
other one together so let me once again
get out my defender knife cut the little
box here there's too little cutters
right here poor buddy way to keep them
out of the room today that guy was being
so hyper I didn't think we could film
now he's like outside the door waiting
like Hitchcock ready to get in you know
come on out borscht I know you're
filming in there pull this little bad
boy out a little foam thing here with
him so that you in the cameramen
so I know that you guys on the camera
are all cahoots so for you guys I throw
set you up ha what else is in here all
right so we got the cooler that's it all
right notepal ago 360 multifunction
laptop cooler that's the user's guide a
front and back get the other way you
guys don't really care about that you do
care about this so check this out it's
even got USB got a nice thing here which
you can pull down and this is where it's
going to be for the angles you've got a
little control here so we'll check us
out here is what they're talking about
so good angle it got to pops down right
here set your laptop up on this or if
you don't want to be like that way you
don't have to have it that way you can
always take this thing like I said pop
it back down into place and you can set
it completely flat there's still plenty
of room underneath for you to work with
I think most people going to like it
some type of angle you know I mean this
one's probably going to probably the
most preferable and actually that's how
it naturally goes if you just pull it up
it goes to that one so let's flip it
around here let me try to find the
little sign thingy sorry folks we talked
about there being a part to remove for
the kindle so they actually the back
piece that was right here it doubles is
two different things and by the way this
USB plug right here this is to power
your fans so that's what these are for
you be plugging this into your laptop or
your device now this is the piece that's
the breakaway it'll work on this device
to make it angle but it also works as
your kindle folder as well so you'll put
that little thing right there you guys
can see you can set your little kindle
right there i'm going to set my corsair
dominator memory on it look at that
isn't that a nice little shelf for the
corsair dominator memory everybody who
says thumbs up I want to hear him just I
think it's a great little stand there we
go a nice it will stand for the corsair
dominator yes sir but
get them out of there so that space of
good folks it's two products in one
laptop cooler or your other cooler easy
to put back in add a little sliding
thing they're just pull that back pop it
in and voila everything is back into
place so so that's it folks this has
been the unboxing and first look of the
new cooler master notepal that's right
the notepal peugeot 360 we'll see you
guys back here and check in tomorrow
