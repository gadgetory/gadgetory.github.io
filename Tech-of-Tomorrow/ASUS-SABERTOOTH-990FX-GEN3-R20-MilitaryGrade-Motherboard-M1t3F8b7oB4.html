doing that
well I'm mark here at Echo tomorrow
following up at our CES 2013 coverage
with a JJ from Asus now you guys all
know about the saber-tooth motherboards
these things are totally completely
covered with their great ceramic stuff
these things are geared for the guy who
wants ultimate looks they're really
looked like a combat tank in a way now
this new 990 FX what we're looking at
today is a new revision it's the
revision 3 board and we're going to let
JJ explain to you how this board has
differences it's why it's better for you
at the end user at the end of the day
yeah like you know what it's actually
it's a revision 2 but it's a gen 3 so
it's the world's first a and 3 gen board
so we have full support for actually gen
3 super gen 3.0 which is enabled with
the latest generation of AMD FX based
CPUs in most situations though you're
generally not going to be able to get
the performance benefit of Gen 3.0 right
off the bat but we've done a lot of work
at terms at least making sure that
that's an option that's supported here
on the port but on top of that being
able to add some additional value we've
gone ahead and updated our brand new
thermal assembly to even add four more
dissipation abilities we've got that
serum X coating that you talked about as
well as all the classic tough features
of course it features all the tough
grade components like the tough coat
chokes MOSFETs and capacitors all the
tough components that make this the
famous series correct but in addition to
that we're also talking about validation
you know tough components are great but
just because you have great components
doesn't mean that's gonna be a great
motherboard you know we're actually
showing some that's a tough question
yeah there's actually some footage here
that we're showing that goes through the
qtr lab that shows actually how we test
these boards where we're actively
putting the CPU the graphics the SATA
the USB bus everything under load we put
it actually under load for 20 days we
run it consecutively monitoring the
actual reliability of the board so to
make sure that when a user buys a
sabertooth board they can feel confident
in this long term reliability and its
performance plus you've got of course
the key technologies like our thermal
radar system USB 3 boost and all those
exclusive UEFI technologies the thermal
radar all that that's correct so really
an overall awesome board for guys that
are looking really
great board for the mt3 line excuse me
for the am3+ line out there looking to
keep their board for you know three four
five years especially that we have a
five-year warranty on tough boards this
can be a fantastic option a lot of times
like Anthony Reynolds our in-house tech
he loves the sabre-tooth boards because
he's all into that total like camel
warfare type stuff so this totally like
fits in even with the new thermal tech
products they will take ecstasies new
combat mice and stuff which were
actually to a guy who building combat
stuff could use that hand-in-hand with
years and have total combat look in his
room no toaster you guys can see and I
think that's really cool this board's
geared for those guys who want a really
great board but I really feel this is a
board that has great looks yeah no I
mean overall of course the aesthetic has
always been one of the great things
about the tough line so even before you
speak about reliability consistent
performance and the quality of the
product it just looks awesome so it
definitely speaks to a lot of different
users and we're always happy about
bringing in your tough board to the
market it's like a pretty girl that has
brains rare combo so anyways folks here
it is Gen 3 it's already on the market
by the way JJ be hitting the market
literally as we speak very very soon
sorry guys we'll see you back here in
the channel when we get back to town as
we're heading back now peace out we'll
see you folks back here on tech of
tomorrow thanks JJ thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
