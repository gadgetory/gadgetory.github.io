the channel we all know we're looking
for those great deals so it's the
beginning of October and we've got the
top 5 tech deals under $40 now the first
of these is what they're calling a
wireless gaming mouse I know there's
always a bunch of controversy between
the gamers about a wireless it's not a
true gaming mouse think the snobs going
but hey this thing is thirteen dollars
and 59 cents it's pretty awesome
it's the Z's you etx o 8 mm DPI
adjustable wireless professional gaming
mouse it's got some pretty cool features
5 way DPI switch you can customise the
DPI from 800 1200 1600 to 2000 all those
things are pretty cool but like I said
best of all it's under $14 the 2.4
gigahertz two-way wireless transmission
technology is pretty cool and if you're
looking for something that has no wires
whatsoever and you don't care about
anything else this is gonna be something
that you're gonna want to check out and
like I said it's a great price as far as
the button configuration goes on the
left-hand side you have two buttons
these are very easily accessible with
your thumb on the top we see two more
buttons we see the scroll and click and
then below that the adjustable dpi and
when we flip the xo8 over you guys can
see there's an on and off switch for
making sure your battery doesn't die
unnecessarily to power up the xo8 we
have a compartment located on the back
side as well this is where you put the
double-a battery and the connection for
your USB easily comes out and goes right
back into the mouse for easy storage
next up for you USB enthusiasts we have
the energon 12.1 amp 660 watt 5 port USB
desktop charging station
now this little bad-boy features the
Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 USB charger
for the iPhone iPhone plus iPad
smartphone and other USB devices and the
thing's pretty cool I mean it's really
really small fits on your desktop it's
very unobtrusive and you get a lot of
different options for charging different
USB devices you get a charging in the
very top for a quick charge you have
smart charging and then below that you
have just three more charging ports for
all of your different very
USB 3.0 devices feature in a built-in
SCT IC to ensure maximum charging
efficiency and protection for USB
powered devices the smart charging
technology makes sure that all of your
devices get charged up as fast as
possible with no burn outs to use the
energy all you do is simply plug in the
power cable and you're good to go
and best of all you can utilize every
port on the charger and charge five
devices at the same time in the world of
downloadable media we all know that DVD
things are becoming very passe even
though sometimes you need them you don't
always want them inside of your computer
in that case you're gonna need to get
yourself an external DVD drive and we've
got one from pick tech that is pretty
cool at a great price
now the pick tech is a USB 2.0 cd/dvd
burner ultra slim portable external CD
DVD RW player rewriter for Apple MacBook
and Windows together I got all that at
one time amazingly now this thing's
about $30 the pic Dex pretty cool though
for one thing it's very portable you can
take it anywhere that you want to go it
doesn't weigh anything at all it'll work
on either a Mac or a PC pretty much
anything that has a USB port you can
plug it in and you can use it also for
those people who like to share their
information put it on a disk this is the
best way to do it you can put that
information on disk share with your
friends or stick it in your backpack and
be on the go and like I said hey it's 30
bucks for many PC gamers getting
something that has a great balance
between price and performance is a real
factor and the cyber acoustic 30 watt
powered speakers feature a subwoofer and
are great for your gaming experience and
not only that they don't take up a lot
of room and still sound good there are
two two inch magnetically shielded
satellite speakers and a 5.2 inch
subwoofer the subwoofer itself features
an acoustically balanced wood cabinet
you also get a desktop control pod which
features power volume and bass and you
also have a headphone jack and an
auxiliary input port if you're looking
for a set of speakers that'll sound
great but not blow your house down in
the cyber acoustics 30 watt powered
speakers but their subwoofer are
something that are really seriously
worth checking out there are only 31
dollars if you get the frustration-free
packaging and these things are great
because they not only look good they
sound decent they're not the most
audiophile thing in the plan
but they're only 30 195 and you get that
great sound you get a controller for
controlling everything and what's best
of all if there are people around and
you want to numb out and get into gaming
Hey all you got to do is plug your
headphones into that little headphone
jack where you can completely immerse
yourself in the game with that happen to
worry about in the lives of their pesky
outside people now last but not least
who doesn't like a gaming keyboard right
now here's the weird one like who makes
his keyboard hell if I know but we got
this thing and it actually works pretty
cool it's a USB wired gaming keyboard
with seven adjustable colorful back
lights
and it also features eight gears to
adjust the brightness the keyboard looks
pretty cool and it's pretty well made
also the caps are made of high-strength
ABS plastic and this keyboard requires
no drivers whatsoever it's completely
plug-and-play you can also press 19 keys
together at the same time and it won't
affect your gaming whatsoever and it
also has a 10 million key press life
cycle so you don't know it'll last quite
a long time as well the buttons all have
a very good feel to them and although
it's not an expensive mechanical
keyboard a lot of people who don't like
that kind of feel will probably like
this quite a bit they're also multimedia
Keys located on both the right and left
hand side of the keyboard the response
on the keys themselves is pretty nice
it's not like an expensive meta Kanaka
keyboard but it's also not like anything
shoddy as well it's like somewhere in
between it has a pretty cool design it's
pretty functionable it's plug-and-play
and it's only $35.99 now although I
can't really tell you who makes this
thing it's still very nice for under $40
one thing about this keyboard though I
have to say is very unique I don't know
if you guys have ever done it but I know
that when my kids playing the computer
they constantly spilled drinks on the
keyboard
sometimes even the computers itself to
my wrath I might add but this keyboard
offers something unique if you spill
your drink on this keyboard on the
backhand side of the keyboard there's
the place where it drains and actually
the liquid comes out of the keyboard so
if you spill a drink inside of there it
might be a little sticky but it's not
gonna have all that liquid sticking
inside there to totally destroy your
keyboard and also since it has that
you'll have no problems at all rinsing
water through it to keep it clean and
for adjusting the height of the keyboard
there are also two little adjustable
stands on the back of the keyboard as
well so I've folks there you have it the
top 5 tech goodies for under $40 in the
beginning of October like usual have
links for all of these products down
below like button hopefully you guys
like this products and you know what to
do I'm out you guys been watching teka
