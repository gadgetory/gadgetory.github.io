on the market these days all kinds of
headphones from cheap little in-ear
headphones all the way up to audiophile
headphones that cost thousands of
dollars and there are also noise
cancelling headphones so tell me my sale
kale or just what the heck is a noise
cancelling headphone and why why would I
ever want to have noise canceling
headphones
well noise cancelling headphones are
really good in this respect if you're
out riding your bike or you're at the
gym or you're flying in a plane we are
out somewhere where you just want to be
able to hear your music or answer your
phone and hey what all in private
without really hearing into the outside
noise that's going on these type of
headphones are really good now there's
some out there that are very expensive
there's the Bose ones there's also kinds
of new ones from neuro phone these ones
that are in the three and four hundred
dollar range but I decided that I want
to take a look at some headphones that
were way less money than that I was
trying to shoot for an under $60 version
of this video the top five but um I was
only able to get a bunch of the pairs
under 16 but one pair out of all of
them's actually $80 so I want us to be
the top five you know noise cancelling
headphones that were under $60 but I had
to beef it up to $80 because of these
particular ones in the back now I have
five different sets of headphones okay
starting off the beginning we have two
at $49 this is the cowan that I have
right here and then I have the one with
the one here the Aven tree it's right
here it's a venturi right here the next
I have this one called taotronics this
is a $59 set then behind that these
things are in the a and sevens these are
also $59 and at the very end I have the
Nasdaq when these are the ones that are
$79 now a lot of these headphones sound
a lot the same really I can't out of all
the headphones at the end of three shows
I'm gonna tell you drop the bat that as
far as just the audio quality goes none
of these headphones really stood out
maybe go oh my god this is the best set
now there were a couple pairs however
those we go through that were the most
comfortable that you could wear for a
really long time
sound is the same they all pretty much
have a really basis ound on the end of
them you know and if you turn off the
noise canceling it gets a little bit
more open but they're all very much the
same so let's just start working our way
through these headphones taking a look
at them and like I said we'll start off
in this so let me push these out of the
way now and we'll start off right here
with the Cowen now these are $49 and the
entire bunch of headphones that were
looking at today I would say that
probably I would choose these first I
know it sounds crazy you know if you may
feel different but these were really I
thought the most comfortable headphones
out of all the headphones comfort zone
and after that as far as the comfort
goes it jumps over here into the old
towel so this is $59 those the comfort
levels so let's go ahead and let's check
out what comes inside the box go ahead
and pop cap here get this open inside we
have a VIP card cowan audio it's got a
little thing here so you can register
your headphones or something like that
or at least a cardan you're now a VIP of
these folks you get a for every child a
fair chance United States fund for
UNICEF why this is in here I have no
idea but hey my suppose UNICEF is cool
it's helping people so I'm thumbs on
that but why it's in here I don't know
we've got a Thank You guide users guide
nothing really too much with that stuff
there is a very nice though
carrying case in here it's very nice
it's it's kind of made out of that
pseudo leather stuff it's a Mickey you
can squish it all up into a little ball
you can throw at the cameramen and have
them throw it right back at you here let
me have that thing back here go back in
quit moving when I'm throwing stuff at
you you're taking the fun out of it
alright I'm sorry you can beat that out
I guess but all right so this nice bag
now here are the headphones they are
like I said very comfortable putting
them on here they're very light the cups
are very very soft when they're on your
ear there's no discomfort whatsoever the
noise cancellation on these particular
headphones is also pretty much all like
I said they're all pretty much about the
same none of the noise canceling
features on any of these headphones
actually stands out either but the
comfort level which I feel is going to
be
the most important thing when everything
else you know it's kind of the same
these are very comfortable now these
particular headphones have a 30 hour
playtime with a four hour charge time
they feature 40 millimeter large
aperture drivers they've got a built-in
mic the county sevens also feature
bluetooth 4.0 and NFC pairing
capabilities that's near-field so if you
guys have note that is just basically
another way to connect your headphones
to your devices the ear cups like I said
they're really soft material they call
it a protein material but I don't know
exactly what that is but I just know
that they're very very soft now on the
Left cup we simply have the charging
port on the right cup is actually where
all the controls are looking on the
outside of the cup you can see they have
the cowan name now right underneath that
you're gonna see a little triangle
button now this triangle button does all
the operations and each angle the
triangle does something different as far
as play pause forward backwards all that
stuff's all controllable right there
another cool thing about these
particular headphones is you can
actually plug them in as well so you
don't have to use them wirelessly and
inside the box it actually comes with
the cable for that as well and there's
also another switch that controls the
on/off features in the center is the
Bluetooth and all the way over is the
active noise cancellation now last but
not least people are always wondering
about the aesthetics of a product and
you guys can see from all the product
shots that these particular products by
cowan they actually look pretty good the
design features nice like I said they're
very comfortable
they're only $49 the active noise
cancellation works really well you can
actually answer your phone and all that
stuff while you have these headphones on
so all in all they have a lot of great
features and for 49 bucks I just got to
say they're amazing I mean you get
everything indeed in the box your
carrying case your charging port you can
plug it in leather pouch the whole deal
let's move onto the next set okay now
this next particular set is also another
set at $49 this is the Aven tree now
these are like I said are pretty much
right in the middle of the road with
everything sound is right down the
middle of the road the features are down
the middle of the road the comforts down
the middle of
the road but they're still all on all
solid headphones so let's go ahead and
let's just start taking them out of the
box see what's going on with them the
reason I didn't do an audio test on
these is because I felt the audio was
just so much the same that to show you
guys five different sets the headphones
with five different recordings would
just be a little bit too much and bore
you to death so we just kind of skipped
that aspect it's really not the total
truest you know showing up it anyways
but what the heck
okay so these particular headphones I
have to say their design is very very
minimalistic as far as it looks and
everything go on these particular
headphones they honestly look kind of us
a little bit okay you know they're their
look is nothing that's gonna mean I'm
making you go oh my god these are the
greatest thing since sliced cheese the
cups are pretty nice but the comfort
level on these like I said is kind of
right in the middle of the road this
particular set of headphones even though
it's $49 I feel sits right in the middle
of everything that's kind of going on
today in the box you get the headphones
you get a carrying case the carrying
case is not as nice as the other one
this isn't leather it's kind of a little
fealty case you know it's filthy it's
kind of nice you go ahead right here
once again though you do get the ability
though to plug in the headphones into a
little you know little 3.5 millimeter
jack so if you want to plug it into your
headphones or your whatever you have out
there device that actually accepts this
jack you'll be good to go charging
cables inside of there
now the Aven trees they have up to 18
hours of playtime with bluetooth only
and up to 10 hours with BT and a and C
enabled it actually has a two to three
hour charge time they feature 40
millimeter stereo drivers it's got a
built in mic
bluetooth 4.1 the ear cups are once
again made of a soft protein material
but I didn't think they were anywhere
near as comfortable as the Cowan's they
do have an 18 month warranty and like I
said they're 50 bucks so overall like I
said these headphones sit right in the
middle road and I don't think I
mentioned it the Cowan's also had an 18
month warranty so both of these $49
headphones both of them have an 18 month
warranty these like I say I don't know I
just hate to repeat myself but very very
middle-of-the-road on these particular
devices on these particular set of
headphones
however all your controls are located on
the right hand side your charging port
your cable for connecting it to their
devices all of your controls everything
are located right here pretty simple
stuff it's all operated by one hand I
have to say that controlling these
however is pretty easy because when you
reach your hand up to them they're
actually in a pretty good ergonomic spot
so when you want to control these and do
that kind of stuff it's really good so
if you're in a gym or out you know
running around somewhere and you want to
be able to control these things and turn
off you know your Bluetooth or whatever
is going on you can do it pretty simply
with these headphones and last but not
least on the outside of the ear cup we
see the active noise cancellation on and
off button now the taotronics they come
in at $59 but like I said the comfort
level on these is pretty much the second
out of all of them pretty much the
features are the same this one also has
30 hours of battery life time takes two
hours to charge it up so three the
headphones that were shown you today
actually have you know 30 hours the
other ones have 18 so most of them have
30 and these ones fall into that
category and like I said these are
probably my second favorite of the bunch
even though they are $59 so let's go
ahead just go ahead and pull them out
and also another thing nice about these
ones is these ones come with a very nice
case so even though you're paying you
know $10 extra this is actually kind of
a hardshell case it's not completely
like a hardshell guitar case
but it's not like a softshell case
either it's kind of in-between and I'm
squeezing on it and it actually will
keep your headphones pretty safe and
solid so carrying around and everything
you're not too worried about getting
them damaged just slap them back into
this particular case so go ahead and
pull them out everything you're gonna
get is going to be right here now one
thing about these particular headphones
and I don't know how much it's going to
matter to people out there is this
particular set of headphones does come
with an airport and excuse me Airport an
airplane adapter but I get to set the
airport that's actually on the plane so
it's an airplane adapter it comes with
that also comes with a gold-plated jack
cable so you can plug it in your phone
or whatever device you have got that
still has a plug it is an all Wireless
so you can use them wired or Wireless
the charging cables in there
err 18 month warranty once again it says
that right there not too much about that
stuff the headphones actually lock into
the case so that's pretty nice let me go
ahead and get these out of here there's
a little velcro strap here - so you just
strap them in the velcro strap and take
the velcro strap off when you want to
get them out now these have very very
nice cups now these ear cups are also
made of a soft protein material but like
I said they're very very comfortable the
only ones that I thought were it's a
little bit more comfortable where the
Cowan's and that's pretty much just
because they were just it felt like a
slightly bit of a lighter feel on your
head they just had a slightly bit of a
more like I don't I really put it to you
than a lighter feel and you're moving
your head around these feel just a
little more heavy now as far as the
drivers go this particular set of
headphones has 40 millimeter drivers as
do all the headphones here now the only
difference is on the $79 headphones that
are made of a different material and
like all the other headphones were gonna
see today they do have an adjustable
headband so they'll fit on pretty much
any size head unless you're an alien
with a giant head or somebody was a
really small head like one of those
little shrunken heads now on the right
hand side there are a few controls we
see the on and off button there's a
little light that tells you that are on
and off we have the charging port and
then we had the next previous and volume
buttons located above that on the other
side we see the anc controls this simply
just turns the anc on and off and also
on the left hand side is the jack for
connecting to a device if you don't want
to use these headphones on a wireless
dimension so like I've said throughout
the video as far as the other features
the sound goes and all that stuff these
headphones are pretty much the same
across the board except for a comfort
wise I feel these are the second most
comfortable out of the entire bunch now
next up we have the ausdom a nc7
headphones now across the board if you
look online these particular headphones
do have good reviews the reason i say
they're in the middle of the road above
the stuff that we're looking at today is
they only have an 18 hour listening time
where a lot of the other ones had 30
hours and they have a four-hour charging
time which also once again puts them in
the middle of the road they have a mic
it's bluetooth 4.0 they're $59 like I
said everything pretty much across the
board to me is kind of the
so let's just go ahead and pull them out
of the box and see what they look like
anyway so we'll go ahead and just pull
the old box inside of a box out the old
box ception there pop another little cap
all righty then now you will see though
that these headphones do have a nice
little case though so for people who
want to protect their headphones and
they like a nice case I think a lot of
the review sites do particularly like
this feature it is nice to have a nice
carrying case I will say that because if
you're a person who travels a lot you go
to the gym you don't want to just throw
your headphones in a bag and you know
get them damaged and then they're not
worth the money especially if you're
even gonna pay the 60 bucks you want to
you know have something to protect them
so let's go ahead and just take them on
out of the package here I think I'm
going backwards on this for some reason
I'm zipping my zipper up okay now inside
you get an awesome green card so that
means that all the illegal aliens out
there if you buy these particular
headphones you get a free pass across
the border no I'm just kidding but it
does say green card so it's the Austin
green card it's just a super user
program it's like their thank you to you
for spending your money on their
headphones bro thank you from Austin all
right like all the other headphones
we've seen so far it comes to the
charging cable a gold-plated cable to
hook up to another device other than the
wireless so it comes in bed and it comes
with their little users manual why it
comes to that I guess not just probably
to tell you what the controllers are
like usual adjustable headband
um these particular pads are soft
the thing about Visa I don't like is
they feel really rigid that's to me
that's how I feel these particular
headphones even though they kind of been
in there pretty flexi when you put them
on your head I don't know the way they
fit is weird fee for my head they're
kind of like they go way up to me over
my head they don't really fit good so if
that's probably like my reason for that
other people have me you know have a
different shaped head and for them they
might fit really better they might have
more of an egg head shape of head it
might fit them a lot better but for me
I'm not you know all that firl with the
comfort zone now now as far as the
controls go on the left hand side we see
the anc on and off button as well as the
charging port now on the right hand side
we see the jack for connecting to non
wireless devices right next to that we
see a button that doubles as two
different things
it's the play/pause and the
an off button the same as the buttons
down below this is for your previous
your next and your volume up and down so
like I said I feel these particular
headphones are the middle-of-the-road
the reason I really don't like them is I
don't feel the comfort levels there
they're kind of I think made more for
people have like an egg-shaped head
because the top is just so round that
fixed people who have you know more
taller type of conical head than I do
but I'm sure that it's gonna be
different for people out there who have
different sized heads that's just my
opinion on the whole thing all right now
last but not least out of today's top
five we have the noise hush by Nasdaq
now the only difference between this
headphone and the other ones are two
different things a couple of them had an
18 hour you know playtime these have 30
hour playtime and these actually have 40
millimeter neodymium drivers and those
were actually better made but I have to
say just as far as the sound quality
goes I didn't really think that was that
much of a difference on the noise hush
than the other ones maybe some people
might notice it but I really didn't
notice that much at all but the thing is
though those particular drivers are made
better so they probably will last for a
longer amount of time now as far as what
we get in the box let's just go ahead
and pop the cap and bring these out like
we did all the rest of them done today
like usual these have an inline mic for
answering your phone and all that kind
of stuff that has the ANC noise
cancellation all that stuff one thing
about all these headphones none of them
really had any superior type of like you
know dust or waterproof protection or
anything like that either I thought I'd
throw that out there they're all pretty
much like I said really even across the
board
now really nice carrying case now some
other people might feel that for the $79
that they want the different drivers and
they might want this case the case is
very nice it's made of a really kind of
interesting material because even though
it's hard it's actually very very soft
and and kind of silky feeling it's
actually a pretty nice case so let's go
ahead and pop these out I just wish that
these particular headphones were a
little bit more comfortable as if they
were a little bit more comfortable I
think I would have had a better rating
for them so inside the case actually you
have this thing right here velcro pulls
out you can put it anywhere you want
inside of there take it out it's going
to contain pretty much the same thing
that we've seen and all the other ones
except for these are actually much nicer
so oh also another thing about that you
know what I don't know as I'm recon of
evaluating them maybe there is a reason
for the $20 difference because actually
these do have something that I did not
see actually in any of the others today
and that is the ability to plug in to a
standard so this means if you won't like
plugging into like a guitar amp
headphone or any kind of thing that act
active doing the music industry you'd be
using this particular plug and it's
completely gold so all it really does is
it just pops onto here and you guys can
see though that these connectors and
everything on this are made so much
better than the other one so I guess for
$20 what you're getting with the noise
hush is you're getting probably just a
little bit better quality build and a
little bit better quality in the
peripherals that come with it that's
really what the difference is going to
be the comfort level I'll get them and
put them on my head is not uncomfortable
they're just a little bit heavier than I
felt from the Cowan's which were just
absolutely light on your head and
comfortable so I can't say these are
uncomfortable you also get your charging
cable and once again you get one of
those airplane jacks so for 20 bucks you
get a better set of headphones better
peripherals and the ability to take that
jack and turn into a quarter inch shack
so you can use it with professional
music equipment stuff like that I just
think that that's a really cool feature
about it now
like I said as far as the comfort goes
these are probably right in the middle
road with the other ones adjustable fan
these ones do fit my head a little
better though you see and there are just
and I pushed them all up they're sitting
on my head this is actually important
feature to me because I don't want to be
going around something and have it fall
off my head these kind of fit on my head
pretty good not quite as good as the
other ones but they are pretty
comfortable now these particular cups
however are different than the others
that we saw today as well because they
feature memory foam now the noise such
in one way are very different than the
others they actually have two volume
controls one located on the right hand
side that she uses a scroll which is
very easy to use once you put the
headphones on the scroll wheels right
here sip
turn your music up and down very easy to
use and on that same side you also had
the active noise cancellation button now
all the other controls are located on
the right hand side all your volume
control your Jack for you know hooking
up to what to non wireless devices
rather all that stuff's located on the
other side so you've got your you know
previous you've got your next you've got
your pause your mute all of that kind of
stuff is all located there including the
on/off button all on the left-hand side
so alright folks that is it the top five
active noise-cancelling headphones for
under $80 so let me kind of break this
all down to you guys real quick as far
as a comfort level goes like I said the
Cowens or what I feel for my personal
head shape and everything are the most
comfortable the features are pretty nice
there's some that were $59 as far as the
feature set goes definitely the noise
such are definitely the best they have
the best drivers inside of them
they come with the jack to one corner
you get the airport you know Jack the
airplane jack as well just higher
quality stuff so if you want to pay you
know $79 it's $30 more than the Cowens
maybe somebody has a little bit bigger
head than I do and these might fit them
better as far as the controls and stuff
go honestly all them are almost
identical they're so close all the
controls on them are pretty easy to
access I wouldn't say that any one of
them stands out as being oh hey this
one's way easier other than the fact
that on these it does have the scroll
and a scroll I have to say as much
easier than clicking buttons to try to
make state you know you know if you're
on a treadmill and you're running you
don't want to have to worry about which
button you're clicking you want to go up
to change your volume and accidentally
fast-forward to the next song when
you're listening to your favorite Jam
and your workout you know what I mean
you don't want to do that if you just
want to adjust the volume then I always
have to say these might be just be a
little wee bit better so I'm network you
