eldercare once again on tech of tomorrow
now a lot of people went asking me
lately hey man how was your health do a
health update video ok so that's what
I'm gonna be doing today talking about
my health now for those people who
follow the channel you guys know that
for a while there I got really really
sick I was literally right on the edge
of my deathbed I was having really bad
problems with my shoulder and it
completely locked up I was just an
extremely bad pain I could not eat
anything I could not sleep I was just
basically honestly right on my deathbed
I was in so much pain and so sick that I
never thought I was gonna get better it
was like this for like 90 days which was
just crazy stuff first I had like
pneumonia type symptoms then I had the
shoulder problems and with the shoulder
problems really crazy as my doctor said
okay the pain will never truly go away
and I have to say that I agree with that
you know about pretty much but one time
I was just in my bed a couple months
back and I rolled over in bed and my
shoulder made this really loud cracking
nasty noise and then after that actually
the pain went away almost all the way
I'll admit it you know every so often
I'll have a little pain right here on my
shoulder that kind of pinches but if I
move my shoulder around stuff do some
exercises and especially I just take a
really hot shower moving around the pain
usually goes away so it's nothing
extreme so as far as like my health and
as far as that stuff goes I'm doing much
much better for you people out there who
have diabetics in your family or
anything about diabetes like on my foot
I actually have a big giant ulcer it's
now about like this big and eventually
it'll probably lead to me beginning my
leg amputated I've had it on my foot now
for a couple of years and I've been
keeping the infection away and making
sure I clean it and keep a bandaid on it
but unfortunately I don't really have
that much blood flow in my right leg the
diabetes has been like really bad hence
why I lost like all my toes on both my
feet but I've been I've been dealing
with that it's just it's really hard to
stay on a completely strict diet and
night after night eating for all those
months I'll admit that since you know
I've come back from there I've eaten
worse food
some soda pops I've eaten some candy
bars stuff I shouldn't probably even do
whatsoever but just not eating for so
long you know a sudden there's been
times where I've broken my diet I try to
stick to a pretty good healthy diet as
much as possible as chicken and
vegetables but I mean there's just
occasions where you know obviously
you're gonna eat the occasional
something different with a burrito with
tortilla and some cheese and stuff like
that but mostly I try to eat healthy now
mister buddy the dog here he's getting
old in his years but he's still really
healthy happy dog - he likes making
videos when I was trying to make the
video he just kept trying to hop up in
my lap over and over and over again
unfortunately though he's too old he
can't really make the jump anymore not
on a chair that's high or anything if
it's a smaller chair well then yeah sure
he can do it but anything that's pretty
high now he's just like nope so um I put
him up here anyways cuz I know he wanted
to be in the video really bad he's like
everybody wants to know how I'm doing -
dad and it's like yeah he's doing well
so my health is doing much better a lot
of people also said hey man start a
patreon site you know if you get a
patreon site we'll help you know
supporters you can pay your medical
bills cause like I have just a shot ton
of medical bills they're like stacked up
like you know as far as the ceiling goes
try and even really deal with them at
all is kind of a major pain in the butt
so I did start the patreon site so for
you people out there who have already
supported me there thank you very much
peace and that's pretty much it so
health-wise as far as like having any
kind of cold anything like that I'm
completely over that stuff all the way I
do have like I said the ulcer on the
really bottom of my foot um it's not
infected cuz I'm not sick from that or
anything and I do have some antibiotics
and stuff like that and I've just
learned to keep it clean and I use just
different types of oils and stuff to
keep it clean and it keeps it natural -
I don't like to use a whole bunch of
peroxide on my foot cuz before when I
did that that wasn't really good now I
use a different method so luckily it's
been like a few years it started out you
know really small then just got bigger
and bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and that's just the thing that
sucks about being a diabetic and I'm
trying to deal with that but thanks to
all of you people out there who support
me and the channel that's really totally
appreciated videos don't get very many
views anymore I don't know what the deal
is it just seems like you know you two
when they change their algorithm is kind
of just like pass me over but we're
still here we're still making making
business and still going along so few
people out there who have stuck with us
and are still here hey we love you we
hope to see you guys on the channel um
here in the future some more so see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
