checking tomorrow I'm here at the PV
booth today we're checking out the 8200
this is an auto tuning guitar that
features and tarasana tuning we're going
to turn over to Michael let him tell you
guys about this great new thing and the
people at PV how's it going Michael it's
great glad to be here at Winter NAMM
2012 we got the 8250 V powered by
Antares auto tune you see it looks like
a regular guitar it plays like a regular
guitar with one exception I'm out of
tune not anymore so it's just not this
single button right here that's one
button oh yeah just push the volume pot
down you're perfectly in tune now what
if you were like in just say you were
tuning which you were like a heavy-metal
guy and you want to go to drop D what do
you do to get yourself in the drop fee
just think about it happens
first I'm taking tomorrow it's a auto
mind
tuning guitar Michael 20 tune it with
his mind again now with the mind meld
yeah right and all seriousness you just
you play the opposite of what you wants
you hold down a G flat and drop and back
to normal
what are some of the other components
about this guitar play what kind of
niggas and stuff we look at this bad boy
well with the antara system you've got
modeled pick up so it's modeled after a
two humbucking guitar so the guitar
operates just like it looks the idea
that we want is that you forget about it
it plays like what about it's right you
know the greatest thing about it is it's
perfectly intimated so a D chord here
it sounds low same there G and that's a
nation like that means you guys spend
actually a lot of time actually making
the neck play perfect to be able to do
this Auto tuning right absolutely but
quite honestly it's the system that does
all the heavy lifting I mean think about
this it's using pitch correction to tune
the guitar not mechanical parts so you
would think that it would to try to tune
out your bends but
the system is smart enough to know when
you're bending a note or when you're out
of tune there's no latency you can hear
right when I hit the string so when
you're playing the guitar you just
forget about the system usually do you
program it till I clock into like you're
tuning like what you're saying it's like
if you have two three certain tunings
that you use you can like program those
in the guitar so it has auto recall for
although well the guitar on its own
doesn't have what you call presets I
have to finger the opposite of what I
wanted to do for instance a drop and
open G for instance see actually this so
there you go I know that song so this
thing is basically though from anywhere
for beginning in trailer sort of that
beginning entry-level musician to even a
pro school guy you just doesn't want to
mess with anything on stage just a click
of a button on his guitar in a way he
goes absolutely we feel that the
customer base is very very wide for this
we're not trying to you know have that
educators well we want to teach kids to
tune their guitar well yeah of course we
want to teach kids to tune their guitar
there's a lot more to this than just
tuning what's the street price on this
an entry-level like on these things
right now $500 some dollars that's
pretty good because I've seen some other
fans from other companies went to their
names that are twelve to thirteen
hundred dollars so five hundred dollars
I think you guys want pretty solid
product and you guys say absolutely we
feel very good about it's been a great
show right on thank you very much
Michael thank you for your time good
luck with the show thanks man</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
