BS this time x99 flavored welcome to
techyv tomorrow weather shake it spicy
whoa so what's up you guys like that
intro give a thumbs up and if you like
x99 give a double thumbs up cuz today's
video is all about the x99 platform
featuring Intel's latest Core i7 59 60 X
extreme edition processor and you guys
all know ddr4 comes to the table with
this now Before we jump into the video
though I want to give a special shout
out to the people over at Squarespace
for making today's video possible for
you folks to check out so you guys are
going hey what's Squarespace well you
guys are going to dig in if you guys
want to save money and get a free trial
period all you guys got to do is enter T
ot at the checkout which gives you a
free trial and 10% off if you subscribe
with that said let's jump in and check
out this system real quickly in case
some of you folks out there just happen
to miss it this is intel's very first
desktop 8 core cpu that's not xeon
really big news to these folks now the
one we're using is an 8 core cpu has 16
virtual so you have 16 threads running a
bunch of mixes things absolutely
incredible and doing rendering and
crunching and all that stuff comes in at
3.0 gigahertz 3.5 gigahertz on its boost
20 megabytes of smart cache this thing's
really geared for a hardcore stuff now
the chipset is the 2011 v3 now a lot of
people out there gonna ask this
questionnaire I saw the comments in the
previous video saying hey well my old
CPU work of this and will just work with
ddr3 absolutely not
this chipset supports ddr4 these cpu
support ddr4 and the old CPUs will not
transmigrate over to it but what that
said you guys can see back here the
system's here I've got the motherboard
up here behind me very much thanks to
people over at gigabyte is their x99
gaming
Wi-Fi motherboard and this thing's
pretty decked out we've got 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 from the people over at Corsair
on the outside who is something nice
from Corsair the 750d I also have the H
105 all supreme court so it's an
all-in-one water cooler that's inside
this bad boy it's keeping this thing
running absolutely cool in fact this
thing runs so damn quiet that it's
running actually behind me right now and
you can probably hear the air
conditioner over it and it never reached
a temperature over 42 Celsius ever even
during the most intense testing so this
thing's running cool and absolutely
quiet the CPU itself actually has a TDP
of 140 and this is actually a little bit
higher than the previous generation X 79
next up we have the video cards now you
guys can see that we're using two EVGA
GTX 780 eyes and SLI mode now the core
i7 59 60 X Extreme Edition we're using
features up to 40 lanes of PCI Express
and four of those lanes can be totally
dedicated to video so we're only using
two cards in SLI but we could use up to
four without losing any performance
issues and getting no bottlenecks
whatsoever but gaming isn't something
that we're going to over saturate with
this video because the difference
between X 79 and X 99 were very small
indeed so with that said let's just keep
moving on talking about the parts for
the power supply we have a brand new
from the people over at cooler matte so
this is their brand new V 850 it's got
plenty of juice and is powering this
thing just perfectly another thing to
take note of the rear i/o on the
gigabyte motherboard is really cool
check out how it totally lights up and
like this cool weird like neon purple
color I think that's really awesome and
one thing also cool about it is a lot of
times you're trying to plug that stuff
in behind your desk you know you can't
see you're just like what the heck it
totally eliminates that frustration
because everything is laid out and lit
up so you can see they're like oh yeah
dummy-proof and boom plug it right in
it's a very good feature than the people
over gigabyte and I have to say hey
they're gonna probably get a lot of fans
out there who were given that a thumbs
up as far as storage and boot drive goes
I use the Intel 520 series 240 gigabyte
as our main boot drive and a pyro 240
gigabyte Drive
the people of a patriot as my main
storage drive and last but not least a
couple of small details we did use a DVD
obviously to install the windows 8.1 now
I really absolutely hate windows 8.0 as
far as I'm concerned it can seriously
like burn in hell and disappear but
Windows 8.1 changed my mind once I
install that update have my normal
desktop it was cool to be able to switch
between what I wanted to look out
without being forced into this damn
panel thing I didn't like that
whatsoever now it's a lot better to use
and I'm happy with Windows 8.1 we were
on both of our test systems in
comparison and so with that said let's
jump in and let's check out the test
scores
your backs rocking out once again to the
new benchmark song now a lot of you guys
that they're always asked hey how did
you guys make your music website that's
WWE Tech of tomorrow music com we did
that all with Squarespace now
Squarespace is really kind of unique
they have this totally unique
drag-and-drop interface so that when you
go and you try to design your website
you can do it very quickly because
everything's really intuitive a really
cool thing about Squarespace as well is
they have 24/7 technical support that's
right you guys are based out of New York
the Big Apple and no matter what time
day or night that you need them they are
there for you and it's also never been
easier to set up your own online store
you guys get a free trial by entering
quixote at the checkout and also if you
guys decide to join you get an
additional 10% let's touch real quickly
about their performance of this machine
now obviously in gaming between the x79
and the x99 and just using a couple of
cards there's not much difference in
fact the x79 and x99 platform in general
are only for gaming if you're gonna be
using a bunch of video card meaning like
for because all those PCI lanes being
available is gonna help you out a lot
other than that if you've got an older
4790 or 4770k your gaming machine is
going to be just fine now transferring a
4k video and premiere saved a minute now
over a time a minute really adds up a
lot and when it comes to number
crunching obviously you can see that
there's a big performance difference
between the previous generation and this
generation the drug we tested before was
the 49 60 X this is the new 59 60 X one
little number difference but you can see
that the performance is actually pretty
good it's not mind-boggling but for
Intel it's pretty damn good now if I was
somebody out there and I own the next 79
platform I wouldn't be running out and
going trying to pawn it and buy this one
but if you're just coming into the
market I would definitely choose the X
99 over the X 79 any day of the week
because those little performance boost
over time add up just think about it a
minute you do the videos that could be
in hours which adds up to being days so
over the year and over time you're gonna
be saving a bunch of time which equates
to money in the long run so that's it
folks
wraps up today's video like usual all
the information for this system will be
down there below the like button which
hope you'll hit you like this video and
also if you guys happen to miss anything
and still have more questions about the
CPU and the chipset and all that stuff
make sure you guys check out our
previous video that we did explaining
all that stuff for you the good fans so
hey thanks for watching if you guys
aren't something you like what you see
then hey sub the channel you guys will
see me in your inbox imma or accurate
Tekken tomorrow and uh I'm off to have
some fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
