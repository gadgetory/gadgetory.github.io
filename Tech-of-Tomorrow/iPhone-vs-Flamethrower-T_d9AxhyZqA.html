flamethrower against the iPhone this is
an older iPhone little Rose called women
I got from Jonathan Morrison actually I
got the boring thing here from Jonathan
Morrison at TLD so first off lots of
love to Jonathan from TLD you've been a
great friend thank you for all your
support so that's what we're gonna do
we're here in my driveway outside and
you guys can see I got probably one more
day left in my chair and then I'll be
out of this chair and walking I'm
keeping my fingers crossed my friends
now we do this video I would have you
guys sing the roof the roof is on fire
but I think if I set the roof on fire
the Housing Association will come and
kick me out now before we do all this
burning and turning let's hear a quick
word from today's sponsor Corsair the
strafe mark two features 100% Cherry MX
RGB key switches providing a smooth and
linear response with precise accuracy
these switches deliver flawless
keypresses and have a lifespan of up to
fifty million activations so you know
you're getting the durability you'll
need there's also a convenient USB past
the report for any additional USB device
you might want to use it also includes a
volume wheel so you can adjust the audio
on the fly without interrupting your
game at all the strafe mark 2 is also
compatible with the IQ software so you
can customize the RGB to however you
want it to look looking for a tool to
take on your PC opponents give the
strafe mark to our G mechanical gaming
keyboard a look today so there you have
it looking for a killer keyboard check
out the mark 2 now with that said though
let's go ahead and let's set everything
up we have a little custom barstool from
the backyards so it was a kind of a
broken bar still so we're like alright
we need some kind of prop to put the
iPhone on to burn it up that won't you
know blow up the neighborhood or cause
any serious trouble and now I got to set
up this interesting little boring thing
so let's jump in and let's let's set
this thing up and get ready to do the
burn baby burn
burn so now really quickly let's set up
our ghetto display for the iPhone for
safety reasons I shall now done my
safety goggles hey yes I will ah ain't
she a beaut ok so now we need to set up
the flamethrower although it's kind of
funny because on the box it says it's
not a flamethrower but it clearly does
say flamethrower right here so this
little thing right here is the first
thing we're going to adjust all the way
this way means that it's completely
turned off which is clockwise and
counter clock it's on so I'm going to
turn it just a wee little bit on to
start the flames I don't really know how
crazy it's going to be then I have to
hook up this little contraption right
here making sure that it is completely
off so the last thing we do is we just
lock the tank into position then we
replace the tank and then last but not
least we're going to turn this little
part right here but there you could hear
it actually coming out holy it's a plain
phone it's working let's get that iPhone
madness I'm pretty tough
oh ho
oh yeah back away from that you're gonna
close up here we go
crazy
oh this is crazy crazy crazy crazy
oh my god the iPhones still going though
I think I'm almost out of propane though
we'll see what's going on here one two
three four wait a second again
second
oh wow okay crazy head look this flame
on camera
what I'll do is not too close
that's burning up crazy crazy crazy
crazy one let it cool off second look
cool off thing
oh my god variable or - what about lads
they could have built their tank and
iPhones no this is crazy how's the
backside look
oh man this iPhone is pretty durable oh
my god it's still going I still got a
little bit more propane I think
crazy crazy crazy crazy every
neighborhood dthe one of these right all
right
and that one alright man
the iPhone is tough
now is totally a lot of look but the a
my phone is still burning burn baby burn
like a disco inferno man it is still
going have to say though honestly the
iPhone nailed it so pretty dang good
against the flamethrowers alright I mean
I was burning the crap out of that thing
and what's really crazy is look on the
back side maybe really burn it frontside
so go check out the backside still going
backside almost looks you know still
almost new but on the other side all the
inside components are still burning so
that's a pretty tough outer case on the
iPhone I got to say
flamethrower it's a crazy thing and I
husband the iPhone held up pretty good
that all things considering cuz the
whole backplate of it is still intact
and even though it's burnt it's not
completely destroyed so let me know if
you guys want to see more videos like
this this was a lot of fun thanks you
guys for watching so if you guys would
like to see more flamethrower versus
things well you guys let me know you
guys voted for the iPhone so that's what
I did let me know if you'd like to see
something else I'll put a poll back here
but the next things to burn and you can
let me know what you want to see burn
here on techo tomorrow peace and hey if
you want to get one of these
flamethrowers or god forbid it you want
to get an iphone we'll have a link down
