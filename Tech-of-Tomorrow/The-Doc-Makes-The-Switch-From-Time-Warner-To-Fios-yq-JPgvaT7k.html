there it's me Elric Faris your host here
latekka tomorrow YouTube channel I want
to talk to you guys about something that
I just did recently previously I had
Time Warner servers for my cable for
everything my TV my phone all of it
through Time Warner these guys could
never really provide me very good
internet service the rest it was okay my
phone was kind of clickety clack all the
time friends of mine came over always
talked about their verizon stuff another
TV is way better
so I find just said hey it I gave
up I made the switch now I want to say
right now I'm not being paid by these
guys it's not a commercial or anything
else I'm just letting you guys know my
experience with it and so far it's been
pretty cool so check it out I was able
to get for 135 dollars a month a digital
package with all their cable stuff 35:35
Internet and phone service all in one
package now the thing that's really
surprised me the most is the changes
first of all my internet speeds are much
faster behind me on the screen back here
I had the speeds I'm getting 40 to
download and about 30 to upload
sometimes the uploads a little bit
better and also depending on the browser
this makes a difference Google Chrome
actually is the fastest browser
everything that I test in Google Chrome
always has the first fastest after that
comes the Firefox and then Safari Wow
Safari sucks I feel sorry for my Mac
friend you stick with that Safari
cuz that's a crappy one that's the worst
one speeds actually slow down to like
half using that browser that's just
amazing so maybe you don't know that
using a browser can make that much of a
difference but hey it actually does so
these the benefits I've seen so far
another thing games I go to download a
game off steam man let me tell you
something before I'd be sitting sitting
sitting looking at like you know 1.1 1.1
now I go and download a game it says
like four point five five megabytes the
second so downloading a game is almost
like that quick now it's just
unbelievable how fast it is when I go
out and I start scrolling through my TV
channels all of my channels are much
clearer and I have
an abundance more of channels to view so
that's way cooler I've got movie
channels I've got sports channels I've
got all that I've got some supreme
gold package you know I'm saying and my
phone always previous in the past my
phone had it clickety-clack today I'd be
on it be like clickety clack clickety
clack clickety clack maybe it was like
the IRS wiretapped me or something said
 that's why I change the service now
I'm just kidding ha ha ha sounds funny
though anyways now I talk to my phone
it's like crystal clear it's like I'm
talking to the person right next to them
but so far my experience actually has
all been pretty positive now there are a
couple of negative things for one thing
when you get your internet box and the
guy comes over he tries to tell you all
this stuff to set up your home network
he's gonna give you a bunch of pass
codes and stuff that are totally
irrelevant make sure that if you have
the guy come out to your house that he
sets up your wireless network himself so
you can create all of your own pass
codes all your own logins otherwise the
guy will even write a bunch of
non-essential stuff on which will get me
to the next point that's negative phone
service yeah I waited for like 25
minutes on the phone building for these
 where I wanted to get a hold of
them protect service once I got a hold
of them I got to say it's a place
service but I was on hold a long time
once I did get all of them my entire
network problem everything I had
resolved within like a couple of seconds
so everything's good so I would say if
you're out there in your area and you
don't like your service at all you have
questions about it and you want a really
good service I gotta say my experience
I'm switching to summarizing files and
the whole Gold Package of theirs has
been a solid experience so check out
what I got
once I paid 3 months of bills these guys
give you a $500 gift card a piece of
card that's right you pay 90 days where
the bills and they actually send you a
car when you can go to the bank at $500
out I didn't even have to sign any
contract whatsoever and I've got their
super package at 130 dollars so overall
personally I'm very happy that I made
the switch from Time Warner over to
Verizon Cable so many people minute give
me a about this at all but for the
people out there who've been thinking
about switching and or like in the
middle of the you know the kind of the
teeter totter going five should I do it
I would I've done it I would never look
back ever again see you guys here on
tikka tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
