taking a look at something that is a
really cool idea but at the end of the
day I think you guys will see why I have
come to my conclusions now the product
that we're talking about is the sin seal
morph now the sin seal morph is
essentially a flattened MIDI controller
with several different overlays each one
with its own MIDI presets so no matter
what kind of project you're working on
chances are there's an overlay for it
now the stencils pressure grid it has
two sensors the first is a positional
touch sensor which has 6502 dpi for
tracking accuracy the stencil can detect
any touch anywhere on its surface
however now the second is a force touch
sensor this has actually 20,000 pressure
sensors the stencil has the ability to
tec touch as light as one gram and up to
as heavy as five kilograms the stencil
can also detect any object on its
surface fingers paintbrushes stylist and
even a gloved hand and thus insel has
palm rejection options so you can draw
or use a stylus naturally as well the
stencil also has a latency from 2
milliseconds to 8 milliseconds depending
on the mode you're working on from full
resolution to high-speed modes the
sensor is also pretty portable I mean
it's really just about the size of an
iPad if it not a little bit thinner it's
about nine and a half inches by six
seven inches long and only about 0.2
inches thick the stencil has a
rechargeable 420 milliamp lithium-ion
polymer battery and can be used with USB
or bluetooth and in the box you get a
decent length micro USB to USB cable as
well as the users guide to get you up
and going stencil also claims that the
morph can work in any environment be it
rain snow or even completely underwater
now how you're gonna be doing something
completely underwater um I don't really
know but maybe you could take your cell
phone and dive down in with the senso
and it'll work but I ain't gonna be
going doing that the really cool idea
however behind the entire stencil morph
is that it works at a bunch of various
types of swappable rubber overlays from
music production video editing to typing
and even gaming now the key to running
all of these different rubber overlays
is the sense L app where you can
customize each one of these overlays to
fit your needs the senso app is only
available on Mac and Windows though but
the morph can be used as a USB MIDI
controller for Android and iOS devices
the stencil is pretty good about Auto
detecting what kind of overly you put on
it to and within the app you can change
about any button or slider on any
overlay to do pretty much anything you
want and changing these parameters is
pretty easy as well simply click on a
button you want to change and various
options will appear below it
you can set anything from various MIDI
controls to keyboard buttons and you can
even put it in MPE mode which is MIDI
polyphonic expression which gives each
finger control over pitch timbre volume
and more currently they have about 8
overlays available for from music one
for gaming one for video editing a
keyboard and even a transparent one for
creating your own customizable overlay
the gaming overlay pretty much turns the
stencil into a big flat controller on
the left side 2 L buttons a select
button a flat joystick controls and a
d-pad in the middle is a giant trackpad
on your right hand side to our buttons a
start button a flat joystick and your XY
a and B buttons you also get six preset
buttons up top so you can save different
configurations there's also a QWERTY
keyboard overlay which feels ok for a
flat keyboard but with no key rollover
accidentally hitting other buttons might
become a problem but this is definitely
practical for times when you don't have
a keyboard like using your phone or on
tablets
another overlay is the video editing
overlay which simplifies your workflow
by putting all your shortcuts into a
single button every button is also
labeled on the OH
so any shortcut you send to the morph
can easily be found now being a musician
my favorite overlays are the music
production overlays you get a piano
keyboard with 24 keys a drum pad overlay
with seven large pads and 13
programmable zones and even better you
can use your fingers or drumsticks or
pretty much anything to make a beat
once this overlay is on the morph goes
into fast scan mode capturing every hit
no matter how fast it is now they also
have a launch pad like overlay with 16
note pads and different midi knob and
slider controls and even piano keys at
the bottom which of course you can
change to anything you want
this next overlay is called the bucola
Thunder overlay and it's actually not
part of the music production package but
you can still get this overlay by itself
but it's 60 bucks
it features 27 areas of which can be
used with any instrument that accepts
MIDI or MPE input the Buchla Thunder
also includes nine different maps that
you can easily switch between and you
can do this all without ever opening the
senso app
now the last overlay is a transparent
one which means you can pretty much
great and drought your very owned
overlay now this is customization to the
max meaning that you can make it do
whatever you want it to do wherever you
want it to do it with three different
shapes to choose from you can set up
your buttons to be any size you want and
even any color you want as well and with
a little programming I would have to say
this overlay seems like the all one
package cuz you can pretty much turn
into any overlay you want to now before
I get into my conclusion on the sensor
website you can get the senso morph with
one overlay for 249 dollars now they
also have the music makers bundle which
is the sense of morph and three overlays
the piano drum and the music production
overlay this is two hundred and eighty
dollars then they have the senso morph
with the booklet Thunder overlay that's
also two hundred and seventy dollars and
like I said the booklet Thunder overlay
is about sixty bucks all the other
overlays are about thirty-five dollars
now I have to say that you know this
unit is a pretty cool idea and the fact
that it uses haptic force feedback you
know so when you're touching the buttons
you get that little kind of vibration
that's all kind of cool but here's the
real thing to me using all this stuff
especially for music production and
stuff like that I think that for your PC
or your Mac you can get better things to
do it with like if I was really trying
to save money for music production I
would probably go with Ike a multimedia
just that some of their stuff to me is a
little bit easier to use now if you're
on your phone and you're wanting to do
stuff on your phone then obviously this
could be something you know that you
could take with you and do whatever you
want but at the end of the day I think
that it's a little bit too pricey for
what you get
honestly I don't think that I personally
would go out and buy this myself but
there might be other people out there
who
opinions different it's a cool idea it's
a little bit pricey maybe with the
little adjustments in the future and as
they you know get the product going this
is probably the first run of it and they
make stuff that's actually full-size
maybe this will come more in four tation
especially if they can get that price a
little bit lower right now like I said
at the prices that it's at it's not for
me
but hey like usual we'll have all the
information about this particular
product down below so if you want to get
more information check out some
different videos or just get some more
opinions or because you like it you want
to buy it we'll have all that
information down below also if you like
what you seen you like the channel hey
make sure you hit that sub button and
turn on notifications so hopefully we'll
see you guys back here on the channel
we'll see you guys back here on techo
tomorrow for more tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
