back to tech of tomorrow I'm here with
buddy the impatient and dog and today is
launch day of the brand-new AMD r9 290x
now the sample that we're getting is
non-reference and we'll be here for
about a week or so but we were lucky
enough to hook up with our bro linus
who's actually gonna bring the coverage
for us so for all you folks out there
after better once you guys hit that like
button and show linus how much you
appreciate him bringing that technology
over here to tech go tomorrow so we
could bring you stuff on launch day
linus bro thank you very much man
appreciate it very much and with that
said let's bounce over to Canada
and see what Linus has for us on the new
r9 290x thank you for the invitation to
do the guest review I appreciate it very
much we were lucky enough to get one of
AMD's Radeon r9 290x cards and I would
be more than happy to tell you a little
bit about it so number one is it uses
the same GCN architecture as the last
generation 7000 series but there have
been some tweaks and improvements some
new features and just generally some
beefing up Ness of that last gen
architecture to make it a truly next-gen
performance card so for one thing that 1
gigahertz processor in there has over 6
billion transistors with 2,816 stream
processors it now features a four gig
memory frame buffer and a 512 bit bus
this is important particularly in the
future when we want to be playing games
at greater than HD resolutions such as
two and a half K or even 4k in fact the
290x really stretches its legs when
you're gaming at 4k or an AMD Eyefinity
technology which is surround 1080p
monitors for the most part although you
can do surround 4k and I did see that
with two cards running at their
conference and it was pretty freakin
amazing now they've made changes other
than that number one is it has DirectX
11 point 2 support but nobody is talking
about that so let's just move right
along
number two is support for AMD's mantle
API so this is a new way that game
developers can probe
on their game - instead of communicating
with the card through an intermediary
such as DirectX or OpenGL it can
communicate directly to the card in a
way that wasn't previously possible so
when battlefield 4 comes out very
shortly in its retailed form we're gonna
be looking at probably AMD and NVIDIA
neck-and-neck because they're gonna be
under the same constraints and that is
dealing with DirectX in December when
battlefield 4 becomes the first game to
officially support mantle we could be
looking at a whole new world of
performance not only for this card the
290x but also even for Amy's last
generation 7000-series products because
it is supported on any card running with
a GCN architecture chip inside it but
there's more guys the chips clocked it
up to one gigahertz what exactly does
that mean well their new power tune
technology allows maximums to be set for
pretty much anything and then handles
the actual fluctuations on its own so
you can set a maximum power consumption
a maximum temperature a maximum clock
speed and then voltage is actually going
to be dynamically adjusted in order to
keep all of those other things under
control and optimize the card for as
much performance as possible
AMD's quoting changes in voltage as
granular as once every 10 microseconds
yes an extremely extremely small amount
of time in order to leverage the
available power that the card can
consume now with that said yes the card
does consume more power than GTX 780 and
GTX Titan but it also performs extremely
well it's also a little bit on the
louder side but with the switch on the
top you can decide whether you want the
fan to run in quiet mode which maxes out
at 40% fan speed or uber mode which
maxes out at 55% fan speed more
improvements guys easy Eyefinity now
gone are the days of DisplayPort
adapters in order to get Eyefinity
running at all you can hook a monitor up
to any of the four outputs out the back
and you are ready to go you can also run
up to 6 displays off of a single card
using a DisplayPort hub and they no
longer need to design an eyefinity 6
edition in order to enable that use case
next up we've got true audio which right
now okay there aren't a ton of games
supporting yet but in the
future could be a big deal it's a
programmable DSP so that is a digital
sound processor on the cart itself that
will allow games to directly tap into
resources that they never would have had
before and they would have had to rely
on the CPU because ever since Microsoft
changed things around with Windows Vista
and we weren't able to use hardware
accelerated sound cards anymore
we've been stuck pretty much in the dark
ages as far as hardware accelerated
audio goes so I really hope that this is
something that takes off but right now
it's only supported on the 290x the
upcoming 290 and the two 60 X now with
respect to overclocking and the way that
power tune works we didn't get a very
good overclocker I've had people
commenting on on my reviews saying well
Linus you've only got it clocked at this
and other reviewers thought that you
know what overclocking is a bit of a
mixed bag I think we're not gonna get
the true performance story of this card
until you see non-reference designs with
better power solutions and with better
coolers on them that's when we will
really see what radeon r9 290x is
capable of so bear that in mind when
you're looking at our overclock so we
have a decent overclocking GTX 780 we
overclocked all of the cards in our
benchmarks our 290 X isn't a great
overclocker but what we can say about it
is that it is $100 less expensive than
the card that you're about to see it
real close to on all the following
charts so without further ado let's rock
out to benchmark music in the typical
pack of tomorrow style
someone's coming and I guess you guys
are back anyway so that was a little
awkward
alright you guys looked at the numbers
you saw them price the performance clear
winner against the GTX 780 although
we've yet to see what Nvidia is going to
do with the 780 Ti next thing up is
performance wise remember we overclock
all the cards this one's a bit of a bunk
overclocker and our 780 is an ok
overclockers so if we factor in that
other reviewers around the web we're
getting upwards of 1 point 1 gigahertz
on this card we can say with confidence
that it should be performing
particularly at higher resolutions and
it does really stretch its leg as you
amp up resolution it performs at least
on power maybe better than the GTX 780
and that is without factoring in AMD
mantel technology yet so in short it's
up to you what you guys think but it
looks to me like AMD has a winner on
their hands if you're looking for a very
high-end gaming solution with a great
price to performance ratio thanks again
for having me as a guest on tech of
tomorrow I hope that I didn't bore you
guys and without further ado back to
Elric so wasn't that awesome news
directly from Linus tech tips in Canada
so right the bat once again a high
salute to him the team over there make
sure you guys sub to Linus tech tips for
bringing this coverage over to us and
probably the next time you see me lions
together we're going to be giving away a
giant amazing system so with that said
I'm gonna go out and actually read some
reviews and see what's all but this so I
can actually form my own opinions in
time for when I get my cards here at the
house so that's it peace out thank you
laughs we love you brother so much
appreciation for that fans makes you do
the right thing hit the like button here
and go sub to Linus tech tips and if you
love us hey you're not so hit that
subscribe buttons you can see up side
there behind
