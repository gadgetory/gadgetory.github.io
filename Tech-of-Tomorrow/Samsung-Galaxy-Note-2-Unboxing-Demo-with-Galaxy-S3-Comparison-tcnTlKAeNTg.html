Wednesday on tech of tomorrow I'm
eldritch Ferris your host today we're
doing the unboxing and first of the new
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 now this thing has
a 1.6 gigahertz quad-core processor a
5.5 inch Super AMOLED screen all kinds
of other great features that you're
gonna want to take a look at so with
that said let's jump in and do the
unboxing and check out this new Samsung
product
all right folks so right here we have my
galaxy s3 right here and the next up we
have the new samsung galaxy note 2
things a lot different than my phone and
a lot like my phone it's kind of bigger
screen to me start unboxing it
resolution on this is 1280 by 720
exactly the same as my phone features
this Super AMOLED screen it's got an 8
megapixel camera 1080p video quality has
a pen that's actually very touch
sensitive has built-in GPS features the
new 4.1 jellybean which my phone is
actually supposed to update to very soon
but it's not so prot the bat let's just
show these two right next to each other
now my cameraman who let me this thing
he thinks this thing's too big but in
all honesty I covet this thing and if it
worked on my phone I'd be getting this
thing from him I'm gonna get me one of
these even though it's bigger I like it
that's the way it is I think this
thing's very nice for traveling around
with the bill ability that you're gonna
be able to take the pen and write down
all your notes and everything and use it
is gonna be very well people traveling
doing a lot of business I personally use
a lot of the microphone technology we
just click a button and you know you
record that's my favorite thing to do
but the new pen is gonna be pretty
interesting to do so with that said
let's go ahead and take out the pin and
let's check it out as I set down my
phone then back down here underneath is
the pen you can see it's writing this
little silver thing I'm gonna go ahead
and remove it out of there get this up
to the counter for you folks I'm gonna
go ahead and remove this plastic screen
off the front here underneath you can
see the Super AMOLED screen and check
that out as I'm coming near the screen
one thing white folks he checks as I get
into the screen
I'm the worst typist in the world now
that I wrote this incomprehensible
bullcrap on the screen let me try to use
the eraser and just erase it all off of
there make the screen nice and pristine
again I have very very sloppy
handwriting you can also clear all but
for some people who type good this may
be a very good thing like you could just
say like especially like you could say
I mean it's chicken scratch but I mean
it gets the message across how well this
particular part of it is going to work
I'm not exactly sure but it is an
interesting thing now let's move along
and let's take a look at some of the
other accessories if I didn't mention it
earlier this thing has a 1.6 gigahertz
quad-core processor in it go ahead and
move over the box right here you guys
can see right here at the Galaxy Tab to
you your tablet buddy I got a buddy -
his name's buddy the dog and he sitting
over on the table over there and
actually sitting quietly while do the
videos so I got these two things your
registration your warranty try to hold
the Box open here
got your Quick Start Guide cable four
USB connectivity
alright let me move on now the charger
that's in here is actually the
international version it's a little bit
different the phone that my friend
Jonathan got is actually the unlocked
version
talk whit and set that down next up are
the headphones they're all on here nice
and wrapped you can see that they've got
little cones here I'll push them out a
little bit here you guys can see the
rubber eyes ear pads they pull off
there's a replacement pack that's right
here in my hand
you got a bunch of different sizes here
to put on depending on your size of ear
so it'll fit inside of your ear
comfortably so with that said let's
actually do this a little bit more
hands-on with the new Samsung Note 2 so
you pick it up start up here I love that
watery sound it's saying swipe screen to
unlock let me get back out of here I'm
just gonna press this right here get
back to the homepage they've got a lot
of stuff going on here this is your
s-pen discover your inner creativity so
obviously they're gonna have a training
program and stuff inside of here for you
to go ahead and learn how to use that
it's also your phone has your contacts
everything else all your apps and
everything so what this thing to me
seems like that it really is it's kind
of like having a blackberry type device
just without the typewriter on it cuz
now you have a pen but it's got all
functionality it's also bigger so for
people who are on the go and playing
game didn't like that stuff it's gonna
be a very very good device so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video I think this
is a really cool product I'm actually
gonna try to get one for myself on my
account this one's built for the AT&amp;amp;T
universe and for others it actually does
not work with my verizon account which
is a bummer because if it did I would be
taking this thing for myself so here's
the front there's any question just
again I'll just show you guys the back
the megapixel camera that we talked
about
down here I'll reap with the pin back in
now and easily goes in once you put the
pin back actually the phone you didn't
see that when you put the pin back in
the phone actually changes it recognizes
that you no longer are using the pen so
all right folks I hope you guys enjoyed
that that's the unboxing of the new
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 you guys can see
is a different size than my phone but
for those people like I said who are on
the go a lot
this can be a very very handy device
I'll see you guys back here on techo
tomorrow for more tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
