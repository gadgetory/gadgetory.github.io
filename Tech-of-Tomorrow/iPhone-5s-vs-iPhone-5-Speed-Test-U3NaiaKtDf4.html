where we are interviewing none other
than Henry Ford soon-to-be inventor of
the car only thing is he doesn't know it
yet
as if like I have a time machine that
I've arranged a sample of with the
government yeah that's what I did it
travel back in time and interview Henry
Ford before he had the car No so what's
going on an apple new iPhone 5s it's out
some people even waited in line ten days
now my buddy over t LD being that he's
an Apple fanboy and all him in the
homies went and they waited in line
early in the morning not for ten days
mind you but they were there early in
the morning eating their Mickey D's
breakfast or whatever they were doing
that day now I know you guys don't want
me to cover a whole lot of things on
phones you guys don't seem to be too
much that audience especially if it's an
Apple phone you guys like to throw rocks
and stuff at it but I figured you guys
would at least want to know how much
faster is it then the
previous-generation phone that's
something that you guys would at least
finish that I fear you like hey is it
cool is it better at all well inhale
 yeah so hey Jay I got a piece of
paper blowing over here towards me and
on this piece of paper I have my secret
notes for what's going on so let's see
how much faster the new 5s is than the
previous generation iPhone so let's talk
about the first score Geekbench
single-core now the iPhone 5 had a score
of 720 - iPhone 5s 1400 and 8 so that's
almost double the score so no matter
what kind of if you want to talk
it's actually twice as fast as that in
that score we're gonna jump up to the
next one
geek bench multi-core iPhone 5 1300 i
phone 5s 25:58 once again we see it
almost doubling the previous generation
that to me is pretty impressive I mean
I'm not gonna around buying iPhones it's
not my thing but if I was in that market
I might be seriously going damn it's
time to upgrade next up 3d mark ice
storm unlimited now this score it
actually more than doubles iPhone 5 5689
iPhone 5s thirteen thousand eight
hundred and ninety seven Wow
that's pretty damn impressive so they're
doing a lot of stuff with their chip
over there at Apple to make it obviously
play games better next up again 3d mark
ice storm unlit
graphics score iPhone 5 5232 iPhone 5s
17,000 617 now last but not least and I
actually I think this is pretty
important for a phone I'm not a big
gamer on a film but for me web browsing
and like that if I'm at my car
looking for something this is a very
important thing so this is called
SunSpider
1.0 point 1 lord x equal better score we
have the iPhone 5 700 milliseconds the
iPhone 5s 417 point 7 milliseconds so
not quite double but pretty damn close
so you guys can see that obviously the
people over at Apple they've done a lot
of stuff to make this much much faster
now I'm not having all the specs here
and all that stuff because I'm not a big
phone guy but if I was just a consumer
going out in the market and I went up to
somebody and I said hey dude what does
that phone do compared to that phone
well obviously the new iPhone 5s kicks
its previous generations phones right in
the bollocks because it's double on
almost everything so that's gonna be
better gaming better than internet
browsing better opening up stuff faster
music just all in all if the phone is a
better phone mechanically built wise
which I'm not even getting into it
should be a really big hit for the
people over at Apple now Apple haters
are obviously gonna go and not give a
grats ass but for some people out there
who do care about this I think this is
pretty relevant information obviously
the new iPhone 5s is twice as fast as
the previous generation iPhone 5 so with
that said hope you guys like this video
