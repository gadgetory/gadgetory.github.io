battlefront is here Star Wars beta
Edition and I've got that shit for you
guys in full 4k glory so we're gonna mix
it up we're gonna have live gameplay
mixed with fraps captures all in what
now remember I've got all these settings
turned up to their maximum maximum
settings so real quick let's check that
out folks you guys can see that I have
everything set to pretty much as high as
it can go if I said it any higher than
these particular settings the system
actually did start to crumble down so
let's talk a little bit though right now
about the system back here behind me is
the blue fury and yes you guys have been
asking for it I've upgraded to Windows
10 now so all the testing I'll be doing
in Windows 10 x9 I'm bored by Asus the
deluxe board this board is totally
badass
and for the CPU on this baby it's the
Intel Extreme 59 60 X liquid-cooled all
custom chip from Swift Tech you guys can
see the Tod thing Bill Owens actually
made this really cool window design for
us we took that off though so you guys
can see in there it's got 16 gigabytes
of kingston memory in there just look at
this thing it's all water-cooled - fury
X cards that's right - fury X cards in
crossfire and everything's gonna be
brought to you guys in glorious 4k now
you guys are big shock but with all
these settings set on there Ultra
resolutions and everything on a 4k
monitor I'm getting about 51 to 53
frames per second even with two fury X
cards so that's pretty badass
so with that said though let's jump in
and let's check out man
Star Wars what the fuck is here let's go
kill some see it alright so enough about
the system and everything else what's
now going to let's play survive between
gonna be a single-player cuz it's just
me right now
keeping the difficulty on normal and
let's go in here and let's play this
badass thing now this is total like I
said in 4k you guys can see it caught my
Acer monitor here and then pretty soon
we shall be off
not my best
that looks pretty frickin amazing back
bar is who
waveone so you guys can see it's kind of
hard to see probably I'll do some
recording tuning about 45 frames per
second I just hit the record button so
we can core just a little bit of it
check out what it looks like in glorious
4k that is how we were cutting the frame
rates back to about 22 and 23 but I
don't know still play goodnight
check this out awesome
here comes the next batch of beverage oh
yeah recharge baby
okay now I think that's gonna get a
little bit crazier on wave 3d okay
what's up
flame the pot okay
all right come clean the pod waiting for
the next assault now something's got to
change here so any of the weapons yet no
nothing yet
the heck is that noise man what the hell
oh shit
Oh
it's just me and my little ol hot wife
Oh
going after a widow at that tummy with a
wet head I go get you
I don't hear you come to Papa
don't run away that's not love oh boy I
don't think I could take that thing on
head-on no that kind of kicked my ass
Oh
okay different strategy different
strategy these damn Imperial bastards
they got people everywhere coming after
poor old me
Junio would you me anything that are
looking good for me right now
oh shit I got down to 50% usage yeah
baby it's down to 50% if it is sent down
to pretty
that's just crazy man
oh I did got it - that last explosion
was fucking totally badass well then
just blew that a tad up that thing
almost killed me though a bunch of times
it surprised I didn't get killed
I sure if I stood up to the crazy ass
hard levels' it will do that so I don't
know what you guys think but this stuff
looks fun I can't wait when the full
game comes out so I can play it my son
came over yesterday he played a bunch of
hours on it oh and I'm liking it I'm
addicted I'm a Star Wars freak I think
most you people are and you guys can see
like this is a super system back here
and in 4k it's still only getting less
than 60 frames per second and that's
with two fury X cards and crossfire mode
why is that because well obviously this
game is demanding but as you guys can
see like when I walked up to that Canyon
cliff scene you look down shit's
starting to look real that's all I'm
gonna say anyways more information link
this we go down there below that like
button which hopefully you guys will go
Chuck Norris smile on cuz I know I
totally dig this shit and I hope you
guys too do you like what you see hey
subscribe because I got a lot more
videos coming here on TECA tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
