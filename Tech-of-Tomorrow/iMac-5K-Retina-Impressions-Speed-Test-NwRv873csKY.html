guys are checking out tech of tomorrow
I've got on the table today the latest
2014 27-inch iMac with 5k display that's
right now whether you guys like Apple or
not you gotta hand it to him because
these guys are the only people on the
market that have a 5k display that's
right so what is five-carat they're here
when 5k I've heard of 4k but which is
what my hell is 5k well 5k is the
resolution death this thing has a
resolution of 50 120 by 2880 whoo
amazing right pixel density fourteen
point seven million pixels in this thing
so basically what you're getting is four
times the pixel density that's right
so instead of seeing a single pixel in
there you're seeing four times that
single pixel which makes it amazingly
accurate it's wonderful to look at and
it's so much easier on the eyes I mean
that's pretty much the biggest thing
about this brand new product it's all
about the monitor now AMD actually had
to work with Apple and do kind of a
little fidgeting to even get this thing
to do this because you guys all know
that currently right now there's nothing
out there that can truly power anything
like this hence why Apple right now
isn't releasing a single monitor like
this because they can't anything to
power it but working with that deal with
AMD they've got this 5k thing and I have
to tell you after looking at it and
using it it's simply incredible I'm an
older guy I even have to wear glasses
sometimes and looking at this monitor I
don't get any kind of eye strain
whatsoever and if you compare this to my
older 2012 edition one the screen is
just you're just like holy Batman I
mean the depth clarity on the other one
you know 2560 by 1440 you know it's
nothing does it go about it's pretty
damn awesome but now you take that and
you've got this 50 120 by 2880 just
think about that it has to really be
seen I feel in person to be truly
appreciated having a 5 K screen means
you can have that 4k video up and still
have space to work around which is
actually a pretty awesome thing the one
that I got is just the basic you know
it's the entry-level it's the i5 3.5 3.9
on the boom
it's got an M 290x you know video card
two gigabytes of RAM you could upgrade
that to four you can also upgrade it to
a i7 each one of those is $250 a pop
though and I really wouldn't suggest
upbringing to many of the things beyond
those two through the Apple upgrade
program because even though the fusion
drive is only one terabyte with the new
Thunderbolt 2 thing you can hook it up
and you can have so many external drives
it just makes it completely irrelevant
almost what the internal storage is in
there it's nice to have it but why pay
the people over at Apple a fortune when
you can just get some external things
now I know the questions on everybody's
mind though is all hey where is the
performance now take in mind that my
late generation 2012 is an i7 it's 3.4
gigahertz and it also has 32 gigabytes
of memory where this one is an i5 and
only has 8 gigabytes of memory in
Geekbench 3 my 2012 iMac had a single
core score of 36 14 the brand-new retina
iMac had a single core of 38 79 as far
as the multi-core scores go we saw 13
795 on the 2012 and we saw 12,000 406 on
the retina iMac so like I said
previously the new one is an i-5 my
previous generation is an i7 and you can
see that this thing's keeping up and
beating it in some places another
interesting twist this time the CPU is
not soldered onto the motherboard like
previous generations so if down the road
you decide hey I do wanna upgrade the
CPU you'll be able to do it next up
let's check out disk speeds now take
into comparison both these drives are
one terabyte fusion drives the 2012 iMac
had a score of 139 megabytes a second
right and 322 megabytes a second read
the brand new retina iMac however had
311 megabytes on the right and 688 point
7 megabytes a second on the read so why
don't you guys think but I think that's
actually a pretty damn nice jumped from
upgrade for machine to the other you're
always looking for some kind of upgrade
in some kind of performance things that
are better this is one of them now as
far as graphics go my 2012 iMac came
with the gtx 680 MX it had 59 point 2
frames per second with the onscreen
testing and 107 frames per second with
the off screen now the retina iMac with
the MT 90 X
scored 26 point 4 frames per second on
screen but 169 frames per second off
screen and the reason for this is
obviously this retinas boy has so many
more pixels to push that in some areas
something he's just gonna have to give
I've seen actually no lag in this
machine whatsoever everything hops
around and just his good works
flawlessly I don't see any difference at
all between my previous generation it
pretty much seems the same and I didn't
have to do really any upgrades at all at
this I didn't do any memory upgrades no
video card upgrades no nothing that says
out of the box stock machine for people
out there who are getting older who just
want to have a monitor that's going to
totally be the best that they can get
this is what you want to get your hands
on now I know people on the PC
master-race and go I'll screw that I'll
wait blah blah blah you'll be waiting
probably a little bit longer but for me
for what I do
for my old eyes I gotta say I really
love this thing as far as the internal
hardware and stuff goes it's probably
not going to be all that much driven
than we've seen previous generations you
know there's gonna be a few new parts
here and there but the biggest thing
about this obviously is the monitor and
I got to tell you from first impressions
I'm impressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
