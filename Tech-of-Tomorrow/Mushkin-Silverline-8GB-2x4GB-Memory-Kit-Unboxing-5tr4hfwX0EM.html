all the tech all the time and today
we're taking a look at the Michigan
Silver Line memory pack that's right you
guys can pick this up over on Amazon for
about 42 dollars I believe about 20
dollars at stake it's an 8 gigabyte kit
timings are nine nine nine twenty four
it's coming into market at 13 33
megahertz I don't know if it's gonna
have an XMP profile or not it's pretty
much standard based memory but that said
let's open the package and let's check
this shiznit out all right light so here
we go and I say the name of Michigan it
to me sounds like something like Irish a
Hollander type styled a Michigan the
weird strange name you can see here
Michigan enhanced and get more that's
right to get more for your dollar lads
alright anyways a screw around the
vocals there we'll flip it around right
here so you guys can see the sticks
inside the actually the Silver Line
thing we're gonna take them out for you
but some people like to see the
unpackaging or actually like to see the
packaging as I unpackage it turning it
into the raw product that it is alright
here we go spin it around one more time
the memory of the future if you buy it
it's definitely the memory for your
future that's for damn sure son so wish
me enhanced gives you how to install it
pretty simple I think most people are
doing it and there's a little thumbs up
right there yeah and then get more
alright so that's it let's pop it out of
the packaging here pop one out pop the
other one out then we'll bring up the
camera run close so that he can show you
them let me try to get them over here
alright so here we go try to get those
sitting flattened upon my hand there as
best I can
it's gonna take a look there
I was set one down here for mr. Cameron
to zoom it in fact I'll go ahead and
make it cool because the color I'll use
this black background which I think
should look good I'll set these down and
I shall have the camera in super zoom in
on here
so now let's type the cabman get really
close up here you guys can see the front
of each stick notice the notch that's in
here make sure you're putting it in your
mother bore when you look you'll see the
memory is actually only going to go one
way make sure you install it properly
now we'll go ahead and we'll turn them
over one at a time so you guys can see
the back so here's the back side the
color of silver I think is really badass
I like silver looking stuff back in my
day everything was like silver silver
stereos silver everything and then
everything went matte black and so now
things are starting to come back to
silver again and that's kind of a
classic so I like it and that's pretty
much that
alright folks so there you have an 8
gigabyte kit 2 sticks 1333 but 42 bucks
you may be able to find it cheaper if
you look around maybe it's more
expensive it all depends this is the
price we'll talk about on Amazon which
you guys can check out in the link below
like usual hey I hope you guys liked
that video and make sure that you hit
that like button here's the L to hit

contest which means we'll be giving out
lots of prizes and we'll have what oh my
god another contest is even bigger and
more so we'll see you guys back

see it CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
