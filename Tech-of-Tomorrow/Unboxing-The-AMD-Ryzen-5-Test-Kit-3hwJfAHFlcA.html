Tekken tomorrow we're not those other
guys and today we've got something
pretty badass for you folks
now many people out there they have
hopes and dreams of becoming a reviewer
and getting that cool stuff that you see
us reviewers get well today we're going
to show you exactly what you get in the
AMD test kit called risin 5 that's right
so if you guys are always wondering hey
man what do you get as being a reviewer
well with all the half of all the other
stuff I got a mitts a mixed bag
sometimes you do get some cool ticket
mutters yet like today so let's jump in
real quick and let's see what you get as
a reviewer in AMD's risin 5 test kit so
this is the box that was actually inside
the box we decided to skip the box
section today and just go straight for
it
now we'll open up the top here now the
packing in this was a little bit more
dense when I got I looked at it make
sure there was a little rip right here
but uh real quick you guys can see now
this is what comes in the kit sure what
this is right here so I'll pop out of
the way real quick we see the two CPUs
they're coming the kit 1600 X 1500 X get
those those came we also get some very
nice memory from Gayle has a lot of
features here nice ddr4 stuff leave its
3200 megahertz so pretty nice stuff
there let's go ahead and just take it
out of the box even if it won us as
we're here let's check this stuff out
and you guys can see it looks pretty
nice now this stuff totally lights up
RGB so it's going to be cool to look
right for the motherboard all that cool
RGB stuff for those RGB lovers out there
we also get another race cooler sorry so
I've sliding all around we also get
another rate cooler some people like
these coolers they actually work pretty
doggone well fit that out of the way got
an extra cable here applied for the
motherboard and then the motherboard
itself is the a be 350 gaming 3 from
gigabyte so they're gaming series
motherboards it's the lower end chip
said it's the B 350 so even these and
boards about a hundred bucks on the
market I think right now so these are
really well priced motherboards so these
are some real quick video folks but I
mean if you're ever wondering whatever
comes in the test kit well this is what
it is peace out we'll see you guys back
here for another video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
