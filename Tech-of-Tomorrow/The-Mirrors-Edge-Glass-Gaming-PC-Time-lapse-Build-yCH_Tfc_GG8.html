back here on Tekken tomorrow bringing
you guys a bad ass system now this
system
I'm calling the Mirror's Edge and really
the whole basis around this entire
system is to show off a bunch of killer
ass parts that we got from Corsair and a
few others now brand new crystal series
of 570 x this case is badass its elegant
it's all glass it's just totally cool I
think you guys are really going to dig
it plus we show off a bunch of other
different parts now what it say it's
right off the bat I could give a
less if you could build a cheaper
computer there's nothing in this
computer at all that I've built at all
to save money that wasn't in it at all
all this bill is about is about showing
killer ass parts and how bitchin the
system is now there are a few things
about the 570 X I think you guys are
going to be like hmm but most of all
it's pretty badass and we've done
something totally different
we actually time-lapse the entire bill
with my man Anthony Reynolds peace out
brother thanks for doing that for us so
you guys get to check that out but
before we do that let's jump in and
let's take a close look at the 570 X and
see how elegant this badass case really
is the coolest thing about the crystal
series 570 X is obviously it's covered
in glass everything on the external of
the 570 X is glass and that's pretty
awesome now the only cavity that does if
you keep touching with your bare hands
you're obviously going to leave
fingerprints
cool things are 2-year warranty so if
you don't anything with the case you
screw it up for the first two years you
have it you are totally covered it comes
in weighing at ten point nine kilograms
form factors mid-tower the dimensions
are four hundred eighty millimeters by
two hundred thirty four millimeters by
512 millimeters as far as motherboard
support Mini ITX micro ATX and ATX up to
two hundred and seventy two millimeters
is that's the largest size board you can
use it inside of the five 70 X now for
you guys wondering hey man how big the
video card
and I stick inside the 570 X well up to
370 millimeters so you can use a pretty
damn big card the maximum CPU cooler
height is 170 millimeters what that
means is that's the distance from your
actual board to the glass as far as
power supplies go as long as within
their 225 millimeters you are good to go
as far as internal expansion slots there
are seven of them so that means you can
put seven different items inside your
system most of the time though you're
going to be using video cards that take
up two slots as far as how many SSDs are
hard drives you can stick inside of the
570 X well you can stick to 3.5 inch
drives or two 2.5 inch drives we'll get
to a little bit more about that later
when get into the build and you guys
will see how this is almost true the 570
X is made of two different things
steel for the frame and glass for the
outside as far as plugging things into
the front of the 570 X you get two USB
3.0 ports a single headphone port and a
single microphone port there are also
buttons to control the lighting and the
power button there's a lot of room
inside the 570 X for mounting your fans
in the front you can put up to 320
millimeters or 240 millimeter fans and
on the top you can fit two hundred and
twenty millimeter fans or two hundred
and forty millimeter fans and on the
back of the case you can stick a single
hundred twenty millimeter fan for
keeping all that air flowing through
your system the case itself actually
came with three RGB fans inside of it
but we changed all those out to some
even better fans which you'll see in a
minute this next feature to me is very
important because almost all the systems
we build we like to have liquid cooling
at least on something now as far as the
front goes you can install all the way
from a 120 all the way to a 360
millimeter rad that's pretty incredible
on the top you have room for a single
240 millimeter and on the rear a single
120 millimeter liquid cooler most of
those are the ones are the all-in-one
though so that's the five 70 X a lot of
features and looks pretty bitchin
but now let's jump in and let's check
out the Mirror's Edge build as far as
the rest of parts go for the Mirror's
Edge check it out man for the
motherboard we have an LG 1151 this is
the Asus z170 deluxe
has some other boards lots of features
and the color matches this bill just
perfect not only that like most you I
just like a zeus boards for the cpu we
wanted to keep the same cpu that we've
been using in all of our test systems
because not only is this build going to
look cool we're gonna actually start
doing all our testing in it because it
just looks more badass than the test
system so we stuck with the Intel Core
i7 6700 K 4.0 gigahertz of unlocked quad
core skylake goodness
obviously socket LGA 1151 to match the
board as far as the memory the mirrors
edge needs to have some badass memory so
we went with 32 hundred megahertz
Corsair Vengeance this is the 32
gigabyte kit which consists of four
eight gigabyte sticks
it's ddr4 it's got lots of led flashing
colors and just looks badass like I said
earlier folks I removed all of the fans
that came with the 570 X and we replace
them all with coursera ml 120 pro's
these things are badass their wife their
LED they're 120 millimeter and they are
bitchin
even though I searched and searched I
just could not find a damn coarser
liquid cooler to stick in the system so
I went with the Kraken X 62 from NZXT if
you guys know anything about this
product it's really nice it'll do the
job and it has a lot of cool lights that
match the build for the boot drive we
wanted something very very fast but
still with enough room on to not only
store your OS but to store all your
other programs as well so we went with
the Corsair Neutron XT iSeries 480
gigabyte SSD lots of speed and lots of
room we also went with a Seagate 2
terabyte fire CUDA now this is a hybrid
drive it's both a solid-state drive and
a regular SSD all combined in one for
much faster caching and much faster
access to all your programs and games
and powering up the Mirror's Edge is a
corsair rmi series RM 850 i this is an
850 watt fully modular power supply it's
80 plus gold certified with a 10-year
warranty so you know it's gonna last
okay now let's check out Anthony and
Reynolds aka Thrasher to put the mirrors
edge together in a bitchin time-lapse
video
so the first thing that Anthony does he
completely tears the 570 X down to its
frame this makes it much easier to plan
the bill figure out what you're going to
do for cable management and all that
other stuff and then start prepping
everything to stick it inside of the
case
there were a couple of things that we
did have a little bit trouble with
installing the kraken x 62 on the top
that took a little bit of slight
modification because it just wasn't
fitting perfectly and once again i kind
of regretted not actually having a
corsair one but that's just the way
goes sometimes
you
overall though putting a system inside
the 570 X was pretty cool we didn't run
it any serious problems and if we
actually just stuck to parts that we're
all probably made by Coursera as much as
possible everything would have fit like
a glove as it is it's put together it
looks nice I think it looks bitchin
definitely want to know what you folks
have to think
the big thing in my is that was really
kind of strange is installing a 3.5 inch
drive was kind of tricky we couldn't get
it to go in a standard way and as you
guys can see mounting it in the back we
actually had to put the electronics
facing outwards which I guess isn't the
end of the world but I mean I really
didn't want to look at the underside of
my hard drive I want to see the top so I
could identify and go hey look that's
the badass part in my build but once
again that just a small thing about the
case beyond that there are no sharp
edges whatsoever inside of the 570 X
it's very smooth all the way around
putting in the extra fans and stuff was
a very simple affair no problem
whatsoever now it took Anthony a total
of about four and a half hours to
completely build the system test it and
get it up and going but everything works
really great
now I didn't mention in the build
previously just because we're gonna be
changing out the video cards but you
guys can see that I used a Founders
edition GT X 1080 inside the build and
it looks pretty cool but we're going to
use this build like I said for not only
just a standard system to look cool I'm
sick of just having a test bed out there
that just looks ugly and just sits there
this is a badass-looking system there's
plenty of access in to take the glass
side panel off stick whatever video card
we want in there and with that 2
terabyte ultra-fast drive you know
everything on the system is going to be
really really fast and in fact we're
going to be bringing you another video
we show you exactly how fast the system
is with the different video cards we
test all right Tech fans so there you
guys have it the Mirror's Edge system
featuring the corsair crystal series 570
x case now obviously as far as beauty
goes the case is amazing cable man it's
a little bit difficult can't hiding
those cables and as far as installing
3.5 inch drives it with a little
modification it can be done but not my
most favorite thing in the world so as
far as beauty and elegance goes I say
that right beauty elegance think I said
it right as far as that goes
come on man this case is a ten as far as
economics go I'd say it's probably a six
because you can't hide in the cables and
cable management's a little tricky and
as far as like modifications sticking
other parts can go I'd probably give
that about a seven as well because we
did get into crackin X 62 but it wasn't
the easiest thing in the world like
usual all the parts that we used in this
bill will be down below like button
hopefully you guys will go Chuck Norris
style on it we put a lot of effort in
the video to bring it to you folks so
hopefully you guys will appreciate and
like that I'm our buddy the dog he
wanted to make his appearance mr. G
behind the camera we'll see you guys
background teka tomorrow for more tech
