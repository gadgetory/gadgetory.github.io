tomorrow we're I'm here once again with
Nick from Asus and we're going to show
you something that I think is really bad
ass what is this well this is the new
Asus Transformer a i/o now not only is
this thing an a i/o though it's a
portable tablet with 1920 by 1080
resolution and it's really cool I could
go on about all the features but I know
Nick here who doesn't want to sit here
and look funny so what we'll let him
talk about some of the great things that
are inside this thing so let's go talk
about it
sure all right so like you mentioned
it's a tablet and there's a base station
so you have a full core i5 PC or a core
i7 depending on the configuration that
you want and then on the tablet side
you've got a Tegra 3 Tegra 3 processor
inside and you're running 4.1.1 jelly
bean so you're running pretty much the
newest Android and the newest Windows 8
and what will make this the transformer
is that you'll be able to still access
the windows from the base station when
you disconnect the lap of the tablet
when you're on your home network
wirelessly right wirelessly so check it
out you can pull this off right and not
only when you pull it off you get to run
the Android inside of your home or
whoever can actually connect you can run
your full Windows 8 which the
touchscreen and everything else which I
think that really does make it the
transform part yeah when I saw the
earlier model with this CES I don't
think that that feature was actually
implemented in doing so such an early
model or they weren't showing that yet
so we're using that room to make that
remote connection we're using a program
called Splashtop and we specially tuned
it and worked with Splashtop and with
Nvidia since there's a 7:30 M inside of
the space station right on to go ahead
and tune that so you get a good a good
remote performance when you detach it
now it's also an IPS screen as well he's
got an IPS LED backlit screen 1080p like
you mentioned so it's really going to be
as good of the screen quality as you can
get and it be Hema thaty 9 point 4 inch
tablet exactly a giant-sized tablet now
also just like some of the other
products I understand that audio is very
important aspect so I understand the
bass has some special audio features in
it as well sure some of our products on
the ACS products you'll see them labeled
sonic master that means that we've done
extra audio engineering to give you one
of the top-of-the-line audio experiences
for that prod
so for all-in-ones all-in-ones may not
be known for the best integrated sound
we've put extra effort to go ahead and
make you give you that good rich sound
right on yeah all in wonder is that when
they first came out I don't think that
really Intel quite knew the market how
would grasp it but it seems as it's
changed there's been all kinds of
different in the blend ations with this
personally out of all the iOS I've seen
though this one's the coolest because no
other what I've seen transforms they're
usually the unit itself everything
built-in and you can't change anything
usually but the memory if you're even
lucky to do that right exactly so this
thing is really cool so let's go ahead
and let's pop the base up here we're
going to attach it
I'll have Nicky here fix this grace you
don't even have to so right now you guys
can see it's running the windows 8
through the wireless yep so as you
detached it it automatically made that
connection through the wireless network
to go back to Windows and give you
access to in Windows so right now we're
using the windows from the base station
but we're completely wireless
and its own stand okay you can see its
own stamp becomes something all the
controllers everything are right here on
this side on the back you've got your
own stand so it becomes basically a
portal monitor and as you can see here
on the left side on the right side when
you're facing it you got a little blue
button you can go ahead and click that
and you'll pop on over to Android and if
you want to go ahead and pop that click
that again you can go ahead and pop
right back over to Windows so oh no I
mean that's just really inquiry amazing
yeah and then on the PC the PC station
we don't we didn't skimp out either on
the PC station you can see on the side
we've got it full of USB key connections
media card readers audio ins and outs
and the back side has an HDMI out as
well so it's actually very well made
yeah it's not cheap at all it's very
sturdy as I'm sitting cooling and
pressing onto it it's very sturdy
they've got power and land in the
backpack here yeah you guys can see that
over here we've got the power and the
land back here in the back of the unit
so I think what's really going to make
this even stand out even more is that
say someone does want to take the tablet
out with them it does have HDMI out so
you connect them on
up to the HDMI out you still have a full
PC here and you have it's a tablet on
the go here Shearson you can dig up HDMI
to this as well
no just a station so you generation can
run this is a dual monitor with this
with this tablet or if you take this
tablet on the run this doesn't become
useless
you can still attach the monitor to it
and you still have your fold oh okay so
I understand what you're saying your
folks so impatient on getting this what
he's saying that is this can actually
double as your standalone PC so say
you've got a kid your kid wants to take
this thing on the road to school your
kid could take this use this Android
function at school and you could still
sit at home and use this as your PC to
surf the web do all that stuff right
actually that's really cool we'll just
go from spar through the well but hey
folks that's pretty much it this is the
new Asus Transformer AI oh and you can
see it transforms and has lots of cool
features if you guys want any more
