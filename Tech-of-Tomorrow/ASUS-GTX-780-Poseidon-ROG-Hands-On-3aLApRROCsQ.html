at CES 2014 once again with nick from
asus and now we're going to show you a
lot of new killer stuff that's coming
out from these guys that have to do with
video cards and stuff now some of the
stuff is actually honoring out in the
market but someone's going to be brand
new so let's let Nick tell us what's up
alright so we're here and we're going to
go on the rgm so on the inside of this
case here this carlton most case we have
our asus Poseidon graphics card so this
is based on gtx 780 this was in
development before the 780 Ti so you may
be seeing some updates in terms of on
the TI but basically the Poseidon as the
name indicates is going to be
water-based as well as air base so here
we can see we have the inlets and
outlets for water cooling as well as we
have the dual fan system that you're
familiar seeing on like a dc-dc two
solutions right so it's got a choice of
either one if you're a guy who just
wants to overclocking and stick with air
cooling because you don't want to go
crazy you're good to go but also if you
want to be someone who takes to extreme
you've got all those options in one card
exactly just give you a little bit extra
flexibility maybe you have been on water
maybe you added this card while you're
on water maybe you want to get off of
water so one thing the fans are
definitely going to want to know Nick or
what type of connections do we have here
for the water cooling this is this will
be your standard 38 38 I believe
anything inside of him yet no no nope
all right you guys can see right now
they're using a giant cooler master
cosmos case right here to install all
this stuff they've got a corsair ax1200i
power supply down there and here if
we're going to we're going to move the
case out in just a little bit and check
this out because this is really badass
rog dual bait gaming panel so this is a
4 inch led-lcd and as you can see you're
going to have a host of controls here so
as well as some audio outs and USB and
then we're going to see so you have cpu
frequency you'll have cpu and chassis
fan control as well as monitoring you'll
have temperature control for motherboard
pew monitoring as well so this little
knob here will give you access to all
the different options if you long press
you'll be able to go in and edit those
options so we'll see cut into edit mode
we can adjust the fans or pick which
game you want to adjust and there's as
well as a host of other options it's
really cool because it's totally digital
looks awesome looks like something
inside of a Ferrari car so this gives
you host controls it's got a little
escape feature on this button where if
you're in the middle of the game and
someone's walking and you don't want
your wife to know you've been playing
games all night you hit this escape
button it was just window out of your
game and get you on your desktop really
right on that's really that's really
really good I think that's gonna be
really cool for those kitties who want
to play games at home and don't want mom
and dad to know you're just gonna be
like wait I'm out of that game now like
we said before folks there are a few
products that are already out but maybe
not all of you know about it one of
those is the asus Mars card kind of like
a mars bar man not quite as taste me but
I dip it in chocolate it'll be tastier
but just tell us just a little bit about
this Mars car this is pretty tricky
looking so this is our dual 760 mars so
you have 2 760 GPUs from Nvidia auto SOI
just slapped onto one PCB to go there
you go so 4 gigs of ram total on the
card and we actually an article on this
for you folks a little while back we
don't actually have a car in hamp but
now you guys can see the card so I'll
just bring it up to the cameras you guys
get a real nice clothes look of this
card show you guys the back of the card
you guys all love the solid backing in
the car we discussed this many times
awesome technology unlike previous Mars
releases or areas releases this is not a
limited-edition piece yeah not not just
to limit in a thousand pieces that
anybody can buy it yeah so if you're
around the world you want to buy it you
can get it you got right here get your
SLI if you want to slap to these bad
boys together you can do that your Mars
logo power connections see it takes two
8-pin power connectors for ball z power
you guys can see the cooling solution
all that stuff and the duel fans so
usually to fans means DC YouTube the two
standing for two fans also we got a
little thing over the monitor the
rampage 4 Black Edition motherboard
that's the motherboard that was actually
in that system that we saw a few minutes
ago
and it's a very high end of motherboard
for asus so that wraps it up for this
technology we've got some other stuff to
show you guys as well as monitors and
some other cool stuff as far as systems
and actually a fast router so there's
all kinds of asus technology so with
that said me and knicker outta here and
we'll be with you soon from the video
right there we go alright
and be with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
