are doing this ice bucket challenge but
how many people actually know what it's
about do you really know what it's about
ALS is basically Lou Gehrig's disease
was a tax year spinal column in your
brain and basically just deteriorates to
the point where you can no longer
control your body or do any functions
whatsoever so when you're doing this
challenge you're doing it to bring
awareness of ALS which is Lou Gehrig's
disease now I'm going to do something
different than most people I'm just

he did this now obviously to achieve
this it's not the same as you know your
daily just overclocking this guy to use
dry ice you had to disable some cores
had to disable hyper-threading and at
the end of the day obviously for anybody
at home use this is a complete waste of
time but still it's good to see that how
far you can push this equipment and how
well it'll do now they achieved all this

you guys are going to like this one
drum roll please Oh a and D lowering its
prices on September first let's talk
about it
the move is designed to make the FX
series more competitive against Intel's
Core i3 and until Core i5 products based
on the hassle refresh and the devil's
canyon designs the price of the AMD FX
95 90 which currently retails for 225
pounds will be dropped to 175 pounds and
the price of the AMD FX 6300 with its
six cores will reduce to around 70
pounds now the price we quit are in
pounds we're not going to translate that
directly into American money due to the
fact that these things could fluctuate
and change but regardless for AMD fans
prices dropping is always an awesome
thing
