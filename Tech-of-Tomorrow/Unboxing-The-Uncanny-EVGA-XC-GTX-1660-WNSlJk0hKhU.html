it they've released a seriously
entry-level card in the form of the GTX
1616 that this is the EVGA fir just
cards pretty cool it's the XZ version
and one thing you guys have noticed
those we unbox this card take a look at
it this mother is just thick it's fat
it's like a big old giant sandwich
you're gonna take a big bite out of so
what is with that said though let's
check out this car that's gonna be
coming to market at about two hundred
and twenty nine dollars has great scores
for the price and overall I think you're
gonna be pretty satisfied with this car
with that said though let's check this
bad boy out
just watching this box I'm Batman or no
it's in the box so let's get to unboxing
the dang box let's go
so here we have it the books looks like
most boxes right yeah most parts are
kind of the same um we'll spin it up
look at that Oh a box facing straight up
even neater let's spin it around here is
the back of the box where they've got
some all nice little fun facts about
this thing and yeah all that good stuff
that we're talking about that's right I
spin around to the side yeah yeah yeah
I'll find all fun foot what's inside of
this box alright let's see oh it's oh
I'll pop the cap right here stop the
little Batman voice although I like the
Batman voice by Dave is a good voice I
think it fits me alright so what all is
in the box nothing else inside of here
you guys can see up there in camera land
rest of the box is completely empty it's
an empty box once I take this stuff out
so now the Cameron was remarking that
this thing was like very very well
wrapped so I'm just like I'm very well
wrapped okay
so let's see we've got the card right
here in front of us and we've got this
little bugger right here now this card
features the tu1 one sixth ring
gpu-based up to 12 and nanometer process
now this card features four thousand and
six to two cores it has six gigabytes of
gddr5 memory and what the heck things
let wrap like a burrito in here it's the
ultra wrap one wrap right there we'll
move that rat then we got another
right here 190 bit memory interface
memory bandwidth 191 gigabytes a second
destroying this bags out of here you
guys are gonna notice this thing is very
very thick furry slot design now the
base clock is at fifteen hundred and
thirty megahertz it has a boost clock of
1785 megahertz there's 88 texture units
22 streaming multi processors and 40
rock units okay so as far as that goes
you guys can see this card is a very
very thick bad boy this is definitely
not a 2 slot design and in some ways I
feel like this may end up being a caveat
to this card because this card is really
small and for really small systems
you're gonna be like ok cool I want to
use this car but hopefully I hope it's
not unfortunately too wide that it just
doesn't fit in a lot of systems that's
the only thing that I'm really worried
about I mean beyond that this card is
really small as we see on the front
we've got a single fan design on this
side single 8 pen power requirement like
I said 120 watts what it's recommended
that she's a foreigner what power supply
which means you can pretty much build
really low-end systems all the cooling
stuff is there obviously on a card that
this low of a price you're probably not
going to get a giant backplate so we're
not seeing any backplate on this
particular card whatsoever but no kind
of to be expected
also these cards don't do SLI or
anything like that and you guys can see
that the rear i/o is really a very basic
IO just three different connections
that's it whoa I don't know what you
guys think but honestly for 229 bucks
this card has some absolutely cool
features now this is just the unboxing
and first look but we will have
information down below so if you guys
want to check out some more stuff or buy
them we'll have that down there but stay
tuned to the channel because now we have
the full-blown review where you'll get
to see all the scores and all that stuff
as we give it a head-to-head battle with
the rx 590 which is actually right now
about $20 more than this card and I
think you'll be very surprised at the
results so stay tuned to tech her
tomorrow we're here for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
