know him but to me Robin Williams was
just pretty much a childhood hero Mork
and Mindy so many movies so many
comedies I just found out that this guy
has committed suicide and that's just
like really honestly like one of the
saddest things I've ever heard i grew up
totally liking this guy seeing
everything he's done and I mean honestly
this is a kid he was just so funny with
his nanu nano and everything and just I
don't know I'm just totally balling even
really have the words to say it I've
thought about it myself a bunch of times
and like if you're out there thinking
about it make sure you get help if you
know somebody's like that make sure they
get help because like Robin was someone
I like totally respected and liked to
see that he does that like makes me feel
even like shake here on my own personal
ground because I've got my own demons as
do we all so like rest in peace Robin
man you're going to be missed down here
I loved you as a kid I'm sure there's
many other people that feel that way I
just want to say this has nothing to do
with the video it's not the description
or nothing else this is the personal
thing it's just really sad to know that
Robin Williams has died so rest in peace
brother
unfortunately though for us the show
must go on and i'm sure that robin being
the community was would want to stall
like have a good laugh and be happy so
we'll try to continue on with the video
in that type of light now for gamers out
there right now it's actually never been
a better time 4k monitors are just
booming they're everywhere and prices
are dropping down below seven under
dollars now 4k gaming you can see
everything so detailed it's actually
more real than real can you get more
real than real I think you can that's
they're shooting for it anyways right
now over on Amazon they have lots of
these on sale Samsung Phillips a zhuzh
all these awesome 4k monitors for gamers
under 700 bucks so if you're a gamer and
you're looking to upgrade that monitors
and jump into 4k ahead of the pack this
is a good time for you make sure you
guys check out the links down below like
button all the information will be down
there like usual so if you're looking
for 4k now's a good time now the first
story today is for you AMD fans out
there you guys are going to have
something to celebrate it seems like the
r9 285 is coming soon now this little
demon is rumored to be equipped with a
tunga GPU from AMD's volcanic island
line now something really interesting
about this card is there's no crossfire
connections on the card at all instead
the r9 285 utilizes XDM a crossfire over
PCIe just like the other volcanic
islands graphics cards now the naming
suggests that this car is going to fit
somewhere between the two ATX and the
290 but if we go according to the specs
it looks like it could fall somewhere
between a 280 x and a 280 coming at it
about two hundred dollars which is a
great price point it looks like we'll be
seeing a GPU core clock of 918 megahertz
with an unspecified boost clock member
will start at two gigabytes of gddr5 on
a 256 bus clock at 1375 megahertz which
will provide 1.76 gigabytes of bandwidth
less than the r9 to AT&amp;amp;T ATX now as far
as power requirements go this card
should feature dual 6 pin power
connections and should be under 250
watts total TDP next up is for you
google fans out there that's right we've
got rumors of a new
Nexus 9 comin rumor central suggests the
tablet will come with an 8.9 inch
display packing a resolution of 1920 x
1200 or quite possibly 2560 by 1600 it
will also pack in videos 64-bit variant
of their Tegra k1 SOC with two
custom-made denver cpu cores as well as
their mobile kepler GPU alongside 4
gigabytes of ram for those who want more
information this will all be linked down
below in the description but so far what
it seems like is this is very much like
Nvidia shield only with a pure Google
Experience next up Samsung fans which I
happen to be one of I will admit the
note for some pictures have shown up and
are these the real deal or what here's
what the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 may look
like hmm while looking very similar to
the front of the galaxy note 3 the back
and sides look different the phone
appears to retain the plastic back with
leather like textures but the size looks
similar to the ones on the yet
unannounced Samsung Galaxy alpha and
surprisingly it looks like Samsung's
adding a little metal into the mix now
the last story involves ease of use now
maybe this isn't a groundbreaking story
but it's still cool nonetheless for
those of out there who like ease of use
now Google has made it much easier now
to unsubscribe from emails now instead
of being hid down below we had to look
around for it they've made this thing
totally non-obtrusive and it's right out
there where you guys can see it now so
if you go in your emails and you get to
see when you're like why hey you can
easily unsubscribe with a click of a
button so that pretty much wraps it up
for all these stories folks like usual
down there below the button will be all
of the information in the description in
there so thank you guys very much for
watching tech of tomorrow once again if
you were Robin Williams fan I'm sure you
guys will spend a day in mourning for me
I just hope that everybody out there is
doing really well and like I said in the
beginning if you're ever suffering from
depression which I will honestly admit
to you I suffer from it a lot after
getting my foot cut off and stuff I've
gone through all kinds of stuff I've
gone through drug abuse and trying to
get off the pain pills they put me on so
it's very hard to maintain a good life
so if you have one make sure what the
people you love to have them support you
I'm elric thanks for watching tech
tomorrow you
no I love all you fans and we'll see you
guys back here for more tech goodness
very soon peace out my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
