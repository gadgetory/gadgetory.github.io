welcome back once again to tech of
tomorrow now if you guys been following
the channel we've been doing a lot of
different builds on all kinds of
different platforms our latest build is
based on the AMD FX 95 90 CPU you guys
all know it at the market like 800 to
900 dollars and it was the
top-of-the-line CPU that AMD is ever
released and it goes to 5 gigahertz in
its overclocked state now with that said
we started building a system we brought
you guys part 1 of the bill we showed
you guys all the parts and now today
we're gonna bring you part 2 which we're
actually prepping the system
so what empathise gone ahead and done in
this video it's these put most of the
parts inside of the system including the
radiator all the stuff for the water
cooling and it's all inside the system
because we're gonna have to actually go
and pre-cut all of the components for
the water cooling system before we can
actually install it so today's video is
just pretty much showing you guys an
update of how the system is progressing
here you can see where we've mounted the
reservoir the SSD and a few of the other
key components to the build now at
Anthony's going to do now after this is
take this back to his house and pre
assemble all the water cooling stuff and
tested he's still got to put the cooler
on the card still put the cooler on the
CPU get all that pre mounted and then
we'll actually take it remove it from
the system and make sure there's no
leaks and no problems with the system
whatsoever before he puts it back in and
does the final build so there you have
