freaks elric here once again the Tekken
tomorrow youtube channel bringing you
guys more tech awesomesauce that's right
what are we looking at today well today
we're going to be looking at the play
360 now this is a wireless speaker that
features 360 sound from the people at
nokia so without any more further ado
let's actually jump in and see just what
the hell out works talking about
alright folks so like any good unboxing
or whatever we're going to first show
you obviously welp the box so here's the
front of the box not too much to really
see there then we'll show you on the
side of the box of the cameron zoom in
there and it tells you actually what
comes in the box and even though we're
going to see it we might as well see it
first here so you get the nokia play 360
speaker a battery pre-installed micro
USB charger 3.5 millimeter audio jack
the carry pouch and a quick guide you
guys can see right here cap for
Bluetooth connection through NFC now
this will work with the latest nokia or
google nexus 4 phones you just instantly
hook up to those if you're using
bluetooth like i said you'll have to be
hitting a button for that features 360
sound which means you can hear it all
the way around the thing so here's the
back of the box not too much there it
just shows you that comes in three
colors the blue the white and the
charcoal gray or graphite or where
they're actually calling that color will
flip it around the side that's the last
thing for that so i'll go ahead and just
remove the box top here now once again
we got a box inside a box box ception
yeah exciting stuff anything exciting on
the blue box no just pretty much the
same thing as on the other box so i'm
not going to waste no more of your time
with that we will just go ahead and
begin to unbox is bad take it out like
this I think
alright we got that out of there so it
looks like I'm actually got to break out
one of my trusty knives so I'll go ahead
and just make a quick little cut down
here which boom we're going to see the
insides flip it around i think in
showing us the instruction there with so
here we go switch on pair reconnect
swapped basic stuff there go to just
move this out of the box cabrini nothing
else there get rid of that all right so
here we go here it is and all its fine
and we going to remove this plastic off
its you folks can see it it's very
lightweight I got to say that it's kind
of cool-looking this is like a you know
a blue color that you see like an
anodized aluminum so it's pretty cool
now here up on top you have your volume
control you have your minus and your
plus to make it louder or quieter here's
your Bluetooth connectivity you just hit
this button right here and it pairs it
up with your phone or whatever Bluetooth
device you happen to be using here on
the side it's got a little kind of like
a sub woofer type holder to let the bass
sounds out that's got to be what that is
so here in the back we have the power
button micro USB and then the 3.5
millimeter input cable for your audio so
I'll go ahead and set that down let's
continue the unboxing at the rest of the
stuff out these are going to be all the
things for your connectivity you just go
ahead and pull all those out of there
okay so what all do we got here we've
got the Nokia play 360 wireless speaker
md 50 watt next up one of the paper
regret that it's just limited warranty
paperwork so let's get the other way you
guys can read that on your own here we
have the charger micro USB to your
standard wall jack here is 3 3.5
millimeter audio cable one into your
audio device 1 and into the speakers and
then last but not least we have a really
cool carrying case in here
we'll go ahead and get that out and
check that out so it's made of like a
neoprene waterproof type stuff up at it
all or you could put it on top of baby's
head yeah it actually does look like
they've you guys ever seen little babies
and one's a little caps it looks like
the little baby cap so obviously that's
supposed to just go over the speaker and
then you can carry that bad boy around
however you want to do it so with that
said let's jump in now and let's give
you a demo and see how this thing hooks
up and what it sounds like all right
folks like usual we're doing audio we
have our zoom h1 connected now we're
going to both play your music directly
from the phone first and then music from
the speaker so you guys can compare now
I know it's not perfectly accurate but
it will give you a general idea of the
difference between just listening to on
your phone or listening through this
$149 speaker
my
he
No
alright folks so there you have it now
we were able to get this thing for
ninety nine dollars on sale and at that
price point I gotta say it's pretty fair
now there are all kinds of these types
of products out there there's the beats
by dre pill there's a jam box there's
all kinds of different ones out there
but this one surely sets itself apart
from the rest by a few different things
first of all the NFC technology no other
one out there has this right now and the
fact that it's completely 360 and sound
now inside the room where me and
Jonathan doing the testing once we set
this down the table anywhere that you
walked in the room you can actually hear
this thing pretty clearly now sounds
coming out from every angle it's coming
out from the top from the sides the base
is coming out from the bottom and it
really does have a very clean sound for
something this small I know lots of
times people want to listen to stuff on
their headphones but for that moment
when nobody else around you just want to
have some easy listening set down the
316 and away you go peace out we'll see
you guys back here on TECA tomorrow I
hope you guys liked the video if so hit
that like button and always subscribe so
you don't miss out on any of our contest
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
