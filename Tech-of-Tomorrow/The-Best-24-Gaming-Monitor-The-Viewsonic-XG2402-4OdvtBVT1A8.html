kicked the butt like when she asked you
a little too short to be a stormtrooper
and I mean I know these guys aren't even
around where are they
you have biatch he's down the more
Stormtrooper for me he's a dead man
I've killed me a stormtrooper in the
name of Luke haha
so what's up everybody welcome to TECA
tomorrow today let's check out the view
sonic XG 24:02
what's up Tech first welcome back once
again to tech of tomorrow today's video
is sponsored by viewsonic and as you
guys saw in the beginning of the video I
was gaming on the brand-new viewsonic XG
2 402 now this is a very very nice
monitor even has 2 2 watt speakers built
into it and the speaker's sound really
good so you don't really need any
external speakers or anything especially
if you're in like a confined area and
being a 24 inch monitor if you don't
have room for 27-inch this monitor will
fit in there just perfectly and it has a
lot of great features
right here in my head
that cable gracefully
from things in me that I never business
the price right now you can get it for
two hundred and nineteen dollars it's an
absolute great price for all the
features inside of this monitor now
first off on the front you guys can see
it it's a 24-inch panel now this is a TN
panel but the feature this TN panel are
really nice 1 millisecond response time
144 Hertz on the refresh rate this
monitor features a resolution of 1920 by
1080 P and it also features an aspect
ratio of 16 to 9 the brightness level on
this particular monitor is 350 C D and
it's a hundred and 20 million to one
dynamic contrast ratio the lag time the
two 402 is also very very low at 8.2
milliseconds which is virtually nothing
the on-screen display controls are
located very conveniently on the right
hand side of the monitor you can easily
access these buttons and there's also 22
levels of black stabilization via the
OSD there are also various gaming modes
as well as the option to make custom
modes to whatever you want the monitor
be and one of the absolute best features
of the viewsonic 2 402 is that it
features free sync technology so gamers
can have absolutely smooth gameplay with
no frame tearing at all using AMD
technology on the back of the 2 402 you
guys can see there's a really cool X
that lights up in red and this can be
turned on and off at your discretion now
as far as the connections go there are
two HDMI ports a display port two USB
3.0 connections a USB type B port this
is actually what connects up to your
computer a 3.5 millimeter jack for your
headphones and obviously the power
connection where the power cord goes in
now inside of the box you get the
monitor itself you get the power cord
and you get the USB type B cable to
connect up to your computer and also
included in the boss is a DisplayPort
cable one thing I think that anybody
will agree upon is that the stand of
this monitor is pretty nice for one
thing it offers a lot of different
options for your height for your tilt it
also can do portrait mode and all that
stuff pretty much any way you want the
screen to be you can make it that way
and also at the very top there's a
really cool hook for work and your
headphones on so if you're gaming you
just want to take your headphones off
you can
easily set it on over there and also at
the very bottom of the monitor there's a
place for cable management so you can
get all those messy cables out of the
way and just make your desktop area look
really nice and clean
beyond specs and all that I'm sure the
biggest question though in everybody's
mind is how well does this monitor look
when playing games what looks absolutely
brilliant being a TN panel means it's
gonna have the absolute fastest response
times the absolute fastest refresh rates
it's gonna be great for playing all your
games especially with the freesync
technology movies look good the screen
looks really really nice on these
particular type of screens they're not
really made for like editing videos and
stuff like that because of the color but
for gaming movies they're totally geared
for that and that tends why a lot of
monitors call themselves a gaming
monitor and why this monitor is well is
a gaming monitor the two 402 is geared
for a gaming experience
alright Tech verse so there you have it
the viewsonic 2 402 a 24 inch monitor
with a lot of nice features
first off freesync technology is really
awesome if you own an AMD card it'll
hook right up and you'll get absolutely
perfect gameplay with no screen tearing
whatsoever
also one millisecond response time
really fast input lag of 8.2
milliseconds absolutely nothing 144
Hertz refresh rate come on this monitor
is geared to give the gamer the best
experience that they want and at 24
inches it'll fit in a lot of smaller
spaces where bigger monitors just won't
do and the speakers on board as you guys
heard they sound really nice so you
don't really even need to go out and buy
any other speakers unless you just want
to have it even louder but most people I
think will be very satisfied all around
with the 2 402 i'm Elric you've been
watching teka tomorrow like usual we'll
have a link down below where you can
check out more information or buy one of
these for yourself because right now
they're going for 220 bucks that's a
deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
