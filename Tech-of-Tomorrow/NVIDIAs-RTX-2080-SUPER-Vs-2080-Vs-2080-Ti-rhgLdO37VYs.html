it's time for another launch this time
the Nvidia founders Edition RTX 2080
super pretty much the second most
powerful card on the planet and for the
price it's definitely I think probably
going to be the most fast card there is
in the market so with that said let's
jump in let's talk a little bit about
the card then let's check out the
performance and at the end of the day
see if you'd want to buy this card and
put it inside of your gaming PC so being
a founders addition card means it's
gonna come and pretty much the same
looking box that we're gonna see for all
these series of cards not a lot usually
comes in the box it's usually just the
card maybe an adapter for your lucky and
some kind of little user's guide all the
drivers and all that stuff are usually
all online they're usually beta at
launch time and that official launch day
all the normal drivers out so with that
said though let's go ahead and let's
take the card out there's obviously the
card itself whoa nice card right nice
back plate we'll get there
set that baby down nothing really else
in here except for this little thing
right here there's always this little
box and this time in the box like I said
once again there is an adapter it's a
little DVI adapter here so if you want
to use this bad boy just plug it on into
your display port and wallah away you go
so and that's pretty much it like I said
they give you a couple little books and
for those of you are wondering what
exactly the spec differences are between
this card and the regular r-tx 2080 we
have those right here on screen for you
you can see there's not really that much
difference it's just some increased r-tx
ops and some increased cuda cores and a
little bit more clock speed that's
really about it and another difference
is that the r-tx 2080 super does require
more power so first off take a look at
the card you can see there's two nice
spinning fans on the top
and we see r-tx 2080 super right on the
front of the card I kind of really liked
the color of these cards being that
they're silver and black they kind of
remind me of old school like stereos and
stuff like in the 70s and 80s
everything was silver before it all got
to being blackened I think this is kind
of cool and for you arts yex guys it's
really shiny take a look at the top of
the card you guys can see there's a lot
of heat fins going all the way across
the card and I've talked about this
before I really like the design of these
cards because the entire card is closed
up which means that the design of the
card takes all of the heat into its
cooling components and it dissipates
them out from those fans and it keeps
the card running really cool now you're
gonna see there's two power connections
a single eight pin and a single six pin
connection it's required that you have
at least a 650 watt power supply to
power this card also on the top left
hand side you guys can see when you
remove these little tabs right here that
is where you have envy link so if you
want to use two cards in SLI
configuration you can do so although I
really think that this type of
configuration is completely dead and
I'll have another video on that later
now everybody knows that I love a good
backplate that's just my thing because
that way you never cut your hands up or
anything it just makes it look nice and
this card has a nice solid backplate all
the way across the card really smooth
nice design even the back of the card
very simplistic now taking a look at the
cards connectivity you guys can see
there are three display ports a single
HDMI port and a single type-c port and
this type C port it's gonna really start
being used quite a bit as we see VR
moving into the future now like I said
before there are a few differences
between this card and the 2018 and the
2080 had a base clock speed of 1500 and
15 megahertz and a boost clock speaking
of 1700 and 10 megahertz however on the
super card we see the base clock
increase to sixteen hundred and fifty
megahertz and we see the boost speed at
eighteen hundred and fifteen megahertz
so that's the card and the specs on the
card
pretty good specs on paper now let's see
how it
in performance now Before we jump into
the scores let's take a look at our test
system we've got a really nice test
system setup now has an ASIS rock
Maximus X here a Wi-Fi motherboard Intel
Core i7 8700 K for the CPU totally
liquid-cooled
32 gigabytes of Kingston HyperX fury
ddr4 memory we have a 2 terabyte Seagate
Barracuda hard drive this will we store
most of our games on we have an EVGA
supernova 850 watt g3 power supply we're
using the latest Windows updates at the
time of testing and the latest Nvidia
beta drivers at the time of this review
now with that said let's rock out to the
benchmark song and check out those
scores
you guys can see as far as performance
goes the supercar definitely beats the
standard 2080
across the board and it's about 10 to 20
frames per second different than the 20
atti the big difference you're going to
see though even though it's not really a
large one is in the temps the 2080 I
running the hottest at 80 Celsius so
this card is run really hot when it's
under full load and the super runs at 78
right below that and at 75 degrees
Celsius we see the r-tx 2080 and if for
some reason you're completely a newbie
to RTX here you guys can see a really
nice patch done on quake 2 that shows
the differences between r-tx on and r-tx
off and you guys can see it brings a lot
more than just shiny colors it brings a
lot of depth actually makes the game
look even better all the way around and
take into consideration this is just a
patch on an old game imagine the
potential on new games that are built
from the ground up with r-tx technology
so here's my complete take on you know
the brand-new r-tx 2080 super first off
honestly i think that the price on this
at $6.99 should have been honestly my
opinion that this is what the 20 80 TI
should have been at launch it should
have been this price if this car was a
little bit lower they'd be even better
but here are the facts the way they are
this cards $6.99 10 to 20 frame rates
difference between this and the RT X 20
80 TI you're gonna pay then with three
or four more dollars more for that card
anything however that's on the market
from AMD at the current time frame which
would be the Radeon seven other testing
that card because everybody knows that
card is slower than these cards it's
slower than the other reviews that have
been out before so there's no reason to
riashyn that card is seven hundred and
forty nine dollars so that cards $50
more it's a slower card and that's
pretty much exactly what NVIDIA is
trying to do they're basically just
checkmating AMD wherever AMD comes up
they're just going to checkmate them
Nabi comes out that hey boom they come
out the competitive thing then AMD
lowers their prices then these guys
lower their price and this is really
good for us as consumers as consumers we
want to see these guys fight it out go
back and forth as much as possible in
the mud throwing dirt throwing punches
kicking in the ball stabbing in the back
we want to see that stuff pretty much
because at the end of the day that means
that when the cards that come to the
market we're going to be able to afford
them now this card is a very fast card
like I said beyond the twenty atti
it's the fastest card on the market
single card this period there's no other
car that's out there by AMD or Intel or
anybody else at this moment in time so
for the price level what it is I have to
say I think it's the nursery is perfect
so you might get mad at then go oh my
god it's $6.99 it's
so overpriced but I know prices on video
cards these days are very expensive and
if you can't afford this card they do
have other cards that have come out that
are lower priced that are still really
fast at 1080 now if you're definitely
wanting to do 4k and you're doing VR and
you definitely want to be able to take
advantage of r-tx because as you saw in
the video RTX when it's done right it
looks really good and NVIDIA is
continuing to have more game developers
get in to RTX when they see what it can
do they're like oh my god it's the the
game things that look kind of like this
or it can look like ah and honestly when
it first came out a lot of people said
oh man it's just shiny bla bla bla bla
bla but you guys can see in the video
where we showed the comparisons where
it's not just shiny anymore it's
actually a lot more in depth you can see
things better objects really change the
way they look they just burst out RTX is
coming of age and it's looking really
cool and this card is fast enough to do
all that art tech stuff without a
product i mean exactly without a product
it'll do all the r-tx stuff without
having to spend the higher cost on the
20 80 TI so that's why I give this card
an editor's choice now like usual we'll
have links down below to any bunch of
different cards of these for you to look
at we'll have more information so if you
guys want to bop around the internet
look up more reviews check out more
stuff we'll have that stuff there we'll
also have links to our music so if you
guys like the music we'll have links
down there where you guys can purchase
some of that stuff and if you just like
the general feel the channel and what's
up then hey hit that sub button and turn
the bell on that way you'll be notified
I'm Miller you guys been watching techo
tomorrow this has been the brand-new
review of the RT x 2080 super from the
folks over at nvidia doing it founder
