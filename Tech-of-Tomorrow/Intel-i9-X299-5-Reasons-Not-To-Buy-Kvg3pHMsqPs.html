Corsair glaive RGB Gaming Mouse okay so
it really seems like there's
overwhelming evidence support that Intel
has seriously stepped on their dick with
their latest I nine and X $2.99 platform
release and I'm going to tell you guys
the top 5 reasons why you should hold
off on buying anything from Intel at
least for six months as things balanced
out now the number one reason why you
should avoid this new platform is the
pricing and I'll tell you why
now traditionally almost all of us in
years have gotten used to pointed if you
want until you're going to have to pay a
little bit more but now we see until
releasing a top-of-the-line CPU at
$2,000 which just trust me and there are
people out there in other countries that
$2,000 is like $10,000 $15,000
comparatively how will these people ever
even get these CPUs on their desk it's
like a dream CPU and even two people in
America unless you're really a rich
person doling out $2000 for a desktop
CPU is just kind of crazy I mean let's
just face it if you're a gamer why would
you invest two thousand dollars in a CPU
there's just no sense of it and if
you're a person who does designing and
you do that sign of stuff why would you
even need to have a desktop CPU you'd be
one to move over to the xeon territory
or something else from AMD it's
comparable but why would you use a
desktop cpu if you're using a machine to
do rendering movies anything like you do
with pixar with you with doing 3d art
and all that stuff you need a really
totally badass cpu but that's not really
a desktop cpu and this is where things
just get really weird it seems like it
that intel is trying to put a half
desktop half workstation
you know half you know supercomputer all
into one chip and i just don't think it
really fits so right off the bat the
pricing is just crazy and let's just
face it
AMD especially with red river coming out
has a much much competitive price
strategy and intel knowing that AMD is
doing this we all know obviously this
entire thing was rushed which we'll get
into as we go down the list of things is
just crazy they should have come to
market being at least way more
competitive
AMD even if they made their mistakes
they step in their dick and fell down I
think that end-users all of us would
appreciate a lower price point because
let's just face it Intel you guys have
made a mistake with this it's blatantly
obvious what's going on you guys are
just trying to have something out there
right now but as far as price is going
it's just not happening for me and I
think AMD right now it's going to have a
very good chance of just sneaking right
under the Intel radar you know and
taking over now reason number two
anybody out there right now that has an
X 99 platform motherboard and CPU
upgrading and going to this new platform
especially like we're tamo most of us
are gamers is just senseless there's
really no reason to do it because as you
sacrifice the PCI lines and stuff going
down the list it just makes no sense to
sacrifice this if you already have a
platform that does 40 PCI lanes and
you're totally happy so as far as an
upgrade path whatsoever it just makes no
sense whatsoever in fact as the price
will drop on x99 chipset sand their CPUs
it would totally be smart for user just
coming into the market to probably jump
into that because what we're seeing
right now is the X 299 only offers a
small margin of upgrade pack and let's
just face it if you own something
already that's good and you want up for
you want upgrade to something that's
totally going to kick ass on that not
just maybe get you know three or four to
maybe five frames per second for
investing in a whole new thing that's
just totally totally insane reason
number three to hold back anything I 9
and X to 99 is that the lower end CPUs
that are coming up for mental only offer
16 PCI lanes the 76 for TX and the 77 40
X only have 16 PCI lanes that's just
crazy why would you even want to jump
into this whole new platform that's
supposed to offer you all these PCI
lanes for crazy SLI and just multiple
cards and everything with a CPU that
only does 16 PCI lines you'd be better
off with sticking with you know the
lower end chipsets why would you need to
go you know X to 99 to do that there's
just absolutely no reason and I want to
hear your guys's comments what you think
as well because you guys are all part of
part what's going on here but me
personally I just feel that having those
two CPUs with that low of compatibility
and performance is just kind of crazy
it's like you know offering somebody to
have a Volkswagen engine and a Maserati
hey I got a cool Maserati but you'd like
to have a Volkswagen Internet we do have
a package for that sir if you'd like it
I don't know to me that's crazy so
reason number three and I feel really
strongly about this is they're lower in
CPUs are really nothing to really talk
about they're just they're obviously
going to be lower price but my question
is is why before we get two reasons
number four and five we all know we need
a killer Mouse for our gaming
environment let's check out course
there's Glade today's sponsor if you're
a gamer who spends a hell of a lot of
time in from their computer gaming you
want a mouse that not only is killer for
gaming but is also totally comfort and
that's where the globe comes in it's
also got a lot of cool features like six
programmable buttons 16 K adjustable dpi
and it's made for absolute comfort
because you can change the thumb grips
that's right I said it the glaive
features interchangeable thumb grips
that's right you can choose between
three styles of snap-on thumb grips for
the total tailored fit for your comfort
style the glaive also features on-board
profile storage for lighting effects
macros and dpi settings so no matter
where you go you'll be up and ready to
go with the glaive RGB
okay now reason number four is this
currently even though Intel announced
all of these new CPUs over at Computex
you've seen all of the sites review them
and do things about them as much as they
can right now but check this out
availability at this moment is pretty
much completely utterly nil no review
samples have been sent out to any of us
reviewers that's true no review samples
have come out and only two of the lower
in CPUs though - I just talked about and
reason number three are even going to be
available which means that all those
other CPUs right now are pretty much the
complete paper launch and that's total
 if they don't have all the CPUs
rating everything ready to go why I
announced them and everything I mean
everybody knows that AMD is gunning I've
talked about this in other videos AMD is
gunning for the crown everywhere they
want to dominate if they had
their way just like any company they
dominate the entire market and Intel
seems to me like they're almost playing
catch-up so the availability CPUs right
now is really nothing the lower end CPUs
we talked about 270 640 X and the 77 40
X are the only CPUs that are currently
being offered you know that shows a
release David's you can buy the rest are
still up in the air so what's going on
with that Intel like it means you're
going to come out you're going to
announce all these badass VP yous
why aren't they all mark get ready
that's one thing and then obviously
let's talk about reason number five now
reason number five I have to give a
shout out to Paul at Paul's Haro because
this video is actually what inspired me
to for reason number five completely
I'll have a link down there to hit
videos you guys can check it out peace
out you guys don't know it me Paul and
Kyle we all used to work together at
Newegg in fact me and a guy named
Kerrigan Hobbit were the guys who
actually invented Newegg TV and
introduced it to the people at new wake
to do the show so just a little text
facts but reason number five if you
check out Paul's video he was able to
borrow a CPU and a motherboard from
gigabyte and from what he's saying it's
completely unstable like things
just don't work proper so that means
reason number five maybe the absolute
strongest reason of all that we've all
talked about videos you ought to chill
back and wait till new drivers will
check it out with the X 299 platform
these i9 CPUs it seems like this stuff's
not even ready for primetime whatsoever
so what's intel's going to do they're
going to release this stuff out in the
public
just for a dick wagging contest you know
what I mean when the stuff doesn't even
really work whatsoever so I would
totally totally hang out and wait before
anybody really invest any money in the X
299 chipset or the i9 CPUs unless you
can get a hold of them like Paul did
borrow them check them out and see the
instability for yourself now for me I
think that these five reasons all give
strong evidence to be switching over to
AMD right now I don't think I'm going to
be really investing any money in the
x-29 platform whatsoever obviously I'm
going to be asking for motherboards and
trying to get the CPUs I'm going to try
to hustle my way with Intel to get some
because I want to have this stuff
in-house and build do my own testing I
totally trust Paul he's a great guy but
personally here at Tekken tomorrow I
want to get this stuff in and see
kind of errors and stuff I encounter and
hopefully Intel will fix this stuff so
that they can be competitive in the
market but at this moment those are the
five reasons you should really really
stay away from men-tel's i9 @x 299
platform until things seriously change
i'm Elric you've been watching Tekken
tomorrow once again a special shout out
to Paul Paul's hardware man thanks for
the inspirational video peace out I'll
see you guys back here on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
