6:00 a.m. here at Tech Oh tomorrow I
know at first your host and guess what
that's right you've waited for it and
for those fans out there who like Nvidia
the new gtx 660 is now launching its
launch day and i'm going to do the
unboxing of the new PNY gtx 660 that's
right this is one of their performance
series cards let's jump in now and let's
do the unboxing and see what comes in
this nice little box for the people at 2
p.m. why let's go
all right folks so I got the card right
here you can see it's got a plastic
repre now I could not find a small knife
so we're have to use this extra large
one here so we'll take that right here
get that the cameras you guys can see
that go ahead and strip that baby down
here's the front of the box spin this
bad boy around to the back of the box
very easily removed right here at the
cameraman Oh hit him on the head and you
can hear it fall on the floor fun stuff
fun stuff all right so here's the box
very sturdy box as you guys can see it
should be simple enough to open up here
just bad boy goes let's see here there
are a couple of tabs here on the end so
just kind of get the tap right pop the
cap falls off there I'll just let that
sit on the floor for a second now cards
gonna be pretty trippy when it comes out
of the box so you get this up here
because last time all the stuffs on the
bottom so I make sure I don't make the
same mistake twice so voila here we have
what comes inside here it's going to be
the drivers CD and this looks pretty
early cuz check it out it's like you
know in a CD you get the CD swapmeet I'm
just kidding just poking some fun with
the guys at be and why don't get mad J
go up to the side so in here let me set
the car down get out of the camera range
I'll open this little baggie up right
here open it up
inside of the baggie we see molex to
6-pin DVI to VGA and finally the user's
manual and it actually has a bunch of
stuff in here to install low profile
stuff so I guess they have the options
for bracket four loko flops let me step
it off the side now that's good to the
heart of the matter
this is the card you can see it's got
its own little plastic shelf here get
this little thing out of here it'll be a
little tab here out without dropping the
card on the floor whew tricky stuff to
balance in camera range right folks
that's right got to be professional so
we'll get this stuff out of the way show
you guys the back of the card first you
can see the blue PCB I know Savi brought
their gonna go I hate the blue baby baby
man doesn't matter don't do things based
on color man put the card around shitty
you guys the front I can tell you some
basic stuff to get you by to memory
that's right
192 bit memory interface but if you guys
want to actually see the full review of
this card after this unboxing I did a
full review of Ron TECA tomorrow so when
you guys are done checking out this you
guys can check out the full review over
on TECA tomorrow so here's a rear angle
the card flip it around show you guys
through Ohio you can see it's different
color coordinate in this card you're
supposed to be able to support four
monitors off this card we'll have to see
if it actually does that two DVI hdmi
displayport
and see it's got a single fan the blower
design this card should run pretty cool
last time my RAM the reference card
actually did not run that much different
than the over cool cards now the over
cool cards overclocked better but that
was really about it so this one's
entirely based on the reference design
single six pin connectors you guys can
see up here and that's pretty much it
folks that's everything that comes in
the box like I said before if you guys
want to read more about the whole review
see out played in games everything's
please check out the link in the
description below and go read my full
review over on WWE Cube tomorrow
love you see you guys later today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
