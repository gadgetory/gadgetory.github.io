tomorrow so let's jump right into it
today we're gonna bring you guys a
system build which is pretty much just a
lot of parts that we have gotten in for
review from different companies and
we've put all these parts together and
we're bringing this bill to the table
now I want to clarify this is a
suggested build we weren't going for the
absolute cheapest in price or anything
else we're taking the parts that we have
from all the different companies we're
putting together there and making a
system with them now this particular
system is a mid-level system it's coming
to market about $700 and to really I
think still well balanced system for the
price for $700 there's actually quite a
bit of gas under the hood now starting
off we have a case by the company in gam
Deus I'm not sure exactly how it's
pronounced to think it's game to yes if
I'm saying it wrong hey excuse me like
I'm willing to be corrected at any time
whatsoever now these guys provided their
talos t1 case and they also provided a
power supply as well now the case is
very very nice has a lot of RGB features
you guys can see it's actually a really
nice looking case there's a lot of room
in the interior for storing all of your
stuff there's plenty of room for
aftermarket coolers and everything like
that cable management it can be done but
I have to admit it is a little bit
tricky to get all the cable wires in the
back of this particular case there's
only really I think about 3/4 of an inch
in maximum as the depth that you have
back there so anthing always does a
great job doing that but I remember when
he was building this one he was kind of
like making a few marks one error or
trying to get the cable management in
there so it can be done but it does need
to have a little bit of work now this is
an AMD based system as well so the
motherboard that we're using is this
motherboard from as rock the B 450 steel
series AMD board now this board has a
lot of features actually for its price
range and if you're into RGB this board
has lots of RGB features so human
delights hearing all that eye candy and
all that stuff the case has lights on it
the fans you guys can see in the front
they all light up and they can be used
in conjunction with this board all the
software is there plenty of room this
particular board I think is a really
solid product especially for the price I
think
a lot of people out there probably have
this board and if you have and you're
using it well let us know what you think
about it particularly I think it's a
really nice board now
okay now the CPU that we used it's a
really nice CPU it's the 2400 G APU from
AMD it's got their onboard graphics if
you guys want to see how this particular
product scores just on the graphics side
of things I'll have a link down below we
did a previous system building this
really tiny system that was no bigger
than my hand I think the performance in
this particular system will be just a
little bit better because the other
parts in that system were like so damn
that really you know not really
SuperDuper fast harddrive anything no no
I guess actually used an SSD so that
wasn't a problem I know that it had like
so dim memory and it wasn't the fastest
stuff and being that's really small you
know you're going to sacrifice somewhere
but overall this is a really good CPU
and we did use the included cooler with
this just to keep prices going and it
kept the CPU cool throughout all of our
testing I think it only got as hot as 83
Celsius at maximum that's you know when
we're just absolutely barreling the
system down and doing a lot of stuff on
it so video card Radeon 570 from the
people over at F oh I'm getting a tongue
twister today my thing to come a little
special thanks to Eric at XFX sport
kicking us down with this particular
card for this build this is a very nice
card it's very kind of a mid-level card
it's very well priced these things keep
going down in price so even those
particular system right now is we're
bringing it to you about $700 you can
probably find some parts and probably
even bring this system cost to a little
bit less if you just do a lot more
shopping now one thing in this
particular build is this this inulin
product it's a 120 gigabyte SSD we
thought why not these things are like
really dirt cheap so why not actually
put an SSD in the build you can actually
omit this SSD all the way out if you
don't want to use it and you can
strictly use the Seagate 2 terabyte
drive we did you can partition your
drive put windows on one and put your
games and stuff on another and you'll
still be absolutely fine but I just like
an SSD if possible because it just makes
things really fast so
boom this is the power supply now this
particular power supply is 100 bucks but
it's made of all complete Japanese
capacitors it's got a 10-year warranty
really solid power supply and you guys
always say you know and it's a known
fact one thing you don't want to go do
is go build this really nice system and
then scrimp and get a crappy power
supply so having a really good power
supply means you could even upgrade a
650 watch you could upgrade the video
card you could change the motherboard
and still keep your case in the power
supply and be really good to go um the
only other thing I don't have right now
out in the package is the Kingston
memory we used an 8 gigabyte kit you can
you upgrade to 16 32 whatever you want I
think even the 32 gigabyte kit of this
particular memory is only like 184 bucks
but keeping costs down we wanted to keep
the you know the memory you know down at
you know a pretty decent price and this
left I think was like Oh like I think
it's under 50 bucks even so all in all
pretty good stuff now you guys can see
the system looks really nice I mean look
it's beautiful in the front now the only
thing that I have to say that I'm really
not a fan of and I know that you guys
are most likely gonna agree is this
glaring cam deist thing on the top of
the case I wish that could be changed
out or turned off or may not there
because it it's almost like a blaring
banner like 7-eleven you know it's right
there in your face and that's kind of
crazy but it still looks pretty cool
the finish is kind of a mirror finish so
the case looks really nice than the
inside of it you can see like I said
there's plenty of room for your
components to put inside of there you
can hide the cables and all that stuff
especially from this side you can do it
very very well
there's enough space inside of it for
you put enough hard drives or SSDs
whether using you know 2.5 or 3.5 drives
you're gonna have enough room inside the
case on the backside like I said you
guys can see the cable management is all
really done nicely but it is kind of a
semi tight fit back there but everything
was able to get done and look really
nice so at the end the system does look
really nice we have the fans turned up
to full blast right now for the video
just so you guys can hear them but you
can also turn these fans down and have a
system run silently if you want you
don't have to have them Spang just
depending on what you're doing you might
want to keep them on full-blast if your
hardcore game
and keep them turned down if you're just
writing a letter to mom you know it just
depends on what you're doing alright so
those are all the components for this
system and I think like I said it's a
really nice well-balanced system
especially for being right under $700 I
know there's gonna be some opinions that
very out there and you can always use
these bills a suggestive starting point
or change things around to suit yourself
now as of the time of this video review
we're using the latest Windows 10 with
all of the updates we're using the
latest drivers that are available at the
time of this release but we only ran the
test in 1080 and 1440 because of the
system that's you know under $700 I
really didn't think anybody's gonna be
trying to push for a 4k system at that
point so with that said though let's
rock out to the benchmark song and let's
check out those scores
now like I said previously you guys can
see the CPU only gets as hot as 83
Celsius and the GPU only got us hot as
89 Celsius and this is under full load
which means we're playing all the games
for a long time before we actually take
these measurements all right so there
you have it Tech fans a nice little
system for under seven hundred bucks I
think that it's a really good system for
the price range I definitely want to
hear what you guys have to say now one
thing you guys definitely have to take
into consideration when you're watching
our videos though is that we already
have a set platform for how we test
games and the way that we test them is
with everything with all the bells and
whistles to their absolute maximum which
means that you know yes some of these
games did get under 60 frames per second
on 1080 and definitely less on 1440 but
you can adjust the settings in the game
so that the games play absolutely a lot
better I mean if you're just going
around and taking pictures and just
viewing the game it's cool if you're not
getting a whole bunch of frames per
second but you're just viewing the game
and checking stuff out most of the
programmers pro pro gamers out there man
I'm trouble saying this today they
turned the games almost their lowest
absolute settings so they can bounce
around just kill people so the average
gamer you know unless you have a super
duper duper high end video card to play
everything with all the bells and
whistles chances are that you're gonna
be running this the settings either at
medium or on high and with that you're
gonna get absolutely a lot better
performance I'm sure there's a lot of
videos out there on the market that you
know that say here here's a 570 and
here's what it was with low settings
medium settings and stuff like that so
you can take the scores that you saw in
this particular video and you can just
go oh hey guy don't run my games at that
you know I run my games more at this and
you know what's going on so you'll be
good to go like usual we will have a
list of all of these parts down below so
you can pick and choose if you like the
system the way it looks you can recreate
the system the way that it is or you can
change the parts app to suit your
absolute perfect desired system I
Amalric you guys been watching techni
tomorrow if you guys aren't subbed we'd
love to see you guys back in the channel
um you can turn notifications on I don't
know if you're really doing anything
anymore because a lot of my viewers say
that they're not getting the
notifications even though they have
them turned on but hey it's there
anyways and we'd love to have you sub
here just to have you as part of the
family we have a patreon site and a
website and we always have a link to all
of our music so if you want to check out
our songs or any of that kind of stuff
there are lots of ways to support the
channel we'll see you guys back on here
for more reviews and more tech here on
tech and tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
