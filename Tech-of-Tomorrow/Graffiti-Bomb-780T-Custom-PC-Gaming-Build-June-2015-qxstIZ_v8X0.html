custom systems and with that said we
bring you another system in our series
of hydro dipped systems what is hydro
dipping well hydrogen thing is basically
taking your case
tango includes completely crazy method
of dipping the case and putting film on
the outside it's kind of a really
interesting thing if you guys want to
check out the videos we've done before
we'll have the links for those right
here so you guys can check out those
videos before we even check out that one
but with that said we've got another in
the series of hydro dip cases this one's
based off the corsair 780 t and it is
the graffiti bomb that's right then
why'd you keep your Feeny bomb cuz this
shit's tough Bob that's why so check it
out right now you guys can't see
internally because well obviously
because we've got the window on but from
the outside you get to see this thing
looks really cool and the dip is really
unique those people out there you like
the color yellow and for those people
who like cartoons you're gonna really be
into the theme of this why well because
it's based on graffiti and that type of
stuff kind of like you know urban is
super Feeny ish and just totally bottle
all the way around you guys can see it
looks just really really cool and for
those people out there who are like
looking to do something totally
different
hydro dipping is a really cool
up-and-coming thing we were lucky enough
to get ours done if you guys want to get
one done we'll also have that link down
below where you guys can check out
somebody who can do it for you as well
now on the inside of the case we have an
Asus z87 deluxe motherboard and sitting
inside that zip sock is an Intel i7
4770k CPU always a good one now for
going we just stuck with Corsair once
again in fact mostly everything in here
other than the motherboard the CPU is
brought to you by Corsair we use the H
100 i GTX hydro series cork in it hydro
series
your dip system that's right you know
what don't like this for the power
supply you guys just saw the unboxing
this the other day this is the RM 850 I
if you guys haven't missed the unboxing
you have that link right here for you as
well for memory we use the Dominator
platinum now this thing is really cool
32 gigabytes of incredible memory even
paying with a fan but we didn't put the
fan and we just thought with him or
picked that out of the bill as far as
the hard drive goes no moving parts here
baby we went with the neutron XT for an
80 gigabyte SSD from the people over at
Corsair as far as video card we use a
reference series GTX 980 for the people
over in video thank you very much in
video and we appreciate that so you guys
can see that anthem arrows are tech in
house has done a really nice job just
making a system out of this that's not
over the top but is still nice and
custom everything's laid out nicely all
the cables can be hit very well very
easily on the case a lot of different
things could be done with this case this
is just the direction that we chose to
go with for those of you out there who
actually do like this type of bilbo and
like to build one for yourself we'll
have all the parts and everything listed
down below that like button hopefully
you guys will go nuclear on the like
button because you like this build and
you like the series of videos if not hey
we'll see you in town but beyond that
thanks for watching I know you guys been
watching tech up tomorrow like usual
hope to see you guys in your sub box so
if you're not sub you know what to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
