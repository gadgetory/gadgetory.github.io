custom systems and with that said we
bring you another system in our series

dipping well hydrogen thing is basically
taking your case and going through is
completely crazy method of dipping the
case and putting film on the outside
it's kind of a really interesting thing

we've done before we'll have the links
for those right here so you guys can
check out those videos before we even
check out that one but with that said

dip cases this one's based off the
Corsair 780 tea and it is the graffiti
Bob that's right Ben why'd you keep your
feet e-bomb cuz this shit's the bomb
that's why so check it out right now you
guys can't see internally because well
obviously because we've got the window
on but from the outside you guys to see
this thing looks really cool and the dip
is really unique those people out there
like the color yellow and for those
people who like cartoons you're gonna
really be into the theme of this why
well because it's based on graffiti and
that type of stuff kind of like you know
urban is ruffini ish and just totally
bomb all the way around you guys can see
it looks just really really cool and for
those people out there who are like
looking to do something totally
different hydro dipping is a really cool
up-and-coming thing we were lucky enough
to get ours done if you guys want to get
one done we'll also have that link down
below where you guys can check out
somebody who can do it for you as well
now on the inside of the case we have an
asus z87 deluxe motherboard and sitting
inside that zip suck is an intel i7
4770k cpu always a good one now
cuckooing we just stuck with corsair
once again in fact mostly everything in
here other than the motherboard and cpu
is brought to you by corsair we use the
h100i GTX hydro series cork in it hydro
series
hide your dip system that's right you
know don't like this for the power
supply you guys just saw the unboxing
this the other day this is the RM 850 I
if you guys haven't missed the unboxing
you have that link right here for you as
well for memory we use the dominator
platinum now this thing is really cool
32 gigabytes of incredible memory even
came with a fan but we didn't put the
fan and we just stopped with him or pick
that out of the building as far as the
harddrive goes no moving parts here baby
we went with the neutron xt for an 80
gigabyte SSD from the people over at
Corsair as far as video card we use a
reference series GTX 980 the people over
in video thank you very much Nvidia and
we appreciate that so you guys can see
that anthem arrows are tech in house has
done a really nice job just making the
system out of this that's not over the
top but is still nice and custom
everything is laid out nicely all the
cables can be hit very well very easily
on the case a lot of different things
could be done with this case this is
just the direction that we chose to go
with for those of you out there who
actually do like this type of bilbo and
like the build one for yourself will
have all the parts and everything listed
