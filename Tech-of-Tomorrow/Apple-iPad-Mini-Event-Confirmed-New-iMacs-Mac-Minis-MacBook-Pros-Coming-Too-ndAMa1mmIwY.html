tech tomorrow I'm elric and I've got
some exciting news for people out there
who are fans of the Apple and Mac
product line that's right on october
23rd apple is holding a media event
where they're going to announce all
kinds of new products including the
rumored ipad mini they were also
supposed to have refreshes on many of
their other products as well including
the mac mini the imac and many other
rumoured products so let's jump in and
let's check out what the rumors have to
say the alleged 7.85 ipad mini is
rumored to start out at a $249 price
point for the Wi-Fi only model it will
come in black and white options and also
feature LTE data capable models the
13-inch retina mac pro if announced
would feature a slight processor bump
and more importantly a 2560 by 1600
resolution smashed into a 13-inch
form-factor laptop the mac mini don't
expect any redesigns to the mac mini but
addition to the faster Ivy Bridge
processors it would make sense to see
nvidia graphic options in higher end
models it's been over a year since we
last saw the imac lineup updated so
would make much sense to see Ivy Bridge
updates both the 21 and 27 inch models
the switch to NVIDIA GPUs and possibly a
slimmer thinner design so hey folks
that's a lot of exciting news let me
know in your comments about what you
think below I'm actually looking forward
to the new iMac in my recording studio I
have a mac pro but the cameramen he has
one of those new mac pro's a small one
and it's actually giving faster numbers
than my mac pro so his little laptops
beating my big old mac pro so i'm
thinking about jumping into one of these
new iMacs it put in the studio so let me
know what you guys think and we'll see
you guys back here on tech of tomorrow
