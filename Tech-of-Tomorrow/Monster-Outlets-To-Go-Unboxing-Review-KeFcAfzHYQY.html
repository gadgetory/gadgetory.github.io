welcome back once again to our YouTube
channel for those you want to go I've
got a really nifty little object this is
the new monster power outlet to go three
now what this is is this is a thing that
has three power outlets and two USB
plugs all in a single small unit now why
would this come in handy why would you
want to use it well a lot of times when
you go and you have your laptop or your
computer when you're traveling on the
road you get to those hotels and those
are you traveling I'm talking about and
there's only one damn plug so you get in
there near all frustrated trying to do
this well this not only gives you three
additional outlets to plug your stuff in
it also gives you two additional USB and
now these are powered USB ports some
devices you may know that you might plug
into your laptop other units sometimes
actually you have trouble using the
power of the onboard USB this will
actually eliminate that problem so for
twenty nine dollars you can hop right on
to this little bad boy take it on the go
with you and eliminate a lot of the
problems so normally i do like an
unboxing and then a video and a review
all that stuff this is the product
that's just kind of a nifty little
gadget so we're just going to do it all
in one so there really only is this so
here's what you did open it up you open
it up you pop this little thing out I'll
bring it back up camera man don't you
sweat it none so I took this out of the
box it's very small me to bring it even
closer to the camera man so we can lock
on into it I'm going to spin it around
now so you guys can all see a very
slowly here's the plug you've got one
two three try pong grounded power
outlets which is what you need if you're
operating with PC equipment you want any
that old-school stuff that's not
grounded because it can short stuff out
then you've got two powered USB ports
right here in the front so once again
this just a little take over this is
from our friends at monster power I'll
drag the box back up here again this is
the outlet to go three product I'll put
it back in and if you in a box again
hook up the plastic window big deal and
that's this product right here monster
power outlet to go three four you're
traveling person hey this is a really
great product like I said it comes in
nine bucks for those of you travel or on
the road you know how much of a pain in
the butt those single little outlet
things can be in hotel rooms this is a
big thing the powered USB is also very
good because as you know some powered
USB devices overload the on board of
your computer so 29 bucks on the go it's
a great product thank you monster we
appreciate your effort
everybody I'll refer is here on tech of
tomorrow down under addition well today

of you who are on the road a lot you
know the traveling business type or the
traveling porn star who needs to move
