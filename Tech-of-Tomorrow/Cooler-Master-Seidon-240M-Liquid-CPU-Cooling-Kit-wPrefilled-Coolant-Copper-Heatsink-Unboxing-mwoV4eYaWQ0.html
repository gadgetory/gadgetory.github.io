every day back in the beginning of
cooling pcs people were really afraid of
water clean because you know
traditionally water and electricity
never really did mix but with the way
engineering is today with modern stuff
going on water cooling is becoming more
prevalent daily and it actually works
quite well we've unboxing taking a look
at quite a few over here at echo
tomorrow and today we're going to take a
look at another one today we're going to
look at the side on 240 m from the
people over at cooler master and this
thing's supposed to be coming into
market at about a hundred bucks supposed
to be very competitive with the other
products that are out there on the
market I haven't actually seen it yet
but with that said let's actually jump
in and see what this New Sidon is all
about alright folks so like usual let's
take a look at the front of the box
coolermaster you can see got the dual
120 there's in the back side on 240 m
liquid cpu cooler maintenance-free siz
that down here overclocking design for
it two times the surface space Pete
stuff will flip the box around here's
one side not much to that at all flip it
around the back where it basically shows
you what's going on here shows you their
pump and stuff shows you their rad now
I'm going to flip it on the last side
here and get the camera to zoom and this
actually does tell you all the specs so
if you're looking into all the specs
check out these all right here sorry
come up here and working our way down
you can see them all
so all right that's all the specs so now
let's actually go for the unboxing take
the trusty knife there you have to use
special effects it's got its own I'll
make a nice insertion here on top right
here go ahead and peel this plastic off
of the dang thing get my hands in here
and peel it off like get it Christmas
morning get all that off of there so
let's see the start up here on top I
guess All Right see your words again
over here where do we go where do we go
I've never seen the particular box
before so unboxing is an adventure for
me as well as we discover how to open it
up alright so there we go so pops open
right here and now it's with the camera
to zoom in and let's take a look at
everything inside here real quick okay
let's go ahead and remove stuff out of a
piece of time here are the two 120
millimeter fans and see there's two of
those all bearing the cooler master
named get those out of the way mounting
accessories now this thing will mount on
any type of socket that's out there
whether it's intel or AMD if it's been
made in the last 10 years pretty much
this thing is going to be mounted on it
comes with everything inside of here for
both AMD 1155 1366 am-3 a.m. to whatever
your fancy you even got your stuff right
there thermal paste all of the mounting
nuts these are going to go probably to
lock the thing down so we'll go ahead
and get this out of the way here's the
actual instruction guides oops we're
falling down here so next up here's the
warranty paperwork yeah don't you see
that you guys know that it's there move
on here go all the instructions like
there's a lot of these like too much for
me to get out but basically there's
instructions all the way or
found on how to mount the site on all
kinds of good information now let's move
along we've got some more mounting stuff
right here mounting screws these are all
going to be on the top additional
hardware right here basically just a lot
of different hardware there's even more
down here these are all for the
different type of things for mounting
the ZIF socket on so let me get those
out of the way now we come to the unit
itself so kaboom alright pull this bad
boy out here's they're really small
radiator here it's very thin though so
it's going to fit in many many cases
because if its thinness case you can see
that power connector now let's loop it
around here let's take a look at the
block and the pump they're all contained
in one so let me get this up to the
camera means you can see this folks so
let me move this out of the way get the
best shot for this probably right
there's a good shot you guys can see the
flexible excuse me the flexible cabling
and then here's it's going to mount and
get this off of here real quick
there you guys can see lots of surface
area total copper looks like it's
already been on a machine a lapping
machine to lap this down and make it
flat let's go ahead and put that back on
going back to the radio one of the thing
right here you guys can see if there is
a fill port right here so if you need to
fill this back up it's going to be right
there think um cell filled tho from the
factory so that's pretty much it that's
everything that comes in the side on box
so there you have it tech fans
everything that comes in the box of the
new cooler master seidon 240m total aio
now this thing you can't take apart and
add anything onto it is how it is this
thing's actually going to start showing
its age as all kinds of new products
come out that you can actually take
apart and still use but they're still
all on once they're kind of all ones
that you can upgrade that's the future
but for now this thing's ninety-seven
bucks that's a pretty competitive price
range we'll have to take it down the lab
test it and see how it does against the
other products that are in this same
price range so with that said folks i
hope you guys like this video i'll see
you guys back here on techo tomorrow
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
