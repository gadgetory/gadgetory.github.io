mainstream every day back in the
beginning of cooling pcs people were
really afraid of water cooling because
you know traditionally water and
electricity never really did mix but
with the way engineering is today with
modern stuff going on water cooling is
becoming more prevalent daily and it
actually works quite well we've unboxing
taking a look at quite a few over here
at Echo tomorrow and today we're going
to take a look at another one today
we're gonna look at the side on 240m
from the people over at coolermaster and
this thing's supposed to be coming into
market at about a hundred bucks it's
supposed to be very competitive with the
other products that are out there on the
market I haven't actually seen it yet
but with that said let's actually jump
in and see what this new sidon is all
about alright folks so like usual let's
take a look at the front of the box
Coolermaster you can see got the dual
120 there's in the back side on 240 M
liquid CPU cooler maintenance-free siz
that down here overclocking designed for
it two times the surface space neat
stuff will flip the box around here's
one side not much to that at all flip it
around the back where it basically shows
you what's going on here shows you there
pump and stuff shows you there rad now
I'm gonna flip it on the last side here
and get the camera to zoom in this
actually does tell you all the specs so
if you're looking into all the specs
check out these all right here starting
them up here and working our way down
you can see them all
so alright that's all the specs so now
let's actually go for the unboxing take
the trusty knife there you have to use
special effects it's got its own I'll
make a nice insertion here on top right
here go ahead and peel this plastic off
of the dang thing get my hands in here
and peel it off like get it Christmas
morning so let's see the start up here
on top I guess let's see your words
again over here where do we go where do
we go I've never seen the particular box
before so unboxing is an adventure for
me as well as we discover how to open it
up alright so here we go pops open right
here and now it's with the camera to
zoom in and let's take a look at
everything inside here real quick ok
let's go ahead and remove stuff out of a
piece of time here are the 2 140
millimeter fans and see there's two of
those all bearing the Coolermaster name
get those out of the way mounting
accessories now this thing will mount on
any type of socket that's out there
whether it's Intel or AMD if it's been
made in the last 10 years pretty much
this thing is going to be mounted on
comes with everything inside of here
for both AMD 1155 1366 a.m. 3 a.m. -
whatever your fancy you even got your
stuff right there thermal paste all of
the mounting nuts these are gonna go
probably to lock the thing down so we'll
go ahead and get this out of the way
here's the actual instruction guides
whoops are falling down here so next up
here's the warranty paperwork yeah I
don't you see that you guys know that
it's there move on here go all the
instructions like there's a lot of these
like too much for me to get out but
basically there's instructions all the
around on how to mount the site on all
kinds of good information now let's move
along you got some more mounting stuff
right here knotting screws these are all
gonna be on the top additional hardware
right here basically just a lot of
different hardware there's even more
down here these are all for the
different type of things for mounting
the ZIF socket on so make it those out
of the way now we come to the unit
itself so kaboom alright pull this bad
boy out
here's their really small radiator here
it's very thin though so it's going to
fit in many many cases because if it's
thin this case you can see that power
connector now it's loop it around here
let's take a look at the block and the
pump they're all contained in one so let
me get this up to the cameraman so you
can see this folks so let me move this
out of the way get the best shot for
this probably right there's a good shot
you guys can see the flexible cable
excuse me the flexible cabling and then
here's it's gonna mount and get this off
of here real quick
there you guys can see lots of surface
area total copper looks like it's
already been on a machine a lapping
machine to lap this down and make it
flattened let's go ahead and put that
back on going back to the radio one of
the thing right here you guys can see if
there is a full port right here so if
you need to fill this back up it's going
to be right there thing comes self ildo
from the factory so that's pretty much
it that's everything that comes in the
Sidon box so there you have it Tech fans
everything that comes in the box of the
new cooler master side on 240 M total
AIO now this thing you can't take apart
and add anything on to it it is how it
is this thing's actually gonna start
showing its age as all kinds of new
products come out that you can actually
take apart and still use but they're
still all on ones they're kind of all
ones that you can upgrade that's the
future but for now this thing's 97 bucks
it's a pretty competitive price range
we'll have to take it down to the lab
test it and see how it does against the
other products that are in this same
price range so with that said folks I
hope you guys like this video I'll see
you guys back here in TECO tomorrow
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
