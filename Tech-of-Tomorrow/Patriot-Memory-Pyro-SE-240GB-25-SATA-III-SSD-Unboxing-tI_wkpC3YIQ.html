lr fair is back here on the tech of
tomorrow youtube channel bringing you
the tech of tomorrow but today now check
it out today i got something pretty cool
from the people over at patriot this is
their patriot pyro SC 240 gigabyte SSD
drive now this thing's got some pretty
cool features it uses the latest
sandforce controller it's supposed to
have read and write speeds up to 500 500
it's 2.5 inch form factor say 23 use mlc
technology that's multi-level cell
there's single level cell and
multi-level cell technology and nand the
slc stuff is usually geared for
enterprise stuff is very costly all the
ones you guys usually see in the market
or mlc so that said I've got my nice
trusty furniture knife
can we be using this to do x unboxing so
I'm gonna take the old trusty knife
right at the top this little piece of
plastic here I'm going to go ahead just
cut that to a little rippie rip e so I
was just really bust one quick knife cut
and then it's gonna go ahead and peel
the plastic off its gonna go throw the
knife the cameramen gone now just
kidding that would hurt him and who
would film the damn videos right yes I'm
talking about so here's the outside the
package to you guys and see the box how
much to it Patriot is their own little
color scheme going on here it's very
similar to the same codes that they use
an ocz their drives look kind of the
same flip it around let you guys see the
backside so we'll stop the unboxing
there's a little tab right here and go
ahead and pop that little tab there with
my hands there we go remove that slide
the drive out that see it's all in
plastic housing there's only one of the
things there that is this Patriot pyro
SSD se23 little thingy here so that's
pretty much it there's this in this I
will go ahead and just set those gently
up the side today I'm gonna throw them
we'll throw them at the camera neither I
mean giving you guys as you know letters
you guys think i abused the cameramen so
many fools are crazy you're sending me
to feel bigger stuff at the cameramen
y'all are some haters now man if I throw
too much Adam I mean he'll ask for
freaking workman's comp or some I
can't afford to pay that man come on all
right so check it out got the little box
here all there really is to this box is
this so my table tab pop the top go
ahead and pull the drive out you guys
can see right here here is your SATA and
your power connector right there the
drive is very small 2.5 inch form factor
like we said before Ali's this way in
fact most of all the latest cases I've
been seeing and reviewing they're all
coming with a place to put your SSD
Drive so that's pretty cool get a good
glimpse the front there see you guys can
see the back of the drive right here and
that's pretty much it I mean all SSD
drives are made to be very very strong
durable I've seen some of you guys out
there make some comments you're saying
that the mean time between failure is
much worse on these than a hard drive
that's totally impossible hard drives
have moving parts there's no parts on
the edge you can bounce these things
around smack them around they last much
much longer this drive also has trim
support that helps maintain the
longevity of the drive so if you want
something fast you want something
reliable you definitely want SSD today
was the unboxing of the new Patriot pyro
SE 240 gigabyte SSD using the latest
sandforce controller see you guys back
