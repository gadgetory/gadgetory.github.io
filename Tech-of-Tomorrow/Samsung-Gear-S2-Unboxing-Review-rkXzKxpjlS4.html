another edition of Tech in tomorrow I'm
Mallory Kerr hosting today we're gonna
check out something really cool from the
people over at Samsung this is their new
gear s2 SmartWatch now you might think
SmartWatch huh what's a SmartWatch plays
it really do for me and always you have
your phone and like I pretty much
thought the same thing when I first got
the gear s2 and had it my hand is like
oh it's kind of cool but we've seen this
before and like what's really the big
deal but actually the gear s2 has some
really cool features that make it
actually very appealing and we'll get
some of those in a second so first off
let's jump in let's talk about the
design the build of the gear s2 and then
let's go on let's do some stuff with it
and see what it's all about
so with that said though let's check out
the gear s2 from Samsung as you guys can
see from this picture the watch itself
is actually made up of a bunch of layers
of material starting off with the
silicon base and added protection layer
another layer of plastic and then
finally the top bezel all on top and
this is all smashed in to make the gear
s2 the display features a 1.2 inch fully
circular Super AMOLED screen with a 360
by 360 resolution and 320 pixels per
inch the network it features Bluetooth
and 3G it features the Exynos 30 to 50
chipset internally there's 512 megabytes
of RAM and there's also 4 gigabytes of
storage to store all your music and
stuff on it also features a 250 ml amp
battery and 4 sensors that it has quite
a few it has the ACC the gyro the HRM
the barometer the ambient light and the
GPS which is only for the 3G models and
another cool thing that we'll get to in
a few minutes is this thing's actually a
surprisingly waterproof up to three
meters now there's just a whole lot of
cool things about this watch that are
really incredible you can set it up for
all kinds of health benefits you can set
up to monitor your heart rate you can
set it up to actually monitor how many
steps you take
and also if you're one of those caffeine
junkies that'll actually monitor your
water and
caffeine intake pollen being able to
monitor all the things about your health
is actually very important to me and at
first when I got it like I said I didn't
think you'd be that value because I have
all the same information on my phone now
it's like okay well I want to drag
another watch around and my phone around
but I discovered some things about this
that were actually really cool so first
of all what type of the things I think
is really great you can store up to a
hundred and songs up to a hundred songs
straight on to the gear s2 which means
if you go to the park and stuff like
that and you actually forget your phone
and don't take it with you you can still
walk around the park do all of your
heart monitoring all of your monitoring
for your body and all that stuff and
still listen to your music through your
wireless headphones and hooking a member
is actually really easy as well as you
guys can see right here all you do is
basically paired them up set it up and
then you're off and going and you can
listen your music around the park I use
it a lot when walking buddy the dog some
other cool things about this are is that
you can actually walk up and set up a
samsung pay so if you go up to some
place and you want to pay for your stuff
and you don't want to use to phi2 your
google wallet or whatever you can use
what they have now their Samsung pay so
you can walk up to a Starbucks or all
that stuff and do counter to counter
purchases right off your SmartWatch
that's a pretty cool thing I mean
smartwatches should be very smart and
one of the easiest things about
operating this is how you control it the
band around the edge you simply just
adjust it from right to left you can add
a calendar you can add monitoring type
stuff just so many different things um
you get notifications on it like I just
got a notification in fact my sister
called me why we were sitting here doing
this and I wasn't really even expecting
that and I looked up to Jesus I was like
hey someone's calling me and it was my
sister calling me on it so needless to
say I'm actually pretty impressed and
something I haven't really talked about
and I want to apologize guys I have a
temperature of 104 because I thought it
really infected her Nia I really
shouldn't be bringing a video but I got
to get something up so we're still going
with this stuff but check it out say
that you get bored you know you're
looking at your watch and you're like
you know what hey you know I'm kind of
bored with the way that this looks I
want a different face one thing totally
cool about the gear s2 is that you can
change the face to whatever you want it
to there's a whole bunch of different
selections check this out
you somebody just scroll through choose
the face that you like
engage it and you're good to go and as
far as operation goes things I really
could never say could never be easier
the controls are very simply you have
the toggle button on top on the sides
you have the back button and then down
here you have to turn on button turn it
off so simple simple operation
everything is really pretty much done
through the toggling feature and the
toggling feature has so many things
inside of it that you can do I'm you can
click on the Settings button you can go
in there and change things like your
display you can change the vibration you
can change the devices hook duck to you
can make a call you can screen lock you
can choose your different kind of
connections your input your power saving
mode and your gear info it's all
available with a scroll of your finger
so we've talked about you know most of
the scrolling features and all that
there's also actually another feature
another way to control the watch what
you do is you simply take your finger to
the very top of the screen you slide it
down and this enables you to choose what
type of connectivity you have whether
it's Bluetooth whether it's Wi-Fi or
whatever it's a very simple thing to use
so overall I gotta say that I first went
into this I was kind of thinking okay
you know a Bluetooth watch huh okay but
there's actually a lot of cool things
and let's real quick let's take a look
at the amazing apps that make your gear
s2 rock the night running app tracks
your runs and helps you reach your goals
then there's also line which is a global
messaging app that is both fast and easy
to use
there's also Yelp for gear browse
reviews to help you find the most highly
recommend and businesses including
restaurants bars shops and more they've
also teamed up with Twitter trends which
stays up-to-date on top local trends and
tweets from popular accounts Volkswagen
this is a neat one this app gives you
access to useful features for your
connected vehicle no matter where you
are so if you got a Volkswagen this is
gonna be something pretty cool they've
also got one called smart things no more
worries about lights left on or door's
unlocked control your home when you're
away all being your gear s2 through
smart things
there's also Kibo by unit key now this
is a sub that you can send each keys to
friends while maintaining control over
the lock operating doors requires a
simple touch for those of you don't know
exactly what this is you guys seem to
use my August smart lock another type of
smart devices this particular feature
allows you to actually
operate those devices via your gear s2
and earlier in the video I talked to you
guys about using your SmartWatch for
buying stuff with their new ally Pei you
can do that you can buy concert tickets
buy coffee all this stuff off via the
gear s2 and last but not least is Boxer
now this is something pretty cool
boxer actually turns your gear s2 check
this out into a walkie-talkie that's
right few people out there you like the
old science fiction the spy novel stuff
now you can use your gear s2 to talk to
you one of your friends directly from
your gear s2 that's pretty nifty right I
think so
control this is a generic we've got a
mission and real quick folks I want to
make a correction earlier in the video I
said that the watch could actually do a
hundred songs well slap me vicious I was
wrong it's actually 300 songs that you
can store directly on your gear s2 300
songs now me personally on a treadmill I
do probably about 35 to 40 minutes so
you're talking three albums that's
enough music to go to the gym for like a
couple of months and not run out of
songs and completely listen different
music so that to me is a very important
feature being able to just listen to my
wireless headset out walking around
monitor all my health monitor my steps
monitor my heart rate that stuff's all
really cool being able to actually
submerge myself in the shower check this
out
I can actually take a shower wash my dog
and totally wash myself and there's
absolutely zero damage done to the gear
s2 like I said before submergible up to
three meters so that's pretty cool that
means you could probably pretty much
jump into a pool and if you got out
really quick in the shallow end you'd
still be okay it's too early at the end
of the day what is my final conclusion
on the gear s2 I have to say that I went
into it not really thinking that it
would be all that much but I have to say
that I'm impressed I'm looking forward
to being able to use it the simple way
of controlling everything is just
amazing I would have says one of the
most ergonomic products I've seen in a
long time there's nothing that I can
really complain about about how you
interact with it at all it's very easy
very easy to operate controls on are
simple and straightforward there was
actually nothing that we ran into it at
all were like going wow what what the
heck what do we do here
didn't counter that whatsoever my entire
experience of the g2 has actually been
pretty cool we took it in the park we
walked the dog we walked around the
streets and stuff with it
we tried just jumping around to monitor
my heart rate we counted my footsteps I
didn't get a chance yes to actually take
it and see it how well it does with like
coffee and liquids and stuff like that
but that's really cool because you guys
know I'm diabetic and I'm getting sicker
all the time it's just really hard to
take care of my body at my age but still
I'm doing it and ions and things is
gonna help quite a bit
I need to build myself up a much much
better retinue of exercise program than
doing stuff than I've been doing I got
sick a lot this year we didn't go to the
gym I hardly at all you guys saw the
year before I spent a year going with
John to the gym to lose all that weight
and I lost all that weight and got
really in shape only get infection in my
foot from the gym being dirty to get my
foot cut off and then put me back to
 again so now I'm trying to do
all this all over again and I think it's
gonna help quite a bit I know it's like
for the trendy people out there a lot of
people out there are poor you're gonna
be like there's no way in hell I could
drop the cash on that hey man I
completely understand that
I really can't either I get most of my
stuff by a kindness of the sponsors out
there who give this stuff to me to bring
the love to you guys so that's how it
only goes for me I know some of the
stuff's expensive these things are going
between like I think 199 and 329
depending on which version you get I
think the classics the most expensive
version it's like 349 the one that we
got just the black version but overall I
have to say that I'm very happy with the
gear s2 it has a lot of features a lot
of functionality very easy to use
simplistic to use no hassles I think if
there's somebody out there you're a
trinny person you do have the money
you're gonna want to check out the
Samsung gear s2 it's a solid SmartWatch
for the price and have to say I'm pretty
impressed
