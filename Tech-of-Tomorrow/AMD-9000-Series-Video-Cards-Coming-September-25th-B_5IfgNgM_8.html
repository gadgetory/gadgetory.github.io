channel with my human Eric but I didn't
know he talked hey guys welcome to tech
of tomorrow we've got three stores you
guys stay what are they about AMD AMD
and well
well buddy hey whats up guys first story
well it's about AMD and it's about their
new GPU codenamed Hawaii that's right
now I was thinking that these guys just
making a video card for you know those
dumb surfers they don't know what
they're doing say it to install you know
some kind of instrument thing inside
their surfboard first paddle out then
sit ass on wave if wave too big pray to
God wait is that what it's on there no
but anyways first story new GPU from AMD
codenamed Hawaii now this thing's coming
out and we're hoping that's going to be
AMD's solution to fight the Titan now
with his other story we're going to lead
into as something to do with this as
well because you guys all know that
prices have now dropped on the 7990 and
so what AMD is done is they have their
new card coming out the hawaii but they
also have the 7990 completely slashed
down to under seven hundred dollars
that's right one thing though that we do
know for certain is that there will be a
live event in Hawaii where AMD releases
this thing on sep tember 25th and we'll
make sure that we cover that event one
way or another for you folks now also
for those people who want to go out
there and save money and get themselves
at 7990 check out the link down the
description below that like button will
have some links to that card now this
thing's selling like hotcakes so I'm
being honest with you have the extra
cash and you've been coveting this damn
card now is the time to buy it because
I've heard that when they sell these
things out that's it they're not going
to make no more so if you want one
there's no better time than now now next
up in a rather twisted thing from A&amp;amp;E
we've heard well it's rumored out from
the vr-zone that AMD is going to
terminate their FX line of CPUs that's
right now most people know the 95 90 it
didn't really score all that well what
people thought it was and I know you AMD
fans I've seen your comments now I know
you guys are right in one aspect this
cpu was very expensive it was more
geared for OEMs but still they sold it
for people out there to buy at nine
hundred dollars and you guys know it's
really just a souped-up 8350 CPU we
bought one we released some initial
scores this saturday we're actually
going to be building the full system to
look for that next weekend on the
channel Luke I still have that will give
you our own personal scores off that
system but that cpu didn't really do all
that well and with rumors of AMD you
know losing money vr-zone decide to put
on storage said hey we're jumping out of
the FX market now AMD officially has
nothing well official to say about it at
all they're not denying not confirming
but their roadmap does not coincide with
that story so I'm saying this story is
pretty much going to be hype I don't
believe it but I definitely want to hear
what you guys think because a lot of
people think that maybe they're just
going to jump over onto their APU side
of things would you guys like that let
me know so what's even more exciting
though than tech news well obviously
free tech that's right and we've
got two immortal action packs that we're
going to be given to you folks out there
now right now these things are on sale
for 22 dollars and they contain four
games that's right so you get the mortal
kombat komplete arcade kollection and
you also get the mortal kombat komplete
edition I know it gets a little bit
confusing you also get Lord of the Rings
and batman arkham city and we have a
couple of ways to win this the first way
to win is to follow us on twitter and to
tweet the articles that we're talking
about in this video the other way is to
go over and like our facebook page our
new one that we have which we finally
went over and it's totally tech of
tomorrow official we're official baby
and so there are two ways to win I know
some of you guys don't like Twitter some
of you guys don't like online stuff so
this way we give you the best of both
worlds and two ways to win now before i
bounce out of here last week we brought
you guys a video of the headphones from
alien vibes and the original coupon code
that we had seemed to not work but we've
got a new coupon code which gives you 25
dollars off of these headphones for the
next 30 days so if you guys happen to
miss then you want to hear how they
sound make sure you guys check out all
the links down below like button which I
know
guys are going to kindly press and show
love to to show us you love us because
you guys did you've come food at too
many times it broke your computer and
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your
computer apologies all around apologies
but that's it folks if you're not
subscribed make sure you do so we love
