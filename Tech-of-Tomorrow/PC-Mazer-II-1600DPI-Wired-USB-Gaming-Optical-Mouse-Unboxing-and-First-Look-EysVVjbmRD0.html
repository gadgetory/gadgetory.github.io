gaming deal of the week
you like getting crazy you like being an
acrobat get Assassin's Creed 2 for 8
dollars and 80 cents on Amazon this week
only see the link in the description
below
what's everybody welcome back Tech Odom
are you guys new me I'm Eric fairest got
Jesus bueno back behind the camera back
there doing his usual Nick now a
lot of you guys have been sending me
emails and stuff about a lot of products
they sell like over in Asia but through
eBay and so taking that in mind I kind
of went and shopped around there looked
at some of those weird-ass cat leaked
monitors and while I was doing that I
came across a bunch of really weird
 mice dude one of them I came
across this was this PC Mazur it's
called like the basically II blue series
and there's this little thing right here
now supposedly this mouse competes with
a lot of the higher-end gaming mice that
we see over here in America but you can
buy it on eBay for 18 bucks ship now a
lot of people gonna freak out they're
gonna be like my god it's coming from
Hong Kong man now there is one thing
about this come bought it from they
don't send you a tracking number so I
waited and waited and waited and some
 nasty email saying hey where's
my product ass bytes and they're like oh
dude it's been at your place for two
weeks and I'm like well why do you sent
a tracking them or they're like oh yeah
sorry
Keamy tracking number I guess the post
all that tried to liver it to one of my
friends houses of multiple times but we
got it right here it's 18 bucks works on
both Mac and PC now online you'll see
that it says it has a maximum dpi of
1600 but actually the maximum dpi on
this is actually 2400 I think it's a
pretty interesting product especially if
you want to get a gaming mice and not
especially if you want to get a gaming
mouse and not break the bank because I
mean come on 20 bucks if it actually
does compete with some of the higher-end
products it's gonna be pretty cool so
what's busted out of the box right now
hook it up to my little mac shack in the
back here and let's see what's going on
alright folks so here we go so the
cameras gonna do a couple things here up
I pissed him off and I make him do a
couple of number things you guys can see
I got the mouse right here but up here
on my screen is actually where I bought
it from from eBay so you guys can see up
here this is the old eBay thing maybe
the guy bought it from was called
prefect for you I'm supposing meant to
say perfect but he said prefect so he
thinks he's the rule of using is your
prefect but this is it 18 bucks online
easy to get there you guys saw it here's
this right here we'll make sure we put
this link up here that we bought it on
as well if you want to check it out so
let's start the unboxing
front of the box you guys can see it
says four Pro right-handed gamers
through your way
it does three-way wow that's kind of
kinky it's got some page weapon
switchers hybrid LED performance says
the master of destiny works on both Mac
and PC and that's pretty common I think
no things we run Mac and PC here are
different stuff couple programmable
buttons now everything on this thing is
obviously written in Asian because the
things comes directly from Hong Kong my
biggest thing is this though if you can
actually get a mouse from Hong Kong that
kicks ass for 18 bucks why not wait the
week for shipping so let's go ahead and
start taking the thing out of the box
and let's see if this thing this is cool
as I'm really hoping it will be so cub
laying there's the box check out the
damn camera man defend yourself camerman
oh wow I'm elated at the camera for that
he gets an extra beating after work and
one bus serving of pork chops so here we
go
here's the master of destiny the mouse
go into done tada well I think of
masters of destiny I'm think of like
some he-man cartoon he-man master of
destiny
alright so let's pull this thing out
mm-hmm buttons seem pretty ergonomic
all right folks here's the right side
two programmable buttons got a little
thumb rest right here for your thumb
pretty cool shiznit buttons up here on
top middle scroll doesn't move left oh
yeah okay it moves left to right as well
as up and down and your regular squirrel
you've got your dpi button right here
you hit this little button it's going to
change the DPI let me spin around maybe
so you guys can see it better there you
see dpi on that side they'll spin around
Yankees are freaking weird over there
here's the e below so you gotta keep
switching every time I look at a name
yet I keep switching it they did it
confuse you I guess there's the e below
and then here at the bottom the maser
the PC maser it's all that flip around
over this side now there are no buttons
on this side at all which i think is
kind of wack you think there'd be a
button on there but there's not so
here's the cable get it all out there
see how long it is so it's actually
pretty long folks so I can't even put it
in the camera range it's longer than
that so here I'm by the camera I'm gonna
pull it all the way back I think you
guys can see this very very long so
let's go ahead right now and let's go
ahead and move my Death Adder
off my thing and let's unplug my phone
charger and plug this little bad boy in
and there we go we can see it all lights
up my Mac automatically detected it my
hack and Mac you guys can see the
buttons on this side all nice and blue
top the DPI
I'll actually play with the dang thing
in a few days I'll let you guys know if
it's actually worth its weight and 18
bucks so if I'm gonna check it out
though it's a pretty cool Mouse I mean
it's only 18 bucks it actually does feel
really good in my hand and I mean there
are many like cheap-ass little
Logitech's that are out there that I
feel this is going to be superior to
those any day of the week so I'll start
playing with the thing and here's the
bottom you guys can see the serial
number down there and you know that's
pretty much it guys check you on the
flipside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
