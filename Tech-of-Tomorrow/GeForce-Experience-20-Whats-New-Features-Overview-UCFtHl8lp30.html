this thing started off a year ago in
2013 and made a lot of advancements

while on the PC but now it's moving over
to the notebook for the very first time
and there's gonna be some pretty key
features that are there that haven't
been available before all the way across
the board the first of these is
one-click Game Capture the next is
one-click broadcast at which minimal
performance overhead will also see full
desktop capture capabilities this will
be great for capturing windowed and
borderless windowed games support for
DirectX and OpenGL and supported on
desktop GPUs by Nvidia there's even more
now you get custom encoding with custom
output resolution custom bitrate and
framerate auto pause on alt-tab
broadcast 720p at 60 frames per second
and
game naming next up is game stream now
game streams gonna be really cool
because base what you're gonna be able
to do now is take your shield and go
anywhere you want to a friend's house to
the you know anymore basically where
they have access to a PC Xbox or in that
type of stuff you'll be able to
automatically stream your games and play
them off of your shield now this is
gonna be pretty cool stuff I'm gonna
handle it over to captain Kevin next
week and let him bring you guys a full
demo of that stuff and that's gonna be
really really interesting currently this

always doing a laptop gaming now this
thing's gonna go when it's gonna make
sure it creates the settings that best
