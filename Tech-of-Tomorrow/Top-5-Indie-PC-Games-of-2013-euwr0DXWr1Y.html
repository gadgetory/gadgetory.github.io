plus for an extended 14-day free trial
check out hulu plus com / t OT what's up
tech fans kevin here on TECA tomorrow
now how do you guys will remember that a
couple weeks ago we put up a video where
I talked about my top five personal
favorite big name pc games of this year
and use that qualifier big name because
i wanted to bring you guys a separate
list where I talked about my top five
favorite indie titles of 2013 now a lot
of the same rules as last time still
apply I'm very bad at picking favorites
much less ranking them from first to
fifth so these are in no particular
order and I'm not trying to say that
these are objectively the best or that
I've played every single indie game out
there because there are a lot of them
these are just the five that I
personally played and really enjoyed and
want to share with you guys so that
building them up anymore let's get right
to them
now first off I want to talk about a
game that was in beta for a very long
time and finally got fully released this
year path of Exile on the surface you
have a game that seems to share a lot in
common with the top down Luke grinding
classic diablo 2 but they take some RPG
mechanics lifted from Final Fantasy
games like a gem system for customizing
your active skills and a gigantic
passive skill tree shared by all classes
whose only difference other than
appearance is where they start on this
tree overall it's a ton of hack and
slash fun with a crazy amount of
customization character building theory
along with a hardcore mode for players
looking for a way to really test their
planning and skills if you're looking
for a fun Luke grinder that is also free
to play my dad and this one's definitely
worth picking up if not at least trying
for a little bit now next up is a game
that's trying to recapture old-school
difficulty with a bit of a twist and is
by far one of the most addicting games
I've played this year rogue legacy take
Metroidvania style gameplay ramp up the
difficulty and add in a touch of
randomness by having to pick new heroes
every time you die each one with a
number of weird physical or mental
traits sometimes useful sometimes
negative and sometimes just plain weird
gameplay is fast difficult and there's a
lot of room to grow and explore thanks
to the game skill tree and numerous
randomly generated rooms featuring a
variety of challenges that can only be
tackled with the right gear or the right
traits once you start playing you'll
find this is one of the hardest games to
put down and even once you've beaten it
you'll have a new game plus mode that
just keeps reeling you back in now one
of the most bizarre games I fell in love
with this year is papers please a game
that uses old school style graphics with
one of the most bizarre overall
mechanics in a game having you work as a
paper pusher at a border checkpoint it's
hard to describe how exactly this game
gets as engrossing as it does adding new
mechanics and rules every day requiring
a keener eye but still doing things fast
enough so you can make enough money so
you don't get arrested for debt or see
family died due to sickness and hunger
it's easily one of the oddest mixings of
gameplay and narrative but those that
start playing it will quickly see how
well it accomplishes this with its
numerous endings and strangely addictive
white-collar work gameplay for that
we've got a game that came out at the
start of this year a game whose visual
style and trippy gameplay is matched by
its excellent puzzle design antechamber
an excellent example of modern
first-person puzzle gaming antechamber
has by far some of the craziest and most
confusing level designs testing players
wits with puzzle
that aren't just as simple as placing
one item here there but having the very
layout of areas change based on how you
look at them if you love puzzles than
this title is an absolute must play and
those of you that are just fans at crazy
visual designs might just find it to
your liking as well now last step is a
game that is very short but accomplishes
a lot in its very short timeframe and
managed to punch you right in the fields
and that's brothers a co-op adventure
game that you play with yourself and
while the controls do take bit of
getting used to it first quickly enough
you'll find yourself easily controlling
two characters at once with half a
controller each brothers manages a form
of storytelling and Exposition rarely
seen in a game so short and does all of
it without using any kind of
decipherable real world language it's
puzzles are fun and intuitive giving
players a well-paced strong storytelling
experience that grows on you with each
passing moment anyone that is a fan of
narrative and video games must give this
one a shot and I can't stress enough how
much I enjoyed this game despite its
overall short length something that
normally bothers me in a lot of games
today so that was my top 5 personal
favorite indie games to come out in 2013
there were a lot of great titles come
out this year covering a large numbers
on risen just too many for me to choose
from and sure a lot that you guys love
just didn't make the list so make sure
to let us know in the comments what ones

top 5 or even your top 10 if there's
