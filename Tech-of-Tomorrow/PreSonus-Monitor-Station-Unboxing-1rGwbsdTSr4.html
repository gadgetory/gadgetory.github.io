Elbert Fair is here back once again on
the tech of tomorrow YouTube channel
bring you guys something really cool now
most of you guys out there know that I'm
in the band pane cylinder and that I
sing in a band and I own a recording
studio and I just really love music all
around so that said I actually built a
recording studio in my house and I was
having a little bit of difficulty
talking back between my control room and
my isolation booth so with that said I
was trying to find a product that I
could talk back and forth with my
engineer and be able to have my monitors
you know my speakers all taking care
about one thing with that in mind I went
out and I started looking for a product
I came across this Presonus monitor
station now this things are really cool
products you can use up to four sets of
headphones three sets of monitors you
can also have talkback back and forward
to your control room and it also hooks
up with your interface as well really
cool thing for the guy who has a soul
home based studio excellent product even
probably pretty good for somebody owns a
big studio if you're not looking for a
rackmount this is a desk based product
but anyways that said let's take a look
at what's inside of the box first I'll
show you the part of the box get the
camera to zoom all in there and get that
blocked I'll flip it around show you
guys the back the box then I'll set the
box to the table I'll have the camera
and refocus on it so that you guys can
see what's in here and I'll go ahead and
pop the cap on it brought the bat we can
see that we've got a bag that has all
the user's manuals everything in it I'll
go ahead and open this up all right got
a few things inside of here we've got
the sea you get the camera to refocus
again there got the Presonus got the
little Presonus little thing there we
have the monitor station a little
control thing there then we have their
catalog they actually give you a catalog
with all their products inside of it you
get all the little rubber feet so it
doesn't run around your desktop and then
you get the Presonus warranty and online
registration card
that's all this stuff that would
basically be on the content page I'm
just going to go ahead and leave that
out there for you folks you can see it
and I'm going to go ahead
the Camden readjust over here on the box
you can see it all comes all well laid
out inside of here I'll protect my foam
padding go ahead and pull this out
there's a couple more things in here
it's the unit and the power supply I'll
go ahead just move that out of the way
in the back go ahead and open this thing
up for you guys
it's actually really pretty heavy I'm
gonna go ahead and set this out there
get the camera to zoom in on this and
get it locked let me spin around let you
guys see the back of it everything's
very easy connect all of your headphone
jacks and everything are located right
here on the front of the unit so you can
see these are all right here you have
your talkback button it's very easy
right here you're sitting inside your
thing you click this little button it's
pressure-sensitive you hold it down it
engages the unit really cool stuff as
you see in the back you can hook up
actually your own microphone if you
wanted to and then all of these back
here for all of your different audio
connections including our say if you saw
I have those kind of jacks but overall
this thing's really cool
we actually test drove one and it was
really nice we could hear each other
very clearly between the rooms and
everything so here's that can you unbox
the last little thing here which is the
power supply and then for those people
out of her studio if you want to have
multiple monitors you want to have
multiple sets of headphones you want to
have really nice stuff in your studio
this new persona sub monitor station
might be the product that's right up
your alley it's coming to market at
about three hundred dollars and will
actually show you how we use it inside
the studio and the next coming few days
so thanks for watching taking tomorrow
ciao we'll see you back here again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
