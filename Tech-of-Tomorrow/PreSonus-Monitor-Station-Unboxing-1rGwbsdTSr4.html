elbert Farrah's hear back once again on
the tech of tomorrow youtube channel
bring you guys something really cool now
most you guys out there know that i'm in
the band pain cylinder and that i sing
in a band and i own a recording studio
and i just really love music all around
so that said I actually built a
recording studio in my house and I was
having a little bit of difficulty
talking back between my control room and
my isolation booth so with that said I
was trying to find a product that I
could talk back and forth with my
engineer and be able to have my monitors
you know my speakers all taking care of
it one thing with that in mind I went
out I started looking for a product I
came across this presonus monitor
station now this thing is a really cool
product you can use up to four sets of
headphones three sets of monitors you
can also have talked back back and
forward to your control room and it also
hooks up with your interface as well
really cool thing for the guy who has a
solo home base to do excellent product
even probably pretty good for somebody
owns a big studio if you're not looking
for a rackmount this is a desk based
product but anyways that said let's take
a look at what's inside the box first
I'll show you the part of the box get
the camera to zoom all in there get that
blocked I'll flip it around show you
guys to back the box then i'll set the
box of the table i'll let the camera and
refocus on it so that you guys can see
what's in here i'll go ahead and pop the
cap on it brought the bat we can see
that we've got a bag that has all the
users manual everything in it i'll go
ahead and open this up alright got a few
things inside of here we've got the see
you get the camera to refocus skin there
get the presonus got the little presonus
little thing there we have the monitor
station a little control thing there
then we have their catalog they actually
give you a catalog with all their
products inside of it you get all the
little rubber feet so it doesn't run
around your desktop and then you get the
personas warranty and online
registration card that's all this stuff
that would basically be on the content
page i'm just going to go ahead and
leave that out there for you folks you
can see it and i'm going to go ahead
the cam and readjust over here on the
box you can see it all comes all well
laid out inside of here I'll protect my
foam padding go ahead and pull this out
there's a couple more things in here
it's the unit and the power supply I'll
go ahead just move that out of the way
in the back go ahead and open this thing
up for you guys it's actually really
pretty heavy I'm going to go ahead and
set this out there get the camera to
zoom in on this get it locked let me
spin around let you guys see the back of
it everything's very easy connect all of
your headphone jacks and everything are
located right here on the front of the
unit so you can see these are all right
here you have your talk back button it's
very easily right here you're sitting
inside your thing you click this little
button it's pressure-sensitive you hold
it down it engages the unit really cool
stuff as you see in the back you can
hook up actually your own microphone if
you wanted to and then all of these back
here for all of your different audio
connections including our say if you saw
have those kind of jacks but overall
this thing's really cool we actually
test drove one and it was really nice we
could hear each other very clearly
between the rooms and everything so
here's that you unbox the last little
finger which is the power supply and
then for those people out of her studio
if you want to have multiple monitors
you want to have multiple sets of
headphones you want to have really nice
stuff in your studio this new personas
monitor station might be the product
that's right up your alley it's coming
to market at about three hundred dollars
and will actually show you how we use it
inside the studio in the next coming few
days so thanks for watching taking
tomorrow ciao we'll see you back here
again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
