once again to TECA tomorrow now if
you're like me you really like audio and
I'm kind of an audio freak in fact I'm
always on the search for the better
sound or the best tone I can get from my
guitar so I can't have a long background
of checking out speakers and doing this
type of thing now the speakers that
we're gonna be looking at today are by a
couple of brothers in Arizona one's an
engineer one's a designer and they were
like hey speakers are boring as hell so
let's come up with something more
creative and different than anything
else on the market and well veter has
definitely delivered on their promise of
doing this now we have a set of their
speakers we have what's called the full
set which includes you know two
satellite speakers and a subwoofer
remote control all that good stuff they
do sell the speakers as single bookstand
speakers you know just as two speakers
without the subwoofer but honestly I
think all in all with the subwoofer you
get a much more balanced sound from the
entire package so let's just face it the
subwoofer is where you really get most
of your bass sounds out so you really
would prefer to have those in just
bookshelf speakers unless you're just
you know limited on space now the number
one thing you're gonna notice about the
panel 1 speakers that well you don't see
any traditional speakers whatsoever
their speaker is actually a twill weave
carbon fiber panel that's right and it
actually has a hundred and thirty-two
square inches of sound being produced
off that instead of what you get up a
standard speaker usually up a standard
speaker you're only getting probably
about 17 inches a little bit more
depending on what you're using of actual
space that's providing sound so if I'm
not being very clear on this the panel
back behind me that you see that whole
panel is what's producing the sound so
that entire thing is pretty much your
speaker which is really cool because
let's just face it it's super thin in
fact I don't I said that or not but
it's only less than 1.5 millimeters thin
that's right it's so very very thin
they're 11 inches tall by 6 inches wide
they feature a stainless steel stand and
a stainless steel stand it actually is 4
inches long so it takes 4 inches of
space wherever you're gonna put them in
on your shelf but you guys can see
they're very very interesting I mean
nothing like this out there has been
really designed they've had some
speakers in the past that were called
planar speakers
and let me just tell you these speakers
were like super duper high value on the
top of the audio scale now I talked to
these guys about what they were really
shooting for with the panel 1 speakers I
asked you guys like totally going for
like the audiophile thing the gaming
type thing and they were more like no we
were just trying to make a very good set
of speakers that wasn't you know really
geared for the highest and of audiophile
and it wasn't really geared for gaming
it was really just for right in the
middle of that it's for gaming and it's
for listening to music but it's kind of
right in the middle and for the price
point right now in their Kickstarter you
can get these speakers for a really
decent price now I have another couple
of set of speakers I just listened to us
as some creative speakers and then I
also has these speakers bifocal the
focal speakers are $700 and I have to
say that these speakers the panel ones
equal the sound quality of those
speakers I mean so these speakers that
are like you know pretty much twice as
much money aren't sounding any better
than the panel ones speakers the audio
on these speakers is very nice it's
straight down the middle so I've talked
about this before in videos sound is
very subjective what I hear what I like
might not really be what you hear what
you like me personally I like speakers
that are a little bit more on the
Trouble side as far as the sound tuning
goes some people prefer a lot of bass
like you know guys who do out the music
and that kind of stuff that has all the
pumping stuff the electronic stuff
they're gonna want speakers that really
can pick up on the solid base of that
stuff they'll have probably separate
tweeters in doing that but these
speakers are really right down the
middle flat so if you're a fan of Bose
type speakers and you like that kind of
clinical type sandwiches in my opinion
how it sounds you're really going to
like these speakers the frequency range
of the panel 1 speakers is 48 to 20,000
Hertz each speaker has 48 watts and the
subwoofer itself is 60 watts
another thing the panel 1 speakers come
with is a remote control now this will
operate all the features of your audio
but you can also connect your Bluetooth
device to that as well another nice
thing about the remote is that you can
switch between two different devices and
control them all from the remote control
so you can have your TV hooked up and
another sound device and control them
all right off the remote control now
with that said though let's hear it
ministration of the sound
all right Tech fans so there you guys
have it the panel 1 speakers now these
things as far as design goes are
absolutely very very nice and another
cool thing is if you want something
that's pretty much handmade here in
America that is these speakers these
guys actually assemble everything inside
their living room I'm not sure if every
single piece of plastic and screw and
everything is made in the USA but all of
the assembly and everything having them
put together is all by these two
brothers in their living room in Phoenix
Arizona so you know that everything at
this point it's completely hands-on
quality so as far as design goes these
things are definitely definitely in my
eyes and editors choice they're very
original the sound is definitely
something unique and different than
other speakers and all honestly I'm I
would have a real hard time truly
describing the exact sound of these
speakers other than to say that they
sound a lot like those because they're
very very clean
there's no extreme high treble no
extreme bass and if I was gonna really
have a caveat in bitch I would ask for a
bigger subwoofer I mean this subwoofers
okay it's it's a nice little long throw
sub woofer but to me I wish it was a
little bit of a bigger design and
probably you know a downwards firing one
just because I prefer to have my sound
all in one type of area but beyond that
they sound very very clean so if you
want something that's not going to take
up a lot of room look very nice people
talk about it get really solid across
the board sound you really might want to
check out these panel 1 speakers um you
can currently get them on their
Kickstarter for a deal when they come
out they're gonna be even more money but
I know a lot of people out there
especially people that are tech savvy
and they want the latest and greatest
stuff to check out these are not only a
cool set of speakers they're also kind
of an art piece by the way of their
design so I'm Eric you guys been
watching Tekkit amaro down below we'll
have a link to their Kickstarter project
if you guys want to get a pair for
yourself and check them out hey do so
I'm sure those guys will appreciate it
and hey thanks guys for sending these
sped of speakers they're pretty nice
