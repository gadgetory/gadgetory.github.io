back here on tech of tomorrow you guys
should know by now I'm Elric your host
now one of the biggest questions that I
get every day of the week is what's my
choice AMD or Intel
what's better what should I do how and
why should I make a decision like this
well AMD and Intel both make CPUs now
AMD since they bought ATI they also make
GPUs as well so in some ways as a total
package AMD has some better leverage
over Intel now the main thing is you
have to ask yourself what am I going to
be doing that's the first thing you
would ask yourself what are you doing
with your computer because if the only
thing that you're going to do with your
computer is watch games at 1920 by 1080
there is absolutely no reason in the
world that you can't use an AMD system
even one of their trinity apu systems
with a 6670 will still play a lot of
games at decent frame rates even with a
66 70 that's very cheap system you can
put a whole system together like that
for very low priced now with that said
though if gaming isn't the only thing
you're doing
when I say gaming I pretty much mean
gaming internet surfing typing documents
any of the basic type stuff but your fun
factor is gaming there's nothing wrong
with AMD now if you're a person though
you're going to be rendering in 3d
you're going to be using a lot of type
of stuff like Photoshop hi intense math
calculations and those kinds of
operations you're going to want to go
with an Intel based system I mean there
is a reason why Mac only chooses to use
Intel in their systems and not AMD when
it comes to high tech stuff Intel is
just better they have less problems they
have less errors just overall for high
end calculations they are
very good now on the server side of
things there are all kinds of great AMD
servers that are out now that will
totally work with our Opteron and other
type of things so in the server market
from what I'm hearing from the people
out there I'm not a big server guy but
in server market even though Intel
definitely has the lion's share of the
market hey Andy still has some great
solutions so at the end of the day a lot
of people always ask this what's better
it really just depends on what you're
going to be doing now I've bought a
bunch of different laptops for laptops
due to heat and the very fact that
there's always more heat with AMD CPUs
that's one of the big things about them
right now
intel has cooled off things with laptops
I pretty much choose to go with Intel
with their HD 4000 graphics on their new
stuff they seem to work very well for
those type of basic applications you
know I'm saying but you don't have to go
out and spend big money on an Intel CPU
and all this stuff if you just want to
do basic things the Intel CPU comes into
play when you're doing things much
beyond standard gaming if you're just
gaming doing standard stuff I have to
say you should probably be looking at
AMD unless you just have an enormous
amount of money to spend and in some
cases when we're comparing stuff even
with using an Nvidia card and Intel
versus AMD and AMD on some of the
gameplay we've heard and we've seen from
all their sites looking around that
sometimes you get better performance
that's just the way that it is so if
you're somebody out there and right now
you're sitting ready you're going hey
I'm going to go out I'm going to buy a
system first off determine what it is
you're doing with your system determine
your budget and then pick the parts that
you want to go there's all kinds of
great things and nowadays pretty much
all parts are almost plug-and-play
there are some people who have some
extreme stuff that has problems of
drivers and stuff but almost even the
most non PC person go out and buy a
bunch of parts and put them together and
it should work
so do it yourself guys you can save a
lot of money by going out and building
your own PC so at the end of the day
when it comes to AMD versus Intel there
is no
clear winner because sure you can say
that an you know an i7 that cost twelve
hundred dollars gets you a little bit
more frame rates than a CPU the only
cost $85 but let's see here $85 $1200
big difference there and does that money
difference justify the cost because the
cost difference is major for the longest
time I ran only Intel based systems but
then we start doing a lot more
experimenting I started getting into the
more AMD stuff started playing around
bit and I found that a lot of these
lower end AMD systems play games
absolutely fine there's no problems you
save a lot of money now if I'm doing
something where I'm really hard work I'm
going to be doing a bunch of editing and
all that type of stuff well then yes I
would definitely go with an Intel based
CPU so there you guys have it that's the
main question I get all the time I hope
this answers some questions for you guys
if you have more you can always put
comments below or you can send me a
direct question right through the
messaging here or you can send me direct
email at Elric at tech of tomorrow comm
but I hope this clarifies some stuff so
if you're out there looking no there's
really not too much of a difference just
depending on what you're doing like
usual I hope you guys like this video
please hit the like button and show me
that you do it'll make me think about
doing more videos of this type and if
you're not subscribed I hope that you
would be so you never miss out on
anything that's going on here on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
