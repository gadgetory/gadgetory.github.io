what's goin on I'm Eric welcome back to
tech of tomorrow today we're going to be
looking at a really cool product for the
people over at Ike a multimedia now this
product starts off at $99 is really cool
price and its really meant the traveling
musician this thing's whole big getup
about it is it'll work either with your
iPhone your Android phone it'll work
with your PC it'll work with your Mac
that's what's really really cool about
it now we're going to probably get up to
my PC first today and see if we can demo
on a PC because we know demographically
they're going to be more PC users out
there than Mac users we know that we
recognize that so right the bat after we
unbox this we're going to try to hook it
up to the PC with the basic installed
software and just see if we can get it
to work and go from there because it's
so that's really cool for the PC users
now for the Mac crowd I know this
thing's going to easily seamlessly work
with that no problems at all because
it's all geared for you're working with
logic it's used to working with Pro
Tools all that kind of stuff it's geared
for using those software programs all in
the box so with that said let's hop in
let's see what comes in the new iRig
keys from the people at I came
multimedia let's go all right folks were
just over here the iRig Keys universal
keyboard controller for iPhone iPod
Touch iPad and Mac PC control yota
clever universal port iPhone iPod Touch
iPad at the Mac PC yeah you see that
right there all that good stuff here's
some basic pictures we're going to move
down along here you see the product I
came Ulta media musicians first yeah
that's right musicians first musicians
rock alright let's turn over the side
check it out
37 velocity-sensitive mini keys pitch
Bend and modulation wheels 5 backward
buttons volume data knob iOS dot
connection compatible iPhone iPod Touch
iPad once again plug and play core MIDI
and USB class compliant powered by the
iOS device USB computer port so that's
all I could stuff I'm not gonna read it
to in French again I'd like to because I
think that's just funny but you guys
don't get mad alright so moving on
here's the back or basically just tells
you a lot more stuff about
the product again more product shots
here I hear some important stuff come to
- free apps the I grand piano free the
acoustic piano app and the sample tank
for iPhone or iPad these are all free
you get them off the app store register
your product get kaboom now it's coming
with this right here SampleTank 2l now
this is a standalone plug-in sample
workstation with 2 gigabytes of sample
works with GarageBand logic pro tools
Cubase live and more so I don't know if
I'm it's gonna be used as a standalone
product I'm going to try to I may not be
able to but let's do the unboxing first
so down here at the end got that go
ahead and get one of my trusty little
knives out here there we go
make ourselves a trusty little incision
here as well yeah didn't dip into don't
do alright there we go the box can now
open and pop this little top here and
I'll go ahead I'm just probably get pull
this back so not gonna get the whole
thing in the camera range here next it's
gonna use if I shake the box there we go
it's starting to come out Oh sounds like
someone's passing gas but it's not it's
just the box now that now this towards
Cameron look at government dock alright
so I hit the microphone it's gonna be a
big old boom right there so anyway
that's my crazy antics let's go ahead
and pop the cap here and we're off the
bat dog alright we get the Quick Start
Guide iRig Keys Universal keyboard
controller for iPhone iPad a you guys
already know that right Quick Start
Guide just going to tell you a bunch of
stuff how to use it and a bunch of
different languages ones that I don't
speak alright we're going to bang that
off to the side this is the register
your I K accessory today you want to
make sure that you do that that way you
can go ahead and download all the stuff
we talked about before like I said they
have a thing right here it says get all
your sample products and all that stuff
on the other side of this is my
registration card and registration card
which you can't see so haha alright so
they were moving that out of the way
what we got down here a revolution
mobile music revolution which is what
these guys are trying to do they're
trying to
everything to be portable rock and roll
on your phone you guys ought it is the
mobile world's taking over
so microUSB to USB see those over the
place
iPhone so you can put in your iPhone now
we'll go ahead and take the product out
and as I've actually read about this I
won't be able to give you guys a demo
like I wanted to you actually have to
use one of those programs so I'm going
to have to like install one in this
computer to do that I thought it'd be
simpler but it's not so let me bang this
out of the way now to the Cameron to get
some very very close ups here and I mean
hold this up we'll start off actually we
might as well start off in the back so
let's just start off in the back right
here you see connectivity this is for a
pedal right here is the iOS connection
plug the iOS connection in into your
phone record directly from this into
your phone easy stuff so that's the
connectivity in the back now let's flip
it around I'll show you guys the front
pitch modulation you guys all those are
good volume right here ten tenten tenten
you can do your different settings here
up and down your octaves here your
programs are here you can see that it's
very very very small but really cool for
using just simple things not very
expensive either being 99 bucks like I
said so you can sit here and use this
thing
and it actually feels pretty good
underneath my fingers it's not bad at
all
it's kind of funny because they have
some of the keys here you know you can
see right here it says all notes off
transparent reset enter yes and actually
each one of these all the way down you
know has something else to do it here
you see you know channel no mini channel
velocity knobs progression so you have
all kinds of knobs all kinds of control
with this 99 bucks so you guys the back
much to it is the bottom though it's got
a little feet to hold on to the stand
and that's pretty much it all right
there we go rockers and rollers you guys
can see this thing's made for ultra
portability it's very very lightweight
it's kind of long but you can stick it
inside of a duffel bag no problem at all
the cool thing about this is since it
goes directly to your phone it can be
powered that way you can plug this thing
directly into your phone and then just
start rockin I mean you could be at the
beach with your friends at a beach party
and just go oh hey I got a grant here
for a song and start banging it out you
know I mean or I think there's trickier
ways you could use it as well you could
probably hook it up and use one of those
USB speaker type things through your
phone so you play it through your phone
USB wireless speaker and you're playing
live at the beach through your phone on
the keyboard not I apologize I couldn't
give you guys a demo but we found out
Rock the beds are unboxing there's
nothing in the box at all the paper work
I have to go online register the product
download the software do all that stuff
and then I can get it up and going so
that'll be another video anyways let me
know what you guys think about this do
you think it's a pretty cool product do
you think it's total garbage I mean do
you think it's actually something
interesting I feel that it's something
very interesting for the fact that the
portability for those people who just
want to have something and take wherever
they go in this new age where everybody
says oh I want to go it's great but you
know from some of those programs you
know like Pro Tools logic all that kind
of stuff that's going to be more with
your laptop that's not going to be
really too much with your phone you're
going to be using that more your laptop
or your computer depending on how it
goes
