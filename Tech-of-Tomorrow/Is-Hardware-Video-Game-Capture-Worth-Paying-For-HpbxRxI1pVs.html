back at you again here on TECA tomorrow
for many years
you guys this seemed we've done software
game footage of the yom-yom and there
always seems to be a slight problem
either it's slowing down the recording
you get skipping or otherwise the
recording just has some kind of thing
that that makes software recording just
a pain in the ass for anybody who's
doing it professionally so if you're at
home you're just doing stuff for your
friends and stuff yeah software and
coding is pretty cool but now we're
gonna look at another product called the
AVO which is actually a hardware based
solution and it does 1080p and 4k why it
doesn't do 1440 we don't know we've been
trying to get all of our man sylvan and
ask what's going on but so far what
we've seen though with 1080p and 4k
footage is just simply amazing on the
hardware side of things now on the
hardware side of things it's a little
bit different and it actually does cost
a more investment because you have to
have a second computer to actually do
all of your copying so you have the
hardware device that sits in between the
two computers and the information is
actually captured and stored on the
second computer so the caveat to all
this is is that you know the better
you're capturing system you want the
more money you have to spend and it
definitely seems like using an SSD over
a hard drive it works extremely
extremely better so obviously there's
gonna be a little bit of money involved
in that but with that said though the
results are frickin flawlessly amazing
and beautiful so I'll stop talking let's
jump in and let's actually check out
some differences between software
footage capture and a hardware base and
you guys will see just what I'm talking
about that's buttery smooth and gameplay
let's go real quick folks though Before
we jump in and actually show you all the
capturing stuff well let's take a look
at the systems that we're using to do
all of our footage with now the first
system that we're using is the icarus
system you guys have seen this system
we've done lots of videos on it and we
did all of our capturing stuff using
this system as a system that we used to
play all of our games now the system
that we use to do all the capturing and
everything this is the x-factor system
it's an Intel based system and you guys
can check out the links down below if
you guys wanna check out the exact parts
that we used in both these systems
so first up gta5 1080p software based
date
let's check that same game out using the
hardware based solution the vo
oh no punishment
don't worry about complex you listen
Fernando I'm from a middle-class family
women out there stand up stop
complaining and make something of
themselves
yes that was unfortunate but I stood up
for what I deserved in divorce court
legal system recognizes the contribution
of spouse we've seen a lot of doom so
let's now once again check out doom
software capture and then we'll check
that out in Hardware as well
reached it
and now here we have doom with the
hardware-based solution much creamier
Wow
cool textures
detective
what temperature
gasps me start
demonic threat reduced by 25% it's up
okay I mean I have to say at the end of
the day hardware based solution even
though it costs about $400 is something
pretty amazing for those people who do
this type of thing for a living so real
quick let's take a look at the pros and
cons of getting a setup like this so the
pros of a hardware system are number one
that it takes the work off your PC so
the piece of you're playing games on is
not being used at all to capture the
footage it's also plug and play and it
offers up to 4k footage which is amazing
it also allows capturing of consoles
such as ps4 and Xbox one
no more laggy footage at all as you guys
can see the footage is butter smooth
now obviously the cons are it requires a
second system it also has a pointer
dollar price tag there's no software
included you must use your own now this
might be something that's actually good
or bad for you depending on the person
you are you're somebody who actually is
used to using type of software and it
works with this system and you're gonna
be happy because you're not gonna have
to step out of what you're used to
whatsoever and the last counter caveat
is that all of your results are going to
depend on the type of system that you
have so if you try to build yourself
like some cheap 200 all our system it
may not capture that stuff as well as
you spend like a thousand dollars or
five hundred dollars building a better
system but at the end of the day if
you're somebody who does streaming for a
living or you do commentary and that
type of thing you want to get it
completely away from that software bs
now that we actually have a hardware
solution I don't think I'd ever want to
turn back and record any of the footage
did you guys see on that type of the
solution so I'm Eric you guys been
watching techni tomorrow like usual
they'll be linked down below that like
button for you get to check out all the
different stuff that we've done inside
this video so you can reproduce the
drill to yourself or choose to do
something a little bit different to suit
your personal need hope you guys liked
the video if you like what you see tank
you can sub and I'll see you guys back
here again on Tiger tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
