Tech damar we bring you all the tech all
the time now you guys all know that we
were at CES last week we brought you all
kinds of great coverage but you guys can
see we're back at my house in my
beautiful backyard in sunny California
where it is actually sunny now I don't
know if many of you guys out there have
upgraded from your standard hard drive
to an SSD but the time has never been
better and you get all kinds of benefits
from running an SSD then running a
standard hard drive first of all low low
failure rates mechanical hard drives
have moving parts that stuff can break
you can drop it all kinds of damage
limited warranty the mean time between
failure on an SSD though is unimaginable
so you get much faster boot times much
faster access times totally quiet all
around a better thing now 20 months ago
fourme introduced the first one terabyte
SSD in the 2.5 inch form factor now 20
months later we see them introducing the
world's first 2 terabyte SSD now this
thing is going to be nine point five
five millimeters in thickness it's going
to be really fast according to all the
rumors that we've heard so far
now you guys always know though when
these drives come out they're gonna be
hella pricey I mean the more
awesomesauce you pay for the more
awesomesauce comes out of your pocket
but this comes across as a good deal for
you guys why is that well when these
drives come out that's gonna drive the
prices of all the other drives down to a
much lower price factor so in the link
in the description below we're gonna
show you guys all the best deals that
you guys can pick up I'm picking SSD
technology you can get stuff for
sometimes under $1 a gigabyte that's
right under $1 gigabyte for the latest
greatest technology now this thing will
probably hit the market in the next few
months like I said it's going to be
extremely pricey but for those people
who are looking for the top-of-the-line
stuff and the most edgy technology well
this is the most edgy shitdick you're
gonna get your hands on so make sure you
guys check out the link in the
description below we have all kinds of
links to great prices on SSDs because
it's never been a better time to upgrade
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
