Tech Oh tomorrow to bring you guys a
latest product release from the people
at Swift tech I'm with their chairman
Gabe Roshan and today we're going to
show you a brand new product now this is
the first concealed or enclosed liquid
cooling kit that you can take apart and
add more parts to so we're going to show
you like a full demo on all kinds of
really cool stuff showing you it against
the competitor and an other system so
here's mr. Bhushan I'm gonna turn the
table over to him and he's introduct
this new product to you folks
hello guys well what I'm going to show
you today and this is essentially our
main campaign we are going to show you a
system that bridges the gap between
current all-in-one systems closed loop
closed loop and full-on custom loops so
remember that because this is our theme
today bridge the gap between all-in-one
and closed loops because the system can
be used by both novices and by custom
DIY users and the price is actually
pretty well isn't right this
Thanksgiving worth about 129 139 139 95
and you can actually take it and add
your components to it so unlike having
one of the old school ones you can take
this add your video card at extra
components on it refill the unit and
continue going and actually once the
unit is sealed it's supposed to last for
about two years so that's not bad
okay three three years okay so they've
extended the life more and excuse me on
that so now we're gonna go over folks
we're gonna show you some systems and
show you this product against the
competitor so let's go across the room
and begin the demonstration so here you
have it dock
that's the new h2 20 C PU cooler from
swift AG now what you see here is
exactly what you get in other words it
comes exactly like this
prefilled with the coolant all you have
to do is the fans as you can see already
pre-installed even the fans we don't get
another all-in-one coolers you have to
assemble the fans for example all you
have to do is attach it to the top of
your case or to your phone panel if you
have access if you have a case that
allows this connect the four screws for
the CPU and you're in business
so installation on this is truly
plug-and-play the plugin may portion of
it connections you just connect your CPU
cooler to this little PWM splitter all
that system is PWM control connect your
two fans to this this to the motherboard
and the entire unit is controlled by the
motherboard so there is no need for
extra software essentially put the
settings in the BIOS computer surest and
if you want more fine tuning use the
motherboard supplied software such as it
comes with every major motherboard
manufacturer asu's MSI gigabyte and
forgive me if I forget someone okay now
you may have about month month and a
half ago we released the h2o 220 led CPU
cooler and it comes with a dual 120
millimeter radiator and the famous
Apogee Drive - CPU cooler which has
essentially that mCP 35 X pomp right now
that kid sells for 239 at retail in
contrast the Swift take it sells for 139
at retail how is that possible well
let's talk about it talk about the
radiator first
essentially there is no difference
between these two ideas
the core is exactly the same it's the
same 14 FBI Fein count all we did was
reduce the length a little bit so in
other words we reduce the size of the
reservoir and we reduced we installed
swivel fittings here all together with
saving a few millimeters you can see
compared to the alleged compared to the
original NCR 220 both are copper core
radiators what else did we do well
compared to this guy we thought about to
learn about the Venant novice users and
here we design the side channels so that
in case you want to use a longer screw
you're not going to poke the channels
and damage your radiator it's a small
detail but it's important because we had
more than once users who with these
earlier generations actually destroyed
every year by using off the market our
aftermarket screws by mistake
very nice swivels also that allow you to
orient the product pretty much anywhere
you want so so far what do we see really
no difference in terms of the radiator
now let's talk about the fans well the
fans are the same they are the helix 120
millimeter pto prevent fans for the same
fans that came with the elite kit so far
no difference now let's talk about the
CPU cooler itself because this is really
where the difference comes in play in
the apogee drive - it is no secret that
we have been using an OEM pump that we
do not manufacture
that we have that pump is as many of you
know made by Lang it's marketed under
the swift tech brand and we have been
doing these for over 10 years now but
it's still not the pump that we actually
manufacture ourselves whereas with the
h2 20 cooler okay
we manufacture this product entirely
ourselves three years ago I decided that
I wanted to get into the manufacturing
into the electric motor manufacturing
business and we hired the people and we
invest into equipment so that we could
actually get the best possible pricing
and best possible cost for pump and it
took us three years to develop it now we
developed the product in with our
initial goals and the still our current
goals to be to have a very high
performance product in other words we
could have made a very low-power pump
pice oriented cost oriented but we
didn't we wanted for this product to
bridge the gap between all-in-one
coolers and custom coolers and the only
way to bridge that gap is to use a pump
that has enough power to drive
additional devices in your loop in other
words that pump is capable to
accommodate one two graphics graphics
card liquid cool graphics cards up to
two or three radiators like we saw that
capture you know in the next few minutes
all right so we're capable of driving a
multiple number of devices thanks to the
power of that pump for reference that
pump is a six watts pump whereas the
pumps offered by the competition about
1.2 watts if I'm not mistaken so it is
five times more powerful
and we also design the pump to be
extremely quiet and we also design it
for very high shelf life for reference
again the self life on the mCP 35x the
end what is called the MTBF which is
mean time between failure is 50,000
hours the self life on this product is
66 zero thousand hours $60,000 so it is
a high very high reliability pump
forgive me okay
every detail in this product has been
considered sort of very carefully to
satisfy novice users but also to satisfy
custom users and everything in between
so now I assume you're a novice user you
install that product you are down the
line you want to buy a graphics card
liquid good graphics card or something
like this you want to add a radiator for
every reason what do you do all you do
is loosen that screw here on that clamp
pull out that Club take the tube out and
that's it you connect that tube to your
graphics card or another tube put
another piece here link the two you're
done and here is the field port where
you can actually empty or we feel you
liquid cooling loop okay just by
loosening that cap here bring it up with
fluid okay and we'll have on our website
a full installation get not installation
but maintenance guide you probably video
video taped also that will show novice
users and other users how to do these in
details but it's very very very simple
now what else comes with the product in
terms of mounting systems just about
everything
every desktop processor Intel 775 11 55
56 1366 comes with that backplate now
2011 ok and also all AMD a.m. 2 a.m. 3
FM FM 1 FM 2 etc processors comes with a
pocket all you have to do is remove that
screw screw the back it on you're done
it's two minutes operation so everything
has been thought of to make it very easy
for just about every user ok one last
detail that I want to show you if you
take a look those those of you guys who
know the AP DD AP the apogee drive tool
which is quite famous for being a very
high performance product this is the
same base plate the same configuration
it is stéphanie it is exactly the same
so we use the same form factor okay as
the famous Apogee drive - the only
difference is the pump now let's move on
to the second part of this demonstration
where we are actually going to show the
unit in operations live operations with
several systems that we put together
here so here you are gentlemen ladies
and gentlemen where we've set up four
complete systems in operations to
demonstrate both the ability of our
cooler towards the competition and the
ability of a cooler for custom loops
custom operations so let me tell you
about these four systems number one
there are four identical cases and this
is the Nanak's ya ds1 case and we have
chosen this case so thank you to nano
Kia for sponsoring this we have chosen
this case specifically because of the
German engineering and the fact that it
is a very quiet case it is all padded so
we wanted in during our demonstration to
be able to demonstrate silent operations
and we find this case particularly
appropriate for this kind of demo okay
so for Nanoka cases the next sponsor is
a soos and thank you Asus for providing
for Maximus 5 motherboards which is that
motherboard that has that beautiful
little via on chipset cooler that can be
used with air or that can also be used
for water cooling and so that is the
reason why we chose it in addition to
the fact that these boards offer the
tremendous amount of TWIC ability and
stability
our third sponsor in this roundup was
Kingston and we want to thank the people
at Kingston for providing the memory and
for provide the HyperX memory and the
HyperX SSDs ok and our fourth sponsoring
this bill
schoolmaster thank you cool master for
providing four of their latest 1300 watt
power supplies and the reason why we
chose them is because they are also
extremely quiet and very powerful power
that we needed for our sli setup here
which is a final sponsor our partners at
EVGA thank you EVGA for providing two
gtx 680 hydro copper as well as three
gtx 660ti s that are on air so these
three systems of cpu cooling only and
the graphics are air cooling the last
system is CPU and graphics and chips
liquid-cooled now what about the CPU
cooling the first system is thermal tech
water 2.0 the second system is a corsair
h 100 i and the third system is the
swift tech h2 20 now conditions of this
test we want to be able to read the
temperatures and be able to see
approximately what temperature
differences are or I forgot about the
CPU sorry Kawai seven 3770k overclocked
at 4.6 gigahertz Intel processor
obviously ok all these machines are
overclocked by the push of a button on
thanks to the Asus software we did not
tweak the voltage or anything like this
just push the button 4.6 gigs or for
them so that we on equal ground with
respects to the thermal load okay so got
thermaltake got the h2 20 now we placed
load on each one of these machines using
cpu burn six eight instances forgive me
of cpu burn and every one of these
machines is running at 1,400 rpms and
speed the thermal tag 1,400 rpm is the
lowest fan speed that you can get on
silent mode the maximum speed on the
thermal tech unit is 2200 RPMs on the
Corsair unit also the minimum speed is
in there quiet mode at about 1,400 rpm
except the higher speed is 2700
in contrast the Swift tech unit lowest
speed is 800 rpm and the highest speed
of the fan is 1800 rpms for this
demonstration this step of the demo
we're on all four systems at 1400 now
let's move over to the temperature
controller here okay so here we have a
temperature controller that summarizes
the CPU temperature of all four systems
and we can see here that the Swift a
cage 220 we measure a 10 minutes average
temperature okay 10 10 minutes it means
that it's been averaging the temperature
of the course for the past 10 minutes so
excuse me you see the Swift a cage 220
at seventy seven point five okay
then you see the thermal take water 2.0
at seventy eight point two you see the
Corsair H 100 I at 81 and you see the
Swift a cage 220 plus the two gtx 680 s
and the chipset cooling running at 82
degrees and what we observe is the five
degrees difference approximately between
the swift a cage 220 just cooling the
CPU and the Swift egg h 220 cooling CPU
and graphics two gtx 680 s and the VR
cool so here you go here you have it
that's the type of performance that you
can expect on these units compared to
other units available on the market now
this is the next step of our
demonstration here and in this step what
we are going to do is have you listened
to the maximum noise level of each units
so right now we are looking at the age
to 20
we have tuned the fans and the pop up to
their maximum speed respectively 1800
rpms for the fans and 3000 rpms for pump
and I'm going now to be quiet and let
you listen to what it sounds like at
maximum speed
so let's move over to the coast area 8
100 I here and now what we gonna do we
can turn it on at full speed and let's
go ahead and do that so that we can hear
the sound level
I think we had enough of the noise
levels so let's let's now move on to the
thermal take unit and listen to the by
the way these fans were running at
twenty seven and a hundred rpms and
that's the reason why they are fairly
noisier than the other fans and I found
out okay okay so now let's go ahead and
put the thermal tech unit at its maximum
noise level maximum speed of 2200 rpm
okay so I think we have a good idea of
what the speed of the assist of these
respective systems is at when running at
maximum noise level and the next step is
in our demonstration is going to be at
running in silent mode now earlier in
that presentation we already know that
at 1,400 rpms both the course area and
the thermal take unit we already at
their minimum noise level so I don't
think there is a point to redo that so
the last step of this demo is going to
be running Swift Tec H 220 in silent
mode so let's go ahead and do that now
here you have it the age to 2009 in
silent mode we do have a little bit of
ambient noise in that hotel maybe some
background air-conditioning but I'm
going to be quiet now and I'm gonna
maybe you can try to get as close as you
can from the unit and see if you can
hear it we do advertise that this
product is inaudible as installed and
when you're sitting a foot away from it
go ahead and try to try to pick up some
nose
now the next part of this demo I want to
show the capabilities of the system to
become a full-on custom liquid calling
so we've seen so far CPU cooling we've
seen the thermals they are pretty good
we've seen the noise or with herb or not
herb in some cases the noise now how
about the guy who starts up with this
system and wants to obtain so here we
are showing an edge to 20 which is
calling the vias and which is calling
two gtx 680 and let me open up that case
so that you can see that in more details
so you can see here how the pump how the
radiator is going to the water block
from the ASUS Maximus five out of the
water block out of that water block into
the CPU cooler then the CPU cooler goes
to the vga 680 the first one and then
the second one and then back to the
radiator so with a single-edged 220 we
are actually calling to high-end
graphics calc water cool graphics cards
now the system is running right now and
as you can hear it's running really
quiet
now temperature-wise morning Phil milk
which has everybody knows is a the most
intensive testing program somewhat out
of the real world but essentially what
we've been seeing running running Phil
mark temperatures on these two cards at
max level about 60 degrees see all that
cooled with at h2o 220 and an
overclocked processor at hope in six
games so it is fairly reasonable and it
haunts very stable and in the last
portion of this presentation let me lead
you to the crown of this presentation
the full custom loop as is built by many
enthusiasts users and let me show you
what we've got here we have the cooler
master stone topper Thank You cooler
master for covered in this case for this
demonstration as well as the cooler
master 1300 watts power supply the
motherboard is an MSI and we have two
radians HD
7900 Komodo HD $7,900
is the processor is an intel socket 2100
block to 4.5 gigs and thank you kingston
for providing the HyperX memory so now
let me open that case so that you can
see what I mean by full on custom
so what we have in this loop we start
with the age to twenty calling system we
drive to first Brittany on HD 7970 on HT
7901 dual 120 radiator at CMC up to 20
QP and then another dual 140 millimeter
radiator that CMC our 240 QP so with
that pump we're driving three radiators
and two graphics cards in crossfire mode
so let's take a look at some of the
temperatures that we get as an example
in that food custom system we are honing
here at the Haven benchmark and we can
see that these 79 70s are running at
about 51 degrees C which at full load
which for all intensive purposes is very
very good we can also look at the
temperature the process temperatures
although under this benchmark the
processor is not placed under any load
except the full score ok so what's
important here is the graphics but
what's most important is the fact that
the H 220 calling system as delivered
can be used as a CPU only system and can
be fully expanded just like a custom
system would be to drive multiple
devices in the loop and all this at
either very very silent operations
inaudible operations or reasonably quiet
in full
at full speed at the cost of one 3995
I hope that you enjoyed this
presentation and sorry if I stumbled on
the world sometimes but I'm not a video
guy doc is the man for that but thanks
for thank you for the time and attention
that you spent listening to this alright
folks so there you have it you guys have
seen the demo you've seen the product in
action you guys now know that the Swift
tech H 220 is beating the competition
and it's also very quiet as well you get
a three year warranty so that means
three years maintenance free use of this
Swift tech product right Gabe absolutely
alright and one thing it's really cool
that is one of presses you guys can use
this thing as a closed loop system no
maintenance whatsoever but if you want
to add other parts to it you can drain
the system reconnect it refill it and
put whatever you want it into this
system correct yep so that's it folks
this thing is coming to market about 139
and we'll see you guys back here on tech
of tomorrow for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
