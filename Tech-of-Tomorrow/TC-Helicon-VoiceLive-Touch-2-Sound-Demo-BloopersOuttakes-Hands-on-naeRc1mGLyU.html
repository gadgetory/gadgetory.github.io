Amaro Channel I'm a refresh your host
and I've got a very very deep voice cuz
I'm a big bad bat mobile frame
welcome to the channel take em to MA hey
guys Elric here on tikka tomorrow here
at NAMM now once again we're seeing
craig from TC Helicon we saw him last
year we saw some of their VoiceLive
products now this year they have a new
voice light product which is
incredible
you guys will hear when I do all the
voices but now we're like great give us
a quick overview and tell us some the
great features about this new product
thanks awesome to see you again this
year a year here already drench a number
of ramen so and that is awesome that's a
good good sign
so let's go over this is a voice live
touch - so it's the predecessor they
this is the second set in the invoice
lifetime series yeah the next-gen
basically what happened with voice live
touch was people started using it in all
these crazy ways that we didn't
necessarily anticipate and sort of
coming back to us saying you know be
really cool but had this a really cool
of it had that can you make that happen
for us and we were actually able to put
a lot of those things into it so first
thing right off the bat if you put this
giant screen on it and the other one had
a little LED display is a little hard to
end it on that kind of they're really
easy to see yeah so it's a lot like that
voice like playing GTX I showed off to
you last year it's got the very like
graphical editing and that kind of stuff
so you can go through all these pages of
a fax and get in there we also decided
that the hit button that we had on the
voice light playin GTX was really cool
as well you know you just want to push
one button have a bunch of effects come
on a bunch of effects go away so we set
up the same thing on here you can kind
of just make a little matrix of effects
for yourself saying let's make you have
a bunch of preset up again I'm going to
adjust them to how you like them first
exactly exactly exactly and with one hit
of a button you could say add a harmony
or take away a reverb or something like
that so sort of on the fly you can
manipulate stuff now I actually had a
chance to play with this yeah it sounds
so much even better than the previous
generation just yeah all the effects
sounds so much more cleaner
nice we always work on the algorithms to
try and make everything as good as it
can be and we've made some tweaks and
adjustments to things like to make it
sound more natural and to try and sort
of tweak the effects to be better suited
for voice and you know we're always
moving forward in that way so it's
really cool one of the other really fun
things we did with this will be
introduce slider effects so the last
version on the last touch you could use
the slider to you know select presets
and make changes and stuff on this one
you can actually use your finger to
change effects on the fly right so you
can actually we really messed around
with that earlier because so much fun
that you're showing how it is yeah for
sure you so literally ask my finger
slides across the bar here you can see
how this this is moving what a funny
little face right exactly so it takes
circle and sweeping through it together
going on yeah so we really wanted to do
a lot of things that were sort of a bit
different vocally you know something
maybe a little bit more extreme so we
see people using ableton or some sort of
other you know backing track that they
might have tempo sync with this so you
can hook this up now to able to live on
a backwards rack and do your group same
absolutely always be incredible do one
single USB in for the audio and the MIDI
sync and then it all goes out audio
through this thing so you know if your
tracks run along and your delays are
flying off they're all going at the same
time everything synched up together the
loops will be synced up so we made them
easier to use they actually the button
presses get get quantized so that they
really the Greek this yang is the best
thing for somebody to sit on out and
rehearse their vocals it's the balls
yeah you're either your vocalist you
want to practice along to sing along to
a song this thing has so many different
effects and so many even things in it
you can almost sound like that singer so
if you can sing this is a really cool
toy to have a ram it really is it'll
take your performance to another level
altogether right on man we're gonna jump
in it okay show you so spoofing thank
