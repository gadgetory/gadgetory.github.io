in my hand is a mousepad and it's pretty
cool it's actually 320 millimeters by
400 millimeters it's got a really
ultimately cool surface it's soft on
your hand and it's also supposed to
track with your mouse very very well I
know it's a mousepad but hey it's 20

signed by white raah now I'm gonna bring
this thing up here a little bit closer

himself white Rob so here's the stuff
now some of you guys say that you like
to see me throw stuff at the cameramen
so for those of you who like this I'm
gonna aim it right the camera hope I
don't the lens because that'll screw
things up it'll be better visually if I
can get as close as possible so camera

pretty good job there he's getting
better at this yeah alright so here we
go it comes in a nice big bag we're
gonna pull the old mousepad out of the

back of it pretty much it so this thing

comments for say five days and in five

four or five months because some of the
companies didn't send their stuff out to
