Tekkit of our I'm mark your host and
we're here with buddy the dog our
co-host now what are we doing well you
guys all know we built the brand new
wind lion totally custom white
hackintosh / pc now this thing was a
totally cool build but we had to
actually make some initial changes to
get it up and running and if my voice
sounds like I have a frog I apologize
I've been actually sick of the dog all
week long and still doing these videos
for you guys so check it out right off
the bat when I was trying to build this
thing the pcie from ocz the boot rod is
going to use would not recognize the mac
OS x at all so i couldn't get it to run
with that whatsoever so i had to pull
that thing out and we switch it out for
an a data 128 gigabyte em SE 2dr which
we partitioned in two different sections
we used one for the mac OS and one for
the windows so that's good to go we also
had to change the video card the EVGA
one that we were planning on using it
actually would only work over on the Mac
Pro for some reason could not get it to
boot in the PC whatsoever so we gave up
and I just got one from gigabyte that we
had that we use another build that's the
wind for sedition so we put that one in
there everything's actually totally
working great now this week we're just
going to talk to you about some of the
things that we did first of all how we
overclocked it we overclock the CPU to
4.2 we just changed it very simply up
the voltage ever so slightly we also set
the XMP profile of the memory to 2133 so
what's running faster than hell actually
we really increase our geekbench score
man it went from 13 802 over 16 k in
scoring which is actually amazing just
from a simple couple changes because a
lot of people when they build their
systems they don't overclock it at all
and a lot of times forget to set the XMP
memory profile but we show you how doing
that really makes a system kick more ass
another thing that we had just a slight
problem with i'll call it a wee problem
i won't call it a total problem it's the
audio now inside we're running Windows 7
absolutely no problems whatsoever but
once we did all the drivers and this
makes no sense whatsoever by the way
you're going to agree makes no sense
remember there are two different
partitions but as soon as we install all
the drivers on to the PC sooner we start
the computer back up in the macworld we
got audio but it only came out of the
rear audio jack so we went out we bought
this new force really cool headphone amp
really small thing sounds great it's USB
works in both absolutely flawlessly and
hey it's actually a really great
headphone amp so if you got some really
you know hi um headphones you want to
listen to it this thing actually kick
some ass anyways from what I've read
them from what I've heard it seems like
most hackintosh users actually prefer to
use an external audio source USB seems
to be very popular also if you guys
would like to pick one up you guys can
see that right below that like button
which I know you're going to hit and you
can pick one up for yourself now as far
as media goes and storage check this out
we used a pair of kingston hyperx 3k 480
gigabyte SSD s14 the scratch for the mac
one for the scratch for the pc and as
far as the media storage goes we took a
single two terabyte drive split it in
half so that each system had one
terabyte of media drive now I know I see
a lot of people like they made a lot of
negative comments about the thermaltake
level 10 GT I don't know why guys
because I dig it for one thing all of my
drive bays are right here very simple
once you do the wiring the case anytime
you want to change any drives do
anything add or subtract anything it's
all right here and if your motherboard
has hot swap ability hey it's even
better you guys all know I use the
gigabyte that's the z77 ex UD 5h that's
a really good motherboard it's like one
of the highest recommended for building
heck anti systems and the reason you're
able to do this is this particular
motherboard has a dual BIOS system which
allows you to not have to use the DS DT
to boot up your system now I know a lot
of you other guys we're asking about the
key thing about turning it and I
initially wanted to do that as a
hardware mob but it ended up that we
just didn't have to do that whatsoever
now when you first put the system up if
you don't touch anything at all it
automatically boots into OS X 10.8 point
three mountain lion but if you want you
can hit the Nek most of you guys have
the any key on your computer don't you
where is the any key and once you hit
that any case
you gave an option of choosing whatever
OS you want to do simply by scrolling
through as you can see here you can boot
easily into windows 7 or easily into the
mac OS very simply easy dual boot system
it rocks we'll bring you guys another
update next week is we actually compare
all the scores against other machines
and then we'll jump into the pc side of
things and see how this thing kicks ass
in gaming so me and buddy will see you
later make sure you hit that like button
and I was laughing some guy goes oh man
he's all it's not fair if you say that
you're gonna make buddy the dog sad if
we don't hit the like are you serious
come on we're like just joking around
here man we preach it you hit the like
button and no we do not make money off
you hitting the like button are you
 kidding me we like interaction
with you folks that's why we kick down
you guys why would you 100k system why
we're giving you guys stuff some of you
guys got no sense of humor but hey me
and buddy the dog we're off to do some
kung fu fight alright and one last thing
folks before me and Buddy hop out of
here make sure you guys check out the
surprise deal of the day in the lake of
