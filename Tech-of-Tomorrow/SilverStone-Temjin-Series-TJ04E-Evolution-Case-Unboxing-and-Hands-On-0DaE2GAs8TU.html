dimensions 214 millimeters wide x 480 9
millimeters height x 490 millionaires in
depth let's go ahead now it's actually
begin to actually unboxes baby alright
folks like user we're going to take a
couple knife cuts to get into the box
the first one's going to be right here
with some cool sound effects you guys
can hear as i go across this thing
that's cut number one cut number 2 is
going to be down the very center go
ahead and take the knife down here cut
through there we go working out nicely
now alright then pop that off to the
side as well now this can be very easier
very difficult to take out the thing i
know you do it ok done boxing so much
fun you're trying to maneuver around
without hitting the microphone in the
cameraman fun stuff fine the stuff these
are the days i go up hopefully i won't
hit the microphone oh yeah i'm able to
clear it so there we go here is the box
and sign effects on now i love this
alright so here we're going to take a
look at the accessories pack got the
trusty knife out again couples cuts here
hope it won't cut my hand up i'll go
away for me just to be on the safe side
lots of stuff comes in so so as we jump
into the accessories pack wrap the bat
we have cooling fins you can see they're
all going to be mountable these are
gonna have something to do with the
cooling inside of the case i don't know
yet like i said this is the unboxing
discovery video first look thing it does
however come with two of those they're
inside of here you can see there until
these little tiny little white packs
right here and there are two of these
also got some other nephew stuff in here
got some wiring harness plug stuff as
you can see right here these are for
your power for your SATA lots of those
right there eight altogether in fact so
it's pretty nice
cable management as well this is a three
pin header for USB 3.0 you have a couple
different options to use on this one we
also have all the bolts and all the
accessories all that good stuff last but
not least in the box we have the TJ 04 E
manual so that's all the stuff that was
basically the accessories pack don't let
cover that too much now let's go ahead
and start removing the outer parts of
the case go ahead and put that there
take this off their feet on the bottom
sole now builders go ahead make sure
didn't come out of plastic that way but
it does so let's just go ahead let's do
a cold cool and boxing let's start off
here right on the bottom we can see we
have removable mesh screens right here
so all the dust that's being pulled up
into your cases your airflow goes
through it will be caught on these and
not all stuck inside your case you can
wash these very easily that's pretty
cool I'm kind of liking the way this is
going now I'm going to flip it over
alright so there we go case is
completely out of the box so here we go
we're going to start at the top of the
case you can see the two USB 3.0 ports
are here for those guys you asked yes
they are compatible with both the old
USB one point 0 and 2 point 0 you have
your headphone and your mic also here on
top on top here is another fan bay i'm
just going to kind of angle that salty
for you guys to see it this is filtered
as well I believe it's removable I don't
really want to start popping too much
stuff off of it right now but I believe
this might be removable yes it is i SAT
right here so i guess i will do it there
you guys can see it it's completely
removable there's a fan right here like
we talked about 120 millimeter the
optional one is not there to go ahead
and put that back moon all the way take
a look at the very front of the case you
can see them one two three four bays
right here these ones you're getting to
put your standard CD drive in or
whatever or if you get an adapter you
can put something else in there like a
floppy you start your restart button or
down here along with your HDD and power
button
it's all this right here very clean my
silicon design show you guys this side
will quick there are two screws removed
on each side one here another here these
are completely to list in the design you
can just use your hand they're not even
very tight in there which is nice
they're just holding it's good but
they're not very tight I like that get
sometimes hard to get off also know that
you take note of we have another fan
screen here so I'm going to go ahead and
pop that off you guys can see there's
another one of those 120 millimeter fans
right here with once again the option to
have another one but it's not there all
right that was excited you have to do
anything okay now we simply removed the
side door there's plenty of room back
here for your cable management my hand
can very easily fit all through here
there's no sharp edges whatsoever
motherboard tray is not removable but
take a look at how much width there is
right here you'll be able to easily
access your CPU to remove it or AP
whatever else you need to do and get it
out there Kelvin's can also be very well
because you have all these holes right
here now there's not any rubber grommets
on those some of you might complain
about that it's not really that big deal
to me the biggest deal to me is being
able to actually hide all the cables and
I believe you're going to be able to do
that very well plenty of room back here
no sharp edges here's 120-millimeter
Fowler talking before it's sitting right
here the nice plug here's the additional
wiring harness they go to see your front
stuff go ahead now I'm going to move
around show you guys the rear once again
120 millimeter fan there are two things
right here you're using liquid coolant
if you want to these were actually metal
plates as well so i'll go ahead and pop
this hair if you want to use them you
can remove them otherwise they just stay
in here i think rubber grommets would
have actually been better but this is
the way they designed it and it's been
pretty good so far there are a couple
things it could have been better rubber
grommets hearing the inside of the
flight here's all your rear stuff this
is well your video cards are going to go
once again here's your power supply goes
two screws one here on top one here on
the bottom
once again we get the bag and let's take
a look at this with my ear folks
remember we said there are two different
models this is obviously the e w model
it comes with a nice clear window I
always think that's a plus I think most
of you do unless you're having a system
that's like totally quiet you're going
for totally like noise reduction I like
to have a window it shows off the shits
inside your case and if I'm gonna take
the time to make it radical I
want to see it I think you do too all
right we'll move out of the way flip it
around here let's take a look at the
inside inside here take a look at rock
about this big huge metal handle right
here this is very interesting this whole
side piece is supposed to be removable
this does look though however like you
have to have a tool to do it here that
you can carry it by this you guys know
my unboxing I don't do anything box into
like a self-discovery video so I'll be
figuring this out you actually put
something into it all your drive bays
right here all are lockable so you just
put a drive in there we can close this
back up and it locks your drive in there
you don't need any screws or anything
else pretty good design down here at the
bottom these are where you can put all
your SSDs so up here wasn't even matter
you have all your SSD storage you can
put right here looks like even put four
of them in right there there's lots of
space up here inside of the case as well
here you guys can see the inside the
case it's really hard to get the camera
deep inside of it looks like you're just
moving crazy in there but this is it you
guys can see it so overall there's lots
of room for everything in here let me
just flip it around guys it's totally
clean and elegant lots of room inside of
the case there's not a removable back
plate which you can easily access the
CPU as I said through this little hole
right through here but overall I gotta
say the new tengen tjo for evolution is
a pretty nice looking case it has decent
features all the way around Kayla manage
looks like it's going to be good that's
about it guys this has been the unboxing
thanks for watching take them tomorrow
we will see you back here
