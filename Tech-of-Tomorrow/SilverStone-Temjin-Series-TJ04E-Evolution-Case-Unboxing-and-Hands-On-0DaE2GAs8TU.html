eighty nine millimeters height by four
hundred ninety milliliters
in depth let's go ahead now let's
actually begin to actually unbox this
baby alright folks like user we're gonna
take a couple knife cuts to get into the
box the first one's gonna be right here
with some cool sound effects you guys
can hear it as I go across this thing
that's cut number one cut number two is
gonna be down the very center go ahead
and pick the knife down here cut through
there working nicely now
alright then pop that off to the side as
well now this can be very easier very
difficult take out the thing I know you
do it so much fun you're trying to
maneuver around without hitting the
microphone in the cameraman fun stuff
fun stuff these are the days I go up
hopefully I won't hit the microphone oh
yeah I'm able to clear it so there we go
here is the box and some effects on I
love this shit alright so here we're
gonna take a look at the accessories
pack got the trusty knife out again
couples cuts here hope it won't cut my
hand off I'll go away from me just to be
on the safe side
lots of stuff comes in this so so as we
jump into the accessories pack wrap the
bat we have cooling fins you can see
they're all gonna be mountable these are
gonna have something to do with the
cooling inside the case I don't know yet
like I said there's just the unboxing
discovery video first look thing it does
however come with two of those they're
inside of here you can see there's all
these little tiny little white packs
right here and there are two of these
also got some other nephew stuff in here
got some wiring harness plug stuff as
you can see right here
these are for your power for your SATA
lots of those right there eight
altogether in fact so it's pretty nice
it's gonna help cable management as well
this is a three pin header for USB 3.0
you have a couple different options to
use on this one we also have all the
bolts and all the accessories all that
good stuff
last but not least in the box we have
the TJ o4e manual so that's all the
stuff that was basically the accessories
pack
don't let cover that too much now let's
go ahead and start removing the outer
parts of the case back there take this
off their feet on the bottom so now
builders go ahead make sure that you
come out the plastic that way but it
does so let's just go ahead let's do a
cold cool boxing
let's start off here right on the bottom
we can see we have removable mesh
screens right here so all the dust
that's being pulled up in your cases
your air flow goes through it will be
caught on these and not all stuck inside
your case you can wash these very easily
that's pretty cool I'm kind of liking
the way this is going now I'm gonna flip
it over alright so there we go case is
completely out of the box so here we go
we're gonna start off the top of the
case you can see the two USB 3.0 ports
are here for those guys you asked yes
they are compatible with both the old
USB 1.0 and 2.0 you have your headphone
and your mic also here on top on top
here is another fan bay and it's going
to kind of angle that saw a few guys to
see it this is filtered as well I
believe it's removable I don't really
want to start popping too much stuff off
of it right now but I believe this might
be removable yes it is like right here
so I guess I will do it there you guys
can see it it's completely removable
there's a fan right here like we talked
about 120 millimeter the optional one is
not there go ahead and put that back out
of the way take a look the very final
case you can see we have one two three
four bays right here these ones you're
getting to put your standard CD drive in
or whatever or if you get an adapter you
can put something else in there like a
floppy you start your restart button or
down here along with your HDD and power
button lights all this right here very
clean nice elegant design show you guys
this side will quick there are two
screws removed on each side one here
another here these are completely tools
in design you can just use your hand
they're not even very tight in there
which is nice they're just holding it's
good but they're not very tight I like
that get sometimes hard to get off also
know that you take note oh we have
another fan screen here so I'm go ahead
and pop that off you guys can see
there's another one of those 120
millimeter fans right here with once
again the option to have another one but
it's not there all right that was
excited you had to do anything okay now
we see if we removed the side door
there's plenty of room back here for
your cable management my hand can very
easily fit all through here there's no
sharp edges whatsoever motherboard tray
is not removable but take a look at how
much width there is right here you'll be
able to easily access your CPU to remove
it or AP or whatever else you need to do
and get it out there cabinets can also
be very well because you have all these
holes right here now there's not any
rubber grommets on those some people
might complain about that it's not
really that big deal to me the biggest
deal to me is being able to actually
hide all the cables and I believe you're
going to be able to do that very well
plenty of room back here
no sharp edges here's 120-millimeter
Fowler talking before it's sitting right
here with a nice plug here's the
additional wiring harness they go see
your front stuff go ahead now I'm going
to move around show you guys the rear
once again 120 millimeter fan there are
two things right here if you're using
liquid coolant if you want to these were
actually metal plates as well so I'll go
ahead and pop this here if you want to
use them you can remove them otherwise
they just stay in here I think rubber
grommets would have actually been better
but this is the way they designed it and
it's been pretty good so far there are a
couple things it could have been better
rubber grommets here in the inside of
the flight here's all your rear stuff
this is well your video cards are gonna
go once again gives your power supply
goes two screws one here on top one here
on the bottom
once again we get the bag and let's take
a look at this one right here folks
remember we said there are two different
models this is obviously the e W model
it comes with a nice clear window I
always think that's a plus I think most
of you do unless you're having a system
that's like totally quiet you're going
for totally like noise reduction I like
to have a window it shows off the shit
that's inside your case and if I'm gonna
take the time to fucking make it radical
I want to see it I think you do too
alright we'll move that out of the way
flip it around here let's take a look at
the inside of the side here take a look
at Rock about this big huge metal handle
right here this is very interesting this
whole side piece is supposed to be
removable this does look though however
like you have to have a tool to do it
here that you can carry it by this you
guys know my unboxing I don't do any
good unbox it into like a self-discovery
video so I'll be figuring this out and
you actually put something into it all
your drive bays right here all our
lockable so you just put a drive in
there and close this back up and it
locks your drive in there you don't need
any screws or anything else pretty good
design down here at the bottom these are
where you can put all your SSDs so up
here wasn't even matter you have all
your SSD storage you can put right here
looks like you can put four of them in
right there there's lots of space up
here inside of the case as well here you
guys can just see the inside the case
it's really hard to get the camera deep
inside of it looks like you're just
moving crazy in there but this is it you
guys can see it so overall there's lots
of room for everything in here let me
just flip it around guys it's totally
clean and elegant lots of room inside of
the case there's not a removable back
plate which you can easily access the
cpu as I said through this little hole
right through here but overall I gotta
say it the new Tim gen TJ oh for
evolution is a pretty nice looking case
it has decent features all the way
around Killman looks like it's gonna be
good that's about it guys this has been
the unboxing thanks for watching tected
tomorrow we will see you back here in
moscow next time comment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
