2014 here at the a data booth now we're
gonna move over to their SSD section
where they have some really cool new
products including the mg FF m2 which is
a brand new next-generation form factor
M to drive that is going to work like a
PCI card directly into a motherboard
that actually you stick a motherboard do
a few modifications if it's an 8
Hardware modifications to work so let's
jump over here and let's take a look at
some of this stuff like amy has been
making SSDs for quite a long time now
this is some of their older products
including their xpg line of memory you
guys have seen that over here we have a
gigabyte motherboard and here's what's
the really interesting technology right
here now this thing is going to run at
1,800 megabytes per second unbelievable
speeds it's just incredible and this is
the new ngf fm2 technology now current
motherboards won't be able to use this
but like I said with eight changes to a
motherboard and I believe that other
sizes will be working with everybody so
you'll be able to get this technology
very soon we also have a new proposed 2
terabyte drives can be coming out the XS
930 they also run at 500 megabytes per
second and it's one of their new product
lines I really look forward to seeing
this can you imagine having 2 terabytes
in your SSD you'll be able to store
anything you want all your games all
your music everything here is just your
standard PCIe SSD you guys can actually
see the difference between this one and
that one that one over there has a lot
more stuff on the side right here
compared to this one which is actually a
why it's running a lot faster here we
see some more of their xpg memory you
guys have seen this we use this in a lot
of our test stations and then moving
down here we have a lot of other
products but your guys going to see but
this one like here is actually really
really interesting this product right
here is going to be used in smartphones
tablets all that kind of stuff and it
goes up to 128 gigabytes and it's
everything all-in-one controller
memory the whole shebang all inside of
this little thing right here really
incredible stuff you guys have seen this
right here I've used in a couple of my
builds as well as this one
I actually used a actually quite large
one and what if I built you guys
actually so I'm moving down here we see
some more their technology and then some
