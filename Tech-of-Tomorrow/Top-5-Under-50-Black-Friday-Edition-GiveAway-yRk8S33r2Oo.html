by J&amp;amp;L real happy holidays everybody
welcome back once again to TECA tomorrow
now what's better than a top 5 video
we'll check it out it's a top 5 video
that's a giveaway as well everything
we're going to show you today we're
gonna be giving away to you the fans so
with that said let's check out the top 5
for under $50 here on TECA tomorrow
and then let's give all those prizes
away to you the great fans
let's check this shiz Nick out the
cheerson cx-10 w is a little mini drum
that's totally killer for flying around
your house having fun outdoors and
chasing other dogs and cats and all that
stuff and it's so small it'll basically
fit in the palm of your hand I mean
check this thing out and you guys saw it
took off from the top of my head so this
thing's really cool what's really nice
about it is it operates off your phone
so if you're used to playing video games
and all that stuff on your phone you are
gonna be right at home with this little
baby because it flies up that completely
no other remote control comes with it
nothing else you just charge it up
install the app and then you're up and
going and like I said this thing's cool
because you can fly this indoors as well
as out in fact I'd honestly have to say
that this is kind of more for my style
and indoor drone because you can fly it
on your house fly it around the rooms
and as you're doing that you're still
practicing getting better if you to fly
those bigger drones like we've shown you
before so I think this thing's a really
killer product anybody who gets this
they're gonna be happy with they're
gonna have a lot of fun it's only 35
bucks and I'm sure we're gonna have
coupons for Black Friday deals for even
more so there you have it man a mini
drone lots of fun for you under 40 bucks
funds where it's at baby now this next
item is actually something that's really
useful especially if you're on the road
a lot and you're going places and you
need to jump and you can't get a hold of
triple-a well then hey the Energon P for
this thing is gonna be pretty cool
because it's the flashlight it's a
charger for your cell phone and it'll
also double as a charger for your car so
if your battery's all dead
connect these bad boys up to your
battery and up to a 4.0 liter engine can
be jumped with this and it actually
works pretty well the other day I had a
guy from triple-a come out he actually
jumped my battery because mine was
bigger and he wanted this so bad that he
bought it from me on the spot I was like
hey man I still got to do my video he's
like hey I live around the corner I'll
come back but it charged his car and did
his car perfectly he put a dead battery
inside of it hooked it up to his car and
boom it started up on the first try so I
have to say it does work and for the
price it really can't be beat so if we
need a flashlight need something it'll
charge up all your USB devices your
laptop and all that stuff and it can
recharge really easily in the P for
something you're gonna want to take a
look at so to use the P for to jumpstart
your battery it's very very easy there
are two ports on the front you simply
plug in the two wire connectors into it
connect it to your battery and boom
you're up and going further charging you
can see there's a port on the front for
USB then you guys can obviously see the
little lens in the front that doubles as
the flashlight personally I think this
is a very very nifty item it doesn't
totally fall under like computers and
stuff like that but it's still tech it's
USB driven it's for your car it's
flashlight it charges everything come on
can it be a pen it's cool right now I
don't know about you but I'm a person
who's constantly on the move I'm either
going places picking things up going to
the post office going to the gym doing
something all the time and if you want
to listen to your tunes all the time on
the go then having a pair of headphones
that are really nice sound good and
won't break the bank is a great idea
today we're looking at a pair from I
speckle and I think you're gonna like
them because they're under 30 bucks they
sound great and have some great features
the Icicle earbuds feature bluetooth 4.1
connectivity 80 PTX clear sound they're
waterproof and they're sweat proof so
matter whether you're in the gym
sweating or you might actually fall into
water jump in the pool you're gonna be
okay with these headphones they'll still
keep on going and what's really nice
about them as well as they have these
nice ear hooks you guys can see these
right here and the ear hooks connect on
your ear so if you're jogging down the
road bouncing around doing pretty much
anything except we're like probably like
jumping off a building you're gonna be
ok with these they're not gonna fall off
your ears they stay on very well and I
know a lot of you people out there are
exercising a lot and doing that kind of
thing you're doing sit-ups and all that
kind of stuff
won't have to worry whatsoever about
these and the fact their sweat proof and
waterproof is a really good thing like I
said you sweat a lot in the gym you
don't want your headphones getting all
kicked up with gunk and looking like
crap
it's just gonna be nasty and the designs
not bad as well you guys can see on the
outside of each little earbud there's
like a little bit of design which is
kind of cool
most things are just like a plain simple
color but at least there is some kind of
design for this and for girls out there
and stuff who like design stuff they'll
probably appreciate this more than men
but it's still pretty cool controlling
the ice buckle earbuds is also very easy
on the cable you'll see there's a little
control unit now this control you know
doubles a couple of things you have
volume up and down and then you have
track forward and reverse as long as you
hold the button down and in the very
center of that you have your
connectivity button as far as
connectivity goes you can connect to any
type of Bluetooth device whether its iOS
whether it's Android if it's smart and
it's got bluetooth you can connect to it
and as far as charging knows the unit
does come with a charging cable a
carrying case and some extra ear buds
and to charge it there's a little
charging port located right on the side
of the controller the icicles are
currently on sale for $26.99 and I'm
sure we're gonna have Black Friday deals
making them even lower if you're a
person who does a lot of traveling and
you spend a buttload of time inside your
car chances are there's been times where
you've needed to charge a USB device and
you need to charge it fast well this
device by axe Gio will do that very very
quickly it features two connections by
Qualcomm which are both USB 3.0 and it
also comes with a Type C cable so you
can even charge those devices all you
have to do to get the ax to you up and
going is simply plug it into your
cigarette lighter in your car and voila
you're up and going then you just plug
your USB devices into the unit and
you're charging so you can do this any
time with your cars running with your
car sitting still and it's a really
great thing it'll charge everything very
very fast and for under 17 bucks it's a
really cool item I think many people out
there who actually do a lot of traveling
will appreciate this other people were
doing over car and something that don't
be like yeah okay that's whacked so I
guess this particular product depends on
the need if you need something like this
this can definitely fill that slide and
make you a happy camper and if you don't
you're just like WTF but anyways it's
cheap
it's nice and since it comes with both a
micro USB and type C cable you're ready
to go automatically alright folks before
we jump into my favorite of the top five
products let's check out the product
from our sponsor the J and L headphones
the J no.1 or 3s are wireless Bluetooth
earbuds that feature wireless
connectivity and also a magnetic
function which is really cool because
you can take both the earbuds click them
together and lock them so they can wrap
around your neck and be out of the way
completely if you don't want them in
your ears the J no 103 s are also sweat
proof so if you're in the gym running or
doing any of that kind of stuff you
don't have to worry about the sweat
getting all sticking at ruining your
earbuds e another cool feature is if an
important phone call comes in you can
get hands-free calling using the J and L
103 s many of the other earbuds that you
see on the market feature a six
millimeter or an eight millimeter driver
but the J no 103 s feature a larger 10
millimeter driver for better sound
clarity and better highs and better lows
earpieces are also made of matched
aluminum and have a really nice dark
grey look to them they're also one of
the lightest weight headsets you can get
in the market coming in at point zero
six ounces with a rating of IP x5 the J
no 103 s can withstand sweat rain and
even a little splash of water the 103 s
also come with a carry bag USB charging
cable and extra earbuds to suit your
ears and currently these beauties are on
sale for under $30 the syma x5 HC I have
to say is a 10 out of 10 in the fun zone
and honestly my favorite of the top
fives today when we did the drone baby
that we showed you guys just the other
day we are flying this on around the
park at the same time and I have to say
that this is probably one of the
absolute best drones you can get for
learning it controls very easily it's
got modest stuff to work with you don't
have to be a super genius to get it
going it's easy to control it doesn't go
so fast and so far that kept to worry
about it flying two blocks away not be
able to see it plus it doesn't have that
room you know a little cool little home
feature so you don't want to do that but
all in all I just think this is a great
product the controllers nice you guys
can see simple drone it's made out of
plastic has all the you know standard
lighting and all that stuff on the
bottom and all that stuff you know
for a drone the battery installs right
here giving the x5 HC up and going is
very very easy you simply just charge
the battery and after it's chart you pop
it back inside of the drone like so
stick the battery on and back in there
and then after the batteries back in
there you simply close the back up and
you're good to go there's an on and off
button located on the bottom and on the
bottom you also see the 720p camera the
720p camera in this I don't think really
works all that great it works okay but
it's not something to really write home
about this drones more about just having
fun and enjoying your day learning how
to fly it
the controls are also pretty basic and
easy to use you don't have to have a PhD
to do anything to get the drone goi'm
typically turn on the old controller mm
give a little blast here
that's still pretty cool though okay so
like usual the drone is a hell of a lot
of fun even the house although I really
don't recommend using in the house is
good smack stuff things and scares a
shed of your animals but outside this
thing's amazing it does test have the
standard headless mode so you can fly it
wherever you want unfortunately doesn't
have follow me or return reading that
type of stuff but like I said the
controls are very easy to use especially
for a beginner it's not a whole lot of
money so if it breaks or something
you're not gonna like freak out and go
oh my god what did I do
plus you can buy the drone separately
from the controller and get it for even
cheaper we're gonna have the combo pack

these items so if you guys like these
