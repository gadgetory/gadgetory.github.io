tickle tomorrow we're bringing you all
the tech all the time today on the tech
table we have the new gigabyte win force
r9 280x AMD fans I know you guys have
been waiting for this card so without
any further ado let's actually jump in
talk about the features and what this
card is about how it performs at the end
of the day whether it's worth your money
as the unusual
all right folks so like I said when I
reviewed the MSI twin frozen edition of
this card you guys all know that the r9
280x is a rebranded 7970 gigahertz
edition card which as we said before it
isn't a bad thing you still get all the
standard features that you had before
and a few other things you still get the
2048 stream processors now this card has
actually clocked the highest of the ones
that we've seen yet because it's core
clock is that 1,100 megahertz
the standard core clock is at 1
gigahertz so you see you've got a lot of
little leeway there you've got a 384 bit
memory interface with the memory running
at 1500 megahertz so this card's pretty
much exactly the same as the previous
generation card now it does support
though DirectX 11 point 2 that is
something new it's also going to support
all of the things that you've seen the
past I Finity all that stuff you've also
got some improvement as far as using
these cards in a crossfire solution now
there's still some micro stuttering
issues that are going on with multi
monitor technology but as far as single
monitor technology the micro stuttering
has been improved and another story will
breaking for you guys will give you a
little sneak peek you can actually use
this card with a 7970 gigahertz edition
in a crossfire configuration now what
makes the gigabyte card special well
they're wind force cooling is extremely
good cooling it keeps the card running
very cool and keeps the car running
pretty quiet as well now as far as the
cards cooling goes it was pretty much
neck and neck with the MSI card burning
about 1 degree hotter which only makes
sense because it's actually clocked
higher as well so you're getting between
66 and 67 Celsius under full wood that's
pretty damn good that means that this
card is running cooler than previous
generation cards if only by a little bit
and that's always a good thing that's
gonna allow you do better overclocking
because the cooler the card runs the
more flexible the card is going to be
gigabyte like MSI uses all quality
components across the board when they
make their card because they want the
card to last a long
time in your system now as far as the
power connectors go you need a single
six pin and a single eight pin power
connector it's 250 watts of TDP for the
car another cool feature of the gigabyte
wind force card is its dual BIOS feature
meaning you can set one bios for
overclocking one bios for normal if you
happen to miss one of the bodies up you
can always flash it and get it right
back to normal factory settings now the
rear i/o of this is exactly the same as
the very first reference Edition 7970
cards that we saw it has a single DVI
connector a single HDMI and two main
DisplayPort adapters and inside the box
that comes to the main DisplayPort to
standard DisplayPort cable in case you
only have that type of cable so with
that said though let's jump in now check
out the benchmark song which is the
human Zoo written by yours truly and the
staff here at echo tomorrow and let's
check those bad boys out right now
I like oats so there you have it you
guys can see that obviously the r9 280x
is totally kicking ass on the gtx 760
and is going neck to neck with the gtx
770 which is priced at $100 more than
this card now in the beginning we said
this is a rebranded card but that's not
necessarily a bad thing because there
are a lot of new features and vidi has
been known to do this as well and when
you do it as long as you make some new
feature changes improving upon the older
technology that's okay
they've done this here with their new
cgn technology the 11.2 that you're
getting with the DirectX you can run it
with an older car there's a lot of
differences here that are going on plus
it's priced at a hundred and a hundred
and forty dollars less than competing
cards that's right you're going to buy a
79 70 gigahertz Edition last month it
would have been between 100 and 140
dollars more than this card so that's
definitely a solid thing and a winner
for the gamers so at the end of the day
I say this is an editor's choice here
for the AMD fans of those people looking
for a card in the $300 that'll play all
their games at 1080p and even play them
at 2056 by 1440 that's right I'm Miller
we'll see you guys back here in TECO
tomorrow if you missed anything make
sure you check out the link down the
description below with a link over the
full review and if you're not sub hey
there's a little button back here make
sure your sub because we've got all
kinds of action always going on on tech
up tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
