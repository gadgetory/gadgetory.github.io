2013 today with the mirage hotel with
boo who is from the lovely company of
Roseville you guys are familiar with
them we do all kinds of work with them
and this year they have a couple of
great new products that they want to
introduce to you so I'm going to hand
the floor room is taboo and let him talk
about some of their new shoes Nick here
at Roswell all right this is our popular
and very focused item this year this is
the brown full tower go come in black
and white the black will come to red
LEDs down on the bottom the white
version will come with blue this door
will open left to right but it is
suggestible if you install the hinge on
to this side you can have it open for
right to left as well there's a button
down here to allow you to turn on and
off the LED fans of the front there's a
reset button right on top of it under
this corner you might not build to see
that under the angle right up here on
top folks you see them right there all
right and we do constant reduce a hard
drive dock on the very top panel as well
there will support three and a half and
two and a half inches well we have this
shark fin panir nut bitch without more
airflow and for more aggressive look
emails closing down to prevent dust and
getting to your top down of your case
how do you just pop it open again I like
that I like it up myself it's much more
aggressive now what about these two
things off to the side the sliders there
were these two things for them those are
kanga colors there was a blood control
the fans the front in the back I'll sent
all the case hands inside the case and
so all why are you everything's internal
you just took it up and go right that's
right how is like some of the stuff like
dynamite like I is really like about
cable management like how back here in
the back side and stuff for the other
case do you have good cable management I
know that when we took a look at one of
your larger cases the Blackhawk culture
it had amazing game of management I does
this have the same type of features in
it as well yes they were up to maybe I
believe nine grommeted routing tables
and I believe an additional four more so
you have plenty to choose from
throughout your cables now what about
motherboards is a very large case with
the list it like the EVGA SRX
motherboard is it fit that size of
mothers in eatx up to eatx okay now this
is one product you also have another one
that came out called the armor as well
right that's yes they did cases now we
have that one right down here folks this
is another new case from there's this is
the armor evolution so what do we got
going on with this window this is the
first minute tower that we have that can
support etx with USB 3.1 on the front as
well it'll come with a red LED lights in
the front with 2 120's to the top 230 on
the side one in the rear and what's the
price on this one MSRP is one 1999 and
it's currently available on newegg.com
and then what about the throne just pop
back that one how much is the throne
right it has been released yet so we're
still deciding on it but it would be
very similarly structured course teeth
or be too okay looking around 169 179
excellent so another product that they
are releasing they've had before on the
market is a infrared thermometer so
basically you shine a little light beam
out there I out to you guys out there in
the audience you guys can see that and
it measures heats now they've had a
couple models this particular one that's
been on the market right boo yes that's
right and recipe for that one is about
79 99 now they have two more this one
right here and then the dual beam one
which is this one in my hands we got
dual beam here single beam here and this
one also has a detachable flashlight is
that correct correct LED flashlight when
you pull that trigger both will come on
so that's cool stuff over here now is
this product right here I know you guys
had the five Bay Reagan closure that's
this one right here but now you guys
also have an eight day as well correct a
name was introduced before but we've
been using updated model for both five
day in a pain this one will come with
USB to point out as well as a SATA
cantos part 2 3 terabyte hard drive /
treasure so the five day will have 15
terabytes a day of 24 HR 20 thanks so
much now folks let's move across the
room we're gonna do solar security and
keyboards so let's go all right folks so
now we're moving across the room and we
have security systems that you guys
might not know this but Roosevelt makes
all kinds of products from kitchenware
to solar lighting two bags for our
camera which we're carrying around just
an amazing amount of products even
beyond the pc spectrum now this is a
really cool one that we're actually
gonna integrate in our home very soon so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
we have now a 4 8 and 16 model and we'll
have the full of the boost we can tell
you some of the special features about
these units so boo what's great about
these things man well the eight channels
Crowley available right now it will have
two models one with the ccd camera one
with CMOS its course CMOS we have lower
quality images but it would be very
affordable before channel the 16 channel
will be introduced soon into the market
that will both all support 39 Finch
internal SATA hard drive up to two
terabytes and for backup purposes it
will support an external hard drive
enclosure via USB told out to support
and backup your videos and it also also
support an rj45 Ethernet port so you can
log in and watch your videos and back
them up onto your desktop what if you
want to do like off-site storage of your
films does it have that availability as
well would you better look these up
doing system it may be like store your
stuff like off-site instead of being at
your own you over log in via the network
and record your videos onto your guests
up from there okay so good stuff and
what are some of the prices on these
things I know they're not totally I
borders from the ballpark prices on
these you and so people ask don't know
what they are for the hnr out there
around to 49 99 for the 4 and 16 yeah
those have not been discussed yet but
once we have it we share that with you
okay
now since we have these back here
anyways I haven't seen these but I know
that this is one of the things that I've
got here this is the wireless internet
IP camera is correct this is part of our
surveillance fine as well for those of
you don't want wiring around your entire
home we also have a wireless version
both in night vision and daytime this
one here we incorporate five LG's so you
can see and capture nighttime videos and
it will also support motion sensing as
well so once it takes his motion that
either recorded video or picture and
send it to your email now these are
indoor and outdoor as well boom that's
great okay now let's move across them
over here to some of the solar stuff
which if you guys been following the
channel you guys see that we actually
installed these systems at our house so
gonna move over here you guys saw this
i'm not going to go too much on this guy
know you guys have already seen these on
our last video but these things are all
very well priced you've got security
free to your garage your front door
place where there's no light solar
lighting they're like christmas lights
you can use them view like christmas
we're just for decorative in your house
and these yard lights are excellent
they're great for gardening or in the
walkways so do you know boo do you guys
plan on expanding this wine and doing
like a lot more products like that's as
far as being solar power because i
really think these are cool all my
neighbors have come by and made
compliments about my yard since i put
this stuff up these are very very sad
selling very well i'm not new at website
and solar would be something that Rosa
will be considering on expanding in the
near future right on well now let's go
over here to the keyboard because we did
the demo at my house for some reason we
weren't able to get the color keys but I
see that now we do have like we promised
the colored keyboard so can you give us
a demo of the new dual that keyboard
series here sir sure all these keys are
individual it's there will be two LEDs
on the back you can see we've removed
one of the keys this is the cherry MX
blue switch you can see the red LED
there and one switch at over to green so
you can see that when switch that off so
you have a barrage of the key switch on
there and of course we can control the
independent colors for the WASD and the
four arrows so right now there are both
green one switch them over to to read
and it will support up to five
backlighting modes right now in the web
switch that over to system this is the
breathing mode we're going through Louis
to the highest and back down let's
switch it to the lowest setting their
medium brightness and this will be the
maximum brightness and you can also
choose when to switch them off so right
now it's two colors right boots that's a
green and the risk being on the red and
we'll also corporate feature we can lock
in Windows case you can do not activate
them when you're playing a game so right
now since the black lighting is off when
I activated little flash red three times
that you know that the Windows key had
been disengaged so when you press it it
will not take you out of your game and
screw you up alright which is having to
be pulling your leg let's switch it back
on it'll flash to clean three times
three times that you know that it is on
again and if you have two black black
keys on and you do disable that the key
which is simply not be backlit nothing
worse than being in battlefield 3 and
getting kicked out of your hand and a
desk support 12 and kevo liver so more
than your 10 digits ganado o excellent
and when we see right here folks we have
the white version of the new throne
right here you guys can see it's got the
blue lights all to the front of it and
everything yeah you have that fun day
once you push this guy here so try out
that light for more stealth of guilt
roast pork 210 hard drive solid States
