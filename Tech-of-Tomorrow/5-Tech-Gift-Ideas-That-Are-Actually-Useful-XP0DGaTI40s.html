off right there maybe twenty three
twenty two ninety-nine these things are
very low price and you guys know during
the holiday season getting somebody a
gift that's right in that twenty five
dollar pocket is really cool now these
particular headphones are simulated 7.1
headphones but some cool things about
them though are so we take them out of
the box not too much in the box did we
get the headphones I think we get a
little manual right here anything else
nope I think it's just the headphones
now check it out under 25 bucks really
nicely well-made headphones that are
very flexible the pads are very nice
they fit on your head they're actually
pretty light they're not extra heavy
they have a built-in microphone which is
retractable so you can pull the
microphone in and out and the microphone
doesn't him and sound that bad either
and you can use it with ps4 you can use
it with an Xbox you can use it with your
phone it has a button on it so you can
mute it so if you want to answer your
phone or do something like that while
you have the headphones on you can do
that no problem
the audio on these headphones obviously
it's not bose quality but for a gift
that's under twenty-five bucks they
definitely do the job so if you know a
kid out there who's looking for some
headphones he just wants to game have a
good time be able to talk to his friends
out there and you're not even sure
whether he has a ps2 an x-box a pc you
don't understand what this kid got well

those things so there's no problem
whatsoever so if he's gonna game on his
pc he's gonna play with his xbox or his
ps4 all that stuff that's connects to it
if he wants to use it with his phone
doesn't matter what kind of phony hands

off when the woman he wants to talk to
the people he can mute it when he
doesn't want to deal with stuff so all
in all for the price these are a great
deal they're very flexible they're
adjustable the headband on them is very
very comfortable honestly these are an
editor's choice product if I was gonna
do a video and do just a top five just
on headphones under $25 these headphones
right now would definitely be included
so if you guys are interested check
these out we'll have a link down below
you can get some for yourself this
company has been around a long time
they've sold like I think like 800,000
sets of headphones they're one of
Amazon's choice products so if you're
looking for something like I said under
25 bucks a solid gift and you don't know
what that person has welp guess what if
they're a gamer of any caliber these
will work with them now this next
product in a lot of ways it's similar to
the other product that we just took a
look at them what do I mean by that well
this particular product is brand-new
from creative and it's the brand-new g6
deck now this thing is a really nice
product 130 DB 32-bit 384 kilohertz DAC
that's right stereo simulation was 7.1
audio really neat thing plus like I said
it'll work with your xbox it'll work
with your PC it'll work with your
PlayStation which is just like the
headphones that we took a look at
previously it'll work with all those
same things so if you know somebody out
there once again who's an audiophile and
you want to get them a really nice gift
this is a really really nice product
that everything the engineering behind
it it has technology built inside of
it's no matter how
the sound gets then it doesn't distort
it'll work with anything all the way up
to like audio grade headphones so if you
have like 600 ohm headphones that's
gonna power those it's also it'll go all
the way down to low to that um excuse me
all the way down to lower ohms all the
way up to that so depending on the
different types of headphones that you
have it's going to automatically adjust
to those type of headphones so if you do
have really good you know studio grade
audiophile headphones it's also going to
power them now here's a little box right
here for the g6 I'll go ahead and just
pop the cap right here and get that out
of there very very compact unit really
really small right here in my hand just
let me see what else comes in here in
the box I don't know what else is in
there looks like there's a something
let's see yeah we pull the king here
okay yes there are a few more little
things that come inside of the box we've
got a a USB cable so we got a USB cable
right here
and then we also have an s/pdif cable
right here this is an optical cable
really good stuff so if you have optical
speakers you can hook this up directly
and get digital sound digital sound is
really really killer for music and games
it's okay but honestly for music if you
had those type of speakers this
connection is the absolute best you can
have now the controls and everything
this particularly unit are very easy to
use they're all right here on the front
you've got a push button in right here
an adjustment switch right here as far
as your inputs and outputs go you have
headphones you also have a mic those are
located right there on the front and on
the back you see the USB charging port
you also see the line in and line out
ports on the right hand side you'll
notice that there's three different
buttons the first one is your Scout
button the second is SB X and the last
one is your gain and on the right hand
side you can clearly see if this unit
supports Dolby Surround but like I said
earlier in the video that surround is
actually a virtual 7.1 unless you
actually have a set of headphones that
have that many speakers in them
everything's gonna be pretty much
simulated 7.1 there are some you know
headphones out there that do have that
inside of them but there's not really
that many now additionally inside of the
box with the unit you get a little bit
more paperwork you get this
tiny like sales guy this little X thing
and then last but not least this giant
manual down here when you get over here
this giant manual in every language you
can imagine so there you go now like I
said this is for an audiophile person a
person who really wants to have the
highest quality audio so if you know a
person out there who's really into their
music and they like something they can
stick in their backpack take wherever
they want to go you know on the road
wherever they want to go they can take
this with them it'll plug into your
phone it'll plug into your PC no matter
what type of you know outlet that you
have this unit will work with it which
is really good now the g6 comes to
market a little bit under 160 dollars
but if you know someone out there who's
told into their music and they like
something that's portable the hell like
I said it's really small it'll fit right
in your backpack it'll fit almost this
in your pocket and you can take it
wherever you want to go if you got your
headphones Hey you're good to go so
pretty much if your person wants to
cruise the beach go to the mountains
wherever you want to go you've got a set
of headphones that you like and you
really think they're audiophile quality
you can take this your phone and that
and you can listen to the high-quality
music wherever you're at on the go like
usual we'll have a link down below if
you want to check out more information
about this product for yourself or just
get one for that person in your life
who's is an audiophile music freak is
this thing on
no just kidding so check it out many
people out there have TVs most of us
have TVs I'm sure there's a few people
out there who live in a cave or you know
they're up in the mountains or something
just don't have a TV but I think most
people out there today own a TV and with
that said many of the TVs on the market
including some of the TVs that are
higher-end the speakers that are inside
of them let's just face it they suck
they're not very good they're either
tinny or they make your TV shake I mean
there are obviously a few brands of TV
out there that do have you know good
sound that's it built inside of them but
a lot of times you get a TV and you
start listening to the sound you're like
wow I can't hear the voices and so in
order to hear the voices you keep
turning it up and then when the music
comes on the music's so loud that you're
like your neighbors want to call the
police on you and think that you're
having a giant party at your house you
guys don't I'm talking about like your
string to hear people talking but
as soon as the music comes on our
commercial comes on it's like well I'm
your face you're like oh like wow what's
going on hit the remote the remote so in
that case the solution for that is
getting a nice sound bar now today we're
gonna be looking at one from blitz whoof
now this is a really nice particular
sound bar for many different
applications if you have a TV and it has
you know sound that you don't like or
you have a PC you just want to have a
sound on your desk or if you have a
phone and you just want to connect to
your phone and listen to your music in
your room it'll work in all those
different capacities the blitz wolf is a
35 inch 60 watt 2.1 sound bar that has
bluetooth 4.2 connectivity so if you
have any type of Bluetooth devices no
matter what it is or there's a TV like I
said before your phone or any other
device that will hook up automatically
to that plus if you want to hook it up
to your TV there's also connections for
coaxial there's also s/pdif and there's
also USB so depending on the type of
device there is a connectivity that
you'll be able to connect it up to and
then get up and going to it now as far
as the sound goes being that at 60 watts
this thing actually pumps out a lot of
sound and it also has a pretty nifty
little remote control for operating it
so you can sit back on your bed chill
out and adjust the volume on it now when
you're using this particular product
with your TV the voices and everything
are much clearer to hear then like I
said on a lot of standard TVs it just
stands out a lot better the music is a
lot better and overall the sound quality
is pretty good because you have to you
know separate 30 watt speakers in a
subwoofer all pumping out the sound and
the design of this particular speaker is
it has like a cavity a chamber inside of
it which acts as a bass resonator so
these speakers not only have good
clarity they have a lot of bass to them
as well
I like this particular product it's
about 175 dollars right now maybe it'll
be even some better deals coming on
Black Friday but for right now that's
what it's at it's actually a pretty good
price I've listened to some others from
Kenwood and other brands that are like
in the five and six hundred dollar range
and the sound really wasn't that much
different whatsoever than this product
by blitz whoop
so like I said if you're out there you
know somebody who just like to have a
one single sound set up which means if
you know you have your PC and you just
want to sound bond your desk you don't
mess with anything else you can use this
for the application if your TV the sound
sucks you can use it for your TV or if
you have a phone and you just like to
come home and listen to some nice music
this thing's very very unobtrusive you
guys can see I mean it's very very nice
the design and everything is very very
clean on the back you have all of your
connection ports very very simple to
hook up everything's laid out well and
honestly the design is very nice it's a
quality design overall the look of it
everything is pretty high-tech now as
far as what comes in the box beyond just
the product itself you do get the sound
bar like I said the remote control that
I was showing you a minute ago then
there's an additional box right here in
this additional box you've got all kinds
of different plugs you've got USB
connectivity
you've got RCA connectivity in fact
you've got a couple of different coaxial
art RCA cables even comes with the spit
of cable and there's also just for
hooking up to an audio source right here
so if you just want to hook it up to any
kind of audio source it has this little
tiny mini jack you're good to go what
else is in here
and also the users manual so do you got
any questions about how to use it how to
hook it up it'll all the inside of this
little book so there you go know
somebody who needs a product like this
it'll be a great gift for Christmas that
is for sure like usual I will have a
link down below so you can check one out
for yourself or buy one if you feel the
need all day long people sit in further
desk whether they're working in front of
their desk whether they're playing on
their PC you know you spend a lot of
time sitting on your butt playing on
your
and we all know that a lot of chairs
that are all completely leather or PU
leather in that kind of stuff they make
you sweat quite a bit and having a chair
that's a mixture of both that and mesh
makes you're sitting and experience a
lot better now the only thing I can say
to endorse this chair is that my cousin
came over and visited me and before I
even had a chance to finish this video
that sucker took my chair I mean he
truly he was like oh I love that chair I
gotta have that chair he wanted that
chair so that chair from auto fall is
now bye-bye
luckily though we did get to film all of
the good you know nice b-roll about that
chair though before he took it so let's
quickly take a look at this very nice
chair from mono faux it has a really
nice design you guys can see this
particular one is in blue particular
product comes to market right now at
about two hundred and eighty dollars
it's just as compatible though as any of
the higher-end chairs that you see out
there it's very comfortable to sit in it
has a very nice headrest it has a lumbar
support it's very easy to adjust you can
take the chair and adjust it all the way
back the head the headrest itself it's
very comfortable so if you want to lay
back in your chair and get comfortable
you can do that as far as the side rails
they're pretty adjustable they're not
fully completely 3d but they're but
they're very nice and adjustable anyway
so you can get it per door it's pretty
comfortable um a lot of the chairs out
there that I sit in I feel that they're
really just too hard and too stiff kind
of like we know you talked about that
you know the girl going in the port you
know one's too hot once you cold ones
just perfect I believe this chair is
pretty much right in the middle of all
of those things it's a very very
comfortable chair it's not too soft and
it's not too hard it's right in the
middle all the stitching is very quality
on this chair it has a very nice
five-star base the wheels are very well
made so whether you're sliding across
carpet or across a hardwood floor
you want to have trouble maneuvering
around in the chair all the controls for
the chair are located on each side of
the chair so no matter what type of
adjustments you're doing you just simply
click the controls you can go up and
down back and forth you can spin in a
circle if you want all those options are
actually on the chair another nice thing
about this chair is even though you're
not going to
looking at the back of the chair those
people sitting behind you will be forced
to look at the back of your chair and
this chair looks really really nice kind
of looks like an arrow pointing down in
a lot of ways this particular chair the
design of the color reminds me a lot of
Tron if I was gonna do a room build on
Tron based stuff I would definitely want
to have this chair in my room and like I
said my cousin Adrienne came into my
house and I have a lot of gaming chairs
in my house and after sitting in that
one and playing in that one he was like
hey man I really want this chair so I
mean that to me is kind of a pretty you
know good endorsement for the chair it
sits right in there in the middle price
ranges about $279 it's not six hundred
dollars it's not a hundred and fifty
dollars but honestly most of those
chairs that are like 140 150 dollars
they're not anywhere near as well-made
is this the very fact that you get all
of that mesh in the chair so if you're
sitting in the chair for a long hour
you're not going to get up and your
backs not gonna be all sweaty and
uncomfortable you know from sitting in
the chair for long periods of time it's
comfortable its mid-range price if
you're looking for a really quality
chair that's not gonna break the bank
and still bring you a nice chair we'll
have a link down below where you can
check out more information by one or
just check it out for yourself
now last but not least on today's
products at first when this company
reached out to Matt the product I
thought about it because I've got one of
these products before and I kind of
scoffed at it because it really didn't
clean my carpet as well as I thought it
would the previous robot vacuum I I had
it worked okay but when I got my hands
on this one over here and this one's
pretty neat too the little d-bots one or
something we're gonna be checking out
today it actually cleans on hardwood
floors on marble floors and guess what
yes it even cleans on carpet and it's
very easy to use you just charge it up
and after it's charged up you set it on
two different settings in a way it goes
now you can set this thing to
automatically go around your house clean
the whole house and if your floor is
completely cleaned off of everything
it'll work really really good it'll
simply go around the entire house until
it covers the entire house
unfortunately it won't climb stairs at
this time I believe that module is
coming up in the future or it just you
know jet lifts and flies up to the
second floor and begins its mission but
that virgins on the jet
inside of things and we just haven't got
there yet but for now if you're a single
story thing it's all flat you can do the
entire house just off setting this up
and what's really crazy is check this
out I had a lot of cords on my floor and
even though the cords are on the floor
this vacuum cleaner was still able to go
and vacuum it kind of would pick the
cord up for a second but then it would
go on its merry way and leave the cord
so even if you're a person who kind of
has some cords on the floor it'll still
actually do your floor they'll probably
be a few spots where it just can't get
past it
because as you can see it won't really
go past those particular cables but I
mean if you have to have cables wherever
you're doing it you still want to get it
clean this particular product will
actually do it and it will do a whole
house before you need to actually change
the filter out now the filter is located
conveniently right here on top so on top
you just pull this little thing out
right here and you empty it out and like
I said even though this isn't enough to
like do days of vacuuming if you use it
quite up and and set it on like an
automatic thing it would be great so
pretty much you could charge it a couple
of days a week just let it run on its
own your whole house will be clean it
really really does work well especially
on the hardwood floors it picked that
stuff up really good and also
interesting thing is there's brushes on
the bottom of the unit on the unit
there's a bunch of different brushes and
a scrubber as well so not only you do
you get the brush that brushes all the
dirt up and it actually pushes it up you
get these two other things that if it
brushes up and makes it to go away it
actually spends it back and makes it go
up into the vacuum cleaner so it's
actually really efficient and charging
up the d-bots is also very easy it
actually comes with its own little
charging station which you just plug it
into when it's charged up you're good to
go as far as controlling the d-bots it
can be done in a couple of different
ways on the top of the d-bots you'll see
there's a little button that says auto
on so you can actually turn it on it'll
start automatically working once you
engage that button but if you want to
have full control there's actually an
app that you can download either onto
your iOS or Android device and
completely control the vacuum through
there you can set up parameters you can
set it up to do whatever you need it to
do and it'll do it all through that
particular app which is really cool so I
mean even if you're not home and you can
still be connected to your Wi-Fi at home
you can access the vacuum so you could
literally be in New York and all of a
sudden go my god I need to vacuum my
house I got guests come on coming over
engage the app vacuum your floor and
before they get there the little rowboat
guy will do its job for you now this
particular product is a little bit
pricey it's about four hundred dollars
but there is a lot of advantages to this
like I said if you're a person all right
let's just go another route even like
particularly right now I cannot walk you
guys know that I had surgery on my foot
which is one of the reasons also I kind
of took this product because I figured
okay upstairs it's not as cluttered as
it is down here and for me to get my
vacuum being done this little thing
right here works perfect because it does
work on carpet very well so if you're a
person out there you're crippled or
whatever and you have a floor that's
clean and stuff but you still want to
keep it nice and clean this product is
still simple to use all I got to do is
just make sure you change out the filter
and keep all that stuff clean and it'll
give you probably a long long long long
life of usage has a pretty good warranty
to it so the company's pretty easy to
work with Amazon actually has sold a lot
of these particular products obviously
it is kind of a niche product it's like
hey you know either you need it or you
don't but in a lot of cases having this
ability and it to be automatic to vacuum
up your house and do all that stuff is
actually really really nifty like I said
at the beginning I kind of want to Scott
that it didn't think it would work as
well as it does but it does work very
very well so I'm Eric you've been
watching techno tomorrow
like I said Black Friday is coming
tomorrow today's Thanksgiving Day for
all the people out there America I wish
you guys the very very best god bless
you for all the Native American people
in the world or I'm and I don't mean it
that's offensive I don't mean it anyway
because I know they don't want to like
to be called Indians I think that's more
offensive so all the Native American
people obviously god bless you and I
hope you were having a wonderful time as
well with your families and everything
you deserve a lot more than you have
I'll just say up from the bottom of my
heart you should own a lot more of
America than you do because this is
really your country that's just the
bottom line of it past all the
or any name try not to get emotional but
that's really it this land belongs to
them we are really all just guests
I'm glad to be here so thank you very
much everybody stay out there say Stape

your family and if you're looking for
