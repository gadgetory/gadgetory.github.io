gtx 980 now let's take a look at a
partner card the zotac now this card is
the amp omega so it's the end-all be-all
of overclocking cards and it has some
pretty amazing features so with that
said let's jump in and let's see what
the zotac and Omega GTX 970 is all about
now like I said folks this is not a
reference base card at all this card is
completely aftermarket starting off with
that ice storm cooling you guys can see
the two fans right there on top we spin
the card around you guys can see they
clearly have the zotac name emblazoned
right on the side of the card now one
thing that's really different about this
car though is instead of having two
6-pin power connectors this has two
eight pin power connectors and that's
gonna actually help a lot in the
overclocking design of the card if we
flip the card around the back you guys
can see it's got a lot of cool stuff
including their power boost technology
and in the OC plus which you can do live
overclocking via USB so this is
something totally different that ZOTAC
is implementing in their cards now there
are a couple of facts that you guys are
gonna want to pay attention to before
you go by this cards you want to make
sure the dang thing is gonna fit and
that you have the proper power supply to
do so now this thing is a three slot
design that's right it's really really
big but under those same things this
card is also going to be able to
overclock much better because you're
gonna have a lot more Headroom in your
power another thing for the question
gets thrown out there because I know you
guys are going to ask this on launch
date and Vidya provided all of the 980
cards for all the reviewers around the
world but all the nine 70s were provided
by all their manufacturing partners so
on this launch date all the reviews
you're gonna see on nine 80s are all
gonna be referenced and all the nine 70s
are gonna be non-reference which is
still pretty cool for those of you who
watched the 980 video earlier most of
the features on the 970 are exactly the
same you still get the four gigabytes of
memory the same memory speed same
256-bit memory interface some of things
are going to be different however are
gonna be your core clock your boost
clock and obviously your cuda cores the
model that we're looking at today which
is the ample Meg
it has a core of 1102 megahertz and a
boost of 1241 megahertz the standard
version has a core clock of a thousand
seventy six and a boost of 1216 the
memory clock speed is also higher on
this car than the standard 980 on the
980 you had seven thousand megahertz on
this card you have seven thousand forty
six megahertz of memory clock speed so
it's an itty-bitty bit faster now
mentioning CUDA cores
the GTX 980 has 2048 and the GTX 970 has
sixteen hundred and sixty-four taking a
look at the connect a TS card you can
see that features three display ports a
single HDMI and a single DVID connector
alright folks so there it is all the
features speeds and fees but now let's
get to the heart of matter and what you
care about most the benchmarks
hi folks so there you guys have it
launch day for Nvidia's new 9 series
cards this is the zou Tech and Omega
Edition you guys can tell it just by the
way this card's built with all its
cooling its dual eight and power
connectors this thing is for the power
user who wants to overclock their card
and with that said I think this cards
gonna do very well in that arena and
will actually the video on that a little
bit later on as we actually work our way
into getting familiar with these cards
we actually had like literally 48 hours
with the card the driver to bring you
guys all these reviews it was the
literally shortest time period before
launch that I've ever seen in my life
and probably why you guys are watching
this video I'm probably in the middle of
the second keynote at game 24 at Nvidia
so I'm Mel our caretaker tomorrow thanks
for watching all the pricing
availability everything else about this
car will be downloadable that like
button so if you guys interested in
pushing this card or just checking out
more stuff about it it will be down
there if you like what you see and you
want to see more than hey makes your

killer stuff going on here on techo
