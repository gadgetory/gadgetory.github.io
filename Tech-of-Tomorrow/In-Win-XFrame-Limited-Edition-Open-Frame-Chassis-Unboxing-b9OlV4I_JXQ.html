alert Faris your host back here in the
Tecla tomorrow YouTube channel 3 you
guys I'll look at something that's
actually really cool now
not many people out there probably gonna
buy this and this isn't a review sample
either I'll just say us through out the
bat so if you know the review is about
throats how the hell'd this guy get his
hands on this thing nope I didn't get
his review sample actually my friend
Jerry works at Biostar I was like
cruising walking through his office I
looked over to his destiny had this
really cool thing sitting on there so I
was just like what is that thing and
he's all what's the X frame from in when
we bought it to using a road show so I
was like come on bitch lend me that
thing cuz I want to take it home and
show people it so he was like whatever
bitch then take it and so like I went
alright whatever bitch I took it and now
I'm bringing it to you guys so without
anything else let's jump in let's check
out with this new ex frame is
what the new x-frame is is it something
that you can actually build your
computer on so that you can show all the
parts out in the public you can easily
use in your home taking on the roadshow
or anything like that this is something
that you can use to show off your system
that's what is if you want to spend the
foreigner bucks on it that's on you
let's just jump in and take a first look
at this new X frame from the people over
at n1 all right folks this is it
basically on the box comes then inside
of it there's another box this isn't
really a totally true unboxing because
the people of Biostar check it out but
it's still pretty cool so anyways I'll
take this thing flip it around the table
do the Box inception thing little box
out hopefully not too big all right
here's a box he'll do some action ignore
that little Boop on the camera maybe we
can edit it out anyways alright so
here's the box and we can see right off
the bat it's got X frame not to be
confused with x-men copyright
infringement there no this is not used
by anybody not even magneto but did
print so inside the box we have stuff in
the box
starting up we've got some velcro stuff
here can play mega nut slide around some
screws HDD drive screws by all those
screws to keep your stuff in for now
I'll toss this off to the side nice
little sound there lovely sound effects
then once again I'll do the flippy box
thing actually all right let's take a
look real quick here folks about what
this thing is set of specifications case
size open frame chassis material 2 to 4
millimeter aluminum metal plate drive
bays in the front 5 point 2 5 by 2 3
point 5 by 3 drive bays on the side 3.5
by 3 motherboard form factor e-atx
12-inch the 13 inch ATX micro ATX so
won't support the giant size some other
boards power supplies is 80 X 12 volts
ps2 front port USB 3.0 by 2 USB 2.0
by two HD audio the i/o expansion spots
PCIe PCI ATP slot times 8 so I guess it
means you gonna be able to put up do 8
video cards or eight things and the
slots on the board when it's built that
is the dimensions pipe with depth 329 by
5 18 by 408 millimeters or 13 inches by
20 point 4 inches by 16 point one inches
so that's basically the thing is I'll
just have the camera focus it on the box
you a nice clean shot of that so you
guys can see it
so now after suicide that box says let's
actually see what's in the box I'll turn
around one more time all right here we
go let's start taking up one little foam
side pen here not take the foam type out
oh we go
all right paddle number two well off we
go we're almost there
getting closer closer now we've got a
nice big plastic bag so it's a don't
want to further show overs back into
over diamonds yeah you know Jimmy I
guess you could do that alright folks up
for a little bit of camera repositioning
you can see we've got the X frame out
here on the table you can see all the
front connections are right up here got
your hard drive LED light USB 2.0 USB
3.0 you've got your headphones and your
speaker on/off button motherboard trays
here on top I'm not gonna go ahead and
disassemble in this video I'll save it
for another one but I will say that
Rodney Reynolds from 3d game out would
be very happy because it does have a
removable 3d motherboard tray big women
kick ass on that right on so that's
pretty cool now these aluminum side
frames right here the biggity x frame
these are also removable as well it's
hard to see I'll try to take some other
shots in that and zoom them in down here
you can see we have all our components
these are all the different things
you're gonna use to put on when you put
your motherboard on here all your risers
and all that type of stuff your drive
bays are down here they have blocking
slots for these put your recipes right
there begin your nice little test
raishin pin and go ahead and just flip
the thing around to the side a little
bit
right here is the removal motherboard
tray things you pop these things off and
as you can see the motherboard tray
comes up I'm not gonna go ahead and
totally remove it it's really no big
deal but it does come on
also these screws right here on the side
you can see these that makes this
removable as well so you can take these
completely off if you want to and you'd
be okay um also they say that you can't
use a really long motherboard I don't
know with these off and some
modification this I think you probably
use any motherboards you want the
further testing I do I guess we'll see
that flipper on the back real quick and
you guys can see here's all the slots
for all your expansion cards good stuff
there looping around the side again
here's where your other drive bays go
for your standard hard drives and stuff
like that once again here's the other
slot to the removable motherboard tray a
cup a little quick tens and then boom
the whole thing comes off flip it around
again one time folks show you guys the
front but that's basically it this is
basically it really are just very very
expensive test station other people sell
these things run a hundred dollars like
I said before this n1x frame is coming
in at four hundred dollars they're not
giving these away as test samples I
actually like I said before the video if
you didn't see the beginning of it for
some reason I actually would just got
this from my friend Jerry and barred it
to do this unboxing so there you guys
have it it's expensive its elegant it's
the inland x frame I know it Farish your
host see you back here on tech of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
