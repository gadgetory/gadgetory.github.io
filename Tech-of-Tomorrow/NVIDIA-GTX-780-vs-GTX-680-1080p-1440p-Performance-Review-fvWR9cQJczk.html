once again to tech tomorrow and our
launch day review series of the gtx 780
now this video we're bringing the table
right now is going to be a pretty quick
down and dirty video but we really know
that a lot of people out there already
own a gtx 680 and you guys are going
like man should I upgrade
why should I upgrade and if I'm going to
upgrade what's it really going to cost
me and what's going to be a difference
right so for you folks we specifically
made this video for you so with that
said let's jump in and let's talk about
some of the differences between the two
cards now first off you guys all know
that the titan is pretty much the
fastest card that you can get in single
GPU technology now cost an arm and a leg
but you know it's the top thing and one
thing about the 780 is it's based off
the gk110 GPU now the 680 was based off
the GK 104 another big feature the 780
has 50% more CUDA cores in the GTX 680
it has 2,304 compared to the 1536 that
you see on the GTX 680 another feature
is a jump in the memory now one gigabyte
may not seem like a lot but it really is
for different reasons and the new gtx
780 features 3 gigabytes of gddr5 memory
through a 384 bit memory interface which
compared to the gtx 680 which only has 2
gigabytes of memory and a 256 bit
interface now before the comments start
rolling in I know that you can get from
some people like EVGA you can buy 4
gigabyte gtx 680 s but right out of the
box you get 3 and you also get all the
new technology that comes along with it
now another difference to discuss is GPU
boost on the 680 you can only use GPU
boost 1.0 but with the gtx 780 you can
use GPU boost 2.0 which offers a lot
more flexibility in how your card
dynamically overclocks itself within
certain parameters right now I'm not
going to go into too much detail about
this but if you guys do want to learn
more about that you guys can check that
out in the full review that you guys can
see down in the description below me
another thing to take note of is power
requirements the GTX 780
requires more TDP requires 250 watts and
it also requires an 8 pen and a 6 pin
power connector the gtx 680 has 195
watts of TDP and requires two 6-pin
power connectors so you may want to make
sure that your power supply supports
that if you're thinking about doing an
upgrade so now that we've seen the
differences on paper between the gtx 780
and the gtx 680 let's jump in and let's
see the performance and see how that
translates an actual gameplay so the
first game we're going to see is
battlefield 3 and these are its ultra
settings we see the gtx 680 at a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 have an
average frames per second of 40 for the
gtx 780 however has 58 average frames
per second the gtx 680 at 1920 by 1080
shows 68 average frames per second and
the gtx 780 at 1920 by 1080 shows 90
average frames per second quite a game
there next up we see Metro last light
now it's set at very high with the AF at
4x first thing is the gtx 680 at a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 where we see
it showing 34 average frames per second
now the gtx 780 the same resolution
however shows 42 average frames per
second now at 1920 by 1080 we see the
gtx 680 showing 49 average frames per
second and the gtx 780 showing 59 a
verge frames per second so you're
gaining about 10 frames per second there
next up Batman Arkham City now we have
the highest settings with 8x MSAA and
high phys X first resolution tested to
2560 by 1440 in the GTX 680 which shows
43 average frames per second now the GTX
780 at 2560 by 1440 shows 60 average
frames per second so that's a pretty
good game there now the GTX 680 at 1920
by 1080 shows 62 average frames per
second while the GTX 780 at 1920 by 1080
shows 69 average frames per second this
is a clear example of how the new gtx
780 performs
at higher resolutions next up we have a
synthetic benchmark this is a 3d mark
firestrike extreme benchmark we show the
GTX 680 scoring 3156 while the GTX 780
scores 4338
let's take a look at Lux mark version
2.0 which does open CL and this is the
Sayla seen here the GTX 680 shows a
score of 593 K rays a second and now
you're going to see actually a giant
rays here the GTX 780 scores 1125 K rays
a second so it's almost double the score
in that particular test now let's look
at BioShock Infinite these are the
DirectX 11 ultra settings now first up
we have the GTX 680 had a resolution of
2560 by 1440 showing fifty eight point
forty nine average frames per second
next up the GTX 780 at the same
resolution showing seventy six point
seventy eight average frames per second
pretty cool jump there now at a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 first off we
see the GTX 680 showing a score of
eighty eight point zero six average
frames per second the GTX 780 however
the same resolution shows one hundred
and twelve point forty six average
frames per second last up but definitely
not the least Crysis 3 and it's high
settings we see the GTX 680 at 2560 by
1440 showing 37 average frames per
second while we see the GTX 780 showing
49 average frames per second so about
twelve frames per second boost it up
there now at 1920 by 1080 we see the gtx
680 scoring 56 average frames per second
while the gtx 780 scores 75 average
frames per second earlier in the video
you guys will notice that i talked about
the TDP differences between the two
cards now let's actually see how that
translates into real road temps first
off we see the gtx 680 having
temperature of 35 Celsius and a maximum
temperature of 72 Celsius the GTX 780 on
the other hand has a minimum of 37 and a
maximum of 78 Celsius so the car does
run a little bit hotter but it is faster
so there you have it folks if you're
somebody who is either an owner right
now of a GTX 680 or you're considering
buying one which by the way the price is
probably going to drop and you guys can
check out all the current pricing down
the link in the description below I
think that it all depends on what you
want to do if you're doing 1920 by 1080
gaming on a single monitor I really
don't feel there's any need for you at
all to need to upgrade this card at all
if you're at that spot you're good to go
however if you're somebody who does have
a giant monitor that has 2560 by 1440 or
1600 resolution then this card will give
you a lot better performance and if
you're somebody who's using multi
monitor technology that extra one
gigabyte of memory is going to really
come in very very handy alternatively if
you're using Photoshop or premiere any
of those programs they actually run a
lot better and you guys saw that even
open sealed performance was actually
doubled on the 780 so depending on what
you're doing I hope this gives you a
guideline of whether you need to upgrade
or not so last up before I booked you on
out of here and go get me some sleep if
you guys want to see pricing and
availability on the GTX 680 or the 780
make sure you guys check out the link in
the description below we'll have all
that stuff and if you guys have missed
out on any of our content make sure you
click on that right here I'm Elric we'll
see you guys back here on teka tomorrow
with more gtx 780 goodness
