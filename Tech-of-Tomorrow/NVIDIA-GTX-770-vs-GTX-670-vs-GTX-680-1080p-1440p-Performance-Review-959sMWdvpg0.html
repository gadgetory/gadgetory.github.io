get your tech fest on early this a.m.
well check it out we've got another
battle for you guys now you guys all
know the new gtx geforce 770 is coming
out today you guys saw so today have the
unboxing now we've got our first battle
now usually we do card against card but
this time we're going to do it a little
bit differently we're going to have the
new 770 verse the a Zeus GTX 670 mini
and a reference model gtx 680 so with
that said let's get in and start talking
about some of the facts here on launch
day alright folks so like I said before
we jump in let's do some clarifications
so for this comparison we're using a
reference GTX 770 in 680 and the asu's
GTX 670 directs to you mini which is a
fully spec in slightly higher clock than
a reference 670 all three cards are
based on the GK 104 GPU the GTX 670
features 1344 CUDA cores where the GTX
680 and 770 both feature 1536 CUDA cores
all three have two gigabytes of gddr5
memory in a 256-bit memory interface but
the gtx 770 has a faster memory
bandwidth of 224 point 4 gigabytes a
second compared to the 192 point 3
gigabytes a second scene on the GTX 670
and 680 also one thing to take note of
the new gtx 770 has the highest clocked
memory we've ever seen to date the gtx
770 also is a slightly higher total gdp
at 200 watts compared to the 195 watt
soon the gtx 680 and 170 watts on the
GTX 670 the gtx 770 used a single 8 pin
and 6 pin power connector whereas the
GTX 670 and 680 both use dual 6 pin
power connectors one thing to take note
of the new Asus GTX 670 mini we're
featuring uses a single 8 pin power
connector and a slightly lower TDP than
reference at around 160 watts now let's
actually talk about the different clock
speeds of the various cards we're using
the a Zeus GTX 670 Mini has a 928
megahertz core clock a thousand six
megahertz boost and features a fifteen
hundred and two megahertz
o'clock the GTX 680 features a thousand
six megahertz core clock a thousand
fifty nine megahertz boost clock and
also features fifty hundred two
megahertz memory clock now the GTX 770
reference we're taking a look at today
has a thousand forty six megahertz core
clock a thousand eighty five megahertz
boost clock and the fastest memory we've
seen yet at seventeen hundred and fifty
three megahertz on the memory clock
another thing just to take note of is
that the GTX 670 mini clocks are
slightly higher than reference and the
GTX 770 features GPU boost 2.0 which is
based on the GPU temperature whereas the
GTX 670 and 680 feature GPU boost 1.0
which is based off the GPU power target
alright so now that we've seen all the
specs and all those different
comparisons let's actually jump in now
and let's take a look at the benchmarks
by the way if any of you people actually
have to miss our last videos we showed
you guys attestation make sure you guys
check that out right here where you guys
can see that if you want to know what's
up with our test station with that said
let's jump into the benchmark song and
let's talk about these scores
first up BioShock Infinite at 1440p the
GTX 770 performed about six average
frames per second better than the GTX
680 and about 10 average frames per
second better than the GTX 670 at 1080p
the GTX 770 performed about nine average
frames per second better than the GTX
680 and about fourteen average frames
per second better than the GTX 670 next
up battlefield three at 1440p the GTX
770 performed about five hours frames
per second better than GTX 680 and about
eight average frames per second better
than the GTX 670 at 1080p the GTX 770
performed about seven hours frames per
second better than the GTX 680 and about
eleven have extremes per second better
than the GTX 670 why we're on the threes
Crysis 3 is up next at 1440p the GTX 770
performed about four average frames per
second better than the GTX 680 at about
six average frames per second better
than the GTX 670
at 1080p the GTX 770 before and about
five average frames per second better
than the GTX 680 and about nine average
frames a second better than the GTX 670
3dmark firestrike extreme the GTX 670
scored 29 27 GTX 680
31:56 and the GTX 770 at 33 86 next up
back into the gaming with the Caped
Crusader Batman Arkham City physics set
it high at 1440p the gtx 770 performed
about 5 average frames per second better
than the gtx 680 and about 900 trains
per second better than the GTX 670 at
1080p we see the GTX 770 performing at
about 4 ever trains per second better
the GTX 680 and about 8 average frames
per second better than the GTX 670 next
up a brand new game under the market
Metro last light we have the very high
settings with AF @ 4 X at the 1440p the
GTX 770 performed about three average
frames per second better than the GTX
680 and about 6 average frames per
second better than the GTX 670 at 1080p
we see the GTX 770 performed about 4
average frames per second better than
the GTX 680 and about 8 ever trains per
second better than the GTX 670 last up
Lux mark 2.0 the sale is scene we see
the GTX 670 at 557 K Ray's a second the
GTX 680 at 593 K Ray's a second and a
gtx 770 at 643 K Ray's a second alright
everybody so there you have it all the
specs the speeds the feeds and gaming
performance on the comparison between
these three cards now to really sum it
up really quickly the new gtx 770 is
pretty much just a souped-up GTX 6 a
what it is and the price is actually
really really awesome on this because if
you think about it this card's coming to
market at 399 dollars so that means that
at this price it's $100 cheaper than the
GTX 680 so think about it you get that
extra performance level you get GPU
boost 2.0 you get all of those new
things that are
they're all for $100 less so I'm
thinking this is pretty much a win
situation all the way around Plus this
card at this price should be a pretty
hot seller alright folks so before you
wrap this up and get out of here I just
hope you guys like the style of video if
so you guys know what to do down there
at the like button like usual any of the
stuff is inside the description down
below and if you guys right now are
impatient you guys want to see the
full-on written review of the new gtx
770 makes you guys check that out right
here or in the link in the description
below i'm network we've got lots of more
stuff coming up here on launch day at
the new gtx 770</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
