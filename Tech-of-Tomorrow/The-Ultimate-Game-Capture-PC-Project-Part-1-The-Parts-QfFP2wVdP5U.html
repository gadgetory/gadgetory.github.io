with the case we got the CM storm scout
to mid tower case coming in at eighty
dollars next up is the motherboard this
is the msi z87 GD 65 gaming motherboard
coming in at 180 dollars for the cpu we
went has well why not intel i7 4770k 3.4

for memory we've
16 gigabytes of a data xpg v2 ddr3 1600
megahertz memory can be about a hundred
and forty dollars you guys can see this
is some really classy looking stuff as
far as the color goes do you want to
keep it simple we use the corsair h50
520 millimeter liquid cpu cooler which
is ninety dollars the video card also
matches the motherboard that's right so
we got some color coordination diner
don't ever say we don't have style we've
got the msi gtx 780 twin frozr 3
gigabyte video card come in to market at
about six hundred and seventy dollars
like we were saying earlier the a ver
media SI 985 live gamer HD capture card

all of our footage now this thing's
pretty reasonably priced considering
what it can do so one hundred and eighty
dollars right now now folks we know that
nvidia is going to have their new shadow
play coming out and it will capture
video but it's only on nvidia cards it
in fair play we want to be all captain
stuff from AMD or nvidia without any
compromise continuing with the parts for
the power supply we use the XFX pro 750
watt 80 plus bronze power supply the
thing comes in a rock about 130 dollars
and supports both crossfire and sli
configurations the system is going to
have a multitude of devices for storage

all talked about this said it's one of
your favorite and fastest drives we used
it it's coming to market about two
hundred dollars for just to store all of
the games on we're going to use the
