the channel probably saw you guys a
couple of hours ago you guys all know it
is launch day of the new NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 770 we're bringing you guys all
kinds of coverage now right now what do
I got over here we have the wind force
overclocked edition of the card by
gigabyte now this card is gonna be
pretty cool so right now let's jump in
let's do the first look and if you guys
aren't subscribed make sure you do so so
you don't miss the full review as we
continue coverage of the new geforce gtx
770 let's go alright folks so like any
good unboxing and first look we're gonna
obviously take a look at the box we've
got the gigabyte name the eye of the
eagle 450 watt cooling capacity
guaranteed it's the OC version two
gigabytes of gddr5 memory geforce gtx
770 on the side of the card take a look
at some stuff right here just basically
says they have their OC guru ii software
it's the wind force Edition two
gigabytes gddr5 memory 256-bit memory
interface DirectX 11 HDMI out port PCI
Express 3.0 and DisplayPort technology
oh there you guys see the back of the
box here once again see the Nvidia logo
the name again just talks about some of
the other stuff the wind force it's
cooling design how it goes about cooling
the card and that's pretty much it as
far as the Box goes we'll flip it around
the end right here show you guys this so
in case anybody is looking to buy this
card this will be what you're looking
for and with that said we'll do the
unboxing here we go folks let's get it
out of the box from pop the cap here go
ahead and do this
remove the box we've got the box with in
a box the box up ssin once again you
guys can see the gigabyte little there
flip open the top right here on top we
can see the card on its anti-static bag
glory let's go ahead and set that out of
the way real quick and see where their
stuff comes in the box there's lots of
foam inside of here anti-static stuff
aside here's a little accessories box
let's pop that open and see what comes
inside we have dual molex to 6-pin and
dual molex to eight pin power adapters
right here so in case your powers plasma
on the old school ones you'll be able to
go ahead and hook up your card to it
anyways all right here's the drivers CD
and the quick install guide graphics
card quick guide alright so that's all
what's up I'll just go ahead and put
that back in its box and get that out of
the way real quick let's move on to the
card itself get it out of its little bag
here and while we're doing this let's go
ahead and bring the reference card over
as well so sorry folks so here is the
reference design card you guys can see
it features all of the same cooling as
the Titan in the 690 the only thing that
really separates it is you know
obviously the technology and this little
engrave thing right here this is gtx 770
so that's what that looks like now let's
take a look at gigabytes card now they
feature open air technology cooling you
guys can see that all there there are
three fans underneath there are giant
heat fins that are made of aluminum then
we have copper heat pipes down there so
basically the heat is sucked up into
this goes out flawless heat pipes and
then it's blown away from the card by
the fans now one thing to take note of
with GPU boost 2.0 it relies on how cool
the card is running so the cooler the
card is running the better performance
you'll get the better overclocking just
better overall everything like I said
before though we just got this car today
will be having the full
you and all those results for you guys a
little bit later on let's turn to the
side you guys can see the cards a two
slot design flip it around to the side
here on this side we can see eight pin
six pin power connector we can also see
along the side here all of the aluminum
heat fins will flip it around the back
right here we can see the SLI fingers
now with the GTX 770 s you can use a
triple SLI configuration these four
screws that are right here will allow
you to remove the cooling in case you
want to so a water cooler or something
like that now would have been really
nice if they would have had something
protecting the backside of the PCB but
at least they're now using a black PCB
instead of a blue which will make mini
users a happy camper now let's flip it
around last but not least to the rear
i/o under IO we have two DVI connectors
a single and a dual link we also have an
HDMI connector and a standard
DisplayPort connector alright folks so
that's what comes in the box of the new
gigabyte overclocked edition windforce
