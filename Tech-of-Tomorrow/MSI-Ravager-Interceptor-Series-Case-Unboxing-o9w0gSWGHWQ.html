of tomorrow youtube channel bringing you
tomorrow's tech today and once again
we're bringing you guys something really
cool today we're gonna do the unboxing
and first features look at the new msi
ravage your case that's right the
Ravager ur like a dinosaur something
scratched in the after me and you go
whoo but no this is actually a mid-tower
case coming to a market at about ninety
nine dollars should be available on the
net everywhere with that let's look at
the outside the box and seeing some of
the stuff that it's got so so like
always we'll just take a look at the
front of the box gonna spin around lets
you guys see the side of the box you
guys can see some of the features that
are on there not going to break them all
down just let you guys take a look as
you guys can read i hope you can read if
not stay in school all right that's my
kitty advice for the day let me flip
around so should go to the other side of
the box I didn't see all that Sh of the
various features and stuff all the way
down it's just gonna be us v now one of
the big things about this entire case
that the guy told me the rep from over
there he told me that thing's supposed
have really excellent cable management
so let me start with my little trusty
knife and with that i'm going to go
ahead and make the first incisions up in
here Linda's over so you get the camera
and take a look we're making a quick
incision here it's professionally done
don't try this at home i am a doctor go
ahead make another one over here got the
knife here in my hands now I'm going to
throw the knife and stick the camera
with it no he says no all right no one
takes
so all right we'll start up on top and
right on top we've got a little msi
customer survival pack so let me walk
this over the camera and get a little
closer shot of that these are survival
packs was you know obviously gonna
contain water a medical kit you know
things to clean radiation out of the air
you know survival kit I don't know let's
open it up and see what's in it oh
alright cool so let's check it out all
the screws everything for the case right
here these are all things to lock in
your bays and all that stuff those are
right here got a bunch of tie-down
straps right here and then something
cool down here in the bottom hold on
hold on hold on i'll check it out this
 comes with some bling kill yeah
that's right i got my bling i got myself
in let me walk this year with the
cameras y'all take a closer look hold on
right so you guys all saw that that's
all the stuff it comes to this stuff
this stuff and obviously the msi bling
so I got the msi bling it's survival kit
now what the survival kit is for they
weren't going to tell you but in the
future msi is organizing work gang and
workforce and if you don't have the
necklace on they suck you into their
gang and make you work slavery that's
right as what's happening don't believe
me you know your is asleep alright well
let me yank up some bling so when people
get the wrong idea and think I'm a
rapper so I'll go ahead and put this off
the side set it down go ahead and turn
the case box upside down
go and get out of the way we get some
good strong affection take the box now
the Box goes up the boom right we roll
around here bring this thing around off
the bottom part which yes we'll go
effectively at the cameraman straight
nothing to do about that all right well
let's start off let's look at the bottom
so I'm open it up grab the bat we can
see we got four rubber ice feet right in
the bottom right here one two three four
also we have them now these are some of
the cheese's little grill filters I've
ever seen they're removable but I gotta
say these are kind of cheesy they just
stick in here and then almost feel like
paper I mean I suppose the work but that
is a kind of a I don't know that
particular ones a semi cheesy design but
hey it's only nine egg box we got two of
those on there just flipped over there
show you guys that two of those little
things you can also fit fans in the
bottom so you have intake fans hence why
they have these here you're sucking the
air and you don't want the dust to get
sucked in your system along with that so
go ahead and pop it around flip the
thing up and around here we go up and
around we go where she stops good news
well I know all right once more at the
cameramen got him all right so let's
take it out of the box kaboom so we'll
stop and we'll around you guys can
see that there's a bunch of these little
Rev injure claw marks rah rah rah got
one two three bays obviously right here
in front got our start button nice and
simple there take a look here my flip up
now lets you guys see the top see we've
got two USB 2.0 two USB 3.0 headphone
mic and the reset button I'll locate it
up here on top up here on top again we
see a place for additional fans and once
again a grill this one's not exactly
removable something around let you guys
to the side gaijin see once again plenty
of room for fans here the big claw mark
cross the side again with the Ravager
logo here I kind of like that sound
ah It's A Wrap injure that's my sound of
around you're coming to get you you know
so every time you unbox a Ravager so you
open the box you hear it so tell my
throat later man alright so we'll start
off around show you guys the
back we can see we do have a couple
things for water they're very small
power supply on the bottom all blue
things here on the rear do you fit one
two three four five six seven also a fan
back it's blue you guys can see in there
it's up the msi logo on it flip it
around over here show you guys the other
side when see you only get the cloth
strike now let's start to take the thing
apart we always do here we take
apart so front panel removable try to
seal that all the wires are all wired up
there we have a fan here once again with
another removable grill top you can see
it pops off fan right there pop the girl
back on very nice and simply so I'm just
going to go ahead and sit back on focus
so there's really no reason if you cut
off now yeah it comes off very easily
goes back on now okay so now that we've
took out the front panel we've seen
everything looks on the outside let's
actually go inside and see the inside of
the beat boys I drop a little shoe than
the table makes a nice clackety sound
you guys love the sound effects
technique at don't come back pull this
little side door off
there we go show you guys that get that
out of the way go ahead and show you
this doesn't need to have a little delay
their folks and just watching this thing
apart nicely let's take a look inside
get the camera to come up here you can
see that all these bays very easel of
flexible put your drive inside of there
just a nice flexible Bay I like these
fine they're very very easy to use all
the bays here which it drives in you
just lock it in place and put it back
inside very simply done no problem at
all with that pop that back in there
inside plenty of room there's actually
no sharp edges whatsoever everything
feels pretty good now I'm sorry to say
that Rodney realms would not give this a
kick-ass thing let me show my foot
Rodney a kick-ass thing because there's
no removal motherboard tray so running
would say screw this case but I mean hey
I think it's okay because let's spin it
around show you the back remove both
work space in the old days was because
you couldn't access anything around your
zip you see plenty of room back here
holes here here and here and plenty of
room all the way in the back here for
cable management so they weren't lying
about that there's lots and lots of room
back here on the Ravager for cable
management so see you guys see it this
is the unboxing and first features look
of the new msi ravager a case that's
very ergonomic you guys can see it has
plenty of room for cable management in
the back plenty of bays plenty of
expansions USB 3.0 nori blue motherboard
tray but hey who really cares about that
I think for ninety nine dollars this is
actually a pretty hot product here on
tech of tomorrow so thanks for watching
we'll see you guys later we gotta gotta
do some ravaging of ourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
