Squarespace what's up Tech fans Kevin
here on teka tomorrow now today we're
reviewing one of the most talked-about
games to come out this year a lot of PC
gamers have been looking forward to it
and a lot of console gamers went as far
as to buying an Xbox one just to play it
titanfall now this is the first game to
come from respawn entertainment a
company which consists of a lot of
people that left Infinity Ward after
call of duty modern warfare 2 and
they're responsible for that title and
Call of Duty 4 which a lot of people
hold as being the best two in the series
now does this game live up to their
legacy and proved to be one of the best
new FPS IPs of the year let's find out
today on tech of tomorrow
so titanfall is a multiplayer focused
FPS that takes place in the far future
and players take on the role of pilots
who participate in 6v6 matches that also
feature numerous AI controlled enemies
now players make use of a lot of
familiar tools and weapons like most FPS
games but there's a few new things as
well namely a jetpack and the eponymous
Titans that players can call down during
matches visually the game is good but
not great terrain weapon and pilot
detail leave a bit to be desired but are
far from ugly one area that it does
excel it visually though is the Titans
themselves specifically their animations
they have their own way of moving and
clanking about and it's all very smooth
while not looking like they're just
large people running around now as far
as core mechanics go there's a lot of
familiar territory here along with just
a touch of the new namely the
freerunning mechanics and of course
calling the Titans themselves gunplay
feels very similar to the call of duty
franchise though there is a noticeable
reduce in recoil across all guns
presumably because this is the far
future aside from just shooting guns and
lobbing grenades players have a lot more
mobility options on foot than most
current FPS titles being able to double
jump and wall run and being allowed to
alternate between the two to allow for a
crazy amount of distance coverage as a
Titan gameplay is still very similar to
that of most FPS games and controls a
lot like being a pilot with the
important exception that you can't jump
but can instead perform a quick dash to
avoid enemy attacks while all match
types are limited to a total of 12
players the map is filled with enemy AI
in the form of minion foot soldiers
inspectors helping to breathe life into
every match usually these guys serve as
cannon fodder and easy kills but they
can make a useful distraction for a
smart pilot and can even end up helping
take down Titans if a pilot chooses to
ignore them and this game doesn't employ
any kind of killstreak system but
instead relies on simple cooldown based
timers pilots tactical abilities and
tightened ordnance attacks are based on
a simple cooldown mechanic while
summoning a Titan or using a Titan core
ability are based on a timer running out
Titans can be summoned faster with good
performance like killing minions or
pilots or simply damaging enemy Titans
so there's some reward for playing well
but it doesn't bar players entirely now
I personally prefer this a lot compared
to kill streaks it doesn't award a
single player a stupid amount of
momentum for having a strong start
and doesn't punish a player for joining
a game late you all just have a set of
abilities that can be used every so
often now game modes currently consists
of five different match types with 16
different maps to choose from
pilot hunter which serves like a
traditional point based deathmatch
attrition which is the same thing that
also Awards points for minion and Titan
kills hardpoint which is a simple three
point domination match and the all-time
team classic capture the flag and the
relatively most unique mode lasts Titan
standing in which everyone starts in a
Titan and must fight and destroy all
opposing ones not necessarily all pilots
I kind of wish there was a little more
match variety but what's here does cover
the major bases for team focused at PS
and it helps making finding matches
pretty easy the game does offer a
campaign mode as well though this plays
out just as playing regular matches on a
specific map in a specific mode with
maybe a little intro cutscene and mid
game dialogue with the occasional
special circumstance changing the game a
bit from a traditional match honestly
what plug the game's campaign has to
offer just isn't very much or very good
and whether you win or lose a match it's
still going to continue on Rails either
way but I still find it preferable to
having to try and shoehorn in some kind
of awkward single-player mode and it
does serve as a great intro to the
game's multiplayer and is required to be
twice won on each side in order to
unlock all three different Titan load
outs for customization now as is fairly
common these days and a lot of
multiplayer focused FPS games players
aren't experienced for completing
matches and challenges which in turn
levels them up and unlocks more options
to choose from for customization players
can equip a primary weapon a sidearm and
anti-titan weapon and some kind of
explosive minor grenade along with
having a tactical ability on cooldown
and two different passive benefits
Titans can be customized in a similar
fashion by choosing one of three bodies
which affect their speed defense and
special core ability and can also choose
what gun they use what special ordnance
they have what special ability and once
again a pair of passive bonuses I feel
like the options here are more limited
than they should be especially with
pilot tacticals in which there's only
three of them to choose from
pilot weapons cover pretty much all the
traditional items like assault rifles
SMGs shotguns and snipers the one
particularly special edition in this
case is the smart pistol a gun that can
auto kill enemies after enough time is
spent locking
it's super easy to clear up minions with
this thing it might seem kind of
abusable at first the locking on the
pilots takes quite some time and
requires a decent amount of closeness
so anyone using an automatic weapon or
shotgun can make quick work of someone
trying to use a smart gun on them unless
it's the amped version which brings me
to the one part of the game I'm really
mixed on burn cards so burn cards are
these special items that you're rewarded
with every time you complete a match or
challenge and for the most part what
cards you get are random though they do
seem to favor guns that you use more
often they cover a wide variety of
different effects that last for a single
life or in some special cases an entire
match effects vary from things like
getting a super version of a regular gun
being able to instantly summon a Titan
changing your appearance gaining a
certain tactical ability that just stays
on all of the time or even the ability
to respawn right where you last died
each card is a one-time use you can only
activate one at a time and you can only
bring three cards into one match but
even with these restrictions I can't
help but feel this mechanic just
destroys the game's sense of balance
they're fun to use when you have them
but if you're looking for a more
balanced competitive minded multiplayer
game then they're an element of
randomness that just throws that out the
window and make a good addition for
those of you that want to treat this is
just a fun pick-up-and-play kind of
situation but I wish the game offered
some custom match types where they're
just turned off so when it comes down to
it I think the easiest way for me to sum
up my experience of titanfall is that
it's just good simple fun with robots
it's not the most complex or realistic
of shooters and loadout options and
builds for pilots and Titans could
definitely be a lot larger but despite
this there's just this constant sense of
momentum and fun to every match that
keeps pulling you in I'm not sure how
much I can recommend it in terms of
being a serious competitive game given
the existence of burn cards and my own
personal lack of being pro at FPS but as
far as a casual FPS to just jump into
matches and destroy shit goes it can be
immensely fun especially if you love
robots personally this is some of the
most fun I've had in a multiplayer
focused FPS in a long time and I highly
recommend it it's worth picking up right
now if you just can't wait but of course
knowing EA's track record and the fact
that there's already a season pass
there's a very good chance that
somewhere down the road we're going to
be able to buy a more complete version
of the game under the title of game of
the year or premium it
and an overall much more affordable
price now before I get out of here guys
