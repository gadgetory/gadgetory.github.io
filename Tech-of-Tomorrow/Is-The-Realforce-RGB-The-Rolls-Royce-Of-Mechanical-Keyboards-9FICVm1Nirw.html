back once again to tech tomorrow now
lately we've seen a couple of really
high end keyboards we saw some from
Corsair with our RGB platinum and today
we're going to look at one that's from
the company called corporate corporation
taupe resent us the real force RGB
keyboard and they also sent us a
separate box that contain the spacers
and the key cap removal tool now when
you open up the box with a real force
RGB you'll see it's very very
minimalistic you get the keyboard itself
and the user's manual and that is it but
it does come with a one-year limited
warranty most of the other key removers
that I've received in a box look
absolutely nothing like the key remover
that we received inside of this box it's
very unique in its own style but it does
remove the keys without any problem
whatsoever and if you find that changing
the activation points is your thing then
these rubber spacers work very easy you
simply install them or take them out as
needed
the real course RGB is 118 mechanical
keyboard that has a lot of different
features to draw users in the first is
obviously the RGB lighting effects 16.8
million backlit colors you can customize
to any color that you like this is cool
for people doing custom builds after
people who just want to have a great
environment when they're playing their
games another big point about this
keyboard however is the three
customizable activation points now what
this means that you can change from
three different settings how fast or how
slow the keyboard reacts to when you
touch it the big thing about this I
think though is when you're playing a
game you're doing the wsd keys you want
those keys to be very fast but what
about the keys around them those
particular keys you might want to have
slow actuation so that you don't
accidentally hit them and screw yourself
in the game and this is also where the
key spacers come in these came in that
separate box I showed you guys before
you can set these up around your keys to
make sure that when you actually hit
those keys they don't do anything now
how well this is going to actually work
for different people I don't know but
it's actually something really cool and
I don't think I've seen this exact type
of feature under neither keyboard and
this can be done with every single
solitary key on the real force RGB now
there are some quick keyboard shortcuts
you can use for different lighting modes
and brightness but if you want to get
super detail with your lighting as well
as set the actuation points you will
have to download the software from the
website which also happens to be
very user friendly like most keyboards
this caliber this keyboard is built to
last
50 million keystrokes before you suppose
had any problems whatsoever and
obviously you're going to get full and
key rollover which means you can hit all
the keys at the same time the keyboard
won't freak out and freeze up on you as
far as the looks and the layout goes you
guys can see that the top of this
keyboard is really amazing it's very
clean as well there's nothing that
really stands out that looks like a
sharp badger looks weird everything
looks very very clean and simplistic I
have to say this however as far as
durability goes the real force RGB is
built like a damn tank and will probably
last a long time now the bottom it's
very simplistic as well there's simply a
steel plate across the bottom and there
are two feet for doing different height
adjustments for the comfort of your hand
and if you're wondering hey man how long
is that USB plug will it work for me
well it's actually 1.5 meters long and
the USB plug also features a thousand
Hertz ultra polling rate so nothing gets
in the way of your gaming any key that
has a cross-shaped switch can be used on
this keyboard that's a big thing the
people over at Oprah are pushing on this
thing if you can find any key with that
type of design it'll work on this
keyboard it doesn't matter who makes it
what it is as long as it'll fit that
design you can take it off any keyboard
and put it on this one and play to your
heart's desire the real force RGB is
also designed with something called step
sculpture now this allows you to plan
the keyboard for hours and hours on end
without suffering fatigue and Topher
also claims by this design that you will
get a 45 G silky smooth keystroke every
time as far as gaming goes okay what am
I going to say that you're just going to
be like oh my god because there's really
not too much you can say it's set up
like most keyboards it is very
comfortable however you can play for
long hours on it without stressing your
hands out the ability to change out all
those different actuation points for me
I didn't really find it to be very
useful I've been playing games for most
of my life and I don't have a problem
usually hitting other Keys maybe some
people do but for me I don't really
think that features that great we did
test some other keyboards in house like
that Corsair RGB platinum I think that
keyboard maybe just a little bit better
than this keyboard even though this
keyboard cost a little bit more so at
the end of the day I have to say this
keyboard is
be cool but it's also pretty pricey at
two hundred and forty nine ninety nine
that's almost at the very top of the
heap of keyboards so is it the Rolls
Royce of keyboard at the end of the day
well I think it's pretty close but
that's my opinion
what do you guys think I know you don't
have the keyboard in front of you but
from just the specs and things you see
would you guys say that this is the
Rolls Royce of keyboards like usual all
the information about this keyboard will
be down below that like button so you
guys know what to do I'm Network you
guys been watching Tector tomorrow and
hey if you're not sub plz sub the
channel because we've got lots of more
videos coming for you guys here on tech
tomorrow so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
