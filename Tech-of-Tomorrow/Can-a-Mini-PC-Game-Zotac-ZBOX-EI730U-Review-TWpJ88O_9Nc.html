their new premier pro SP 920 SSDs
feature blazing fast speeds and size up
to one terabyte
for more information check out the link
below
hey everybody how's it going glad to see
you guys back here once again on techo
tomorrow I'm networking we've got
something pretty cool to show you guys
today in the last few weeks we've
brought a bunch of different systems to
the table a lot of them have been mini
ITX and that's where I want to start off
with now a lot of people out there when
you show these systems say oh man I can
go out and I can build this system for
five hundred dollars now I'm not any
disagreement with that whatsoever
not at all but when you're trying to
build a system that's on a mini ITX form
factor everything is much smaller much
more compact and it raises the price up
now the reason that everybody's doing
this is because of the real estate on
their desktop you can take these little
mini Z boxes and all these other many
systems welcome to the back of your TV
on a desk no one even notices them
whatsoever now continuing along with the
things that we've been doing with ZOTAC
we now have their AI 730 this is a
higher level mini ITX system from these
guys and we built this thing up to be
very very competitive we use an M SATA
for the SSD a 256 gigabyte one from Plex
er thank you very much Plex are
providing that we also have a hard drive
a 500 gigabyte one that's similar to
what you'd see inside of an Xbox or
Playstation or a those type of things we
kept that along the same we used eight
gigabytes of a data memory so this
thing's pretty decked out for gaming oh
no it's a really cool system it's
actually really small right here behind
me I have the unit in my hand you guys
can see it is a little bit bigger than
my hand but it's not very much bigger
than my hand it's very thin it's
completely decked out the rear i/o
features all types of different
interfaces
you've got your display port you've got
HDMI you've got DVI so everything that
anybody wants we're hooking up to any
their high end monitors they're all
right here on the back of the rear i/o
this thing's also got completely
wireless capability you guys can see
that as well and think it's right here
at the top here we have the wireless
connection you also get lots of USB 3.0
ports to connect to get one there you
get another one right here so all in all
basically those folks has a card reader
the start button reset button I'll bring
it up to the camera real quick here's
the start button
here's the reset button you guys can see
that inside it's pretty easy to work
within we have the M SATA drive here
standard hard drive the memory is
actually underneath the fan and
everything to keep the video card is all
right here so this keeps the CPU the
video everything all nice and cool right
here with this little thing with the
blower on it and that's pretty much it
folks so with that said though now let's
jump in and let's talk about all the
specs and then let's see the scores of
this new mini awesome system for the
people over at ZOTAC i like to call it
the L 730 which means the 730 in Spanish
with that let's go the Z box is a little
unit with a lot of power under the hood
now this thing sizes in at 188
millimeters by 180 millimeters by 51
millimeters as far as inches goes at
7.40 inches by 7.40 inches by 2.01
inches inside you have an Intel
motherboard a little mini ITX bad boy
that features the iris pro 5200 with 128
megabytes of IDI ram dedicated to it the
CPU itself is an Intel Core i5 40 70 R
now this is a quad-core 2.7 gigahertz
with turbo speeds up to 3.2 gigahertz as
far as the memory goes this little bad
boy can use up to 16 gigabytes of 1600
megahertz ddr3 it has - 204 pin sodium
slots to accommodate two sticks of
memory as far as support for internal
storage goes the zotac ii i 730 features
a single 2.5 inch SATA 6 gigabytes ii
HDD sdd bay it also features a single M
SATA 6 gigabytes a second slot which
we've filled with a 256 gigabyte Plextor
M SATA module networking options are as
follows the Internet has a dual gigabyte
lan and 802 11 AC Wi-Fi and also has
bluetooth 4.0 the unit also features the
card reader which supports SD SDHC SDXC
and MMC
as far as external iOS ziran has to
display ports a single DVID and
four USB 3.0 ports audio is provided by
an onboard eight channel digital audio
source most likely by the realtek
chipset alright folks those are all the
basic features of the motherboard now
let's talk about actually the Box
content or the retail bundle the retail
bundle for the IE 730 includes the Box a
stand
a vase amount for mount screws an AC
adapter a DVI HDMI adapter a USB Drive
with the OS and drivers and an antenna a
power cord the support DVD the warranty
card the user's manual and the quick
guide and that folks is pretty much all
that you need to get up and going now
obviously you're going to need your
windows disc to put the OS but
everything else is included in fact it's
really cool that it comes with a USB
stick with all the drivers because a lot
of people may not have a CD player and
for those people out there doing
everything by USB stick hey these guys
have provided one so it makes it really
easy to use now a couple things I just
want to touch upon before we jump into
the actual scoring and benchmarks now
everything about this unit is contained
in itself there's no room to put an
additional video card pretty much what
you have is what you get but you'll
actually be surprised that this thing
does play pretty good gaming now we've
did the sphere a few weeks back that was
okay it wasn't even really geared for
gaming this one actually is geared for
game you can even see it in the box and
the block itself it says gaming when I
do the dating box because like it says
in the box those epic gaming that's
right epic gaming now I'm not gonna say
this thing does epic gaming because I
think that's a little bit of
exaggeration but for something this
small it does go pretty dang good now
what's the guy just want to reiterate a
few things now I did use an MSA to drive
in this from Plex not like you are going
out there oh my god it's so expensive
it's really not that expensive
this Plextor M SATA Drive is incredible
when you're transferring stuff on on the
system it transfers it like 231
megabytes a second I mean it's flying as
far as access everything it's
unbelievable this thing's actually only
a hundred and fifty four dollars so a
256 gigabyte n SATA is 134 dollars think
about that that's less than a dollar a
gigabyte
and it's very very fast that's why I
won't with that and concerning that the
size of it and the type of game is going
to be playing on I figured the 500
gigabyte hard drive would be awesome for
that because you can store and access
some of your games on that 256 megabytes
main partition and then the 500 gigabyte
you can have some of your other stuff so
all in all I think this is a pretty
rounded-off thing now let's jump in
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
let's check out those boys
so I poked there you have it everything
you ever wanted to know about the brand
new though tech ei7 30 now this thing
obviously is a very small unit when
running it it did not get very hot at
all of unit stayed pretty cool and
pretty quiet throughout the entire
operation now the total cost of
everything that we put into this unit
was pretty close to around eight hundred
dollars not totally there but including
the OS as well folks as you guys always
say this time I'm just rounding it off
and including one hundred all or less
with all that stuff in the parts that we
use the unit itself it's about $450 you
can find it online for BM Saito like I
said that thing was 154 dollars the hard
drive was only like $50 and the memory
was very inexpensive as well so if
you're looking for something that's very
tiny not gonna take up any desktop real
estate whatsoever but still has enough
power to game this thing's pretty cool
now a couple of the things I really
didn't mention the bulk of the review
but I'll going to mention now you get a
couple of different things to mount it
this particular unit right here will
allow you to mount this unit on the back
of a TV so if you want to use it you can
put this like a back of your samsung TV
it'll be completely unobtrusive you
won't see it it'll be in the back of
your TV and completely out of the way
you can hook it up via your HDMI and
then boom you've got your PC in your
living room without even being seen
that's really cool now for folks one is
using the desktop it also comes this
little thing right here you just slide
it on the unit and the unit will just
stand up and sit as a normal computer so
you get multiple choices about how
you're going to use it as far as the
power goes obviously it's gonna come
with a power brick so you get the power
brick and the plug that goes into it you
just plug it and plug it in the wall
it's not too obtrusive as well so I'm
norik thanks for watching techie
tomorrow I hope you guys are preciate
this video if so down below the like
button which I hope you guys will hit
will be all the information about this
all the parts that we have used so I'm
maverick thanks for watching Tekken
tomorrow we'll see you guys back on here
for more tech very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
