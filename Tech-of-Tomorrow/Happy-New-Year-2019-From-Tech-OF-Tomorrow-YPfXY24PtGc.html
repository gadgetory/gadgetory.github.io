behind us and I have to say that 2018 as
a year for me personally really did suck
it was a bad year for me all the way
around for business all kinds of like my
fear of musicians I'll kill themselves
or died just all-in-all a terrible
terrible terrible year and I know for
lots of other people out there it was a
really bad year as well so hopefully
first of all happy new year welcome to
2019 and hopefully 2019 is going to be a
better year for everybody I mean 2018
was just literally riddled with
disappointment we never really did see
what we wanted to see from any of the
manufacturers we didn't see anything
that was like just so outrageous that
we're all like right now a street saying
this tech was amazing we got you know I
don't know I I considered to be you know
just minor updates and some of the stuff
we never really saw we wanted to see
from AMD this year they did catch up
with the CPU stuff so congrats on that
end but as far as the CPU side of things
really go for like Intel lackluster I
mean we all know our TX yeah cool it's
the future but I mean we had house
really wasn't what people expected so I
think that you know even there we kind
of got you know a technology that went
kind of left and we're all right instead
of forward so I was kind of different
hard to swallow and like I said a lot of
people died this year musicians wise a
lot of people Tom Petty is like a
musician I grew up with I love that guy
like I will miss him in his music
forever and I mean let's just face at
Lincoln Park singer
I mean Chester and then Soundgarden like
wow okay a lot of people gone this year
that I really wish wouldn't be gone you
know and that's just saying that I
honestly had a tough time with 2018 you
guys who follow the channel you know
what's up like I had problems with my
foot and even though I survived the
surgery things good my foots bleeding
again
so I'm right back to like almost in the
same state even though I'm a sore there
and I have a kind of a bleeding hole in
my foot so even though I am up and
walking I have to go to the surgeon
tomorrow and I'll probably be back off
my feet until CES where I mean I'll yuri
be able to walk again or all
partner up you know hauled around in a
cart but this particular NGO my foot
right now is just from from the scab
opening up the major cut those of my
foots completely healed it's not
bleeding so in that particular aspect
I'll probably be walking but it's 2019
got a lot of different stuff coming up
first off this year be the CES show
we'll be there next week then after that
there'll be a show at the NAMM in 2019
we're gonna be doing a lot more stuff
with music now so for people out through
like music stuff well be be seeing a lot
more of that on they're gonna try to do
more stuff with the name try to do more
stuff that actually is focused on real
tech of tomorrow it's kind of hard to do
though when I've been you know sick
almost the entire year I literally was
sick almost all of 2018 almost died
twice in the hospital multiple times so
for me 2019 is like a brand-new start so
here we are in 2019
happy New Year to everybody out there
thanks for all of your support thanks
for supporting the channel there have
been many ways to do it you can either
you know buy stuff you know through the
links we put down there from Amazon or
support us on patreon
we've also got our Twitter stuff going
we're all fully functioning now we've
got the Instagram stuff going on it
seems like Google+ is kind of a dead
horse I don't really know what's going
on with that but I guess it's a dead
horse and dropped off the face of the
earth so we'll have to see but welcome
to 2019 I appreciate each and every one
of you god bless you love you we'll see
you guys for more videos here in the new
freakin year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
