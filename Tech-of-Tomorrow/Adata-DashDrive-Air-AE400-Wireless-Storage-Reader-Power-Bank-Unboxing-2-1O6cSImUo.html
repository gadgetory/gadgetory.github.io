who love hardware welcome back to tech
of tomorrow or today we're going to be
taking a look at a very interesting
product from the people over at a data
this is their new dashdrive air AE 400
which is actually three products in one
it's a wireless card reader a wireless
transmitter and a power base for your
phone all-in-one now this thing comes to
market at about a hundred dollars but
you can find it for sale less and that
will tell you that at the end of the
video but for right now let's jump in
let's do the unboxing and first look at
this new product so right here on the
front of the box you can just see it's
the box oh yeah so exciting the adata
dashdrive air wireless storage reader
and power bank AE 400 like I said it's
three products in one you can see that
all down there flip it around the side
of box zoom in there and shows you some
more stuff about it show you the
connectivity flip it around real quick
to the other side got some google play
Sam App Store you can if you have this
in front of you actually you could click
on those and take you right to their
product links let's flip around here's
the back of the box and let's go ahead
and let's take it out of the box so now
that I've got the trusty little life of
the box so go ahead and just make a
quick little incision up here on the top
right here not much to this at all quick
little incision a quick little cutter go
ahead and pop little cap on here I think
I got most of that off there try not to
damage the box too much I still want to
be able to keep it around but you guys
know me if I can't get something out of
a box I'll start cutting that stuff like
crazy hopefully though I'm not trying to
do it here I'm trying to be nice and
gentle alright i think i was able to do
it so what do you know look at my my
doctoring skills are getting better i'm
able to open a box without totally
ravana to shreds so anyway so let's get
inside here alright so for the box flip
it around right here micro USB 2
standard USB and see it right there
it'll connectivity cable now some of the
cool things about this though
is with this device you can actually
hook up 10 devices to it at one time so
that means that once you stick your
information card in here anybody in 10
different locations can actually access
it so if you had movies on here whatever
they'd all be able to access it so let's
set the product on the table get the
cabin to refocus then we'll get some
nice really good close-ups of this bad
boy alright folks so right now bring it
up here you can see there's indicators
all right here telling you what the AE
400 is doing now it's a little bit
difficult to see but this is the power
button there's a little button right
here on top it's slightly differently
colored than the rest of the unit this
right here is the power button all that
diamond east of is like flashy jewelry
now let's talk about the ports that are
on the AE 400 there's a micro USB port
this is used for data transmission and
battery charging a standard USB AF this
is a host port for you FD portable HDD
or power bank functions we also have a
multi-function SD card reader that has
support for SD sdhc and SDXC now like I
said before this thing is also a phone
charger but the phone actually has to be
up close enough to it to charge it's not
a wireless phone charger but it will
charge the phone kind of you know
something just interesting there I
really think a data was just in a way
trying to like reinvent the wheel with
using three products and one it should
be interesting here also we have the
aviator dashdrive irae 400 users guide
it says please charge the AE 400 for
eight hours so before you use the inn at
all you need to plug it in let it have
steady eight hours of information and
then after that it'll be good to go
inside the manual it's just all kinds of
information I'm not going to read the
whole thing off to you guys but that's
it so you get this this and this all in
the Box in the adata dashdrive air like
I said before this is the AE 400 and
also if you're interested in finding
this product and you'd like to show us
on our sponsors some support down the
