welcome back to the ticker tomorrow
channel I'm elric your host and today
we're going to be having a bottle over
oh that's right today the android army
vs the apple alliance in a head-to-head
battle between the nexus 7 and the ipad
mini those you guys out there who are
fans of you there Apple or the Android
have probably gone out and bought this
so this video though is to help decide
for those people who have not yet
purchased one let's jump in and let's do
the comparison
alright folks so first off we're going
to talk about design and form factor now
obviously the ipad is going to be very
much thinner the ipad is much thinner
and it's got a wider screen the Nexus 7
is a little bit thicker but it's held
much easier in my hand so I wanted to
say right off the bat as far as I
ergonomics go I'm going to have to hand
that over to the Nexus 7 it's just so
much easier to hold in your hand then
holding the ipad mini with the ipad mini
i'm a big guy and i have a big hand and
it's actually it kind of stretching my
hand out as you guys can see where this
is just very very comfortable next up
let's talk screen resolution now the
Nexus 7 has a smaller screen being seven
inches but it also has a higher pixel
rate at 1280 x 800 the iPad Mini is a
7.9 inch screen but its resolution is
only 1024 x 768 so once again in the
category of pixel density I'm going to
have to hand the award over once again
to the nexus 7 at 1280 by 800 now pixels
aside just as far as pure video quality
goes the Nexus 7 once again wins it has
a much more vibrant picture and a much
wider viewing angle so another category
that the nexus 7 wins now let's go in
another category gaming now gaming on
the Nexus 7 is pretty good but actually
gaming for some reason on the iPad Mini
is just far superior as far as general
cpu performance goes obviously the nexus
7 with its a Tegra 3 processor was a
quad-core is beating the crap out of the
a5 as far as that goes but as far as
sheer gaming goes if you're just wanting
a tablet for gaming I would have to say
that the ipad mini wins because in this
category it loads games faster and it
plays games better now here you guys can
see in GL benchmark that the a5
processor nearly doubles the frames per
second compared to the Nexus 7 so
obviously when it comes to graphics the
iPad minis kicking butt now like I said
earlier the ipad mini loads apps and
games much faster so now let's take a
look at Batman loading
on both of these
so you guys can see in this one the iPad
once again takes the crowd now there's
one of the thing though that I want you
guys to all take into consideration how
important is having a camera to you and
a video recorder because a lot of people
ask me all the time out there about
starting their own channel and doing
this thing now if you happen to go out
and buy the ipad mini if you guys saw
the video that i made just the other day
the video quality on the ipad mini
really kicks ass all you guys out there
liked it there were only actually a few
negative comments so that's something
you want to take in a difference but
let's take this into consideration 130
dollar price range with that hundred and
thirty dollars could you go out and buy
yourself just a camera of course you
could but this is all inside of one
thing so that's something to consider
next up we do sound quality now the
Nexus 7 it has pretty decent sound you
guys can hear that the ipad though is
actually a little bit better we take
dumb and dumber we play the intro scene
of it and you can just hear the overall
quality difference also we know that's
very very hard to hear audio and
describe it you know to yourself when
you're watching the video but if you're
listening through good headphones we
guarantee you'll definitely hear a
difference
excuse me could you tell me how to get
to the medical school I'm supposed to be
doing a lecture in about 20 minutes in
my driver's a bit lost
excuse me could you tell me how to get
to the medical school I'm supposed to be
doing a lecture in about 20 minutes in
my driver's a bit lost no next up let's
talk about apps because this is a very
important aspect of your tablet for damn
sure now we know that the nexus 7 many
of the games and application that we see
on there have been up scaled from a
phone where the ipad mini all the things
have been developed to work and actually
those resolutions and everything and
that's probably one of the reasons that
they run so much cleaner and better now
we've come to the end of the video we've
showed you guys all kinds of comparisons
between the apple ipad mini and the new
Nexus 7 now I know that all you folks
out there who like all the products that
go along with Apple the itunes store and
all that kind of stuff like I said are
in the video you've probably either
already bought this or you're planning
on buying a product like that if you're
somebody who likes all the google apps
and all that stuff then obviously you've
probably already gone out and bought
yourself a nexus 7 this video was
intended though to show people who are
going to buy one what the differences
are at the end of the day I have to say
just for overall tablet quality and
everything I'm going to have any award
over to the nexus 7 the ipad yeah it has
a couple of cool things on it but those
cool things that it has only matter to a
small group of people and one thing I
just want to reiterate is that there is
a hundred and thirty dollars price
difference now if the apple ipad mini
had a Retina display it would totally be
the kick-ass product and i would give it
the award hands down because the retina
display would be easily worth the 130
dollar difference but just for having a
camera and a little bit better in the
gaming the sacrifice that you're getting
and video and screen quality just
doesn't rate it to win between the nexus
7 and it in the long run so thanks for
watching if you guys like the video make
sure you hit the like button if you
haven't subscribed yet my heart would
appreciate it you did and i'll see you
back here on tech of tomorrow for
another video tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
