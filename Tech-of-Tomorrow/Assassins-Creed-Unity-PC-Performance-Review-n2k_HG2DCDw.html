bringing guys another benchmark test of
a triple-a holiday release title this
time it's Assassin's Creed unity now the
Assassin's Creed franchise is another
series that has a really spotted history
with its PC versions and normally shows
a lot of clear favoritism for the
console market and in fact normally the
PC version comes out a couple months
after the console one does but this time
around we got all versions all at once
so for those of you that were interested
in grabbing the game we decided to run a
couple tests with it on our test system
which the specs of you can see right
here the core of which includes a GTX
780 and an i7 4770k so on the system we
ran the game on four different preset
graphic options of low medium high and
ultra so let's go ahead and see how that
all worked out
okay so as you guys can see still not
the best experience on PC we head around
the game at its lowest settings just to
hit 60 frames per second and even then
if you guys paid attention to the
gameplay you'll notice a lot of
different visual bugs such as people and
objects popping in and out of existence
now of course this could still be fixed
with some future patches but as of right
now on launch day definitely not the
best experience on PC to have now if you
guys are still interested in grabbing
the game we do have a link posted down
below as well as a link to my first
impressions video of the game and a way
to follow me on twitter if you guys
enjoy the video please make sure to
wreck that like button to let us know
and subscribe if you haven't yet now one
last thing before I get out of here
though I want to give you guys just a
little spiel on a service you may have
heard of called Hulu Plus Hulu Plus
