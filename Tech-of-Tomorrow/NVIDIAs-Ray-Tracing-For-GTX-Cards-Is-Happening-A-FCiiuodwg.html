edition of tech of tomorrow now this
morning at 6 a.m. NVIDIA dropped a bomb
out into the gaming universe that's
right so check this out we've all known
that rate racing has been around but
it's really only been available in the
RT X card so if you had an older GTX
1060 or any of the older cards you
weren't really available to check out
DLS x DX r or any of the features with
ray tracing you just really couldn't do
it
however with the brand new GeForce
worthy driver for 25.3 1 you will be
able to use RT X features on older cards
that's right so people who have older
cards will now be able to check out and
experience ray tracing for themselves
now this starts off on a GTX six
gigabytes card it's a 1060 card and it
goes up from there now they're saying
that the performance might not be you
know the absolute greatest performance
on these older cards but at least you'll
be able to see what DXR looks like and
there are actually three demos that
dropped this morning we're gonna be
bringing and showing you guys that shows
off the different effects levels than
what they do with this technology and
with the release of the brand-new Unreal
Engine 4 point 2 2 game developers are
now going to be able to bring all of
this technology to the table a lot
easier so anybody out there who is
developing their game if they want to
have all of these features and use them
implemented right out of the box they'll
be able to use this tool and they'll be
able to drink to the table a lot more
simply so this should change things now
right now let's check out the first of
these three demos and I think you're
gonna find it pretty interesting now
first off let's check out the atomic art
r-tx demo now this features resolution
DL SS and loop options only now this
particular game was created by month and
it features ray tracing reflections and
shadows as well as invidious DL SS
technology
next up let's check out the justice demo
now the only options that are available
in the justice demo are RTX and DL SS
options and you can toggle between these
on and off by using the f5 and f8 keys
now last up let's check out the
reflections demo and see how shiny
things really honor
what's the story what only elevators
lately
I heard kylo Ren destroyed the one over
in D sector yes me who's ever in charge
of this place should be transferred to a
hawk now this particular demo actually
has no options available for you it was
created by Epic Games in collaboration
with ILM xlab's and NVIDIA now this demo
showcases ray-traced reflections
ray-traced aerial light shadows
ray-traced ambient occlusion for
characters and NVIDIA TLS s technology
yeah I think she heard us please be
blended for once all right so all of
those demos look pretty doggone cool
right I mean even though it's kind of
based on Star Wars and really shine okay
like people go oh my god it's just shiny
you gotta admit those reflections do
look really cool and if you watch the
movie they are actually pretty doggone
shiny like that so it is kind of cool
the big news however is that you're
gonna be able to trace these ray tracing
effects and check them out on your
lower-end carts you don't have to worry
about if you've got the latest art TX
card just to check these features out
now it may not run the greatest on these
older cards but at least you can check
it out now
Nvidia they think this is the most
exciting year you know exciting
information that they've released in
like 15 years but I want to know what
you guys think do you guys think this is
all SuperDuper exciting or you guys just
like it's kind of ho-hum stuff I mean me
personally I think any new technology is
cool because it's just like you know
fueling the industry and making things
look better I don't really know if games
are getting any funner but I mean
they're definitely getting better
looking that's for sure so if you guys
want any more information we'll have a
link below if you guys want to check out
these demos and watch them for the self
you can do so I'm Eric you've been
watching Tekken tomorrow if you're not
sub you know what to do we'll see you
back here on the channel peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
