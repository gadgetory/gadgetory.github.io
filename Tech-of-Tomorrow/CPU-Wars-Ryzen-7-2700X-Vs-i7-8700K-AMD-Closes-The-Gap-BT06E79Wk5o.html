worst gift you can get is a gift card to
a place that you would never shop at but
now with bit Moe a social gifting app
for iOS and Android you can exchange
those unwanted gift cards for a gift
card to a place you actually shot bat
what's best about this is you can
exchange these gift cards to any
retailer in the bit Moe app and you can
see how simple and easy this is to do
you can also send gift cards to anyone
in the USA with a mobile number or email
redeeming a gift card is also really
easy with just a couple of taps you're
up and ready to go and best of all these
gift cards never expire so you can use
it when you want to so if you're looking
for the perfect gift either for yourself
or a friend try bit mode today and right
now using the code T ot 10 you can get
10% off an Amazon gift card from 25 to
$100 so check out bit moe you're sure to
like it
alright so bit Moe seems pretty cool
right why get a gift that you just don't
want if you guys want to be able to get
an Amazon gift card for 10% off use the
code T ot 10 and you'll get 10% off now
with that said you guys who follow the
channel know that when we got our rise
in 720 700x we were having one heck of a
time getting it going even with the
different boards that we had and I
didn't want to get you know a whole
bunch of boards but we still tried a
couple so before I even start the video
I'm gonna do something I've never really
done before this particular motherboard
this thing we went through three of
these boards exact same parts all
together in this system this board would
never ever get past Windows so honestly
I would avoid buying this motherboard
that's just my opinion
I've also contacted Matt the dude from
gigabyte and I've asked to exchange
these to get a different board that
would work I've been completely ignored
so honestly I tried but this board never
worked for us I was on the phone with
AMD I was on the phone with every single
solitary person I know trying to see
what was going on
we even had you know Paul from Paul's
hardware and Kyle from bit wit they came
over they looked at like okay whoa okay
this just doesn't make any sense
so this board never worked and then we
hate to go out a camera range go on one
second and this particular board also
never worked neither one of these boards
I went through two of these and three of
the other one and these boards would
never ever go into the Windows
environment no matter what we did and
believe me we've changed out every part
power supplies everything the memory the
hard drives just every single solitary
part taken out of a case putting it back
into a case no luck whatsoever so those
two motherboards they never worked so I
contacted my friend from a Zeus and this
board right here this board kicks ass it
worked right out of the box I didn't
have to do any changes to the memory
whatsoever it ran just fine I we did
change the memory did it to XMP so it
ran at 3,000 megahertz which is what's
on the memory sticks but beyond that
everything was stock right out of the
box everything worked absolutely great
so this board pretty much saved the day
now as far as the system goes we'll be
bringing you another review of justice
system by itself so those people out
there who are interested in buying one
can see more in depth about what's going
on with this system but everything about
this system runs absolutely great it
passed all of the tests and flying color
no hiccups no lock ups nothing at all to
complain about whatsoever and at the end
of this video I have to say that I have
to give AMD hats off actually for this
because I think at the end of this video
when you guys see all the results you'll
be pretty surprised I know AMD fans are
going yeah all right kick that into a
bootie but honestly this is the closest
gap I've ever seen before so with that
said though let's real quick let's jump
in and let's check out the test systems
now also we're running the latest
drivers available at the time of this
build now sure new drivers can come out
every week but I'm not going to keep
testing forever and ever and ever
because things been delayed as well and
also we use wind
and we use the anniversary update so
everything in the system is completely
updated before we start running the test
all the hard drives are formatted
everything on both systems is a complete
fresh install of Windows for the
absolute best performance that you can
get so with that said though let's real
quick let's check out the AMD system so
you guys can see obviously we're using
the 2700 X we've got 16 gigabytes of
3,000 megahertz memory we've got a boot
drive it's an SSD this is pretty much
the same on both systems got a nice 2
terabyte hard drive for the storage and
putting all mainly most of the games on
so overall this is a very very nice
system like I said I'll be bringing you
guys a full review showing you guys this
system so you guys can check it out for
yourself now on the intel side of things
this particular computer i built to be
my music computer and a lot of people
made weird comments but it's not silent
but i'll get into that another day
wasn't meant to be sad this is a digital
music computer so i wasn't worried about
any of that other stuff a little bit of
noise but you guys can see this computer
is very nice has an AE 700k inside of it
has once again sixteen gigabytes of
memory and nice SSD for the boot drive
lots of room for four spaces I mean I
actually went kind of overboard as far
as the hard drives in the system going
but that does really have anything to do
with the performance but pretty much
these two systems are as much equal as I
could really get them unless I just
tried to buy the exact same parts down
the line but you know we build different
systems different you know different
systems have different parts inside of
them at the end of the day though once
you're in performance when you know and
you're playing games and all that stuff
things like you know really how quick it
boots and stuff like that would really
be the only difference is depending on
the quality of the drives itself so with
that said though those are the two
systems and now let's jump in let's
check out the benchmark song and let's
see how well these systems do against
each other and then let's give you guys
a conclusion of what my honest opinions
are about this brand-new AMD CPU so
let's rock
now you guys can see from the gaming
scores that these two systems scored
almost identical one or two frames here
which is really no big deal at all so if
I was going to recommend either one of
these systems for gaming I'd have to say
they're both totally equal and neither
one of them really scores better than
the other it's kind of definitely a
trade off here now there was one
exception however far cry 5 literally
kicked ass on the intel cpu and that's
pretty amazing stuff now the temperature
of the CPU is a very important aspect
when you're running your system you guys
can see that AMD actually wins in this
particular scenario at the max their CPU
is running at 65 Celsius but on the
intel side of things we were seeing a
maximum temperature of a hundred Celsius
now that's one really good thing and
shows AMD winning as far as the power
versus heat ratio goes okay so at the
end of the day with all the testing the
temperatures the gaming and with that
far cry 5 score
honestly these CPUs are almost the
identical price and for the first time
ever ever really I feel completely and
honestly at ease telling you guys that
the 2700 X is a damn fine CPU paired
with the right motherboard there is
plenty of power here and remember I did
all of my testing and everything other
than the XMP memory change right out of
the box
I didn't overclock the memory I didn't
overclock the CPUs we'll have another
video where we actually overclock the
systems and we'll bring them to you and
show you which one actually overclocks
better but four out of the box
performance if I could build a system on
the AMD side of things and make it
cheaper than the Intel I would
definitely at this point go with the AMD
2700 X very nice CPU you guys can see
it's max temperature is running at 65
Celsius on the intel side of things a
hundred Celsius that's quite a bit of
temperature range there now we all know
that CPUs can run pretty hot as long as
they're being cooled correctly but even
that right there is kind of makes me go
WOW you know
I really didn't realize that the Intel
CPU was running that much hotter than
the AMD side of things and both systems
have very nice liquid coolers in them
it's not like one has a cheesy one and
one has a really good one they both have
pretty equal coolers that you know these
CPUs I think should be running a little
bit closer but with AMD being the clear
winner there and if you're a person who
plays far cry 5 that's your game of
choice well you can see that this new
AMD CPU honestly runs that game faster
than the Intel side of things as
squirrely as that might be it's just the
facts so at the end of the day I have to
say I do give the AMD Rison 720 700 X as
a CPU I give it an editor's choice I
think for its price performance ratio
and the way that it compares to Intel's
top dog the 8700 K for the desktop area
I say that's a definite thumbs up and
win for AMD now if we could just see the
same thing going on over on the video
card side of things that would be
amazing the more competition the better
AMD does the better it is for all of us
because it forces Intel to get off their
laurels and do something about it now we
see the 2700 X and honestly this isn't
even really the next gen of AMD CPUs
when I first got it at first I think I
made a mistake on my videos and I said
hey you know this is the next gen but
it's really not it's just the latest in
their line of CPUs it's not like the
next gen really in anything whatsoever
they have other CPUs that are coming out
now with that said since the margin here
is so close I mean the Intel did score
better on certain things you know I mean
but for most people I think a lot of
people out there gonna buy their
computer either for streaming or for
gaming and at this point like I said if
you can save money I would definitely go
with the MD decide up things for one
thing the CPU running a lot cooler than
the Intel to me is a really good thing
because the cool your CPU runs the
longer life it's going to have so you
guys saw it folks
2,700 X damn fine CPU when AMD releases
their new line of CPUs honestly I think
that they'll finally cross the gap and
they'll be able to beat Intel at the
same
now at that time Intel's either going to
be left scrambling literally or they
better better seriously have something
up their sleeve that's going to come out
into the market because the last few
releases from Intel have been kind of
just like
and with AMD's just with these latest
releases I have to say they procced the
gap they've done a damn fine job I
salute you AMD for that I'm a you guys
been watching Tecna maro like I said in
the very beginning of the video if you
guys want to get 10% off an Amazon gift
card you guys can use that VIP mo app
and you can get it for 10% off using T
ot 10 and that'll help support the site
also I'd really appreciate it if you
guys would like and share this video
with other people so that they can see
the video as well that would mean a lot
to me and if you're not subscribed and
you'd like to be subscribed to the
channel hey please do so we'd greatly
appreciate it god bless everybody we'll
see you back here later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
