who just love new technology now what's
been considered the worst kept secret in
the technology industry is now coming
out what am I talking about samsung's
new galaxy note 8.0 that's right so
check this thing out pace is going to be
an 8 inch screen it's going to be a
phone camera and everything else all in
one now is this thing going to be too
big for people to use is it going to be
a pain in the butt we would be able to
take a picture with it I mean kind of
tripping so from now let's hop in and
let's talk about some of the specs now
they're confirmed for the new Galaxy
Note 8.0 the galaxy note 8.0 is pretty
well designed it comes in 2 338 grams it
actually feels pretty decent from what
I've heard it's not too heavy you can
even use it with one hand samsung claims
that it used the standard moleskine
notebook as a cue when designing the
note 8.0 and while comment in that
particular fact might play samsung in
the line of fire for yet another series
of lawsuits we can say that the
dimensions of the galaxy note 8.0 seem
pretty cool like I said before it's easy
to handle with one hand but it's also
large enough to provide a nice good
screen real estate it has a great
balance it specs as well which included
1.6 gigahertz quad-core Exynos processor
2 gigabytes of ram a massive 4600 aah
battery GPS Bluetooth 4.0 and an 8 inch
LED screen that packs a relatively
actually buy today's written as
standards 189 pixels per inch the rumor
performance was quite impressive but one
thing to note is that the 5 megapixel
rear camera is next to useless then
again using the note 8 points at camera
is about as comfortable as attempting to
make a phone call on it because it's so
damn big now they'll also be a lot of
apps on here as well note 8.0 features a
premium suite of apps designed to make
use of the s-pen stylus building on the
success of the wakem design input device
that has made the note line so distinct
the new note allows third-party
developers to utilize its hover gestures
to build new features into their
software as a proof of their new concept
the Galaxy Note 8 point will launch with
a new version of Flipboard that features
an expanding tile option ishy ating by
hovering the pen over a Content file one
of the really cool feature that's really
unique to the note 8.0 is an enhanced
readers mode that automatically adjust
screen settings to optimize the device
for reading ebooks a new remote program
designed to replace your universal TV
remote and an enhanced multimedia
windows mode that really shines in the
new 8-inch screen so right folks what do
you guys think about that is 8 inches
too big now we all know that it's also
going to be a Samsung 10.1 coming out as
well I've seen commercials on it already
you know LeBron James undergoing yeah
you know so he's sponsoring I thinks we
know that's coming as well Samsung's not
too good at keeping secrets obviously
also if you guys want to see some more
pictures or an in-depth article on this
please check out my article / nww tech
you've tomorrow i wrote a full-blown
article on this and you guys see that
now next up on the news today check it
out the new Chromebook pixel what is the
pixel welp it's basically a 12-inch
twelve hundred dollars Chromebook now
it's going to have this awesome pixel
display a storage on it isn't that great
but there's going to be something really
interesting about that now with that
said let's go in and let's check out
what new Google's Chromebook pixel is
all about alright folks so it looks like
the rumors were true google announced
the Chromebook pixel it's a 12-point 85
inch touchscreen chromic with a 2560 x
700 display that packs in the highest
pixel density per inch of any laptop
screen on the market today 239 pixels
per inch that's really incredible now
the Chromebook is going to weigh in at
3.35 pounds and the Chromebook pixel
includes a 1.8 gigahertz dual-core Intel
Core i5 processor intel HD 4000 graphics
4 gigabytes of ram two USB ports now
these USB ports are only two point oh
let's just clarify that right there has
a main display port 2 and 1 card reader
and a 32 gigabyte SSD now Google is also
quoted 25
hours of active use for the battery life
but of course the main attraction is the
display screen it's a 12 point
eight-five display with a 3-2 aspect
ratio 2560 x 1700 at 239 pixels per inch
400 nits screen with 178 degrees extra
wide viewing angle alright folks so with
that said do you guys think that this
thing is kind of overpriced now there's
one thing I want to mention people that
are buying this right now you'll get one
terabyte of Google Cloud storage that's
right so you get a terabyte and you get
it for three years now this usually
costs fifty dollars a month six hundred
dollars a year but if you buy this thing
now you get three years of free one
terabyte storage now if you have the
numbers up that makes the price on this
thing drop significantly because think
about that's eighteen hundred dollars
worth of free shiz Nick a lot of people
have said they think this thing's just
an over power thing to surf the web I
don't know the retina screens really
nice it is a bit pricey at 12 you know
99 or whatever's coming out at you know
we'll see what the prices are because
they always quote them out and they
change they hit the market but it's
right around there so what do you guys
