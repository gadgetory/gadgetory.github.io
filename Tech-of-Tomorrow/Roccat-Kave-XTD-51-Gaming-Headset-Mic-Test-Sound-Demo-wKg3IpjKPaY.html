who just overall love anything that's
frakkin electric welcome to tech Audemar
we're always bringing you all the
electronic items and goodies and gadgets
in tech that we can get our hands on
today we've got something really cool
from the people over at rocket or Roccat
however you want to set a guess it
depends on where you're from I think
Roccat is probably the correction but I
like rocket it just sounds cool right
yeah I know you guys agree so check it
out today we're going to be checking out
the cave xtd 5.1 digital headphones now
these things aren't your normal type of
5.1 headphones most the ones out there
you know are all simulated a lot of
people have called on this or
like hey man that's total
they're not 5.1 these ones are though
each speaker each size of speaker
contains 240 millimeter drivers and a 30
millimeter driver all inside of each
side so you're getting true 5.1
positional audio like one of the big
things that these guys been pushing
about this is that hey these damn things
wherever you go whatever you're doing
you can hear it you know so I basically
farts in a game behind you you're going
to hear it hopefully you won't smell it
but you're supposed to hear it so these
things are pretty badass they are a
little bit pricey they come to a market
$169 but they got their own remote
they've got a breakout box and you can
either use them directly into your
computer at 2.1 or you can use their
sound card which has 5.1 they also have
a lot of software which you can use to
actually and helped yeah they actually
have a lot of software so that you can
actually enhance your sound one of the
things I've heard a lot of people talk
about is this thing called the
brilliance button and out what you guys
hear that I supposed to be pretty cool
so with that said let's go ahead and
take a look at this first let's take a
look at the box we're going to take a
real close look at that um I've heard
that this box is a real nightmare to get
off so I'm not going to sit here and
waste your guys's time as I pull and tug
everything we're going to take a closer
look of the box and then I'll take
everything other box and just show you
guys the content because we're doing a
lot more here than doing an unboxing
we're going to view mic test sound test
all that good so with that said
let's bounce in let's first take a
close-up look at the box alright folks
which is real quick go over the front of
the box the rocket cave xtd 5.1 digital
real 5.1 sound
we went over there it's not simulated at
all head zone 5.1 sound card also
something that's very interesting
bluetooth pairing now I might take a
look at this I got my phone and I
actually download some music so these
things are saying that they'll do
download bluetooth pairing so if I have
my phone with bluetooth I should be able
to hook these speakers up and listen to
this now that'd be awesome because that
would make them slash wireless plus
desktop speakers now you also get the
desktop remote and you get supreme
Cumbres these things I have tons and
tons and tons of padding around them
all kinds of other interesting stuff
along the side they're real quick to
show you guys this is what the box looks
like yummy yummy in your tummy right all
right beside of the box who have
beautiful clear plastic
who's that headphone in the window
that's right
alright spinning around the back of the
box you guys can just see they're just
talking about more output mode switching
you can do external except the little
breakout box actually and one of the A's
is to Phoebus the zoner had something
quite like this but they'd have
headphones it was the sound card with
this kind of breakout box so this got
the opposite direction this is the
headphones with the breakout box being
due on to the USB so alright here's the
other side of the box the bottom block
so you can see something here actually
right here you can see that the desktop
remote right here and you can see it's
very similar to the products I was
saying earlier very similar very similar
alright folks and although we got that
nasty top off and trust me it's kind of
a yeah it's to get off maybe this will
be it's the box you guys can see it
ripped it right here yeah a critic
everybody's a damn critic alright so
first off you get the rocket cave xtd
quick installation guide so everything
that you probably in here too even feels
like there's a CD in here I guess why
not let's just go all the frakkin way
and see what's in here because it feels
like there's a CD in here so that'd be
nice would be nice to have all the
drivers everything on a CD and not have
to go to the internet but you have to go
they don't know all right then rock at
thumbs up for that I bitched about that
before in some of the products and now
they've got some drivers in there so we
got all the drivers everything right
here including some other cool stuff
some notes warranty information and all
that kind of stuff so that's all the
first stuff stuff drivers card
installation guide all that good stuff
alright be putting that back in the box
I'm in it and we've got a little cap
here and the whole thing just slides
right on out then we take the whole box
and vote it the cameraman
man that was close to hit the dog the
dog moon Camryn shaking his head at me
come on that's you're here for come on
here to take subpoena thorn check all
right
here we go - pop top on top it's like
Legos we're just like a little Lego
boxer disassemble it one piece at a time
yeah here we go it up but that Oh crazy
camera just loves this stuff when I
start attacking him like that but you
know it's part of the job around here
next he's gonna want health insurance
file some kind of crazy claim on me
probably those plastic everywhere folks
let's go let's stuff out here all it's
plastic plastic plastic plastic all
right then so hey after all the plastic
check it out so here we go very nice
cable very nice rubber used in this it's
hard for you guys to see this or feel
this but I'm just telling you right now
that this rubber cable is very thick you
can tell it's like very soft but
industrial-type here's where USB plugs
in right here you see you have external
connections so if you want to hook up
extra stuff instead of just these
headphones you can hook up another set
so a person could be with you and you
could be listening to these and your
friend could be right next to you if you
want to check out your game and hear the
sound as well they could be doing that
you've got your channels you can also
select movie mode game mode there's all
kinds of different modes that you can
select with this down here in the front
it's kind of hard to see you can see
your front center woofer rear so you'll
be able to change through here toggle
through and do your different volumes
and the button the right side is the
speaker button allowing you to use
external speakers along with your
headphones and right here we see the
movie button which takes you from a
stereo environment to a 5.1 environment
without going into the software so here
are the headphones now inside like I
said man it's really hard to see but I
can actually see it you folks out man
it's gonna be hard to see I wish I can
take these things apart even further but
I want to break up there so badass but I
can physically see three separate
speakers on the inside of here you can
clearly see there's three speakers now
that's pretty badass and also folks
these
pads are SuperDuper soft I mean they're
super thick they're super soft you guys
can see up here very soft all the way
across the top totally adjustable very
very flexible no breakage like a
freaking pretzel totally adjustable now
the mic can be brought all the way out
of the way they've got a little little
it's it's actually what I call ghetto
well again you can just take this little
clip right here take it off and that
thing will connect right up there and
keep your microphone either way if you
only want to listen to sound otherwise
you can bring it out and you've got this
little adjustable mouthpiece to go
wherever you need it to go so alright
folks so so far these things are very
very comfortable I don't feel my head
getting any stress I could probably wear
these for probably good two or three
hours without having any head stress and
for me that's a long time with gaming
because believe it or not my eye sight
I'll get a headache before that long I'm
good for about three hours in gaming
before I'm like I guess age is slowly
creeping up on my ass that's about what
it is but very comfortable this feels
good let's go ahead now and I'll go
ahead and just pull this little thing up
here they got another one of those
little Clippy things this one is
remaining on here so you won't lose it
I'll go ahead here and top my speaker
folks and I will go ahead and just plug
this in real quick there we go there's
all that so it all lights up you guys
can see microphone on microphone off I
haven't even stalled any of the software
yet but it's saying that my device is
ready to use so I'm sure this isn't
probably 5.1 off the bat but you guys
can see on my screen back here every
well I guess you guys can't see my
screen right now but everything's
installed USB compositive I've cave XD
headset USB input devices all there
alright folks we're getting ready to
give you the sound test but I just want
to show you how you would just did
through all the different sounds so
nothing's written sounds with the
different volume levels so right here
you press front you can see the front
volume level is all the way up it's
adjustable up and down you can switch
through Center subwoofer and rear and
adjust the volume control so however you
want them to be now like I said before
this can either be used for either
stereo or 5.1 you can automatically set
it to how you want to do it
all right folks so here we go we're
going to go ahead and install the
software for this we can see right here
I've installed the CD it's started to
install the driver now alright folks so
here we see the kbecque CD sound console
everything is installed you have your
master your front
here's your bluetooth volume here over
here you have the headset mode it has
stereo or 5.1 surround we're going to be
listening to music so we're just going
to keep it on stereo alright folks so
now let's go ahead and let's do the mic
test alright everybody so you guys can
see I'm using the Windows sound recorder
and this is the mic test of the
brand-new cave xtd digital 5.1
headphones this is the mic test i'm
Elric and you're listening to tech of
tomorrow live on tech talk TV ah alright
folks so there you guys heard it the mic
test works all well and good use it
simple thing through Windows just use
their recording device to record a voice
and stuff doing in-game stuff gets a
little glitchy I thought you guys would
actually prefer to hear with just the
quality of the microphone but that said
let's now move in and let's hear how
these things sound now obviously we
can't give you the full depth immersion
of 5.1 but you guys will be able to hear
the stereo sound and just get you know
kind of a gist of how they sound so
let's go
but back
ha
Oh
Oh
all right folks so there you guys have
it everything that comes in the box the
sound test the mic test the comfort test
pretty much all the testing except for
in Game five point one which really be
senseless because you guys wouldn't be
able to tell that but I'm telling you I
have done and I've played some games and
positioning is very very well I could
bring you guys a test word use do the
microphone you know test excuse me not
the microphone test but the windows test
where I put the thing in there and show
you guys the five point one because
inside of here the five point one is
very very clear when it goes around and
circulates the speakers you can hear
everything clear including the subwoofer
it's a big old boom so these things are
very true 5.1 only negative facts about
it $169 is a little bit pricey but these
things are like right on the cusp of
being audiophile headphones now being
that they had all is 5.1 stuff like that
that's not really totally auto file if
your audio fighters going for the
supreme most awesome sound but these
things are made to be right on the cusp
of being audiophile headphones as well
as gaming and just all around January
use headphones mic works cool they're
pretty comfortable they're bit in the
pricey side but other than that I think
these are very very nice headphones if
you guys look over an Amazon you guys
will see that all the ratings over there
pretty much five-star and down below
that like button which I know you guys
are going to punch and kung-fu hit will
be all the stuff about that's where you
can buy it information all that kinds of
stuff so I'm Mel Rick thanks for
watching Tech tomorrow I think I'll get
back in to do some gaming so I'm up the
kill zone
and be
me
