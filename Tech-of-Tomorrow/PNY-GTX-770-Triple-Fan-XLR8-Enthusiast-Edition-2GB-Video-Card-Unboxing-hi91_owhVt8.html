tech demo we're bringing you all the
tech all the time I'm Eric your host and
we've got a couple of new cards right
here behind me now everybody knows that
the geforce gtx 770 has been out for
quite a while it's been a very popular
card to gigabyte card very similar to
the previous generation gtx 680 it's
ever no electronic issues and all your
DirectX 11 stuff is fully supported yeah
so check this out
PNY some people know the company some
people don't they're actually one of the
OG companies in the computer industry
back in the day and Best Buy and Circuit
City all those places that are now
defunct - including egghead and all the
rest PNY had their products on the shelf
all their memory and everything supplied
the market for many years obviously the
market grew many other people got into
the market and PNY kind of got shifted
off to the side but now they're going
back into things pretty hardcore and
they're making cards that are supposedly
completely non reference what is not in
reference it means it's not based off
the invidious
reference design as far as the cooling
and the PCB goes now this isn't supposed
to have a triple cooling and it's
supposed to be competitive with like the
Asics cooling from EVGA the direct Cu
for the people over a days Zeus when
forced from you know obviously the
people over there gigabyte and the Twin
Frozr from MSI now I don't know I have
never seen these cards before but my
contact Jay hey peace out Jay thanks for
sending these says these things are
pretty badass so let's hop in let's do
the unboxing and see the first look of
these cards and then afterwards we're
actually gonna build a system for you
folks so let's go so here we go folks
we've got two of these the reason why we
have two of these is we're actually
going to build a system and test these
things in SLI and see how well they do
so these are the PNY accelerate
enthusiast edition graphics cards these
are the geforce gtx 770 as I said before
triple fan design now these cards
actually come with a lifetime warranty
which is pretty cool so not to worry
about anything happened with your card
you can replace it two gigabytes of
gddr5 all the basic stuff that you get
with nvidia you guys are familiar with
that just flip it around show you guys
the back of the box since I know a lot
of
they haven't seen these over here to the
right are all the key features I think
that all the Nvidia fans and stuff out
there know these will get to those
actually in a review there's just the
unboxing today we'll go ahead and take
this right here I don't even know if I
need my trusty little knife but I'll go
ahead and use it anyways
coupling a lot of you guys have been
emailing us and asking us you know where
we get the sound I will ask the guys to
put the sound clip in the description
below for you guys since I know a lot of
you guys have been asking about what
that sound clip is so here we get the
box out of the way we'll get the other
one just out of the way so we can do
this properly well pop a cap right here
we got once again the old box ception
thing going on because there's always a
box inside of a box inside of a box so
there you go it's all white box nothing
pretty there spinning around yet it's
confusing right I agree alright here's
some of the nomenclature right here just
specifies which card is actually in the
box
that'll tap here pop the tab box up on
top you see a nice little foam thing
Evert I will put the cameras on okay so
you missed that actually I threw that
and hit myself not good alright so
inside we have a very interesting driver
CD here you can see this one was
high-tech design they spent a lot of
time on the design here the artist
behind this probably should get some
kind of like a pay raise or something
because there's a lot of Detailers you
guys can see and they extensively go
into what it is right here all right set
that off to the side what do we got
going on here we've got the QuickStart
guide the guide did the Maharaja's
r√°pida and the guy at the Insignia
rapido that's right in multi languages
that's right we're worldly around here
so that's inside there we get your DVI
to VGA adapter for those people who
still have those monitors last time I
said nobody use them you guys said oh
yeah sure some of us do alright and I
apologize if you do but hey it's cool
we'll move out of the way there anything
else in there anything else in there
nope so that's it as far as that goes
we'll set that up there on top the old
speaker
nice and loud there and if they pull the
card out of now we'll start on the back
now I know a lot of people are going to
probably say what the heck is that PCB
because it is kind of having that kind
of somewhat brown look you can see there
are four screws right here this is pre
moving the cooling solution also the
PCBs slightly shorter than the entire
length of the card on the bottom we see
the pcie 3.0 interface at the top we see
the two sli fingers you can do triple
SLI with these cards here along the side
of the card you can clearly see the
aluminum heat fins which help dissipate
the heat away from the card we have a
six pen and an eight pin power connector
here so you need 75 and 150 right there
and it'll be an additional 75 through
the PCIe flip the card around nice and
clean looking all the way down but you
guys see the other side and I know I've
been a little prick tease the entire
time so here you go here is the triple
fan design and it looks pretty nice
underneath you can see that there are
heat pipes and aluminum heat fins all of
the heat is taken up into the card and
dissipate it out through by the fans now
this one is slightly open our
architecture but the shroud does cover
the entire card so I'm not exactly sure
how that works when we get in the system
and see how it cools that'll be the
defining moment we'll flip around the
back dvi-i DVID
standard DisplayPort standard HDMI so
basically get the card and adapter and
you get that little user's manual and
that's what comes in the box alrighty
guys so there you have it the brand new
P and Y geforce gtx 770 with its new
triple fan cooling let me hear your
comments down below by the way if you
guys interested in purchasing this card
or getting more information we'll have a
link down there below the like button
which i know you guys are going to
karate-kick and it'll be all down there
so if you guys want to check that out go
ahead and do so also if you're not
subscribed they'll be a little clicker
back here where you guys can subscribe
also
you guys I haven't been following the
challenge to your first vid
we're giving away a $59 PC and we just
did it a crazy introduction on a video
that we're gonna be having for in the
house game capture system which actually
had a lot of controversy because a lot
of people seem to think that dxtory and
fraps is better and let me tell you
ain't happenin anyways I'm Eric thanks
for watching Tekken tomorrow we're gonna
be putting these cards in the system
then talking more about them for you
folks out there so see</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
