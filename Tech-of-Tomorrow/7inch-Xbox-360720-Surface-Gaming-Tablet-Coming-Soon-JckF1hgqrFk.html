tech fans and friends it's me I work
here once again in the tech of tomorrow
youtube channel now you guys all know
the Microsoft Surface RT hit the market
with mix three views people said it was
a little bit pricey through development
wasn't quite what they wanted mixed
reviews but would you guys think if
Microsoft actually brought a 7-inch
tablet to the market that was completely
dedicated to gaming now we've seen all
the different tablets that have been out
there we've seen the Nexus we've seen
the kindle fire we've seen the iPads
we've seen even the ipad minis and we
know is gonna be in nexus 10 coming up
too so we got all kinds of pads out
there Microsoft has allegedly had plans
leaked for a dedicated 7-inch tablet
1280 by 720 resolution supposedly going
to feature arm technology all kinds of
stuff now here's going to be the big
thing about this the applications that
are run on it is going to really depend
on where they start off if they use x86
if they use arm what they decided this
factors going to be a big factor in how
well this thing works now additionally
there might be the option of actually
being able to hook up a you know
keyboard to it or it might be in
addition to the xbox 720 or 360 what its
exact purpose is no one really knows but
it's rumored to come out there so what
do you folks think would you guys be
down if Microsoft really came out with a
7-inch tablet that was just a total ass
 kicker in games would you guys be
down with having it and would you
support that product now I've seen lots
of negative comments out there where
people feel like Microsoft is trying to
take everybody and just shove them into
a box and make them be under their wing
but that said if they do it right
couldn't that be a benefit to me and you
I mean if I could go ahead and grab a
7-inch tablet and the graphics were just
totally awesome on it and the gameplay
was smooth and it was really cool and it
was actually cheaper you know room early
it's gonna be about 150 bucks I'd be
down with that now this sounds like a
product that you'd be interested in you

tomorrow so peace out and we'll see you
