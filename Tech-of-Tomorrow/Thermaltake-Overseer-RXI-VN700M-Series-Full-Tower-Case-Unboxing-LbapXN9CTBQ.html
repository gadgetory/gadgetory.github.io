here at Tech of tomorrow Down Under
today I'm bringing you a review and a
case unboxing of something very nice
from the people over at thermal sake
today ladies I'll be bringing you the
overseer let's try this is the RX one
the case unboxing it tastes good you put
a shrimp on the barbie and put a case in
the Barbie it's all delicious that said
let's go check out what comes inside
this rightful a night boss from the
people over a thermos a game
all right so check it out folks before
we actually unbox this thing let's just
talk a little bit about it basically the
part number this is the VN 700 m1 w2n
it's a full tower case the dimensions
are 535 by 220 by 580 millimeters or
that's 21 point one eight point seven or
twenty two point eight inches depending
on where you're at the weight of this
thing is ten point three kilograms or
twenty two point seven pounds and
there's also a side window inside and
outside are all completely painted black
to make it look really cool as far as
the inside as fans you get one front
intake fan one rear exhaust fan one top
exhaust fan a side fan and a bottom
intake fan
these fans vary in size being the front
is two hundred by two hundred by 30 the
rear is 120 by 120 the top exhaust you
have an option of two 200 by 200 by 30s
and the side intake is also a two
hundred by two hundred by thirty
millimeter fan there's an optional
bottom of intake fan as well which would
be a hundred and twenty by one hundred
twenty by twenty five millimeters the
drive bays it has three 5.25 bays and
one can be changed to a 3.5 bay as well
there are a five hidden 3.5 or 2.5 bays
your choice it also has HDD docking on
the top of the case which is really cool
for you sticking in an SSD or a hard
drive that you want to take the
information it'll also take motherboards
anywhere from a micro ATX to an ATX all
the way to extended ATX the i/o ports on
the outside are USB 3.0 you have two of
them USB 2.0 you have two of them eSATA
you have one an HD and an audio you have
one of those as well so anyways those
are pretty much the basic features of
the case we're doing something a little
different you can actually see those on
the screen as well now let's actually
jump in and let's begin the unboxing of
this cool new case alright then so
without much further ado let's get this
bad boy unbox like usual start out with
me trusty knife it's a beauty so we need
to check it I'm certain the case here on
the top will have some cool sound
effects like always I'll take the knife
and we'll go
okay we got that so basically there's a
bunch of different ways you can do this
I'm actually going to use a throwing
star and kill the cameraman no I'm just
kidding the folks can't kill the
cabman's but I killed him who would film
the thing seriously wait
mind control does it work no I guess not
neither cameraman got to give the
cameraman love so he is my pop the top
here I'm gonna go ahead and toss the
trusty knife up to the side without
hitting the cat or the dog for that
matter
get the old knife and put it back here
this is kind of really cool thing I'm
digging it whip it over take the thing
turn like this now hopefully I will not
hit the microphone up here oh yeah now
Cameron Cameron real quick show the box
and let's give the audience some sound
effects box top begins all right you
guys know I love that I live for
that it's crazy
alright a little pop one of these off
some more sound effects what uno mas
were you non-latin people out there that
means one more alright we got a nice big
plastic bag here we will remove you got
a plastic bag plastic bag is off let's
go on and I'll check it out
we'll start off right here and the front
of the case with the overseer also got
this little goodie right here
so here at the front of the case see all
the drive bays are here really nice
color coordinated trying to see how
these think they're just pop off here
not go over the whole front of the thing
make sure I'm not missing too much here
alright that all seems pretty solid so
you guys can you see all the bays here
there's four but you can see out here
externally it's gonna be intake fan here
I keep thinking that something just
supposed to pop off or come out of here
but I guess it's
smoother at the top this is actually
really well-made I like these
these are really cool this lights up
says it had like a breath type lighting
so it's gonna breathe kind of funky you
guys can see that 1 2 USB 3.0 2 USB 2.0
external eSATA your headphones your mic
and then right here this is where you
can pop in a hard drive SST and take
that information up here on top it's
kind of hard to see but there's also
room for two fans in here meet
personally if I use this case I'm
probably gonna want to put a triple wrap
or a dual right up here on top what
everyone fits because it just looks kind
of cool my thing is gonna be a nice one
to work with I'm gonna flip around show
you guys the side we have a side window
with some plastic I will go ahead and
remove yon plastic so we see a side when
I hear that so you can look through the
case also is gonna be mounted a big fan
here if you want there are two screws in
the back here these are the hand
tightening time go ahead and take off
one go ahead and take off the other go
ahead and just set those off the side
here for right now pop these side off oh
I love that you guys love that too the
big boom boom so anyways let's take a
look at the inside of this a mesh screen
here you could actually put a fan here
if you wanted to want to make it noisy
on the window inside I guess we have an
additional plastic piece in here we're
good with that
there now you can actually see how nice
it looks before we actually go to the
inside of the case I'm just going to
flip it around and show you guys the
rear you guys can see there's a rear
exhaust fan here room for all of your
cards down here if you're using a water
system you have the two holes right here
that you can put your fingers in power
supply to goes down here
nothing fancy let's go ahead and remove
the other side panel and let's see what
the cable management options are going
to be like on this overseer rx1 let me
get these off
mmm that one's a bugger all right there
I got it
nothing too fancy about that side panel
go ahead and move out of the way now
let's flip it around the side let's take
a look at how cute man is going to be my
hand can fit in here pretty decently no
sharp edges of any type at all now the
motherboard tray is not removable not
too many people use it anymore probably
mrs. Rodney Reynolds off to no you know
what
in those degrees but I don't really care
about that this is what's important I
can access the back of my motherboard
I can access my CPU through this window
right here so everything's fine cable
management looks like it's gonna be
pretty good I won't know telling you we
bit the thing together but it's
something that look down here you've got
places for all your cables to come
through here on the side as well you've
got all of your stuff if your
connections in the front all coming
through going inside of the case you
would have connect them very easily but
let that wraps I'm gonna get the
gibberish but me so far it looks pretty
good here's one of the fan connectors
right here for the upper fan so I think
Killman pen should be halfway decent
here we find an accessories bag has a
bunch extra parts in the case all inside
of here that's pretty cool well jump
back down here again you can see that
here these were all your drives are
going to go
I'm sure there's stuff that's gonna be
in here though just pop them on in there
they should be all tooless like most of
the cases nowadays I don't imagine we're
gonna see too much difference there then
let's go ahead and let me bring it
around and let's take a look at the
inside alright so as the kaminari focus
is on the side here we'll take a look
right here
we see all of these are completely to
looks for watching you drive
you just pop your drives in and you can
lock them in place also right here all
of these are slider bays they also come
with all the mounting material for
putting either a standard hard drive or
an SSD in these these are all very nice
and
you work with very nice move around
inside here you can see there's plenty
of room on the inside of the case
clean the hell again here's your USB 3.0
cable some people complain about these I
don't know why you complain about these
these are much easier to use you stick
them right in your motherboard who cares
about the little bracket that comes in
either they use my case and everything
else is here - all your SATA everything
else all your hardware connections are
right here also on the bottom I forget
to mention on the bottom there's also
this removable little thing here this
nice grill for keeping all your dust and
everything it's also washable you can
use that last but not least let me show
you guys the body of the case somebody
ever really do we can see there's all
extra-large feet now the reason these
extra large feet are good if your case
is too close to the ground think about
there's not going to be really any place
to get ventilation so if you're using
these optional bottom fans you're gonna
want to have this clearance ah there we
go sorry about that folks sometimes a
little late in the game
let's pop around the front one last time
before we go into some boxing you see
that pops off completely there's the big
TT sports fan mesh grilles are removable
and washable all the way up on every Bay
alright folks so check it out the top of
the case is actually movable as well you
can go a pop right here you'll go ahead
and just tilt this back so that you guys
can see this is I'm gonna actually hook
everything but this is totally removable
right here you can see there's a giant
fan in there now but I believe that you
can easily fit a dual rad here on the
top if you undo liquid cooling otherwise
you have the option these giant fans so
but either way it's completely removable
you can see all the connectors in there
now really close if you're looking there
you can see all the SATA connections in
there for plugging in the external hard
drives basically the case in the raw so
alright folks that's it we'll see you
back here again here on techie tomorrow
we'll we'll have a shrimp on the barbie
waiting for a you lads see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
