here once again and this time we're
gonna show you guys the top 5 tech
products under $50 so first up we have
the suteki ST WDS xx dual sonic conical
V 20 computer speakers boy is that a
mouthful now these things will work on
your Mac laptops and your PC and you
guys can see these things are pretty
damn bright being white in color they
feature a wired volume control no
drivers are required to just plug in and
go they're powered by USB have a sleek
rubberized matte finish and for under
$30 they offer pretty decent sound they
also have some pretty nice cups on them
what do you know they double as a crazy
set of headphones nah I'm just joshing
what she put up these things are pretty
cool the conical design the way they
lean back and sit back they're really
nice if you got a clean desktop area you
want just to remain clean without any
gaudy colors Hey
these might be the a ticket for you and
next up we have the most futuristic
telephone you guys have ever seen it was
so kind of old school and new no I'm
just kidding with you guys this thing is
the Milken wireless charger that's right
so it's ready for all your new s7 edge
s6 edge is ready for all those phones
are not stuff absolute while I was
charging you just place your device on
here and it charges it up the nuking key
is not only a standard desktop wireless
charging station it also doubles as an
LED lamp works with your Samsung s7 s7
edge s6 s6 edge s6 edge+
galaxy s5 galaxy note 3 the Nexus 5 and
the Nokia 1520 and other than the
wireless charging that the key offers
you can also use it as a USB charging
device as well but honestly what's
really cool about this device though is
that it doubles is this little horn
light which is operated very simple the
little button here in the end you simply
hold your thumb on it as you hold your
thumb it will go all the way up to its
ultimate brightness then you just remove
your thumb put your thumb back on it and
it'll start dimming until it turns off
so it's pretty cool it'll work on your
desktop and where the garlis or whether
you need a really bright light or just a
really dim light it'll do the job so you
can get rid of your desk light and
use the key and right now you can get
this Milken for 40 bucks now next up we
got a set of cans that have a crazy name
now these are the blue do turbine t2
Bluetooth wireless headphones so it's
kind of weird you know blue deal were
they thinking about Ronnie James Dio
were they you know the man owned the
seal the mountain
maybe they were I don't know but anyways
now these bad boys are actually on sale
right now for $29.99 they come in
actually four different colors so
regardless of what color color you're
like you like red you like blue you like
white you like black people they have a
color to suit you now these things are
pretty cool because they have a
57-millimeter driver that's right so
inside of here is a very huge driver
listen to these things and they do offer
pretty decent sound um they're actually
a little bit more bass ease and you know
some of the other ones I've seen that
are Wireless a lot of the Bluetooth
wireless stuff I get sounds very very
flat these were a little bit more bassy
than the other ones now some cool design
features of the turbine t2s are that
they offer completely hands-free
operation which means that if you need
to answer your phone or anything like
that there's a built-in microphone
inside of the phones for you to answer
them which is pretty cool they also
offer a very comfort band on the top
that's nice and comfortable in your head
plenty of flexibility there they offer
very nice and comfortable cups and these
things aren't very heavy so even when
they're on your head you don't feel like
you're lugging around a giant headset
now as far as connectivity goes on the
left hand side we see a simple single
3.5 millimeter jack and on the right
hand side first up we see the USB input
jack this is for charging your cans and
the next we see the fast forward reverse
and pause then the power button and then
last but not least the volume control
switches and they also totally fold up
for ultimate portability now next step
we have the Aki 20,000 milliamp hour
totally portable power bank now this
thing has a lot of different features
and features connectivity for micro USB
and lightning and it also doubles as a
really cool flashlight so all you got to
do is push a little button here on the
end and you got yourself not only a
little power in charging station got
yourself a flashlight let's check out
the other features
now some of the really cool features
about this Powerbank are first off it'll
work with either your Apple devices or
your Samsung devices and pretty much any
type of USB device that's out there or
lightning device and the cool thing is
is that as soon as you plug in anything
in it automatically detects that device
and provides the maximum amount of power
to make sure it gets charged fast the aw
key features rapid input charging which
means if using a DC 5 volt 2 amp input
when using a 2 amp charger recharge time
is twice as fast as a normal 5 volt 1
amp input Bank which can reduce charging
time by up to 50% now I know that a
charging bank isn't absolutely the most
exciting tech product on the planet but
the thing is it's one of those things
like kind of a backbone and type product
if you're out on the go and you need to
charge something you don't want to waste
time either trying to change out your
battery all that stuff having this
device can be very helpful to you and
also the fact that it does double is
this little flashlight it's pretty cool
because if you're coming home or
something you got in your bag and you
lost your keys or something or if you're
just like working around in a computer
room and you know there's not a lot of
light and you want to use to look around
it'll double as that function as well so
that's pretty cool stuff so at the end
of the day it's thirty dollars twenty
thousand milliamp hours it'll charge
anything out there be it Apple be it
Samsung it's Universal baby and it's
thirty bucks
now last up folks another set of
headphones this time the tune phonics
BTX 20 now these things are also a
wireless bluetooth set of headphones
that offers some of the same features of
the ones that we looked at previously
now these things they call these things
a not a color scheme that I agree with
but I don't know I want to hear you guys
at painting around the back what would
you guys actually call this color I call
it like a slime green the company
themselves they call this the green gray
design and some of the features about
these $40.00 headphones that they offer
an advanced type of Bluetooth
connectivity that actually makes the
highs and the mittens sounds of the
headphones actually come out much more
efficient than the bass like we also saw
in the previous set of headphones and
tune phonics states that the very
flexibility of this band and these cups
are made for people who are running or
doing a lot of exercise so let's real
quick to see if they stay on my ears
what I do some like crazy stuff let's
see it
and yeah they're probably not good for
moshing either okay I know that was a
little extreme and over-the-top but how
about just for running okay and like I
said these things are 40 bucks I mean I
don't know if they're exactly the most
high-end headphones out there but
they're pretty cool if you want
something it has a really cool color
you know combination to it there's
really nothing else like this is you
guys can see even in a moment of crazy
go for it
they still almost in your head now the
mockers and the guys who do the stuff
like that almost drop them by that much
you know weights folks that's it man the
top 5 cool tech products for under $50
and like usual all the information will
still be down the pool and like but
which hopefully by now you know what the
frack to do with it I'm Miller you've
been watching techie tomorrow and this
is like I said in the top 5 under $50 we
back for more tech later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
