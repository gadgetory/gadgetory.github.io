you guys are watching tech of tomorrow
glad to see you guys here what's going
on today well today we have something
really nice on the table this is the
brand new and videos okie TX 960 card
that's right this thing got released a
few days ago this is the amp Edition
which means it comes overclocked
out-of-the-box you guys can see the card
right here in my hand but let's jump in
right now let's take a look at the card
itself the speeds and feeds the
performance and at the end of the day
with this card is worth your cash take a
look at the front of the card you guys
can see there's obviously two giant fans
right there on the front to keep that
bad boy cool now underneath that we can
see all the aluminum heat fans and we
can also see the copper heat pipes
running all through there
these things are used to help dissipate
all of the heat away from the GPU down
below that you guys can see the PCIe 16
interface and we flipped the card to the
side you guys can once again see some
more of those little tiny heat fins
showing off the side of the card
flipping around the back of the card you
guys can see that the metal shroud
completely encases it but underneath
that you guys can still see evidence of
the copper heat pipes flip it around to
the other side you guys can see there's
a single 6 pin power connector on the
EVGA it had a single nine pin power
connector which makes the power
consumption a little bit lower on this
card and then we have a single SLI
finger for doing SLI testing as we flip
it on the back once again we can see the
zotac nomenclature and this time we see
a complete shield covering the back
which I know that you guys liked last
but not least on the rear i/o we show
the same 5 port connection as we do in
the other cards which is a single DVI a
single HDMI and three display ports
let's take a look at what actually comes
in the box if we were doing an unboxing
this is actually what you would see now
let's take a closer look of the
brand-new gtx 960 the geforce gtx 960
ships with a thousand 24 cuda cores and
8sm units the memory subsystem of the
geforce gtx 960 consists of two 64-bit
memory controllers equaling 128-bit with
2 gigabytes of gddr5 memory there are 64
texture units and 32 op units based off
the GM 206 chipset the new geforce gtx
960 has been
to deliver great gaming performance at
1080p with the graphics settings cranked
up and FXAA MF AAA or 4x AAA enabled the
GTX 960 will even deliver playable frame
rates with 4k DSR when playing MOBA
games like League of Legends the TDP of
the 960 is hundred and twenty watts and
a recommended power supply is a 400 watt
power supply thermal threshold is that
95 Celsius the base clock speed of the
geforce gtx 960 is eleven hundred and
twenty six megahertz the base clock
speed of the zotac card is set at twelve
hundred and sixty-six megahertz
the typical boost clock speed on a
reference card is eleven hundred and
seventy eight megahertz the boost clock
speed of the zotac card is set at
thirteen hundred and twenty-nine
megahertz so there you have it there's
what the card looks like how nice it is
you guys think it's pretty nice black
all the way around gonna fit any system
but now that we've seen that lets first
jump in let's take a look at our test
system it's based on an i7 4770k and
then let's check out those benchmarks
with what you guys all love the
benchmarks on
all right folks so there you guys have
it
everything about the brand-new ZOTAC amp
edition gtx 960 this car is a little
smaller than the EVGA it also runs a
little cooler thirty-five and seventy
six that's right so thirty-five on idle
and 76 on full load which is kind of
weird it's a little bit hotter on idle
but cooler under full load that probably
has to do with the fact that this card
is actually clocked just slightly lower
this card like I said is 1266 on the
clock and 1329 on the boost either cards
are a little bit higher than that now
this card is gonna be coming to market
at about two hundred nine dollars prices
are going to fluctuate knows gonna be
some pounds below goal I found for this
price I found this price well the price
is supposed to be at this new egg has
the price is pretty locked in right now
I know that other places out there
charging a little bit more money so you
just got to shop carefully to find all
those prizes now personally me for 200
bucks I think this is an awesome awesome
card black bear you're gonna say oh yeah
the two eighties fast roller 280 is also
almost $100 more sometimes more than
$100 in some cases so you expected to
beat it and there are people out there
who obviously just don't have that extra
hundred bucks
they just don't so for the two hundred
dollar price range I have to say that
the new 9cq series all the way around
kicks ass and this car with this nice
small build it's excellent back and
everything I have to say this is a nice
editor's choice card here on techo
tomorrow like usual all the details to
review will be down below like but which
hopefully you guys will hit and like
this video so if you can buy all these
cars just find out more information
about that look down there just hit more
info and you will have all that stuff so
thanks for watching tikka tomorrow I'm
Eric we'll see you guys back in the
channel the next video is si
this see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
