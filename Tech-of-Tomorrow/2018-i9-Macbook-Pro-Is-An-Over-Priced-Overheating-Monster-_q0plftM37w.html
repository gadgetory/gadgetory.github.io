by Corsair if you are looking for a nice
set of wireless gaming headphones that
will not break your piggy bank and still
have a lot of nice features the Corsair
hf 70 s may be just what you were
looking for with features like true 2.4
gigahertz connectivity a removable mic
easy to adjust controls and solid sound
these headphones are perfect for their
price range the HS 70 headphones work
with your PC Xbox or Playstation 4 and
come to market at under $100 check them
out and see what you think ok I know
that most of my audience are definitely
PC fans but there's some crazy stuff
going on right now over on the Apple
side of things I just thought I would
bring the table and share with you guys
now you guys all know that Apple
definitely in the last few years seems
to have stagnated from the powerhouse
they once were and now Apple has this
brand-new eye 9 laptop so brand new
MacBook Pro things like $3,000 and the
big rumors and the thing that's all
surrounding and bringing a bunch of hype
is that people are saying that due to
the design of this new laptop and the
way the processor throttles because
let's just face it the laptop is very
very thin and we'll get to that in a
minute it's going to throttle a little
bit but the big controversy is that
everybody is saying at this new laptop
even though it's a supreme price and
cost all this money it's performing a
lot worse than the previous generation I
7 version of the laptop now Jonathan at
TLD actually has run a bunch of tests
and through real world applications
excuse me real world applications oh
that sounded kind of funny he's proven
that this is actually not true
whatsoever so we'll the link down below
to his channel where you guys can check
that out where he runs all his tests and
everything and I think he's actually
gonna have a follow up video to that as
well
he shows that honestly that's not really
true whatsoever but for me being a PC
guy it's obvious though if you build a
laptop and you're using the latest Intel
processors and we now all know that
Intel's had problems with he
and all this other stuff lately you know
the laptop should have better cooling
solution inside of it I mean these
laptops come to market they basically I
think they have like a 500 gigabyte SSD
16 gigabytes of RAM you know and then
they add the latest I nine processors is
a six core you know twelve thread
processor if you're gonna build
something like this with such a
powerhouse of the CPU I don't really
think that baking it so thin and so
light is really the best design anywhere
and this is where I think Apple really
screwed up in this particular product is
that the cooling solution is honestly
it's a fail Jonathan does show in the
videos that the CPU is not running as
well as it should
due to the throttling now obviously it's
not being faster I mean I excuse me
obviously it's not being slower than the
previous generation but it is not living
up to its full capacity of a CPU
whatsoever because the CPU starts to
throttle from the heat that's going to
be less performance
now most people always know and the
biggest complaint for me where specs
from the PC Guide side of things is that
you know these MacBook Pros cost way too
much I mean let's just face it if you
were to spend over $3,000 and get
yourself a gaming laptop on the PC side
of things man you're talking about a 17
inch screen geez saying probably 64
gigabytes of RAM 1080 we're talking
about fully decked out computer on the
PC side of things for that side of money
but on the Mac side of things
charging $3,000 honestly for a laptop
that throttles is complete total
bullcrap I think that everybody should
honestly probably veto this product and
tell Mac to go jump on the bandwagon of
going backwards because that's where it
seems they're going even though this
thing does have all the latest greatest
features it's slightly upgradeable the
very fact the CPUs throttling getting
hot just makes it a complete drawback
now you could possibly you know get an
external laptop cooler notice things
that flip up and they have fans on it
and that might help a little bit but
that really doesn't help when you're
traveling around and most of the guys
who use the Mac books
stuff like that they're guys who travel
around all over the place and they want
a light laptop that has a lot of power
in it you know and in the past you know
Apple has successfully sold this product
to you know billions of probably people
is millions of people around the world
and may a crap ton of cash doing it but
at this point for them to release a
laptop which CPU gets hot and throttles
and actually cuts away from the
performance that's kind of really to my
eyes kind of a shady thing that's like
kind of selling me a car that if I go a
certain speed limit my engine gets hot
and then the engine just goes back now
sure maybe it's faster than the previous
v6 I was running but still if I'm gonna
be buying something that's new I want to
be able to perform at its absolute best
capabilities are you with me with this
because I think that you are you know if
you go out and you spin especially
$3,000 on a laptop
there should be no performance issues
whatsoever and having a CPU that's
overheating and throttling to me that's
a complete utter red flag I would never
purchase one of these new laptops and
honestly I think anybody out there who's
actually buying these things is probably
after they get them and use them
probably is starting to think about it
and getting a little pissy as well
because even though it does perform
better than the previous I 7 generation
the i7 generation didn't throttle is bad
and you can probably get that particular
version for a lot less money now that
this new one has come out now the only
thing that I can honestly say about Mac
products that I can say it's a cool
thing is that usually when you have Mac
products and you go to sell them you do
get a good value on your dollar most pcs
that they're used you see the the
monetary value of the product actually
go down it really never goes up with Mac
products it's kind of like buying a
Harley or buying a Gibson because it has
that name it does have a better resale
value than PC stuff and I know that's
the way Jonathan looks at things he gets
these products he reviews them if
they're not really good hey he just
sells them trades them off or get
something you know new or better or just
different to suit his needs so at the
end of the day I think Apple need
to really refocus what they're doing it
just seems like right now the company
doesn't really know what's going on with
itself for one thing the person who's
running the company right now is not
really a guy who's an idea man he's a
guy who is great at running a company
making sure things get taken care of but
he's no Steve Jobs and I'm not trying to
insult the guy or anything but you know
his thinking and basically thinking
outside of the bubble or thinking of new
things to do is just not the same as the
company was before and since they always
relied on pretty much having something
innovative that their users really liked
making products that are starting to go
backwards and not do as well is really a
bad thing for Apple and selling a laptop
and knowing right off the bat that the
CPU is going to throttle and not give
you the absolute best performance
shame on you Apple now I know most of my
ears will be like yeah screw those guys
but if you're an Apple guy let me know
what you think but personally I think
that buying a laptop for $3,000 should
have absolutely no issues whatsoever
Apple needs to get a really swift kick
in the butt and make them wake up and
redesign and make different products
there should be no reason for your CPU
to be getting hot and to be throttling
in a $3,000 product piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
