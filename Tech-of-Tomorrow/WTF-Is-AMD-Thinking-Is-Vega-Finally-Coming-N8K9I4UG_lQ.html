once again to take it tomorrow I'm Eric
your host and there's something that's
want to talk to you guys about
so we've now seen the brand new rx 580
and rx 570 hit the market but in all
honesty after seeing this launch I got a
really questions to set to answer and I
don't mean it's no disrespect but Andy
what the you thinking man this is
the weirdest honestly weirdest launch
I've ever seen from AMD if you guys
follow Chen you guys do I go out of my
way all the time to make sure I support
AMD as much as possible but this
particular launch has me in quite a
little bit of conundrum in my brain
because I just really don't see the
point of it the 570 card pretty much has
its balls cut off it's only four
gigabyte card so it's kind of weaker
almost in a 480 in a lot of instances so
why is that particular card even coming
out at all now the 580 I can kind of see
why did want to get that out because it
does complete a lot better with the 10
60 even at overclocked n 60 a lot better
but that's just such a wee bit of an
important help for performance increase
but I got to say to myself just what the
hell is going on with this launch I mean
I thought it was Vega in fact I kept
emailing them over and over again saying
hey this big I was all happy excited is
this Vegas Vegas they were ignoring my
emails and in fact I almost missed this
entire launch because even though these
cards were coming out for some reason
every time I emailed AMD they didn't say
 to me in all honesty I found out
about these cards by rumors online I was
like oh there's a new release coming so
I call a button they're like oh yeah
there is so I really only had about
three days with the cards I mean it
really we only have these card for such
a short time I don't feel like I got to
dig totally in but since it's a brand
new release and we know all the drivers
not surf we're going to need catching up
with I'm just in my head kind of
wondering why AMD actually did this I
don't know have the AMD fans out there
are going to react I know you guys are a
hardcore bunch but do you really see
yourself going out and buying a card
that requires more power than any other
card you pretty much see Melissa's like
you know got two new GPUs on it because
the rx 580 man it is a power requirement
the same as that of a GTX 1080
I so that means if we're going to be
building crossfire systems or anything
like that you're going to have to get a
much bigger power supply with more
connectors on it just to do that so if
you're thinking you can just go out and
just like hey change out your 480 system
and then throw these cards in there
well you can't and to be honest with you
a 1080 sli only takes 2 8 10 power
connectors one for each card where the
RX for 580 excuse me takes a single 6
pin and a single 8 pin to power that
card now that to me is just very
confusing even though the car did run
cool and everything why bring a card to
market that requires so much freaking
power but only brings that little bit of
a performance game at the moment
performance can't excuse me
I just really at the end of the day
don't know what's going on with this I
don't mean to kick AMD but at the end of
the day when I look at these cards I
look at the performance of them I got to
really say to myself Andy what the
are you guys thinking because this to me
is just kind of weirdest thing ever I
definitely want to hear your guys
opinions down below it is a bit
controversial but that's just the way it
goes
570 in my opinion has its balls cut off
doesn't even perform really as good as
the RX for 80 around the same price a
little bit a little bit cheaper for the
card but the performance just isn't
there why even bring a card to market
but does that I mean sure is a little
bit faster than a 470 well yeah sure
slightly faster but for that small bit
of performance I just don't think it's
worth it to go out and dump your cards
and buy new cards like I said in my
previous video if you don't own an AMD
card whatsoever and you're strictly an
AMD family you want their stuff in your
system and you're like NVIDIA well
then hey maybe buying a brand new card
this will be cool and if you have no
problem with the higher power
requirements but hey good for you as
well at the end of the day I have to say
out of all the releases I've seen in my
career this is the weirdest refresh I've
ever seen and I just wonder what is AMD
thinking doing this they should have
waited a little bit longer my opinion
came out with a little bit better of a
card and this is truly the stop gate I'm
hearing until next year so that means
this is all you're going to see from AMD
what I'm hearing so far until we see the
Vega and that's a little bit of a way
off so I'm mark you guys are watching
Tekken Amaro what do you guys think I'm
really just not all that impressed with
this launch and I'm just wondering what
AMD was thinking with this is this just
something to get some quick cash because
as far as performance goes I just don't
see these things being that great of an
upgrade from the previous generation
