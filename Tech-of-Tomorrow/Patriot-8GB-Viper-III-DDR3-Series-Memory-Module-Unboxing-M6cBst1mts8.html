and instead of gaming I Elric feresten
here bringing another video to you folks
the unboxing and first look of something
brand new from the people over at
patriot now this is their new Viper
but this memory is actually hand-picked
now it's supposed to run at 21 33
megahertz and what they're saying by
hand-picked that this stuff has actually
been put in a machine tested made sure
that it actually runs at this mega
before it's shipped out to you
it also features some new type of
cooling now it's passive cooling but
obviously have used a different type of
heat sink or something on it to make it
you know unique so with that said let's
hop in and let's see what this stuff is
in the box it's also about 60 bucks and
you can get anymore Amazon all over the
web so with that said let's pop the cap
and see what it's all about
so there's only gonna be one little
insertion near the top nice simple one
right there pop the top right here oh if
you guys really want to see the box here
I'll let you guys see the box real quick
if you want to see a close-up of it
there's the front of it and then here's
the back of it but you can actually see
the memory what it is right on the side
oh I see the plastic there so for those
you diehards there's that and let's pull
out the plastic container we'll start
off with the front side we can see it's
gonna fight / logo you can see the fins
all on the top of each one of these
that's their custom passive cooling
solution so it's probably actively
touching all the chips inside of here so
if there is any heat it's being
dissipated through these little
membranes so let's flip it around se the
backside
go and remove it out those two guys with
some close ups and pull it out of here
real quick you know get back in the
camera range pop cap pop memory out oh
that's really shiny and really
nice-looking stuff so let me hold up so
you guys get a real close-up really nice
stuff looks very cool 21:33 isn't the
fastest but it's pretty good make your
system run faster pretty decent for
overclockers once again here's the back
now like I said this is an 8 gigabyte
kit these are 200 megabyte sticks let me
pop the other one out from the package
over here gonna see them front and back
together there now you guys may have
seen yesterday that crazy video I did in
the Tron thing because I'm gonna be
building a total Tron system and I'm
actually gonna bug my friend over at
this company Patriot to give me some
more this because look at the memory up
close it actually has almost that Tron
like look to it it's not a perfect color
match but I can see this going in my
Tron system and looking very Trani it's
shiny got some nice little blue white
lines in it I think it's gonna be a
winner so that's it guys 60 bucks 8
gigabytes still run pretty cool 21 33
megahertz see you guys back here on
Tucker tomorrow on Monday so hasta
