the month and so it's once again time
for the top 10 tech deals for the end of
March you know what buddy says he says
they're the best doggone deals you're
gonna see this month now this first item
it's not really on sale but for fifty
dollars the 7-inch amazon fire tablet is
a great deal features Wi-Fi eight
gigabytes of internal storage 171 pixel
per inch 1024 x 600 resolution screen
and internally it has a one point three
gigahertz quad-core processor powering
the tablet it also features rear and
front-facing cameras and even the amazon
underground which features a
one-of-a-kind app store and there is
actually over twenty thousand dollars in
apps and games and even in-app items
that are actually free including extra
lives and games unlock levels unlimited
add-on packs and more and like i said
there's eight gigabytes of internal
storage and it even has a micro SD card
for up to 120 gigabytes of additional
storage the fire tablet can give you up
to seven hours of continuous usage and I
gotta say though for fifty dollars it's
definitely one of the best entry level
tablets you can get your hands on now I
don't know if you're like me you're the
kind of person that leaves your PC or
Mac running all the time and if anything
happens you don't want to lose the
information well if you're that type of
person this next product might be right
up your alley I'm talking about the APC
BR 700g now this is a backup UPS pro
that features a 6-outlet uninterruptible
power supply or UPS the backup UPS BR
700g offers guaranteed battery backup
and surge protection for
high-performance computer systems
networks external storage devices game
consoles or other electronic devices
some of the features include automatic
voltage regulation or AVR an LCD display
energy-saving functionality and it also
comes with the power shoot management
software there are six total outlets
through your battery backup and surge
and three or surge only it also has a
three year warranty and a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars of equipment
protection so that's pretty damn cool
and this thing's coming in to market
right now at about eighty two dollars
and that's a savings of 57
next up we have the blue do our to WH
wired headphones the blue audio are to
WH contains eight drivers inside the
headset two of these are 50 millimeter
woofers and the other six are 32 own 3d
speakers the r2 WH also have a very wide
frequency response between five Hertz
and 25 kilohertz with speakers
sensitivity up to 114 DB and the blue do
8 driver units also simulate 5.1 channel
surround sound and it does us whether
you're listening to music watching
movies or any other audio seen how can
you go wrong this next item I think is
really a cool item because I don't know
about you folks but I'm constantly
misplacing my keys misplacing my cell
phone and I'm always pulling my hair out
going my God where is this stuff at and
obviously you guys can see I've gumball
so I pulled out all my hair now this
next product is called the tile
generation 2 point 0 and what this does
is it allows you to attach it to your
keys or any other device or anything
pretty much that you have you can stick
it on there and then you can track it
down that's right so you can a code or
whatever and all of a sudden you have
this device and if you lose your keys
lose your phone or whatever you go on
your computer whatever look it up and
they'll tell you wha wha where it's at
now this thing's only twenty-five
dollars so I think it's a really cool
neat technical device now I know it's
not the most over-the-top and
reinventing the wheel thing but if
you're like me and you're constantly
losing stuff the tile two point oh my
just be two bites that you want to get
so you never have to go through the
headache of going where the frak did I
put that damn thing are you one of those
folks out there that's currently looking
for a cell phone but you don't have a
lot of money to invest in a cell phone
but you don't want to get
technologically left behind let's check
out 14 $52 the blue advanced
four-point-oh is an unlocked cell phone
it features a 4 inch high resolution
display your normal 3.5 millimeter audio
jack it also has a microSD slot which
supports the 32 gigabytes of additional
storage it runs on android 4.2 jellybean
is compatible with gsm carriers like
AT&amp;amp;T and team
as well as with other carriers that
support gsm sim cards like h2o straight
talk pure talk USA and select prepaid
carriers the only caveat about this is
unlocked cell phones will not work with
cdma carriers like sprint verizon boost
or virgin the cell phone comes with 4
gigabytes of internal storage with an
estimated free space of 2.25 gigabytes
but like I said best of all this phone
is only $52 so it won't break the bank
and if you lose it or break it you're
not going to be stressing out that you
spend a lot of your hard-earned money
next up we have the next con car charger
the next con 6.6 a is a 33 wat 3 port
USB car charger with smart IC technology
it's basically a rapid portable travel
charger for all USB devices and best of
all the next con is currently on sale
for twelve dollars and ninety-nine cents
which is actually eighty-seven percent
off the normal retail price by now I
think that most people out there know
what a GoPro is I mean we've used one of
many videos lots of people out there use
them for sports and stuff like that but
what about one from VTech that's geared
for kids I'm talking about the vtech
kidizoom action cam this camera is
durable versatile and able to capture
the most memorable moments in your kid's
life and it's also waterproof there are
also two mounts on the kitty zoom camera
so you can pretty much mount this thing
anywhere you want on their bike on their
skateboard on their surfboard pretty
much anywhere that they go the kitty
zoom can go it also features a 1.4 inch
LCD screen and can be charged by an
included micro USB cable the camera also
has a rechargeable battery that can last
up to 2.5 hours of continuous video or
photo taking and best of all kidizoom is
under forty dollars I know a lot of
people out there on some type of iphone
or ipad or some type of I device and a
lot of people use it for filming videos
of their family and stuff like that what
would you guys think about a lens kit
that actually makes your phone even more
versatile I'm talking about the Z so
iphone camera lens
it now this is a three in one kit that
features a fisheye lens a 15 X macro
lens and a point six three wide angle

that their product is geared and stuff
for apple stuff it'll actually work with
any type of device out there that has a
camera on it it just clips on and away
you go and three different lenses

they're only sixteen dollars so it's not
like it's a practice gonna totally break
the bank but if you're a person out
there that uses the heck out of your
iPhone or Samsung camera and you want to
like you for more intense type of stuff
