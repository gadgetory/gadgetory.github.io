Corsair commander Pro take control hey
what's going on tech fans welcome back
once again to the channel we have
another battle of the video cards that's
right now these two are very very
competitive against each other you guys
know the 1060 and the RX 580 they've
been kind of going back and forth and
back and forth you guys see our scores I
think you'll be kind of agreeing with
mute right there so I add the gigabyte
da RS rx 580 a badass rx 580 totally
overclocked great cooling all that good
stuff all in the card in the other hand
I have the EVGA SSC edition of their GTX
1068 beginner GTX 1070 it's going to
beat this card I'm just going to say
that straight up it's a little bit more
pricey
now the ARS card 279 smackeroos the
other card 259 smackeroos now these
cards are pretty much exactly the same
in length two hundred seventy five point
five millimeters the other card though
the ARS is much thicker you guys can see
it's almost three slots where the EVGA
card is pretty much two slots now the
other differences are is the power
requirements you guys are always asking
that so the ARS takes 185 watts that's
what it draws from your power supply
this card takes 120 watt beyond that I
mean you guys can see some of the good
things about the cards they both feature
two fans but one thing I have to say
about the or that I like over the EVGA
card is this backplate so let's Marie
put to set this bad boy down this back
plate on the ARS is the kind I love it
stuffed it's got a little overclocking a
little protector there so the heat can
dissipate away from the GPU on the EVGA
how Earlham it with this thing up over
here on the EVGA harvard that is not
prevalent whatsoever you can see that
there's no backplate on there at all so
kind of like you know kind of like for
that right off the bat I'm kind of
liking this card a little bit better now
some other differences however though is
that VA or SRX 580 is an 8 gigabyte card
so it's 8 gigabytes this card is only a
6 gigabyte card and hence why it doesn't
take as much power now looks wise I
don't know what you guys think beyond
the backplate I think that as far as
looks wise go they're both kind of
pretty equal you know ebj is very
simplistic Eleni
it'll do anything but like I said they
probably kept the price down by not
putting that back plate on there which
is probably a little bit why this car
cost more back plates are more expensive
and stuff to manufacture for the card so
you know in that respect like I said
before I really like the back plate is
that obvious like saying badass 50 times
as bad I love the back plate so that's
pretty much the two cars gigabyte card
really nice card SS C card really nice
card obviously this card's cheaper has
less memory less of a power draw but it
doesn't have that beyond that though
let's hop in let's take a look at our
test system right now we're using a
pretty pretty crazy over-the-top
test system it's got a 59 60 processor
that costs $1,000 yeah I know it's
over-the-top and few people out there
think this CPUs bottlenecking the video
cards no way man the x99 chipset has
like 40 lanes and it is most badass of
the badass that you can really get 16
gigabytes of Vengeance memory from
Corsair all in all just a really great
system and with that said let's take
this into battle mode
now as far as the temperatures goes the
EVGA card was hitting a maximum temp of
76 degrees Celsius which is a little bit
hotter than the era's card but the ARS
does have a much better cooling solution
you guys can see it's much larger and
hence wipes a wider card but it was only
getting a maximum of 70 degrees Celsius
under its maximum load the EVGA 1060 SSC
has a base clock speed of 1607 megahertz
and a boost clock of 1835 megahertz the
gigabyte ARS features two different
modes a gaming mode at 1425 megahertz
and an overclock mode at 1400 and 39
megahertz and the memory in both cards
is gddr5 alright Tech fans so obviously
most of us out there have systems and we
want to totally be able to control those
systems in our environment of course
their commander Pro does all that and
more featuring accurate Hardware control
through a single compact all one device
this device is fully compatible of
course their link devices as well it
supports up to six band connectors for
temperature inputs to RGB LED channels
and multiple USB devices due to internal
USB ports and this can all be managed
like I said before through the corsair
link software and with the additional
two USB 2.0 headers you can connect your
course there link devices while only
occupying one USB header on your
motherboard the commander Pro is also
very small and features a low-profile
design so it can fit anywhere in your
case without problems now honestly the
coolest feature mize and especially for
people out there who have a lot of RGB
lighting inside their system is the dual
channel lighting because with this thing
you can conduct a symphony of RGB
lighting and that just looks killer
alright once again a big thanks to
Corsair but beyond that let's talk about
the cards now the very first thing I
want to talk about is the temperatures
of the cars now we all saw that the
aorist had a kill or killer cooling
apparatus had a really nice backplate
all that stuff the EVGA SSC it was kind
of lacking those things and it seems to
have an effect at the end of the day
because the EVGA SSC card was running at
76 Celsius and we saw the ARS 580
running at 70 Celsius maximum so you get
that six degrees
for variation temperature variation
excuse me but you also are sacrificing
you know the cards as far as wit goes if
your system is really packed up with
 and you don't have that extra you
know room within your slots to put the
card in well then that might be a
problem for you but if that's not a
problem whatsoever we see at the RX 580
even though it has 8 gigabytes of RAM
versus 6 gigabytes of RAM it's still
running cooler so I got to say thumbs up
2 gigabyte on that that's a great design
and it's good to see plus the fact of
the matter is most of the time a lot of
people out there are strict fanboys they
only want one car the other regardless I
don't know why that is to me at the end
of the day it doesn't matter who makes
the product I usually shoot for the
numbers now if you're a numbers man you
guys can see these cards are pretty much
head-to-head they really are the numbers
go back and forth in a few games the
EVGA card wins and a few games the
Arabian card wins so if you guys can see
that as far as that go it's a mixed bag
but it's pretty much equal it's like you
know if you were putting in a fighting
ring and one guy won three rounds and
the other guy won three rounds you're
kind of at a tie you know there's no
other way to break the tie with this
unless you want to like separate up if
you were going to separate it by price
then okay buy prices in the ebj wins but
if you're concerned about cooling then
obviously the the AOS obviously win six
degrees difference that's quite a bit
that gives you more you know Headroom
for doing all of your overclocking stuff
and for all your boost speeds because
the cool of the card is the better the
boost speeds go now one thing a lot of
--dress because a lot of people complain
about they go why don't you use the
minimum frames per second and the
maximum frames per second now I'm going
to tell you why because it's almost
pretty irrelevant I mean sometimes when
a game first starts up it'll show one
frame per second so you want me to show
you that it gets one frame per second
then it goes into another thing and it
gets 350 frames per second it really
doesn't make that much sense to me and
that's why we don't do it the average
frames per second is pretty much your
game experience and that one iota of a
second that I got that one frame per
second is kind of you know I don't feel
that's relevant
you guys give your comments down below
I'm always welcome to hear them but at
the end of the day here I do not see a
totally clear winner I honestly think
that in this particular match these
cards come pretty much head-to-head
because each has its own special things
that
YOUnique if you're looking for price
only then one card wins if you're
looking for the total cooling thing
another card wins and you know the same
things with the design the design I feel
on the backplate and all that stuff on
the ars card is just very very nice the
SSC card nice card but obviously we know
that cooling thing could have been
cooler there could have been a backplate
and stuff like that so it's pretty a
toss-up to me but I always want to hear
your guys opinions down below I
appreciate you guys watching the channel
down below that like button will have
all of the information for everything we
talked about including that stuff that
we showed you from Corsair so we'll see
you guys back in the channel if you're
not sub hey you know what to do and if
you don't notifications on how you're
going to get notified</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
