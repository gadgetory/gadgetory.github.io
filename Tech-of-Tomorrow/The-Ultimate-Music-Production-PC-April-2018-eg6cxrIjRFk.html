guys are here now today's video is about
a computer that I built that's pretty
much going to be totally dedicated to
music production for the last few years
I've been doing all of my music
production and stuff on an iMac and this
the reason for this is that the programs
I was using Logic Pro X just works great
and I'm very familiar with it so that's
what I've been using but recently I
started really wanting to do more
digital music as my health has kind of
faded I couldn't play guitar sing very
well so I was like well you know what
digital music and all that kind of stuff
is really popular so let's build a
system and dedicate it to that so
instead of doing another iMac I said you
know what let's do it this time
with a PC and really the main reason
that I want to do with the PC is I want
to be able to use multi monitors because
multi monitors allows me to you know
pull up different screens and see
everything that I'm doing so I bought
reason 10 and a reason 10 is just
amazing for doing all kinds of digital
music if you're doing electronic stuff
reason is of the absolute bomb I just
have to say it really is
and traditionally I'm a big fan of
universal audio products but Universal
audio products only recently made it
over the PC side of things and we bought
the error we brought you guys and review
about a little while ago you saw them
the channel air it's a nice little mini
thing about 500 bucks but it's still a
great little interface to use for your
dog so I really wanted to be able to use
this on a PC but trying to get a PC to
recognize the Thunderbolt 3 stuff was a
major pain in the butt we split early
spent more time researching and spending
time on the phone with with UA going hey
man this crap doesn't work so I had
actually gotten a bunch of parts from a
lotta different people as we
experimented with this my friend over at
Asus he was absolutely awesome he helped
me out also my friend at gigabyte helped
me out and so I was able to get a full
gigabyte system going which is actually
the system that's in my room and I was
able to get this system going with the a
Zeus products and now all of that
Thunderbolt 3 stuff is working
absolutely great the Universal Audio
arrow is working great and I'm really
looking forward to moving on with this
system so with that said though this
particular system it can come into
market about $2,000 or under $1500
depending how you configure it and I'll
give you a couple different options also
for my purposes I really don't need a
video card whatsoever doing music
production having a high-end video card
means nothing and with video card prices
off the hook right now I just feel it's
kind of insulting to give you these
outrageous video card price because
you're gonna look and go that system
cost how much bro you're gonna want to
give me you know two little birds but
that's not my you know my thing I'm not
the one doing the pricing but for me for
doing music production I don't need a
super duper high-end video card at all
I'm using the 630 graphics that are
built into my 8700 and I didn't get an
8700 K because on a music production
system overclocking is probably the very
last thing you'd ever want to do in a
music production system using your DAW
you want something that's going to be
completely utterly stable with no
problems whatsoever and the particular
PCIe that I'm using the PCIe SSD it's an
m2 that sticks in a PCI slot it's really
really expensive and you can pick up a
four and 80 gigabyte SSD for under $200
so if you eliminate just a couple things
in this in the system you can turn the
system into your production work station
thing and it will be under $1500 now if
you decide that you want to you know use
this particular system for gaming and
all that it will work absolutely amazing
for that but for my purposes I don't
really need that stuff and the reason I
need a really really SuperDuper fast you
know boot drive and everything is for
all the virtual instruments virtual
instruments work the absolute best when
they're on something that is the most
fastest transfer rates with no latency
but what that said let's jump in and
let's check out this bad boy because
honestly it's a beautiful computer I
can't wait to put it up there and start
working with reason just from a visual
aspect and I mean just looking at the PC
this baby looks very very nice it's nice
and elegant everything fit inside of it
we had no problems with the cable
management or anything like that the
particular version that we got is a
black version they have a white version
with a white interior this particular
one has a black outside and a white
interior now this is the
fantex inc through pro TG full ATX
chassis and it also has integrated RGB
lighting a tempered glass side panel so
you can see your build inside and this
thing's actually only 97 bucks so it's
under 100 bucks for this badass case
like I said a friend of mine today Zeus
kicked me a really nice motherboard this
is the a Zeus prime Z 370 a LGA 1151
motherboard and I got to tell you this
prime motherboard looks really nice and
performed flawlessly and one thing I
really liked about it is it has full
support for the Thunderbolt 3 card which
is required to use the arrow plus this
board is under 150 bucks so all the
features that you get it's definitely a
great board and if you look at it on
Amazon it's actually one of the Amazons
Choice motherboards which means it's
sold a whole lot of boards it has a lot
of great reviews like I said in the
introduction I only needed a CPU that
had a decent onboard graphics solution
and the UHD six-thirty works great for
me now this is the Intel Core i7 80 765
Watts
this processor comes to market at about
300 dollars and absolutely works perfect
for what I'm doing and if I decide later
on I want to stick a gaming card in ear
and game hey it'll work absolutely great
with very little lag I don't know how
you guys feel but when it comes to my
cooler I definitely would prefer to have
a liquid cooler over an air cooler any
day so I use the Corsair H ATI v2 now
this bad boy comes to market at under
$100 and is another Amazon choice
product probably one of the most
expensive parts in this particular build
is the memory like I said before I'm
gonna be using a lot of virtual
instruments when I'm using the new
reason software and so I chose the
Corsair Vengeance lpx 32 gigabyte kit
now this kit consists of 4 8 gigabyte
sticks and runs at 3000 megahertz like I
said one thing I really liked about this
particular motherboard is that it had
support for the Thunderbolt II x3 card
so I use the a Zeus expansion card for
the z10 and x99 motherboards and this
came to market at under $100 as well and
even though it did take a few days to
configure correctly it's now working
brilliant a friend of mine over at
Kingston actually gave me a really nice
HyperX PCI a 480 gigabyte SSD now this
uses the m2 technology
it's very fast but it's also very
expensive and right now it's currently
available so we'll actually have some
links to some different products you
don't particularly need this high-end of
a drive I only used it because I had it
and a friend gave it to me so I figured
hey I might as well be fair and use it
you can get away with probably using any
other SSD as long as it's stable and
you'll be good to go
another thing about a music system is
you want to have a lot of hard drive
space for all the different music that
you're doing and you really want to be
redundant so that no matter what you
will not lose your information so I have
two Seagate two-terabyte fire CUDA
drives and I have these in raid 0 so one
drive has the information on it the
other drives being completely backed up
and this is also another Amazon choice
product coming in to market at about
eighty nine dollars per drive and I have
to tell you these drives are very very
fast because they're a hybrid drive they
feature solid-state and hard drive
technology all mixed in a single drive I
also won the power supply that would not
only power this PC but if I wanted to
you know say jump in to doing video
games and stuff like that at the future
point I wanted something that had enough
Headroom that I wouldn't have to go out
and buy into the power supply and tear
the system apart so we went with the C
Sonic focus plus series now this is an
850 watt power supply and it comes to
market at about a hundred and six
dollars pretty much when building any
high-end system regardless of what
you're gonna be using it for for gaming
casual stuff music whatever you want to
have really good cable management in
this particular fan tech case it did
that in spades we had no problem at all
doing the cable management there's
plenty of room to get the wires through
and plenty of room in the back to keep
all those wires hidden from the rest of
the system now Before we jump in the
testing phase of this unit I want to
tell you guys that we tested only with
two of the higher-end video cards we did
a 1080i and we also did a Vegas 64 and
so when you're seeing the test results
know that if you want to use this system
and you want to use a different card you
can pretty much say that there'll be
about 10 frames per second between the
different levels of cards now this isn't
complete rocket science but it's a
really good guesstimate of where things
are going to be so you can take what's
in here and you can check it out and
look at it probably what I'm going to be
using is a Z
gave me a GTX 1060 and if I ever do just
stick a card in here if I want to start
doing some editing and stuff like that
that's the card I'll be using now like
usual and we're doing any of our testing
we get the very latest drivers that are
available at the time of testing we
always make sure that we use Windows 10
and it adds all of the anniv updates so
that you know everything inside the
system is the latest and greatest to get
the absolute best performance and with
that said now let's rock out to the
benchmark score and let's see how the
system does
all right so there you have it
I haven't actually given the system a
name maybe you guys can give me some
ideas for the system's name down below
in the comment section now one thing I
want to mention I don't think that the
CPU cooler is actually working as well
as it should because we were seeing
spikes at a hundred degrees Celsius at
maximum temp and that's just pretty damn
hot average it was about 80 Celsius but
even that to me is way too high for
having a liquid cooler so I'm thinking
that when anthem outed it either the
pace didn't take or it's just not mad at
100% correct and I'll be taking a look
at that and correcting that but
everything about the system other than
that is just very very nice having a
really SuperDuper fast boot drive is
great for virtual instruments having
that memory is great for that and making
sure that I have my hard drives and raid
0 and sure that none of my music ever
gets lost and let me tell you losing
music can be really painful because just
think about it you've spent hours in the
studio with your with your mates
recording this stuff and then all of a
sudden you go and you've lost your music
and you're like what the frak and
honestly ideas come a lot of times that
spur the moment when you're writing them
so you'll lose all that stuff so I want
to make sure that I never ever lost this
information in fact I'll be you're gonna
be a minister in fact excuse me I'll be
hooking up an external hard drive to
even be more redundant because I never
want to lose my music now like I said
earlier you can actually put this system
together with a couple of different
parts and to be about under $1500
there's a few changes you can make you
can use a different boot tribe for the
SSD you could use a little bit different
memory you could even use less memory
there's all kinds of flexibility and one
thing I want to state is that my builds
are not always meant just to be like oh
hey this is the absolute cheapest thing
that you want to do I'm not really into
like cheapest that's just never been my
thing I've always been more about
quality and these bills are always just
suggestive builds if I wanted to go out
and go to PC parts picker and pick the
absolute cheapest crap on the market I
can do that but that has never ever been
our goal here on tech of tomorrow so I
hope you guys dig this and like I said
if you guys would like to name this
system hey go ahead down there
leave me some ideas and the one that I
choose I'll make sure that I keep you
guys a really nice game code so I'm Eric
you guys
been watching taking tomorrow I can't
wait to start working with the arrow and
with the reason so what that said
everything will be down below that like
button all the different parts and the
other parts that we're gonna offer that
you guys can choose from and with that
said hey peace out and enjoy your day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
