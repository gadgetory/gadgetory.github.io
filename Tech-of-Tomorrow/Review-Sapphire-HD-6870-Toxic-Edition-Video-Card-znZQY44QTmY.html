forget about it come on in anyways well
today it's me elric Faris your host here
in the tech of tomorrow youtube channel
what we're doing today today we're
taking a look at the new sapphire radeon
HD 6870 toxic edition video card so what
is the toxic edition it's a card that
infects you makes you get sick and die
because it's toxic so so you touch the
cards you die and then sapphire has your
will and they get all your money no I'm
just kidding what really is the toxic
one is the overclocked right out of the
box edition it features the vapor x
cooling which is their vapor chamber
cooling it has that right on board and
the card comes overclocked right out of
the box so what you've given you by this
cards you get a car that has superior
cooling and is overclocked for those
people like an overclocked card directly
when you buy it you don't have to go in
and change any settings inside of your
control panel or anything else it's just
overclocked so now let's go into the
features the performance and at the end
of the day whether you should buy this
new sapphire radeon HD 6870 toxic
edition let's check this out okay
so now let's take a look at the card
itself as you can see right here i'll
show you the front of the card we have
the new sapphire radeon HD 6870 toxic
edition card featuring the vapor x
cooling and overclocker out of the box
so you can see right here all the
external plastic is different than the
standard reference design but it's
pretty much in standard with how the
cards are being made from our friends at
sapphire most of them have the same
plastic exterior with a different
sticker on I'm designating the cards now
maybe there might be a little bit of
clock speed differ a shin but beyond
that most of the cards we've seen have
this same plastic grid I'll be maybe a
different color or a different sticker
so then we're going to turn out flip it
over here let you guys see the Rio Rio
got you too many display ports and HDMI
connector and to standard dvrs going to
flip it around the back show you guys
the crossfire finger right here
crossfire bridged ever you want to call
it and then here's the actual back of
the card I'm going to flip back again
requires two 6-pin power connectors also
in the box if you saw
unboxing video you see that it comes
inside the box to molex to 6-pin power
connectors for you guys who have older
power supplies lets you guys see out
then the card is card takes up two slots
in your system as in about nine point
two inches long last but not least we
have the PCI to point of insertion and
this which you place into your
motherboard so once again to show you
the card now let's move on let's see the
performance in overclock mode
so we've taken a look at the performance
and we can see that the card over
clocked out of the box runs about ten
percent faster than a standard reference
clock HD 6870 so for those people out
there who like an overclocked car left a
mess of it this is a great thing for you
also the vapor x vapor chamber cooling
keeps the card running cool even in an
overclocked environment what that does
is that helps keep the card running
longer so it's you can maintain your
card for a much longer time one of the
things that happens when the card
overheats the electronics we're down
shortening the life of the card so
having a car that has superior cooling
link tins the life of the car so at the
end of the day what do we got we've got
a card that runs about two hundred sixty
nine dollars it's overclocked you can
find rebates online if you look hard
enough it's available everywhere and if
you're a fan of the AMD series cards
you're going to really like this one so
at the end of the day if you're looking
for those cards I give this the editors
choice product here on the tech of
tomorrow youtube channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
