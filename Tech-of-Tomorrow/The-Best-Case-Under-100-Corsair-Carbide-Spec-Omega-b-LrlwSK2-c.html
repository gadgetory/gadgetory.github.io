case that won't break the bank how about
a case that's under $100 has a lot of
features and is very well made let's
check out Corsairs latest case the spec
Omega right off the bat visually
speaking you guys can see that the
carbide series spec Omega case has a
really nice look to it and let's just
face it
the very first thing that we look at
we're going to purchase the case before
we look at specs or anything else we're
taking a look at how the case looks
because let's just face it you're gonna
have to be staring at that case for a
long time with your system in it now the
carbide series spec Omega it's made of
steel and as a tempered glass window and
as a mid-tower ATX case has a lot of
different features the particular one
that we're looking at today is black and
white and the spec Omega does come in a
few different colors they also have a
black and red and a strictly black one
as well the spec Omega also does have a
little bit of plastic on the exterior
and obviously the feet themselves are
made of plastic but most of the build is
made of steel as far as the dimensions
go the spec Omega size is in at 495
millimeters by 232 millimeters by 516
millimeters
checking out the front of the spec Omega
you guys can see it's two different
colors in this build the left-hand side
is black the right-hand side is white
and it was also a tempered glass window
in the front so you can see your nice
build so if you want to use RGB fans and
show them off you can see them right
through the front all the controls for
the speckle mega are also conveniently
located in the front of the case on the
very top you have your on and off button
you have two USB 3.0 ports a mic jack an
audio jack the hard drive indicator and
at the very bottom the restart button
you guys can also see on the very front
of the speckle Mega that on the bottom
there's a little screen this is for
additional airflow through the case the
right-hand side of the speckle Mega is
very very simple just a standard black
panel and on the top of the spec Omega
you guys can see an additional grille
this is for helping to evacuate all that
heat away from the system take a look at
the rear of the spec Omega you guys can
see on the very top left hand side
that's where your motherboard is going
to go in to the right of that a single
120 millimeter fan down below that in
the left you can see seven expansion
slots and
the very bottom space for your power
supply and you can use any standard ATX
power supply in this system and to make
sure that no dust gets inside of your
power supply on the very bottom of the
case is removable filter so if it gets
dirty you can just clean it off and keep
your power supply nice and clean real
quick before we jump inside of the case
let's talk about how easy this case is
to disassemble most of the parts come
off by a simple thumb screw the only
thing that's different is the window
itself this window requires an allen
wrench that comes in with the kit for
you to remove it now that we
disassembled the case you guys can see
the interior of the case very clearly
now what's interesting about this case
though is in the very front of this case
you can actually use a 360 millimeter
rat that's right you can use a 280 or
360 right in the front however on the
top and the rear of the case you can
only install a 240 millimeter rad and in
the front of the case you guys can see
there's a single 120 millimeter LED fan
now on the front as far as mounting fans
you can mount 320 millimeter fans or 240
millimeter fans on the top you can do
two hundred and twenty millimeter fans
or two hundred and forty millimeter fans
and on the rear you can use a single 120
millimeter fan or like I said a 240
millimeter rad as far as your driveway
expansion goes you have three 3.5 inch
bays and two 2.5 inch base there's
plenty of expandability there for your
hard drives or SSDs like I said earlier
this case can use an ATX power supply
but the maximum length of the PSU is 200
millimeters the spec Omega can support
micro ATX ATX and mini ITX motherboard
like I said no extended ATX motherboards
inside the spec Omega and if you happen
to be wondering hey Eric
well my cooler fit inside the case well
from your motherboard to the window you
have a hundred and seventy millimeters
of link so that's the maximum CPU cooler
right inside the spec Omega and for
video cards the maximum GPU length is
370 millimeters so like I said at the
very beginning of the video this
particular case comes to market at $99
and it comes in a bunch of different
versions you can get one that's solid
black you can get one that
red and black or you can get one that's
white and black so a few different color
coordination z' there now a couple of
things i didn't talk about why we're
going to the video is actually how well
made the case actually is internally in
the old days and you got a case you had
to worry about man if i go inside this
case am i gonna cut myself up is it
going to like her injure me honestly
this was a serious concern but
everything about this brand-new carbide
series case is excellent it's very well
made the tempered glass is very nice
it's not cheap plastic you can see
through it very clearly and it's also a
lot easier to clean than cheap plastic
stuff as well cheap plastic tub
depending on the chemicals used will
streak or get blurry and just absolutely
look like crap after a while so for $99
i have to say man the spec omega is a
serious editor's choice product here on
TECA tomorrow it has all kinds of great
features like I said it's not going to
fit you know any external ATX
motherboard so you're not gonna be able
fit those giant size motherboards but
anything from a standard motherboard all
the way down as those mini ITX boards
will fit inside of it it'll look really
nice
the colors are appealing so just overall
I have to say that everything about this
case is really really nice now I know
some people out there probably going to
say oh my god Eric you're not beating it
up anywhere well because there's really
not anything really to beat up here for
the price at $99 that's a very nice
price point it's under $100 it's
aesthetically pleasing it has enough USB
3.0 ports on the front to make it viable
really nothing here - honestly complain
about I guess you could complain say gee
it should be even cheaper but at the end
of the day this is a very solid case
editors choice here in Tekken tomorrow
thanks for watching love to hear your
comments down below and we'll see you
guys back in here for more tech here on
TECA tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
