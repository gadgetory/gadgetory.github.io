once again on tech tomorrow bringing you
guys the top 5 entry level gaming mice
for under $30 let's check that out
so first up is our 1199 Mouse this is
the i-x CC predator 5500 DPI 500 hertz
LED optical USB wired 7 button
professional gaming mouse that's right
so this mouse features gaming
performance and adjustable 5500 DPI it's
adjustable from a thousand to 1600 to
2400 to 3200 and finally 5500 dpi and a
500 Hertz polling rate means great
precision and the way the buttons are
set up on this mouse it's a little bit
different than your standard mouse in
one way usually on your left hand side
you do get two buttons but on this one
there's actually a button right up here
on the top which I haven't really seen
in many other products it's kind of
interesting you've also got an
additional two right here your
adjustable dpi here scroll button which
also adjust is another button and then
on the other side it's just nothing but
smooth and ergonomic so you guys can see
I have like a pretty much right consider
to be a medium sized hand and this thing
fits in my hand absolutely perfect as
you guys can see the buttons are easy
for me to hit and let's just be honest
folks
I mean you will spend 12 bucks at a
McDonald's trip or wherever you live
whatever restaurant you go to on lunch
so paying $12 for a mouse I can tell
that a pretty good deal even if it
breaks in four months from now in twelve
months you can use that thing like a
cheap hooker and then toss that
away let's move on ok next up is one of
the two mice that actually look very
much similar even though they're by two
different companies and this is the YCC
team 4000 dpi and nine button led
optical USB wired professional gaming
mouse the g10 is also a really crazy
looking Mouse you guys can see the
design on it is very crazy and if you
actually just look at it from the top
down it kind of looks just like
something from the Transformers movie I
was thinking it was mr. Decepticon
himself but it's just a mouse the g10
even comes with included software to
help you do something called precision
Ames
looking for that killer headshot the g10
comes a software to hopefully you know
if you suck real bad make you better
right what to see about that but anyways
the layout of this thing is pretty crazy
it kind of reminds me of some of the
other stuff I saw back in the day I
think what's called a Mad Catz there are
a few different ones that had the same
type of design but it's very futuristic
looking the make of it is pretty crazy
it kind of feels like a weird like pop
metal I can't tell if it's plastic or
metal it's kind of very very strange
feels pretty durable the button lad of
the g10 is as follows on the left hand
side you can see there are three
clickable buttons and as you turn on the
top it's a little bit different because
usually you only see two clickable
buttons but there's actually two on each
side then you have one located at the
bottom of the center and then finally
the scroll wheel as the last button and
as you guys see on the other mouse when
I use my hand it kind of fit perfectly
when I put my hand over this Mouse my
hands like way over it so I'd have to
say that this particular mouse even
though it can be used with somebody with
a medium-sized hand I think this
particular one are probably better with
some of the small head it would be a
little bit more ergonomic for them now
this mouse is only twenty-two bucks so
it's also a great deal Oh
next up red dragon
the red dragon m9a1 perdition is a
16,400 DPI high precision of
programmable laser gaming mouse
16400 DPI
vm 901 was built for gamers by gamers it
has an adjustable dpi rate like I said
from a thousand to two thousand to four
thousand to 8200 all the way up to
sixteen thousand four hundred dpi
it also features twelve thousand frames
per second and a thousand Hertz polling
rate VM 901 features 30g acceleration
and an Avago sensor
it also features Omron micro switches in
total there are 18 programmable buttons
5 memory profiles each with distinct
light colors for quick identification of
each one it also features an eight-piece
precision weight set which you can
adjust to however you like your mouse to
be driver CD for programming all those
crazy buttons and stickers to even make
the thing cooler to make the buttons
exactly like you want it also the colors
can be set to 16 point 4 million colors
so it has a lot of colors on it and in
total there are 16 buttons on the 9:01
now for you spellcasters out there and
those bands who are fans of the RPG type
gaming style there are 12 12
programmable macro buttons on the left
hand side so you got 12 things to click
with your thumb then you have 4 more on
top that you guys can see as well as a
scroll button so 16 buttons all in all
with this thing now for price of $30
it's not going to be probably the
absolute most incredible $300 Mouse but
for the price you get a lot of damn
options with this Mouse the 901 I gotta
say is something I know my kid would
love and maybe you would love it if you
have this let me know next up is the
combative wing the copycat the original
ores of Optimus Prime you be the judge
now just like I said this mouse and this
mouse have the exact same features now
they're from two different companies the
designs in the back are pretty much
completely completely identical
I gotta say they're pretty much the same
Mouse the same exact features you see
the same three button clicks on here two
more two more here Center scroll button
button here pretty much all of the exact
same things that we saw in this mouse is
on this mouse and they're pretty much
the same price at $22 now who's the og
who's original it's probably somebody
else um by the way I didn't really get a
chance I don't think I mention it but
every single one of these in this
category that we showed you day has a
very very nice nice cable I probably
should just mention that about that
going through sometimes I forget stuff
so I'm just trying to you know figure
the features out but every single one of
these features a very very nice cable
very well made this one does as well the
last one we're getting to it will be as
well so basically if you liked the other
main you know excuse me if you liked
this one but you want it in white well
then you know it's got a name comes in a
nice little box to look you know
beautiful little nice box beautiful
little mouse and a little price moving
on and last up gamers we have the centi
gs3 901 lumen odda pro gaming mouse up
to 8200 dpi
it features 12,000 frames per second 9
puts two buttons with one dpi selector
it also features the Avego 98 her chip
set acceleration speed of 30 GS and it
also features omni micro switches which
provide crisp firm clicks and just like
all the rest that we showed you a very
nice braided cable now here at eot I
think all of us agree that out of the
bunch this is our favorite this thing
fits my hand like a glove my hand feels
perfect on it
the buttons are very ergonomic and very
whoops before drop down in my hand
trying to like that are very ergonomic
you see there's three right here and
it's kind of weird because one button
just like a clicker down here in the
bottom then you have these then you jump
up on top you have the standard two
clickers right here on top adjustable
DPI center scroll mouse and then on the
right hand side you see an additional
two buttons and one of the reasons they
call it the gs3 901 Luminara is because
the buttons in the center they all light
up and has a very nice cool little blue
color when you're playing your games
nothing that's like too obtrusive making
you go WOW so I know so many people out
that you hate all those color keyboard
rows that's confusing as hell so if
you're one of those people that just
likes nice simple lighting I think
you're gonna find a favorite here
alright so there you have it a bunch of
different styles bunch of different cool
features a couple of them looked really
identical which we thought was strange
too looking what I was looking online
they didn't look that identical when we
got another like but you know you could
use these two like in a total fight
though you know Decepticon you know
Optimus Prime
killing each other what do you guys
think I think it's cool and check this
out what's even cooler about today's
video which by the way all the
information about all of these
particular life will be downloadable it

nuclear on it but like I said what's
