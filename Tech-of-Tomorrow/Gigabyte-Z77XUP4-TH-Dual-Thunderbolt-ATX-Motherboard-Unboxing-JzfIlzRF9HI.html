again to the tech of tomorrow YouTube
channel I'm elric Farris your host and
today we're going to be showing you guys
the unboxing and first look of a brand
new motherboard for the people over at
gigabyte this is their new z77 x dash
you p48 or as I like to refer to it the
up forth this motherboard is one of
their latest motherboards it's made for
all the k overclocking cpus features
their supreme copper design which are
actually showing now helps with humidity
so maybe that helped some countries of
that kind of stuff but that said let's
jump in and let's see what comes in this
box sitting right behind me
all right folks here we see the box the
gigabyte ultra-durable 5 ultra-cool
tradition ultra performance you guys can
see it's designed for overclocking the
intel k sku cpus it's won a bunch of
awards already features Thunderbolt
hence the th it's got 3d power which is
all their stuff their 3d bios so
basically these guys say 3d power you
guys have heard of all the stuff out
there pmsi uses their term Zeus uses of
their term basically all this stuff is
saying that they use really good parts
and all their power phasing is all their
3d stuff which the newest the 3d bios is
their latest uaf bios you guys should
all know that by now obviously z77
chipset two times a covered PCB with a
new glass fabric PCB with has humidity
protection don't exactly know what that
is we'll probably get into that a little
bit later let me flip it around real
quick you guys can take a look at this
right here so in case you're looking to
buy this motherboard you guys can see it
here or you can also look in the link in
the description below if you're
interested in buying this and
availability flip it around just show
you guys the back there just basically
talking about all their stuff that makes
their motherboard good they're ultra
cool ultra-efficient ultra performance
you can see they talk about their
MOSFETs pic and talk about their power
staging let us talk about all kind of
stuff but they're UEF BIOS the dual
thunderbolt on board all digital power
just lots of stuff on the outside their
box folks I mean this is pretty much the
unboxing but I know you guys get mad if
we don't show you too much so I'm still
trying to give you guys some features so
let's pop open we'll start off the bat
by going over all the stuff that comes
in the box I'll start setting it down
here's the motherboard manual here's a
multilingual installation guide here is
the drivers and utility CD here we have
a set of SATA cables these are the new
say that six gigabit per second cables
and set those down we have an SLI SLI
bridge right here the cable
and then last but not least we have the
rear I oh it's all color-coordinated
shows where everything's at now let's
actually take a look at the motherboard
itself okay folks so here's the
motherboard inside the package that I
open it mmm that has that really new
motherboard smell that electrically
smiling tell i'm going to go ahead and i
will pull the motherboard out now i'll
set the motherboard right here we can
start going over the motherboard you
guys can see there's plenty of room
around the ZIF socket at the top right
up here we'll start with the single 8
pin power connector up here here's as if
second lga1155 you can see that they use
high-quality MOSFETs high quality
capacitors high quality choke that's one
of the main features of the board one
thing I really like about the board is
that the system fan and the cpu fan you
can see they're located both right here
at the top right here this is going to
be very easy for mounting your fan on if
you have two connections right there I'm
gonna flip to the side here's the memory
takes dual-channel ddr3 here's a 24 pin
power connector you also have a
secondary system fan here
here's our USB 3.0 this is the breakout
bracket for that right here in the
center of the board we have the msata
connection that's located right here if
I get that for the Camerons you guys and
see this is ms 80 right there okay we'll
flip the board back now this board has a
lot of pci e 1x slots we have one two
three of these and then we have one two
three of the pcie x lots now this but
the board supports either dual sli or
dual crossfire which means you can use
two cards doesn't support tripled and
sport quad just supports those you can
still see that on the board still are
still people calling it a ati crossfirex
x i gotta laugh at that a chasm in a
company now for like what five years and
it's still on the board nvidia sli now
i'll just skip around here you guys can
see they're not talk about a thunderbolt
they talk a little bit about their sound
it has a hundred eight DB it's pretty
decent sound features the realtek
chipset I'm pop back down over here to
the side now we're right here are all
over SATA connections we have a single
set of state of three ports and then two
sets of say two two ports so the white
is the say two three these are the state
of two will flip it down back here this
is where they have a weird thing for
their clear CMOS there are clear CMOS is
a little tiny thing on the motherboard
that you can barely even see it's very
very small you see it right there it
says clear CMOS now if you touch with a
screwdriver or what you do but looks to
me like you could just remove the
battery but that's kind of paying the
but way so let's look down here you can
see you see your panel comms all of your
connections that go to your case
additional USB so you have one two three
additional USB ports down here another
system fan this is a system fan three
down here your TPM connector an
additional system fan your audio and
spdif connections and then let's jump
around and let's take a look at the rear
I
we're at the bat we can see that we have
legacy ps2 and mouse port so to use
whatever you want start right here we
have two four six of the USB 3.0 ports
and you can see that all the ports in
this board are all USB 3.0 I up here we
so the hdmi here's the DVI the vga we
have a single land port then we have
right here the two firewire connections
here we have all of the analog and both
the digital connections for your audio
okay folks so thanks for watching the
unboxing of the new gigabyte z77 x dash
you p 4 th featuring Thunderbolt
technology this was just the unboxing
folks look for the full feature review
and benchmarks when we get back to you
later here on tech up tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
