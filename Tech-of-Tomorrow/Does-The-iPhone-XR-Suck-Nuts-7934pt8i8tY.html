Elric here at tech of tomorrow now even
though I know that most of my fans are
not the hipster type dudes you know when
the tight jeans into bendgate and all
that stuff my friend Jonathan from TLD
still gave us one of these brand new
iPhones now this thing comes to the
market at seven hundred and forty nine
dollars you guys are probably wondering
like why in the hell it look would we
invest our money into an iPhone
well actually this one is the 10r it's a
white version there are some pretty nice
features about it first of all it
features a liquid displace which just
like their high-end monitors it has a
killer resolution of 1792 by 828 326
pixels per inch it has this oleophobic
like anti fingerprint thing on it so
like if you're keynote so if you're like
let's turn off the phone it's gonna like
make sure your fingerprints don't all
get all the phones you probably might
not even have to like use a screen
protector it's photo capabilities are
supposed to be really nice and all that
stuff so if you're someone out there who
doesn't really care you know about
whether it's PC or whether it's Mac and
you're just looking for something killer
to run around with today we're gonna
bring you the unboxing but I also was
able to get ahold of the brand new pixel
3 so we're gonna be doing a comparison
video between the pixel 3 and this
particular phone the brand new Apple
iPhone 10 R and we'll see which one
actually excels in taking photos doing
video and sound and all that kind of
stuff and actually you know which one
looks better and sound better as well
we'll bring that video to be pretty much
a foam battle head-to-head kind of like
we do the video battles but with that
said though let's jump in let's check
this out first we'll see that nice 6.1
inch screen like I said it's got a great
resolution it's an IPS screen so you
know it's really high quality alot stuff
there's no reason for a phone to have
like a TN panel on and be super fast
because there's just no reason important
a phone you're not gonna be playing that
fast of games it's better to have it
looking set you have absolutely the best
text the best coordinate' will bring
that to the table probably without a
problem and that's one of the things
that I personally thought that was
lagging on the previous generation
iPhones a lot of them had screens here
where you look the resolution is like
compared to the other phones it really
wasn't anything but with that said
though let's jump in right now well
let's do the unboxing let's
see what comes in the box talk about the
OS and a few other things and see at the
end of the day just what in the heck is
an iPhone 10 r and is it worth $749 of
your hard-earned cash I don't know let's
see alright so in case you haven't seen
it here is the box of the brand new
iPhone XR which I call the iPhone 10 R
which is you know technically correct as
well but some people maybe picking a
pound it's bad boy is the a12 Bionic
chip and this particular box there's not
much to it you can see the front the
side on the back you can see this is the
64 gigabyte version they have a higher
version they go all the way up in price
like over $800 depending on what you
need but this is the entry-level one I
did bring along my trusty little Batman
knife to go ahead and get a couple
little cuts in here and open this bad
boy up make it nice and simple for us
and I mean really who doesn't like a
batman knife i mean come on
I do you know what's cool admit it so
let's go ahead make a couple slices here
some slices and some Dicers and get
inside of here and hopefully not to and
wreck and totally destroy the phone so I
got it be nice and gentle like a surgeon
here I'm gonna cut these little things
out to do a nice little unboxing and not
damage the beautiful little iPhones it's
not really mine anyway but it belongs to
John so I don't really wanted to destroy
his box I want to get is nice and clean
as possible without damaging it which
may sound easy but it's not just take
all that plastic off ba boom we get that
off to the side and here you go blah
blah the earth let's go ahead and open
this bad boy up what do we got here on
top alright on top we've got designed by
Apple in California it's better than
being made my orange in Detroit yeah my
guess or a lemon in Santa Monica okay
much better alright I'll get that out of
the way now here is the phone we'll go
ahead and see what it's all in the box
so in the box you get the phone you get
the power charger obviously the power
cables gonna be underneath there you get
the nice headphones as a charger right
there so power plug the charger the
headphones and these headphones actually
do sound pretty decent they're not bad
headphones at all I know some people may
knock them but I've heard you know other
ones that other people hadn't they sound
pretty decent they're not bad at all so
let's go ahead and set that aside like I
said this particular phone has a 6.1
inch screen it's an IPS screen I mean
and peel all the plastic off of here and
just get it all off of there get it all
out of the way so it's brand brand
spanking new from the factory so the
front like I said the screen is really
nice it's an IPS screen has a really
really high resolution like I said also
the fact that it has that that new poly
poly phobic whatever I'm throwing I'm
saying that exactly what you guys her I
said right earlier but it actually keeps
from making fingerprints on the screen
so when you're using the screen it's not
going to get all messed up now on the
back we're going to the Apple logo we're
gonna see the camera now this is a 12
megapixel wide-angle camera has a 1.8
aperture digital zoom up to 5x it has
portrait mode portrait lighting optical
image stabilization a 6 element lead a 6
element lens quad led true tone flash
with slow sink panorama 2 6 3 megapixels
sapphire crystal lens cover just a lot
of features including a hybrid IR filter
a lot of features inside of the camera
on this particular phone which is why I
said hey I'd like to really do a battle
between the cameras now also another
thing cool about the camera is you can
do 4k recording at 24 frames per second
30 frames per second or yes believe it
or not 60 frames per second all off of
the iPhone 10 R so that's pretty really
really nice digital zoom up to 3x
optical in the optic but still having
trouble saying that optic image
stabilization for videos extended
dynamic range for videos all in all nice
stuff you can do at 1080p 720p features
which we'll get into actually more we do
the comparison thing so and on the front
there's actually another camera they
call this the true depth camera it's a 7
megapixel camera with a 2.2 aperture
pretty much all the same other features
though as the rear camera all in all
like that said it's already ready to
start me up and do all that stuff and
I'm not going to register this phone now
all of your Wi-Fi antenna are called
bands and you can see them both on this
side of the phone and on this side of
the phone as well so you're never going
to get good Wi-Fi reception since the
antenna is actually built into the
entire phone pretty much take a look at
the right-hand side of the phone right
here we have your wake and sleep button
then down here you have your SIM card
slot it comes a little too
like this nice little tool right here
you just take this tool and you insert
it here and push down it opens it up
nice and simply insert your SIM card
actually user SIM card in here put it
back in here and stick it back on the
phone and hopefully don't drop the phone
on its side but there you go now on the
left hand side of the phone pretty
simple stuff here you just have a silent
ring button and your volume up and down
and last but not least for those of you
wondering hail Rick what iOS comes
inside of this tone well it comes with
the brand new iOS 12 so like I said in
the very beginning of the video if
you're a person who doesn't care your
non centric about whether it's you know
where that's apples or it's PC whether
it's Samsung whether it's Android if all
you want is a phone that's very easy to
use I will say this a lot of my friends
a lot of my doctor friends Android name
they all do have iPhones my mom has an
iPhone jonathan tod all of his friends
around him all this hipster buddies they
all have iphones and so there's a reason
for that they are and a lot of ways
easier to use than the android versions
now me personally i have a samsung i'm
used to using the android version of
stuff like that i'm not you know a big
big big you know fan of the phones but
there are some very nice features about
this phone the screen is actually really
really nice it's a very beautiful screen
all the features inside of it are up to
date has fast process or all that kind
of stuff and i mean a lot of the new
things that are coming out these days
whether it be video cards or phones
they're all gonna be like in that range
it's pushing $1000 and sometimes even a
higher you know what i'm saying so it
comes what it would you really be using
more video card or using a phone that's
gonna be really simple and easy to use
so we'll be bringing you guys a video
like I said comparing the pixel three
against this phone in a head-to-head
battle and let's see which one of those
two phones actually at the end of the
day would be worth your hard earned cash
so if you're looking to check out more
information about these we'll have links
down below to John's videos on this
particular product as well as where you
can pick one up over on Amazon and
support the channel
um I'm Alaric thanks for watching we'll
see you guys back on here for more tech
here on tech of tomorrow peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
