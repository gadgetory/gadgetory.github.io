you tomorrow's technology today I'm your
host elric Faris and today we've got a
nice product spotlight video from the
folks over at Kingston now you guys know
Kingston make the line of hyperx drives
and make all kinds of memory and other
products now this particular product
we're looking at today it's a
performance upgrade kit this is the new
kingston SSD now 200 v plus series drive
this is a 90 gigabyte SSD designed to be
your primary boot and partial storage
drive now this drive is really targeted
towards the individual who takes the
drive with them on the road a lot or is
keeping their information very close to
heart and wants to maintain it best
thing for this drive I feel is for the
person who just bought themselves a
laptop they're traveling businessman and
they travel very much around the world
you want to make sure you have a drive
inside your system that will maintain
your information not get broke till you
drop your laptop now 90 gigabytes is
enough to store your OS and a lot of
information still on and that's where I
feel this drive is really targeted at
now being a performance upgrade kit
though it will be able to be installed
either into a laptop or into a normal PC
you'll actually be able to backup all
your information store your information
on the included drive take your their
drive out and uses an external drive as
well this drive features the latest Sam
force controller let's first take a look
at the box before we actually unbox it
and see what comes inside of it all
right folks here we can see the front of
boxes at kingston ssdnow 200 v plus
series performance upgrade kit also this
drive is targeted somewhere between
high-end desktop and actually enterprise
performance dr it's right in between
that segment it's a good target audience
these guys are trying to look for you
guys can see it's the 90 gigabyte
version Sam force driven three-year
warranty everyday business class
solid-state drive so that's why I said
business class somewhere between high
performance desktop and enterprise put
them on the back what you guys see it
they actually show all this little stuff
here this is actually what's going to
come inside of it they have it all laid
out there you can see it so if your
purchase are going out looking
shelf you go oh hey that comes inside
the box that Rob's me of buying boxing's
damn them of it for now and put a
sticker there no all right let's pop the
cap right here on the cob little tray in
here pull that out looks like a little
quick meal yeah stick that in the
microwave and you're good D munch it up

and get that out of the way here are the
brackets these are for installing your
SSD into a normal 5.25 Bay go ahead and
set those off to the side we get the
molex to SATA power connector let's say
the cable itself here is the external
USB cable here is the external drive bay
package like I said before you can put
this Drive that comes in here inside of
this hook it up to your existing system
clone your hard drive over onto this
remove the drive out of this put in your
system and put your old drive back into
here to use as an external drive it's
pretty cool stuff it's using conjunction
with this that's pretty cool stuff some
performance up break it here is the
drive itself see it's 90 gigabytes
ssdnow 200 v plus flip it around the
back very solidly made it's got the
screw holes in the normal placement so
you be able to change the cover if you
wanted to some modders like to do that
here's the power and the Sega show you
guys too thin side chat and this is it
folks this is everything that comes in
the box and even the box itself so there
you go folks kingston ssdnow 200 v plus
series 90 gigabyte performance upgrade
kit you guys always ask what the price
is so the price in this drive is about
one hundred and thirty dollars you can
get it on both newegg and Emma

this drive is target really towards the
laptop market because having a 90
gigabyte SSD in your system that runs
this fast compared to the normal drive
that comes inside of a laptop is going
to be stellar that said thanks for
