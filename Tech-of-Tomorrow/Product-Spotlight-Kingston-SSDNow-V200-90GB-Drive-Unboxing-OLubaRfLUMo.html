Kingston make the line of hyperx drives
and make all kinds of memory and other
products now this particular product
we're looking at today it's a
performance upgrade kit this is the new
kingston SSD now 200 v plus series drive
this is a 90 gigabyte SSD designed to be
your primary boot and partial storage
drive now this drive is really targeted
towards the individual who takes the
drive with them on the road a lot or is
keeping their information very close to
heart and wants to maintain it best
thing for this drive I feel is for the
person who just bought themselves a
laptop they're traveling businessman and
they travel very much around the world
you want to make sure you have a drive
inside your system that will maintain
your information not get broke till you
drop your laptop now 90 gigabytes is
enough to store your OS and a lot of
information still on and that's where I
feel this drive is really targeted at
now being a performance upgrade kit
though it will be able to be installed
either into a laptop or into a normal PC
you'll actually be able to backup all
your information store your information
on the included drive take your their
drive out and uses an external drive as

force controller let's first take a look
at the box before we actually unbox it
and see what comes inside of it all
right folks here we can see the front of
boxes at kingston ssdnow 200 v plus
series performance upgrade kit also this
drive is targeted somewhere between
high-end desktop and actually enterprise
performance dr it's right in between
that segment it's a good target audience
these guys are trying to look for you
