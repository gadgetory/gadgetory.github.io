tomorrow welcome back once again to
another edition of tech of tomorrow and
some very cool things have been
happening at this year's GDC in fact
intel has made some amazing
announcements about some of their new
products now they have three things that
they're really pushing at this year's
GDC the first is all new software for
they're all in one line that's right you
guys know the on one of the things that
everything in it the monitor everything
you just touch the screen and you go the
next is this new Intel ready mode that's
right ready mode technology so it's
gonna be pretty trippy stuff and you're
also going to get four new enthusiasts
based overclocking products coming out
this year so without any further ado
let's jump in and let's talk about all
this stuff until it's really seeing it
this year's GDC now folks
Before we jump in and talk about those
first few things let's talk about how
Intel is really trying to evolve the
desktop like they're really trying to do
a lot of things by pushing their AIO
technology making it a lot better
they're also trying to explore much more
into the enthusiast segment and probe
out new areas you know we're PC stuff is
generated cuz over the years that's
changed we start off with a giant PC
like the one behind me now you've got
things that are basically the size in
your hand that'll do everything a PC
would back in the day you start out with
a small monitor giant PC then things
evolved a little bit there you've got
bigger monitors smaller pcs now you've
got the Nook from Intel
you've got phablets tablets you've got
all these different products out there
for the mobile segment I mean Intel's
really exploring they want to do more in
this area they really want to see okay
what's going on the desktop because you
guys know almost everybody has a
standard PC so that kind of market it's
really sort of dried up so Intel needs
to extend and find other areas to get
your attention and they're really going
to be doing that in 2014 first off we're
going to talk about all of the new
software application
that are coming out for the IAO which
will help you interface much easier with
that product
AOS are expanding as well they have a
whole new series of these ones coming
out some even sit flat they're giant
screens they look amazing and they're
gonna be great interface with let's
right now talk about some of these new
software applications that are going to
be coming out they're geared strictly
for the AI o and for you here in this
next screen we're going to show you how
Intel perceives their journey to
reinvent the desktop you can see from
2009 2010 era all the way to 2014 2015
plus that Intel has a roadmap that
they're going by and you can see from
the screen that they're doing some
different things like I said previously
there are 12 the new PDA io multi-user
multi-touch applications being released
until there's over a hundred and seventy
applications they're gonna have a lot of
different stuff wheel of fortune
snowflake entertainment you guys can see
all these things that are out there home
interior Holi clock chubby kings and
penguins that one's interesting sounding
parking friends he halli Galli prankster
planet plus all kinds of other things
film new buzz you guys can see from the
screen they're just a lot of new stuff
that's coming out including some stuff
from ubisoft sony and others so this
should be some pretty interesting stuff
making the aio much more accessible and
you know like I said before user
friendly for you one of the really key
areas that Intel's
seriously been pushing though as of late
and you can see they're really going in
this direction is the Nook the next unit
of computing it's a very small little
box that contains all kinds of killer
stuff in a very small area now these
things are geared for those people who
need to save space but still have
powerful little computers to do stuff
with and it until it's going to be
expanding upon this market quite a bit
you guys all know everything's getting
smaller and smaller and smaller so
possibly in the future Intel's gonna
have a computer that's basically know
the size of a watch with all the power
and everything you see in a total
desktop the Nook is a pretty cool thing
if you're a person right now and you're
looking for something for your home to
be your interface or anything like in
your living room and stuff this is
really awesome also if you're in office
you'd have a lot of space on your desk
these things are quite amazing they're
even gonna have wireless technology
where you could actually have this thing
hooked up have a wireless monitor you
could have wireless keyboard and really
a totally wireless environment think
about that that'd be really cool so you
walk into your room
you have none of these cables none of
the stuff in your way whatsoever you go
in and you like can like interface with
it automatically which we're gonna get
up to next we're talking about this new
Intel ready mode technology now this
Intel ready mode technology is gonna be
used for a bunch of different stuff but
it really key stuff is going to be based
inside of your home you'll be able to
walk inside your home and your camera
and everything that you have it's
connected with this will automatically
be awake so it'll you walk in the house
all your pictures everything that you
want download it will automatically be
into this thing also with ready mode
technology it'll actually make your
computer use a lot less electricity it's
kind of like this super duper advanced
sleep mode it's like really smart
technology it allows your computer to go
in this like stem over it's like totally
sipping electricity out so they call it
sippin so it's like at a little tea
party how was it it was divine there and
that will be pretty cool stuff because
you know right now it seems like as far
as the processor going super fast 5.0
seems be kinda like where it's like out
right now until they invent something
new that seems to be where the speed
barriers so they're going in different
directions power saving being one of
them
like these things can be used actually
even on a boat for navigation they could
be used in all kinds of different areas
now out in public that's they're trying
to push you could walk into some place
and with your technology that bar could
actually know what you like to drink you
go to a library don't know what you want
to do like I guess for some people this
is kind of a touch here this might be a
privacy thing I don't really think about
this so if you like value your privacy
you don't want to share anything you can
be like oh I don't want that but I
really think the future the way things
are going is it seems like everybody's
like just going to be sharing everything
so when you walk into a place it'll be
kind of cool you walk in and then
Charlie the bartender already knows that
you Bob the guy you want a drink
and this is the drink you want you go
somewhere to get something they could
know your favorite picture this you're
on your way to go to the restaurant you
have your phone your smart technology
you click and you interface with that
restaurant they have your order
automatically ready for you want to call
it interface of anybody I know some
people don't like to make the phone call
go hey bro called it in oh no man you go
I don't want to call just what you would
need to call anymore so that's pretty
interesting stuff at least I feel here
I'm going to show you guys a screenshot
of some of the ways that Intel feels if
they want to take the desktop to
small spaces in new places they have
areas for your games
in the coffee bar in your home on your
car painting on a farm energy generator
cross-site collaboration on your bar
point of pour like I was talking about
before getting your drink on Wall Street
and then the Intel's last thing
everywhere so basically you would be
connected around the world wherever you
go through your smart device I think
that in itself is really cool and the
home thing hmm would be cooler come in
walk into your home automated technology
have your dinner cooking and everything
like that
I'm thinking that sounds good now we've
gone over the Nook we've talked about
Intel's trying to do all these things
with the small computer all this stuff
but now let's take a look at another
shot that they show at the GDC which
talks about some of the other areas that
Intel really wants to touch upon these
areas include the touch screen voice
assistance 3d depth camera no password
interfaces wireless display amazing
battery life HD displays and Intel's
iris graphics by now many of you have
probably heard about Intel's the next
generation of graphics systems that are
new iris now basically iris has built
under the processor just like AMD APU is
now AMD has been really aggressively
hitting this mark but now we see Intel
also aggressively entering the onboard
market so they're gonna have their own
high-end GPUs on their CPUs very soon
and this iris is the first stepping
stone block in seeing that happen as far
as the desktop goes right now Intel has
four key areas that they're working and
they split them up into different groups
they have the very top of the group
which was the extreme then they add
their performance the mainstream and
then entry-level when the big in the
video we talked about introducing some
brand new things for the overclockers
let's jump in and let's talk about some
of that new stuff so like I said in the
beginning of the video Intel is
releasing four brand new overclocking
processors the first of these is going
to be the extreme edition this is the
new Intel Core i7 extreme edition
processor it's going to feature eight
cores ddr4 and it's gonna be on the x99
chipset pretty bad
stuff the next CPU is the unlocked fifth
generation Intel Core processors with
the Intel Isis pro graphics embedded now
this is an unlocked for the generation
Core processor codenamed Broadwell for
desktop on Intel 9 series chipset
motherboards for the first time bringing
Intel isis pro graphics to the desktop
socketed unlocked processor market it's
also going to be based on the new 14
nanometer process so that's pretty cool
also later this year Intel celebrates 20
years of Pentium processors by having
their anniversary edition now this is
going to be an unlocked processor that
features their new quick sync and will
work on both the 8 and 9 series chipset
so it's really cool to worth on both the
older boards and the newer boards coming
out and it's pretty cool to see Intel
celebrating 20 years of being in the
processor business last but not least we
see another unlocked fourth generation
processor coming out from into later on
this year codename Devils cannon it's an
Evo processor supposed to have improved
thermal dynamics you know it's supposed
to work on both the 8 and 9 chips as
boards as well not a lot of details out
about it but hey it's the last of the 4
and like I said they go all the way from
the top all the way down to the bottom
one thing though before I bounce out of
here want to give special thanks to
