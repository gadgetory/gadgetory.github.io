already can a guy get a break I guess
not hey I'm Elric welcome back to Tod we
bring you all the tech all the time and
today we've got something that I think
is really badass from the people over at
Corsair thanks to my buddy Rick Allen my
fellow rocker for sending the sample and
this thing is their new RM 650 power
supply now this thing is completely
modular has flat black cables totally
gold certified and also has Corsairs
link in it as well which means it'll
link with the rest of stuff in the
system's you control the fans and all
that stuff pretty cool stuff so with
that said let's actually jump in take a
look at the box what it all has to do
with it and then just check out the
power supply itself and see what it has
to offer
so here it is the Corsair RM 650 now a
lot of the details are right here on the
front you can see as the Corsair link
ready five-year warranty low nose zero
rpm a fan mode that means that when the
things running really cool it'll just
slow down and be quiet 80 plus gold
really good certification you can get it
one higher the platinum but this is
pretty damn good things optimized for
silence fully modular let's flip to the
side real quick and take close-up and
let's talk about all of the cables now
here is a it's a single 80 X 24 pin 20
plus 4 number B is the EPS 8 pin 4 plus
4 then we get C which is 4 PCIe 8 pin 6
plus 2 next up is D there are 8 D those
are your Sata's then next up is e your
peripherals 4 pin there are seven of
those you get two floppy adapters and
then finally G your Corsair a link
that's all of your connectors we're
actually going to take a look at those
in a second let's flip the box around
you guys can see the back the only
really thing they're talking about right
here is their efficiency and the system
load with the fan which is what I was
talking about when the system is running
cool the thing will slow down and almost
have zero fan speed making it entirely
quiet so now let's go ahead let's open
the box up pop the cap over here on the
side I hate when they act like that want
to be all mean with me get my little
fingers in there
alright then we've got the buck section
box within a box within a box we're
going to box them in a box little box
alright so here we go let's flip it
around real quick you guys can see right
there it's SKU number around kittens go
ahead just open the box up
cap they're probably little endcap
jabbers whoo
Wow you open the box up and there's like
instantly a wafting smell like silicone
that comes it talked about the new car
smell oh boy
let's see here what's going on over here
well I guess we actually have to rip the
sticker off
all right so kaboom kaboom wrap the bat
we get the solutions guide of 2012 um
are we in 2013 just saying here's a
warranty guide from course they're all
that stuff in their little book here if
you want to read through that zip ties
for cable management and also a little
case badge powered by courser for those
folks who like to show off what they
have inside their system
next up the power cable you guys don't
know what that is
next up silicon very important make sure
you do not eat this stuff nope it's not
jelly and you can't even add sugar and
taste it so just a waste desiccant bad
out of the way all right so next up
click table
holy crap all there's a lot of cake
let's get those out of the way we'll
come back to the tables
let's pop out and let's actually take a
look at the unit before we go to the
tables now this thing's actually pretty
light damn surprisingly light I got to
tell you folks this thing is
surprisingly light RM 650 high pot is
okay I'm not even touching that you take
what you want with that one here's the
back got a nice on and off switch got
our little plug you guys can see inside
of there some of the copper braiding and
stuff making up some of the internal
parts they've clearly got the name right
here again the RM 650 flip it down the
bottom here's the fan looks nice and
pretty and in fact these guys just sent
me an email announced that they have a
whole new fan line which I'll be
bringing to you guys very shortly these
guys are now making fans that's right up
so here's the back side here is the link
here go your peripherals video cards
power
so all in all pretty decent nice-looking
a little unit right there we'll get that
out of the way and that we'll take a
close-up look open a bag up rip that bag
up let's pull these bad boys out now
earlier we already went over the
quantity everything so now let's just
show these cables to you all breaking
out very nice flat black I like these
some people don't I think they're very
very easy to build systems with other
people say they're a pain in the ass I
guess it's just a matter of opinion and
who's doing the build I'm Anthony our
builder he can go for him or not go for
him with him he's kind of down the road
he likes doing a lot of custom cabling
systems and actually uh you guys have
been saying that he's gotten really good
at cable management and he really
appreciates that because he took a lot
of time to try to get really good at
that for years we just built systems and
nobody cares and all of a sudden cable
man became a big thing and uh Anthony
met the challenge and we're really glad
and I see you guys are as well so I'm
just kind of filling time here is I'm
sticking these things in here but you
guys can see them all I'm just setting
them all out here just one at a time no
need that we already did that so that's
pretty much all the cables folks I gave
you guys the amount you guy just want to
see what they look like they're all very
very flat very thin so when you're
putting them in the back of the case
they'll sit flat in there so you can put
your case on if you don't have a lot of
room behind your case and you still want
to do cable management these can be an
important tool so you get all these
cables power zip ties manual thing and
the unit itself alright folks so there
you have it the Corsair RM 650 fully
modular power supply at 650 watts this
thing will power two cards in SLI or
crossfire it's plenty that you need
unless you're trying to go hardcore now
four cards which hardly anybody does so
for the average user out there this is
going to be a very solid power supply
its ability to totally power down and
run quiet is really cool the corsair
link is really good if you use a lot of
their products together and just overall
I think that the cable management and
this is going to be very well so we
install on to a system I don't think
we're going to any problems at all due
to those flat cables if anybody out
there wants any more information you
like to purchase this down to the like
button the description will have all the
information and links to where you guys
can check out this
our supply so I'm mark we'll see you
back here in Tekken tomorrow for more
tech goods and if you're not subscribed
hey you know what to do otherwise you'll
miss out
and be
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
