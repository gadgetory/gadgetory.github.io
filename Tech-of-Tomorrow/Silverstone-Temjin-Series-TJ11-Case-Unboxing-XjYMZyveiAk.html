tomorrow we've got another really huge
unboxing for you and this thing is huge
this is the Silverstone tengen series TJ
11 enthusiasts series computer case and
this thing is enormous here's a nice
picture of the case itself just some
basic information about the product is
definitely a full tower case it has 9
expansion slots with ventilation for a
tent if you really need it it has
support for XL ATX as well as all the
other standard ATX formats it features a
large motherboard tray cut out for
installing aftermarket cooling for your
processors including water cooling if
that's the route you want to go it
features dual silverstone air penetrator
ap 181 intake fans that run at either
seven hundred or 1200 rpms via a switch
dual see through air intake vents with
removable filters to give you really
good cooling performance so now that
we've gone over that let's actually open
it up have a look
this thing when you've got to the side
trust me on this anxious to see this
thing as you guys are as you see them up
winning the case from the bottom that's
the easiest way to do it that way all
you do set it down slide it off
as you can see it comes packaged in
really nice thick styrofoam there you go
wow isn't that nice you get a nice clear
plexiglass window on the side as you can
see plenty of ventilation here at the
bottom your power supply mounts down
here I'll show you that mounts down here
in the back let me take the side panel
off so we take a look at the inside well
here's the inside of the case as you can
see there's enough room in there for
even maybe a small personal loop this
thing has tons of room here are your ear
penetrator fans that bring cool air in
from the bottom push it up and force out
through the top which as you can see is
ventilated you also have a
120-millimeter fan here to blow air out
so it uses basic thermal dynamics to
pull cool air in your hot air will come
up here where hardy arises and then get
blown out by your video cards and by
this rear fan you have your 9 optical
bay slots here and there are two caddies
for your three and a half inch drives
all you have to do is open it like that
pull it out and you even have support
for solid-state drives just screw them
in here to the bottom it fits in between
the two rails slide it in we just lock
it back into place I'll show you the
front of the case
looks like you've got power and reset
here at the top and the bottom as you
can see you've got two USB 2.0 ports on
this side along with a headphone and
microphone jack and if I spin it around
you've got two USB 3.0 and here is
actually your preset button so you have
two options three power buttons okay
let's take a look at what comes in the
accessories box with this case we got
your manual you've got your plates as
you can see for ssds solid-state drives
you've got extra filters your fans we've
got a 24-pin motherboard connector but
here's the cool thing you can run dual
power supplies isn't that cool
plenty of screws for mounting everything
you need you even have a couple of well
actually 333 pin connectors for fans to
a single molex to empower three fans of
a single mullet room power supply and
that is a power supply bracket this has
been the unboxing of the Silverstone TJ
11 full tower case thank you for
