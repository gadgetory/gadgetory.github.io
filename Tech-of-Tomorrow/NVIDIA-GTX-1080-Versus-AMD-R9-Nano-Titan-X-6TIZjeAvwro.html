again on tech of tomorrow if you guys
follow the channel the other day we
introduce you guys to the brand new
video car from the people hold read
Vidya this is their brand new geforce
gtx 1080 card so if you guys want to
check out all the features and all that
stuff you guys are gonna want to check
out that video right here but if you're
looking for performance scores and how
this car does against the competition
and even it a little bit of live doing
gameplay and let's check this out now
just to clarify folks the card that
we're seeing today is the founders
edition version of the 1080 card what
the founders edition mean is that nvidia
has certain specifications that cannot
be changed if they want to manufacture
this version of a card be it from a
third-party manufacturer or a partner
the card size in at 10 inches by 2
inches wide by 4 inches high and two of
the cool things i really like about the
card aren't solid backplate and the fact
that you only have to use a single 8 pin
power connector to power the card and
that the card also has a low power
requirement of 180 watts almost all
operations flow through the sm at some
point in the rendering pipeline with 20
SMS the geforce gtx Tenet's ships with a
total of 2560 cuda cores and 160 texture
units the gtx 1080 also features eight
32-bit memory controllers with a 256 bit
total tied to each of these tivity 2 bit
memory controllers are a trough units
and 256 kilobytes of level 2 cache and
the GP 104 chip used in GTX ships the
total of 64 Rob's in 2048 kilobytes of
level 2 cache the 1080 features the base
clock speed of 1600 and 7 megahertz and
a boost clock of 1700 and 33 megahertz
it also has a memory clock of an amazing
10,000 megahertz with a bandwidth of 320
gigabits a second and on the back of the
card you can see there are a pair of sli
bridges and Nvidia now states they only
support two cards in SLI mode the
chipset itself has seen a dice rank it's
gone from a 28 nanometer process down to
the 16 nanometer FinFET process what
this means that everything has gotten
smaller and this is actually going to
help keep the card running cooler and
running better so those are the fun
facts about the card now let's check out
the test system and check out what you
guys have all been waiting for
Foreman scores now the test system that
we're using in all the testing for
today's video was all done in the FPS
Devastator system this is an Intel based
system featuring an i7 6700 lots of
other great parts if you guys want to
see that full build in case you missed
it we'll have a link right here to that
bill also all the drivers that were used
in today's video were all the very
latest as you can get from both Intel
and AMD and every single test that we
ran was run at 4k in its ultra or at
1080 and it's absolute all true
ultra settings couldn't get any higher
otherwise the machine would probably
break so with that said though let's now
check out those performance scores
we bought the table here is doom now
this is the OpenGL version they won't
have the bulkan version they said for
about 30 days in the patch but you guys
can see this game's completely rockin
and all the settings are turned to their
maximum you guys can see that
everything's as high as it can go in
ultra 4k over 60 frames per second
everywhere and doom is just fun I gotta
say though this game is super freakin
fast man you got to have a lot of great
hand-eye coordination to play this
sucker it's insane
and multiplayer even though I got my ass
kicked
ain't so shabby either
okay so there you have it folks finally
the performance scores for the GeForce
GTX 1080 now I just gotta say the main
thing that impressed the hell out of me
about this car is that its ability to
handle 4k like every single game that we
threw at this damn thing was able to be
played at 60 frames or bug some even up
to 70 frames per second in 4k with
everything tuned up to its maximum
setting and that's pretty incredible
because all the cards in the past always
struggled and struggled and struggled
doing 4k on their own so pretty much I
got to say right out bat this card is
definitely 4k ready for damn sure
it also passed the VR test which V
already and all that stuff all rolled in
one now you guys all know that AMD is
obviously going to have some card to
come back and compete against this but
at the moment you guys can see obviously
the 1080 is the single GPU King it rules
across the board and everything that we
did it just rocks and it's really made I
think for 4k as you guys can see do all
the scores I mean if you're not really
playing 4k gaming I don't know I think
this cards completely overkill the fact
that only takes 180 watts of power
though in a single 8 pin power connector
that's also a pretty awesome fact you
guys like the back panel make sure you
guys get the founders Edition card now
there will be other cards out there on
the market some of them with even specs
that are lower than the founders Edition
that's the car they're talking with me
599 dollars I haven't seen those cards
yet and there'll be some that are even
more expensive with after card marketing
excuse me after you know cooling
additional crazy aftermarket cooling
excuse me I've been up for two days
testing with gene what it's like to get
this video done time so but that's it
folks the 10 days here and I know you
guys all were saying where's the 1070
where's the 1070 heck I haven't seen a
1070 actually in my hand or any of that
stuff yet but it will be coming now like
usual before I bow out of here if you
guys want to check out some free
software for using in your game or
minding your system makes you guys check
out cam from NZXT one thing cool about
it is like I said it's completely free
and it monitors all your temps and all
kinds of things it'll do it on a monthly
basis weekly basis our
the basis it monitors everything her
system blah blah blah it's just crazy
like usual there'll be links down below
where you guys can poke we buy this car
for yourself and to the free cam
software I'm Mel work you've been
watching teka tomorrow and you just saw
the 1080 founders edition card here on
Tyco tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
