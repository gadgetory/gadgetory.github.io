this is elder Ferris here on the tech of
tomorrow youtube channel all right i'm
gearing up for CES and in that thing i
actually want to get a different type of
recording device than my zoom h1 that
i've been using and carrying around so
today I'm going to do the unboxing of
the new rode shotgun videomic this mikes
about a hundred and forty nine dollars
you can find it all over the Internet I
actually found for 102 dollars but I
wanted to go with Amazon because they
had some great free two-day shipping so
let's check out what's inside the box of
this new rode shotgun video mic alright
so here's the outside of the box will
show you that here's the back of the box
not much there on the side of the box
they show you a few features this and
that we'll go ahead and we'll open this
up all right on the top we get a few
things i'll pull those out i'll just
basically call the accessory packs out
of first and then get back to the
microphone itself so we get some little
clips here since i just bought this i
don't know exactly what they're for so
then kicked my butt in your comments cuz
i don't know what they are cuz i just
got and i just opened it here is a
sticker for rode rode microphones pretty
good this australian company really
famous for their microphones here's your
little Quality Assurance checklist make
sure everything's cool with you you also
get your 10 year registration warranty
and then your video myke instruction
manual that's the other essentials now
let's pull out the actual road Mike
itself now this thing looks really
professional it's got a long elegant and
microphone all across the thing you've
got a buffer here this keeps up like a
pop filter for keeping anything out it
mounts on top of your camera now the
only thing i will say after picking up
putting in my hands it does feel rather
plasticky and rather cheap I hope the
performance level on it's a lot better
than what it feels like but just by
feeling it it feels kind of very
plasticky but here's everything that
comes in the box of the new rode shotgun
videomic you get the mic itself with
match on your camera there's a little
plug that plugs into your audio and you
get all these little nifty little things
right here that we talked
about before so thanks for watching the
tech of tomorrow YouTube channel and see
here on the internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
