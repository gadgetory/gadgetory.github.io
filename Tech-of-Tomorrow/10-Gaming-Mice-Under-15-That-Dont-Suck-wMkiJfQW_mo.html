we're gonna bring you guys a video of
ten different mice for under $15 now
some of these in fact most these are
actually you know labeled as gaming mice
although probably a little car one you
know just Wireless isn't really gonna be
a game mice but technically any Mouse
that you can play a game with is a
gaming mouse the only you know really
mess that I would say is really told
totally geared towards gaming would be
one that has like all the programmable
buttons in the side for doing all those
crazy games you're doing spells and all
that stuff beyond that we all know a
good mouse is a good Mouse but anyways
all the ones we're gonna be taking a
look at today I purchased out of my
pocket I bought them all of a vimana and
off of emesis as as osdas is on yeah I
got them off of Amazon there and I got
them all here in house so let's jump in
and let's check all these out at the end
of the video we'll have links to all
those things if you want to check them
out and get more but some honestly for
the price range if you're looking for
something that's not gonna break the
bank obviously it's gonna be you know a
somewhat of a disposable product that's
under $15 you know which which means you
know pretty much should be breaking
you're not gonna like pull your hair out
or freak out and go oh my god weird in
my beautiful Mo's go but hey let's jump
in let's check them out let's see what
they're about and you know why there are
under 15 bucks first up we have the acro
Xtreme wired computer gaming mouse now
this is an optical mouse with four
adjustable levels from 1200 all the way
up to 3200 dpi now they claim that this
mouse is ambidextrous but that's
definitely not the case this is
seriously only a right hander guys Mouse
because the way the controls are it's
got the standard layout of pretty much
any Mouse that you've seen out there
you've got your two controls on top
scroll button adjustable dpi down below
that on the left hand side you've got
two clickable buttons now one of the
features about this particular one is it
does have RGB glare breathing lights
it's kind of kind of an ergonomically
designed and I have to say it's pretty
comfortable for most people with medium
sized hands but best yet this particular
product is only $14 so if you're looking
for something that actually feels
comfortable works just fine does
have some great name-brand out there
that's gonna make you pay a fortune you
should definitely check this one out
okay next up we have another Wired
Gaming Mouse this one is the grand Velas
the low tasty 80 now the things that
stand out about this particular product
is it does have a very nice design it's
got a cool spider on the bottom you can
change all of the different lights on it
but what's really the big deal about
this particular one is it has the
highest dpi adjustability out of all the
mice that we're gonna be looking at
today all the way from a thousand dpi
all the way up to 7,200 dpi
it also has more control buttons as well
normally you just get the two control
buttons on top your scroll wheel and the
DPI adjustment button on the left hand
side you can see that there are two
standard control buttons as well as an
additional button on top of that one
thing to take note about this particular
product is it is very very wide this is
probably one of the widest mice I've
ever put my hands on it's not really too
high but it is quite wide so if you're
someone who has a larger type of hand
you might find this mouse to be very
comfortable and once again this
particular products only $14 so it's a
great deal for what it is
now this next particular product it's
actually kind of interesting because
it's actually completely silent that's
right it's a silent click Wireless
Gaming Mouse it's also got LED lights
it's got adjustable DPI from 2400 all
the way up to a thousand dpi it features
a 40 milli amp power lithium battery it
can be used on no matter what you want
to use a PC or a Mac and you're gonna
notice that it does come with a little
charging cable but this charging cable
only is there to charge the mouse up it
will not work to actually control the
mouse you actually have to use the mouse
and the dongle to unit to work
wirelessly now the design this mouse is
actually pretty cool I'm taking a look
at it you can see it kind of looks like
something out of Star Trek or Orval or
one of those science-fiction programs
out there because it kind of looks like
a spaceship or some kind of futuristic
car that you'd see in like a Star Wars
movie the design of this is actually
pretty doggone need now as far as the
layout goes it's pretty much the same
old stuff on the top you've got your two
click buttons for your fingers the
scroll button in the middle
as well as the DPI just been biting on
the left-hand side you get to control
buttons just like every other product
out there on the market just about it is
very comfortable if you're someone with
a smaller hand you might really like
this mouse because it's a very thin
product it's also a little bit high so
if you're a person with really small
hands I think it's you might like this
particular product better than some of
the others that we're looking at today
and best of all hey this products only
$13 next up we have the HC man T 60
Gaming Mouse that once again this is a
wired product it's only twelve dollars
of the work with whatever system you're
using whether it's a Mac whether it's a
PC the layout is pretty much the same
like I said as all the other mice the
design in this particular one is very
very minimalistic out of all the
products that we're looking at I would
say this one has honestly one of the
most minimalistic designs out of all the
ones that we're taking a look at today
it's just a plain black design and only
one button is a different color and you
guys can see the layout same as always
two click buttons for your fingers in
the center you have the scroll wheel the
adjustment for your DPI on the left hand
side you have two control buttons and up
above that you have the additional
control button like we saw one of the
previous products earlier today this
particular product has a dpi adjustment
level from 1200 all the way up to 3200
dpi and it also has seven programmable
buttons but the weird thing was in order
to get the software to use these
programmable buttons we actually had to
email the company which is something
we've really never had to do before
although they did get back to us really
really quickly now this product has a 12
month warranty and a 30 day money back
guarantee as well as a rapid fire button
and it's only $12 the first thing that
comes to mind when I take a look at this
next product is room zoom zoom because
alright let's just face it it's a car
mouse it's the Sun rain wireless car
mouse in fact 1600 dpi 10 meters of
Wireless distance now it does need to
triple-a batteries and they don't
include these and to access these and
the dongle all you do is pretty much
take off the top of the car like it's a
one of those little convertibles and
then you can access all that stuff
pretty simple product if you like a car
and you think it's pretty cool this is
more of a novelty
you know like I said not all these mice
are completely geared towards gaming but
if it can work for gaming obviously it
can be a gaming mouse for you this
products only twelve dollars look for a
novelty product it's cool and I think
it's pretty neat I'm just gonna set it
on my desk and just let it look cool who
even cares if it works and best of all
check it out it's got lights on the
front and back come on you can even see
where you're driving at night this next
product is by a company called T shucks
and I have to say that out of all the
products that we looked at today this
was probably my least favorite and
there's a couple reasons why for one
thing it's absolutely totally light I
mean it feels like you have nothing in
your hand whatsoever and me personally I
prefer a mouse that has some weight to
it also it seemed to have some serious
problems with the scroll wheel now even
though it kind of looks plain and I mean
it is really really plain and it's also
very very wide so if your person has a
really small hand you probably would not
like this particular mouse as well and
the layout of it same as always
you have your two buttons on top the
scroll which we talked about a second
ago I don't think works very well the
two DPI control buttons on the left hand
side your two standard control buttons
and you get the extra button up there on
top like we've seen on multiple products
today now they're claiming this
particular product work on your Mac your
PC or it will even work with your ps4 so
I didn't try it with that but hey they
say it works that way this product is
actually very low price it's under
$11.50
now the GM 18 also has seven adjustable
dpi levels from a thousand dpi all the
way up to sixty eight hundred dpi this
Mouse like I said is very cheap it's
under $11.50 if you're somebody who
likes a mouse that's completely light
and feels like you don't have a mouse in
your hand whatsoever and you've got kind
of a big hand and just want something
you can throw around and not really have
to worry about then you might want to
check it out but like I said I'd have
all the products we looked at today I
have to say honestly this is my least
favorite the Virgin tech RGB Gaming
Mouse is actually pretty nice especially
for a product that's only ten dollars
that's right I said it ten dollars and
you
I can see that this thing actually has a
very nice design to it I think it
actually looks really cool it's kind of
light um like I said I prefer a heavier
Mouse it's not as light as the previous
one we talked about but it is still kind
of light it has seven colors of LED
backlights it has four dpi settings all
the way up to 2400 dpi it also has six
buttons it'll work with your laptop
it'll work through your Mac your PC and
it might even work with some of those
gaming systems out there you'll just
have to try it out and see if you're a
person who has really small hands I
think that you'll actually like this
Mouse quite a bit because it's very
comfortable for people with small hands
I have a medium-size hand and it's kind
of comfortable for me because it's very
very thin for people like I say to have
giant hands you might want to steer away
from this particular product now the
design layout once again the same as you
get on all the other mice you get your
two control buttons on top scroll wheel
adjustable DPI wheel and on the left
hand side you get your two additional
control buttons just like almost every
other product we looked at today one
nice thing about this particular product
is on the bottom and it has some really
nice anti-skid things so that when
you're using on any service that pretty
much slides across it without any
problem whatsoever so if you don't want
to break the bank you got ten bucks you
want something that just works and still
looks pretty cool hey this one might
just be for you now the next product
we'll be taking a look at is by a
company called Langer and I have to say
that out of all the products that we've
looked at today my personal favorite of
them all is this particular one it
doesn't have anything that's really so
different than any of the others you
know it has adjustable dpi buttons it
has the adjustable scroll button as the
standard to control buttons and then an
additional two control buttons on the
left hand side but what I like about
this particular product is it is heavy
that's right this thing has a lot of
weight in it and I like that a lot you
can adjust the DPI from 1200 all the way
up to 3200 dpi I think it's very very
comfortable for medium sized hands it's
definitely gonna last you a long time it
slides across services without a problem
whatsoever and just really for ten
dollars this thing just looks absolutely
my I think it's one of the best ten
dollars I've ever spent in my life
especially on a PC product so if you
want to get one of these for yourself
you've got a medium-sized hand you like
something that's heavy and built like a
tank you may just want to be checking
out this bad boy I know I like it now
last but not least I think this product
was made from the communications officer
on the original Star Trek because this
is the Aurora Gaming Mouse that's right
it's a wired gaming mouse with six
programmable buttons
it also has software that you can
download as well it has seven color LED
lights it's pretty ergonomic I think out
of all the products we looked at today
that the weight of it is right in the
middle now the lighting scheme on this
particular product however is really
killer to me it kind of reminds me of
Tron just the way certain colors in it
it kind of just reminds me a lot of the
way Tron looks you can change the colors
obviously but what there's a certain
one's the blues that totally remind me
of the Tron universe it's pretty
ergonomic like they said it's
comfortable in my hand I think that
someone who has a smaller hand will find
it even more comfortable someone who has
a very very large hand I think this
particular product will be a little bit
small for you but best of all this
particular product check it out it's $7
that's right $7 so you get a mouse with
all of these features you've got
programmable buttons software and
everything and it's only seven dollars I
don't honestly see how you can go wrong
it's comfortable it actually will
probably last it has the same layout as
all the other ones that we've looked at
today it's the standard two buttons on
top scroll wheel adjustable DPA and two
left-hand buttons and it does have
little interesting things in the bottom
so it doesn't get stuck on surfaces and
check this it even has an 18 month
warranty
say what alright so there you have it
ten so-called gaming mice and one new
it's really not so much of a game might
as I guess so nine somewhat gave me my
send one little cool grace car mouse
okay but all of them under $15 which
means they're very affordable so we will
have links down below so if you guys

one of these bad boys or get one for
