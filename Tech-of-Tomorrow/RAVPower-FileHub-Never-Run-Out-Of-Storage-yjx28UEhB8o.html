something really interesting on the
table today
this is the ravpower fire hub this
particular device doubles as a lot of
different products and has a lot of
different uses so let's dive right in
and let's check it out the ramp our file
hub is not only a file transfer Haven
it's also an external battery and a
wireless router so you do get kind of a
lot out of this $60.00 device now on top
under a soft rubber cover is a USB port
a micro USB port and an Ethernet port
and on the side you'll find an SD card
reader which will read SD SDHC and SDXC
cards up to 256 gigabytes along with
that you'll see a 2.45 gigahertz button
for the device's Wi-Fi so you can
connect wirelessly through your
smartphone tablet or laptop there's also
an SD 2 USB button this is the one key
back up button and this is actually
pretty cool when you have an SD card in
the device as well as a flash or a hard
drive connected via the USB this button
will automatically backup any data on
the SD card to the drive so you can
literally backup your files with a
single touch of a button and finally the
power button is on the other side now
the file hub works with the Rav file hub
app and it's available in the iOS and
Google Play stores
once you've connected the file hub to
the app on the home page you will see
video photo and music options and back
up top shion's as well for your photos
contacts and SD card you can also manage
more than one device connected to the
file hub just stick in your SD card or
USB Drive and within seconds you'll see
it pop up in the app
all you need to do is just swipe to see
any connected devices it'll show you
your used and available memory on that
device as well navigating through the
app is also pretty easy you hit the file
management button and it takes you to
another screen here you can view what's
connected to the file hub as well as any
files on your phone tablet or laptop and
like I said before transferring all
these files is as easy as hitting a
couple of buttons you can move delete
share or even rename files in the file
hub app another cool thing about the
file hub is that it can also double as a
power bank with a sixty seven hundred
milliamp hour battery you can charge
your smartphone or tablet at least one
to two times before it needs to be
recharged you can also connect an
ethernet cable to the file hub this will
allow it to become a regular router as
well as an access point meaning it'll
take a wired network signal and make it
wireless you can also use it as a bridge
to extend your Wi-Fi network now how
this works is the file hub actually puts
out its own network so all you'll have
to do is connect to the file hubs Wi-Fi
and you're good to go
the file hub is actually a really
interesting product because it doubles
as a lot of different things you're not
just locked into one particular function
and what's best of all I feel is that
you never have to worry about running
out of storage on your phone ever again
if you find your phone is getting stored
up with information all you got to do is
transfer that information off via the
file up and you're good to go like usual
if you're interested in this product or
want to get more information about it
we'll have a link down below to
including a discount code where right
now you can get this for even cheaper
thanks for watching Tector tomorrow
we'll see you guys back here on the
channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
