back once again at echo tomorrow I'm
Eric your host with my co-host buddy the
dog you guys have all asked for so he's
back for another edition so what's going
on the channel today we'll check it out
you guys all know that Samsung's latest
galaxy s4 is hit the market it's got a
 ton of features now today's video
we're going to be bringing you the top 5
reasons of white kicks ass over an apple
iphone 5 now the very first reason you
guys all know is that the new samsung
galaxy s4 can capture smell through a
picture as mom i smelt the rooms you
guys didn't really believe that did you
like that fool yeah if so you know every
housewife out to be taking picture of
her dinner and sent it to her husband
just so we can smell it and make sure he
comes home on time now the actual number
one reason we feel is obviously it's the
display 1920 x 1080 Full HD you can
watch a blu-ray walking around on your
phone just looks amazing now it's also
got a 5-inch screen and it's got so much
pixel density that Apple fans would be
just left wanting in the field now
what's the apple iphone 5 got well it
has 11 36 x 640 and it's got some pixel
density but nothing like the s4 plus
it's only four inches large so obviously
when it comes to the screen the s4 is
kicking ass over the iphone 5
reason number two for you pump up types
out there the samsung galaxy s4 features
a quad core of 1.9 gigahertz processor
it splits on the puny Apple dual-core
processor making it stronger faster and
more powerful than the measly five
number three okay check this out the
samsung galaxy s4 it has removable back
plate which means that you can upgrade
the SD card change your battery out do
all kinds of really interesting things
but the main thing is upgrading so if
you run in a space or you're running a
memory on your iPhone 5 you're just
out of luck and that's it with the
galaxy s4 you've got upgradeability
makes it once again another reason why
it's better than the iphone 5 reason
number 4 camera quality and pixel
quality why go eight when you can go 13
that's right the samsung galaxy s4 is a
13 megapixel camera it's also just like
having the samsung galaxy cam all built
in to the phone now combine that with
the much more intuitive and advanced
camera interface and i just feel that
the samsung galaxy s4 just plainly kicks
ass on the iphone 5 and wait there's a
bee ah reason number 5 the samsung
galaxy s4 features an IR blaster you
guys are going what in the hell is an IR
blasters like a boombox you rock out to
know the IR blaster allows you to remote
control fear infrared control your TV
which is really really cool the app is
right here on the phone you guys can see
it right here with this thing enabled I
can go ahead and I can change my volume
I can change my channel they even got a
bunch of stuff where I can choose a TV
program like a TV Guide all built into
the phone so when it comes to
controlling your TV nope folks eerie
won't do that yet another reason why the
galaxy
s for beats the iphone 5 are everybody
so there you guys have it what we feel
are the top 5 reasons at the samsung
galaxy s4 just plainly kicks ass over
the apple iphone 5 now down below in the
comments section be pretty awesome if we
