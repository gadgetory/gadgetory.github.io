me telling you guys over and over and
over again about YouTube being broken
and I thought that a lot of times you
know in a lot of ways maybe it was just
me like I was just being paranoid or you
know I felt like I was just being picked
on but I've really come to find out
lately that this isn't happening only to
me whatsoever
and once I've kind of opened up my eyes
and started you know going and watching
other videos and searching around on
YouTube looking at stuff I found out
that YouTube really is no longer at all
about you or me at all YouTube should
rename itself because YouTube was
created for content creators to come on
and make their content creation and not
be your standard TV BS that you can get
on any TV network out there but now
they're trying to completely change the
format of YouTube around they're trying
to make it basically youtube TV because
they're so paranoid about you know
Amazon Prime and their shows and netflix
they're trying to compete but the whole
thing is what these guys don't
understand is that that in the end is
what's going to bite them in the butt
and completely probably put them out of
business
right now they say they're oh they're
hurting for money blah blah blah well
this entire entire thing YouTube was
created just like the name YouTube about
people bringing their personal opinions
about things to the channel to the
format so they could bring in their own
unique way so that you guys could go and
watch who you like no matter what their
style was that the guy was a cowboy and
cussed alot or whatever or if he was
meek as a rabbit you had the choice to
do it now YouTube is so censored and so
right-wing it's just disgusting it's
honestly disgusting like I can't even
like be who I really am on the channel
anymore because if I say a cuss word
these are going to monetize my channel
to monetize my video or just
wipe out my channel all together and
like I said I thought that you know in a
lot of ways this was just happening to
me but I just got to watch a video there
day where I got to see like it like
almost 50 different youtubers talking
about their terrible experiences
including some of the big boys like
Casey you guys know him he's pretty much
like one of the biggest youtubers of all
time saying that he's sick of the
platform and he's tired of it and also
Philly D one of my favorite youtubers
the guy's killer saying that they're not
gonna really be able to make it
successful living on here anymore so
just picture that these guys are like
some of the biggest youtubers that exist
and they're saying that they can no
longer function on YouTube so what do
you think that leaves a little old Elric
here on Tekken Omar because it's always
just been me and a friend of mine
whether it was me and Jonathan Morrison
from TLD when we started the channel or
me and Jesus is my camera it's only been
two of us there's no big team here you
know we got guest stars of buddy the dog
and rocks you the cat who our guest
stars and that's really it we don't have
any giant corporate sponsorship and
that's another thing the way YouTube is
geared now unless you have a giant
corporate sponsor like Apple or what are
these big huge you know corporate
partners that are partnered up with
Google you can't make it on YouTube
anymore my check this month was like
less than $300 I'm not joking to you so
a whole month worth of my videos all
that work I'm only getting paid by
YouTube for all that work about three
hundred and forty seven dollars yeah
it's shocking right it totally is it's
almost put me completely out of business
like we're literally like this close
right now from from from going under
we're fighting and trying to keep going
on trying to find different avenues of
revenue so you know when you happen to
see some other sponsored videos on here
the reason I have to do these sponsored
videos is well if unless you want to
just totally give up the channel and not
do it we have to figure out a way to get
income on here because there's no way
that I can pay my rent or pay the
cameramen or feed the dog or anything
else without in the income and the
channel is just unbelievably broken like
when I go into my videos and stuff if
you
I rap there were also creators or watch
this you know when you go in there they
give you all these options to choose
from these things to do it's like you
know a hearted comment replied to recent
comment you know Oh blah blah blah blah
all these little things these checklists
that give you points well no matter what
I do in there
those checkpoints always stay marked in
red seriously if you guys want to see
this I can go make a video and just show
you all the air is that it that the
channel gives me there are so many
program errors going on that's just
ridiculous like I can never even get to
like were you know they have like you
know you can get it you know 50 out of
50 points like I can't even get there
anymore because the way they viewed
everything it's so broken that no matter
what I do it just keep saying red
checkmark so no matter what how I comply
no matter what I try to do I can never
really comply with what they want me to
do because it's frickin broken and I
mean it's really broke dick and broken
seriously broken broken broken and what
you're gonna see happen is you're gonna
start seeing a lot of your favorite
youtubers going off of YouTube now I
discovered this new platform called
library it's lbr why and I'm gonna
experiment with that and start doing the
Matt we started doing more of the
patreon stuff but eventually I can see
that there's really not gonna be much of
a future on YouTube for me or for any
other channels out there that are
individuals because pretty much unless
you sell your soul you want to be
completely so you know right that you're
gonna be like Disneyland and does his
face it unless you're a little you know
10 or 11 year old kid
Disneyland is not for adults they need
Disneyland after dark for adults you
know I mean because I'm not about Disney
I've never been like oh you know who are
just gonna you know spoon-feed
everything and talk to you in a baby
voice but that's the way YouTube has
become you can't say any negative
opinions if you say anything negative
about YouTube like they sent me a poll
and literally when I filled out the poll
honestly and I said I didn't like some
of their stuff little I'm not kidding
you the next day my numbers fell so it's
almost like they were like oh you don't
want to kiss our ass and tell us that
they were more like your
next to God well then we'll just make
sure we mess up your channel and I'm not
exaggerating whatsoever all you have to
do to go to confirm this stuff is
looking around the internet and see how
many other people are making videos like
this you know YouTube definitely plays
favorites they have their a little bit
of a channel group that they like and
they promote those channels but God help
any of those other channels that don't
have to fall into their little algorithm
or what they like because if you don't
they'll just kill you off like you can
see my videos are getting like 2,000
views I've had videos where I was the
only person to have that video up before
anybody else and then I'll post it and
it'll be a better video than lioness or
J or as other guys and my video still
will get 2,000 views even though on the
first and my videos more quality the
playing field is completely skewed it's
completely unfair I'm really I'm
honestly sick of it if there was
anything else I could be doing right now
to keep us going trust me I would be
doing that right this second I'm sick of
YouTube it's not really doing much for
me I can't even have contests on here
anymore I can't contact you guys we
can't do giveaways we have to do on
social media and you guys get mad at me
and you're like oh why you did a social
media Elric why not here and you know
people say save do gleam gleam cost
money it's not free you got to pay a fee
I got actually hit with a $500 bill from
gleam that I didn't even know came out
of nowhere
because when a friend of mine was
working here they set up his account and
I didn't know these guys build you
yearly for a huge amount of money so I
get this huge bill from gleam I'm like
what is this
I believin used you a couple times and
thought that was like on a paper basis
so there's really nothing on here really
that's going us here in total numbers
for money I think with Amazon was like
seven or eight hundred dollars and a
couple hundred dollars with them and I
still have my rent my bills my cameramen
everything else so it's just impossible
and I'm tired of selling all my guitars
and pretty much selling everything I own
just to keep a youtube channel going so
we got to find other platforms we got to
move things around YouTube is no longer
about you or me YouTube is nothing but a
corporate Pig that wants to gluttony
stuff itself
on all the channels so it's NBC CBS TNT
whoever it is if you're some big giant
sponsor and Google thinks they can suck
some money out of you you'll be their
best friend they'll love you
but if you're a content creator and you
just want to make good content this is
not the place because they're just gonna
Bend you over and do this to you all day
long over half the money that we make on
YouTube they take that's right so if I
make $1 on YouTube they're taking like
55 to 60 cents of that money so think
about that as well there's really
nothing fair about YouTube they don't
talk to anybody you can't communicate
with them I've tried to communicate with
them many times and say hey you know
there's a problem
they don't care they'll just ignore you
they don't care that's the bottom line
the bottom line is they just simply
don't give a fuck about you they don't
they could give a rat's butt whether
you're on here or not unless you're
making them big bucks with a corporate
sponsor you don't matter and that's just
pathetic because what is it called it's
called YouTube now they want to be
YouTube's TV guess what morons there's
already TV I've got my TV sitting across
the room I've got Amazon Prime I've got
Hulu what do we need you for what to
show the same exact shows that are
already being shown on a bunch of other
network everything that was original
about YouTube is going to be killed and
squeezed out like a lemon until the
limits completely utterly squeezed out
and that means lots of channels lots of
people that you love aren't gonna be
here anymore unfortunately it's not my
fault it's their fault and they suck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
