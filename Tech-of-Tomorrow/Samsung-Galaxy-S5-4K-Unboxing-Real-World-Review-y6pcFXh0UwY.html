today on tech Oh tomorrow we're bringing
you the Samsung Galaxy s5 in full 4k
glory whoa Tech friends what's going on
once again we are filming from Ronald
Reagan Park here in Diamond Bar
California but this time we're doing
things a little bit different we're
coming to you guys in full 4k filming
with the Blackmagic Design that's right
this is their 4k production camera why
are we here
well Samsung's latest greatest flagship
phone has come out the new Galaxy s5 has
hit the market we're going to be doing a
lot of stuff with it today we're going
to unbox it we're gonna give you some 4k
video testing we're going to talk about
some of the top features now you guys
know I'm not exactly the super duper
Foam buff guy if you guys want the most
SuperDuper end you know in-depth review
there's guys out there but there's a
million people out there maybe even
billion people that are just like me
who just use their phone daily and like
certain things about it so first off
let's check out the box now Samsung with
something pretty cool I think they use
this faux wood grain but the coolest
thing about this is it's made of totally
recyclable stuff and it's made with soy
ink so it's great for the planet as far
as the package content it comes with the
actual phone itself the Samsung Galaxy
s5 standard lithium-ion battery a stereo
headset the wall USB charger
one thing to take note of your u.s. user
you're going to be very happy because
the cable that's included is USB 3.0
which makes charging much faster and
last but not least it looks like I'm
stacked with a full head of global
support and product information I've got
me a pair of getting to know your phones
a pair of global support and a pair of
warranty I'm all-in now afraid of you
were wondering what the heck that
background noises that is our friends
here at Ronald Reagan Park playing
tennis behind us now we have two
opponents bouncing the ball back and
forth across the court and this video
were actually bringing you the 4k
footage from the new Samsung Galaxy s5
now I don't really know what these
tennis terms actually mean but I keep
hearing these guys scream love so you
know hey I don't know what that's all
about but if you guys
like what this looks and you guys thinks
is really cool let us know with a
comment down below would you guys think
of the video quality of the new s5 now
let's take a look at the back of the new
galaxy s5 now you guys are going to
notice that this thing has little
dimples now it takes a design from the
note 3 the note 3 that came out
previously had a nice leather background
but didn't have the little dimple so
taking off that they put on the dimples
very good grip you have your heartbeat
monitor 16 megapixel camera and your
speaker all down here now the HTC is
very very slippery the back of this
thing offers little to no grip at all in
fact what my friend from TLD was out
running he's slammed this thing right of
his pocket which is pretty funny because
it is really really slippery this is
actually a much better grip also a few
folks out there wondering here is the
white version this is the international
version but you guys can see what it
looks like right here all in all I'm
really pleased with the grip on this
it's actually quite nice we'll go ahead
now we'll flip it around to the front
give a two megapixel camera up here now
on the bottom we see the home button
which also doubles the fingerprint
reader you have your most recent apps
and you also have your back button and
by the way if you don't happen to notice
we're now filming actually with the
galaxy s5 we thought what better way to
bring you the review and the unboxing
and all that stuff then actually showing
you what the footage looked like off of
the actual phone now jumping back to the
phone let's continue on up here on the
top we have some pretty cool things we
have our headphone jack and then we have
the IR blaster now this thing is
actually used to control your TV pretty
cool stuff over here on the side we have
the sleep/wake and power button despite
all its on this side will traverse down
to the bottom where we see the USB 3.0
slot and this thing's actually covered
because this phone is now water
resistant and dust proof and lastly here
on the side you see your volume controls
up and down all that good stuff for
lowering and raising your volume now
what's inside this bad boy well inside
this bad boy you have a 2.5 Snapdragon
801 processor this is a quad-core bad
boy screen 5.1 super-mo LED features
1080p full viewing now as far as the OS
it's still the TouchWiz it's not as
obtrusive as it used to be but
now 4.4.2 kitkat now being consumer
let's talk about one of the main things
a consumer will use the fingerprint
reader now it's pretty easy to set up
the fingerprint reader just go up here
to the top scroll down go into settings
you'll scroll down here and you'll find
the fingerprint click on fingerprint go
down to fingerprint manager so what
you're going to do at this point is now
you're going to swipe down with your
finger allowing it to register your
fingerprint the more you do it the more
it memorizes it until it gets an actual
complete lock on your finger tip we've
now completed that and now you can also
create a password which I will do at
this time but you guys don't get to see
that so now I've already installed the
fingerprint reader got my password all
set up let's go ahead and check out how
quick this actually works so go ahead
hit the home button it's ask me for my
fingerprint recognized instantly you
guys can see it that works very fast
very easy now how much I'll actually use
this I don't know but I figure there's a
lot of people out there we're going to
really want this feature one thing you
folks are going to want to take note of
is that the Apple iPhone 5s seems to be
geared for one-handed operation as far
as the unlocking techniques go no not
that kind of one-handed operation you
pervert or this phone actually seems to
be more geared towards using two hands
for the unlock button now me personally
I have two hands and I'll be both using
them for this some of you people might
be using one-handed operations
hey I just don't know but enough fooling
around
now we're off to the gym for the water
and for low lighting footage testing
let's go now they say this thing is ip67
water-resistant and we actually put this
thing to the test at the gym first off
found a complete stranger and asked him
to hey would you mind
showering with my phone
like it's good though
oh yeah it's awesome
then I was able to find another guy was
swimming around the pool and I said hey
man you want to take my phone for a dip
and you can see this guy actually dives
down with my phone into the pool filming
the entire time but then we take it a
step even further from the depths of the
pool into the damn sauna where it's over
a hundred and sixty degrees in here you
guys can see me sweating my balls off in
here and it's hot and still the phone
works flawlessly so unbelievable
underwater and the heat of the desert
the phone just keeps on going all right
and since we're at the gym
we thought we'd test out some other
features of this new s5 first of all we
tested out the pedometer this thing will
show you how many steps you take and all
this kind of stuff they also have an
exercise feature where you show your
calories burned out and they also have a
heart rate meter now this thing reads
off the end of the tip of your finger
and I found this particularly to be kind
of a little bit of a pain in the butt to
use a lot of times it wouldn't actually
recognize my heartbeat and it tells you
just be absolutely still so basically if
you're not like frozen like solid like
doctor freeze it seems they have a lot
of trouble reading it so you guys can
see before I started my workout my heart
rate was in the 90s at the end of my
workout it was at a hundred and thirty
mean that treadmill was kicking my butt
now this isn't a reason to go out and
buy the phone because there's all kinds
of programs you can download an app that
might work just as well if not better
but it was still pretty cool to have
this feature at the gym I just wish that
the dang thing read it a little bit
better then it would be spot on
alright folks so now let's bounce back
and talk a little bit more about the
camera now the footage you just saw a
second ago that was on the Blackmagic
Design now we're back using the 16
megapixel camera that comes on the
galaxy s5 there's a little view screen
right there now you guys have all seen
all that killer 4k footage that we did
in video now we've done a bunch of still
stuff using selective focus now this
blurs out the background makes the front
image look really really good so here
are some shots that we took at Ronald
Reagan Park you guys can
these things look brilliant they're very
detailed very clear awesome stuff using
the Galaxy s5 camera also we know some
people are out there going to say hey
how did the HDR work well right here we
have some shots you guys can see how
well it worked with the HDR function on
so there you have it all the features
functionality and cool stuff about the
brand new Galaxy s5 phone now is this
the most well built phone on the market
probably not are some of the features
gimmicky yeah they probably are and
should this probably been with the s4
should have been yeah probably but as
far as consumer stuff goes this thing
has all the bases covered you get a
great camera great still life
photography you've got pretty decent
battery life with that 2800 milliamp
battery yeah about a day and a half of
battery life not quite as good as my
note through which class for a couple
days actually but this thing's going to
be pretty dang close it's easy to use
all that cool stuff but the gym is just
extra topping on top of it but it still
all works the fingerprint reader I know
is the first one that Samsung has ever
had for me I thought it worked pretty
well I thought it worked a lot better
than the heart scan monitor I can tell
you that overall I have to say I'm
pretty impressed with this I've had my
Note 3 for a long time I've liked it but
I'm going to upgrade I'm going to keep
the Galaxy s5 the main reason being is
portability this thing's a little bit
smaller it's a little bit lighter and
the long room at the gym banging around
and run all over town I just wanted
something that was just a little bit
more portable I like this thing
the verizon model that we saw today has
all the features that you want I want to
pretty soon upgrade and get myself a
nice little SD mini card in there and
get me like 32 gigabytes of information
so I can store all my music right in
there and rock out all day but that's it
folks I hope you guys like this type of
video we took a lot of time to bring you
all this stuff I really thought the guy
swimming in the pool and all that stuff
was just really awesome even people at
the gym when we showed him this phone
they were just tripping out they're like
are you really taking this thing in the
water the guy who was taking a shower
with it all he did was ask questions
over and over over going wild going this
is just totally amazing and how many
phones other than the Sony can you see
what people could actually jump in a
pool and swim with it without the phone
take an entire dump at the end of the
day I'm pretty impressed with this it's
not like you know all inspiring great
new technology
but it's got enough cool stuff to make
it interesting to me and to a lot of
consumers out there if you already own
this let me hear your comments down
below I always want to see that stuff if
you guys like this video down there to
like but I know you guys are going to go
a little kung-fu Jackie Chan style on it
and all the information will be down the
description below where you can get this
all that kind of stuff so you're looking
to buy one or just get more information
on it make sure you check out the link
in the description below I'm Miller from
teching tomorrow really hope you liked
this kind of video if you do hate
subscribe and I'll see you guys back on
checking them off for more foam goodness
