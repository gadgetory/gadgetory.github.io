back to tech tomorrow I'm elric Ferris
your host so we bring you all the tech
all the time this week we've got lots of
great stuff nvidia kicking ass in the
mobile market and taking the crown home
we've got benchmarks and a full article
on that also HP once again into the
tablet market last time they get their
asses kicked what's happening this time
and last up in the news that's right HP
has sold their web OS technology to LG
and we have that story as well right
here behind me you can see I've got a
gtx 650ti which i'll be given away so
stay tuned and watch the end of the
video so I folks like I said first up
NVIDIA Tegra 4 it's been released at CES
they made the bold statement they were
gonna kick everybody's asses down the
road and right now they have done that
even the XO nose or the Qualcomm cannot
keep up at this time even though those
people do you don't have some things in
the work that are coming out but for
right now the Tegra 4 is the king of the
ring in mobile technology they are
kicking ass over on our website we have
a full article and the benchmark so if
you guys want to see how fast it is
against all that stuff take a look over
there also next up in the news HP once
again enters the tablet market now the
first time they came out they had one
that ran an OS that was web OS which
we're going to talk about Logan words a
second and that was a complete and total
failure and it ended up selling at a
discount of the market for about 150
bucks now I bought one I actually
currently still have it i don't use it
anymore friend of mine does when he
comes over but their original one to the
market lost now they're coming out with
an android version it's going to be
running 4.1 point one this is the
version of jelly bean that's really
popular right now it's pretty much been
stabilized out no problems these guys
want to make sure that they're not
making any mistakes now all the features
on this thing are pretty decent it's
going to come into market at about a
hundred and sixty nine dollars now some
people are really bitching though
because the sound is basically the beats
by dre audio solution now a lot of
people aren't liking this whatsoever
most the complaints I hear they're
saying mad as soon as I saw that I have
no interest so what do you guys think I
mean at 169 dollars it is coming in
thirty dollars less than like the Kindle
Fire or the google nexus 7 but hmmm the
features are kind of wack I want to hear
what you guys have to say in the
comments below let me hear about it now
last up on the news in religion to the
previous thing we just talked about
obviously HP has now sold their web OS
technology to l.g now they haven't sold
everything off just a lot of parts of it
and LG's going to now develop this and
try to do some smart TV with it now the
people at LG when they were approached
and they were asked about this they seem
to look so unsure of the directions they
were going to in fact the person who's
being interviewed actually just stopped
it was like huh so it seems like they're
confused but HP they obviously know what
they're doing they're shuffling that
 off their plate letting these guys
develop it collecting the cash and
washing their hands on something that
for them was an entire fiasco just like
the palm was so pretty interesting stuff
there hopefully we'll see LG do
something with this and take advantage
of it for now the webos seems kind of
like it's just dead in the water so I
suppose you guys want to know about this
card behind me noppe see you later no
I'm just joking okay you guys want to
know how you can win this card it's
actually very very easy so far I want to
thank the people out there who've been

camper so what do you got to do to win
