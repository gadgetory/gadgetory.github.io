that hit the market this is the risin 5
series starting out at $249 going down
to 169 dollars for brand new skus for
you starting off with the 1600 x going
all the way down to the 1400 vanilla so
let's jump right in let's check out
these CPUs and when you can get your
hands on them yourself so starting off
at $249 we have the 1600 X now this is a
sick scored 12 thread cpu with 3.6
gigahertz as the base clock and
four-point-oh gigahertz as the boost
clock coming up next after that is the
1600 vanilla this is 219 dollars it's
also a 6-core 12 thread CPU comes in
with 3.2 gigahertz as the base clock and
3.6 gigahertz as its boots clock looking
good so far the next up we have a cpu
under 200 bucks that's right this is the
1500 X now this is a fork or eight
thread CPU has a 3.5 gigahertz base
clock 3.7 gogurts boost clock not bad
for the price and then the entry-level
CPU of the new risin five is the vanilla
1400 and is also a fork or eight thread
CPU comes in with three points 2
gigahertz as the base clock and three
points 4 gigahertz add just loose clock
and the very fact that this thing is
only a hundred and seventy dollars makes
it one seriously entry-level badass CPU
