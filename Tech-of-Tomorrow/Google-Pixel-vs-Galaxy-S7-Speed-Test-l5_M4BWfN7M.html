by wonder shares doctor phone never lose
your data ever again hey what's going on
Tech fans youtubers Elric and buddy the
dog here back again on techo tomorrow
what's going on today well this time
we've got another battle of the phones
that's right the samsung s7 no note
since those burned up against the brand
new Google pixel now one of the main
differences between the two phones is
one features a Snapdragon 820 one
features a Snapdragon 820 one with the
pixel being the newer phone so that's
obviously that and a quick shout to
david over at foam buff mean that guy
have been supporting each other for
years now real quick before we jump to
the video I just want to say the only
thing different is the screen size and
the rather not the screen size but the
screen resolution as David's already
pointed out to you guys who fans who
know him screen resolution the test that
we're running really means nothing at
all so with that said though let's jump
in and let's check out what the
difference is between the Samsung s7 and
the brand new Google pixel alright folks
so let's first start off talking about
the specs of the samsung s7 now it
features a 5.1 fully AMOLED screen with
a resolution of 2560 by 1440 with 577
pixels per inch and powering the s7 is
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and the s7
version that we're using is 32 gigabytes
of internal storage and 4 gigabytes of
memory the Google pixel features a 5
inch full HD AMOLED screen which equates
to a resolution of 1920 by 1080 with 441
pixels per inch and like I said in the
intro that pixel features the brand new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 the pixel
features 128 gigabytes of internal
storage and 4 gigabytes of RAM just like
the s7 so first up let's check out
Geekbench so I think you guys will kind
of be surprised because in the single
core processor test you guys can see the
s7 clearly wins but we going to
multi-core obviously the pixel picks up
and it kicks ass and next up we have the
speed test now for you people out there
who complained and said hey it was
totally unfair to do them at the same
time we tested them both completely
separately this time and you guys can
see they're pretty much exactly the same
but what's kind of weird as you guys can
see an upload speed obviously the s7 is
when
so next up let's open up 16 different
apps and see how they perform on these
two phones
now opening up apps initially you can
see that the s7 wins by just a fraction
of a couple of seconds there which is
not very much at all in real-world usage
so basically when you're open the apps
the first time you guys can see that the
s7 is just slightly ahead of the pixel
if only by a small amount
now the only thing that seems to be a
big problem with the s7 is running apps
in the background now we're opening outs
for the second time around with the
pixel everything opens very snappy
snappy snappy but when you're opening up
with the s7 it seems like it's sluggish
and you're just doing things all from
the start once again real quick folks
before we get to the conclusion let's
give a quick shout out to our sponsor
dr. phone from wondershare if you've
ever broken your phone or have gotten
kicked out because you can't remember
your darn password then dr. phone is
here to help now available for Android
doctor phone is the one-stop shop for
data recovery the program is very user
friendly and includes options for data
recovery from broken devices lock

card you can still use doctor phone for
Android doctor phone also has handy
tools you can use such as routing your
Android device data backup and restore
and data erase this comes in great if
you're selling your Android device and
don't want the person you're selling it
to to see you or Duty pigs with doctor
phone you never have to worry about
losing passwords getting locked out and
even if your phone is broke you can
still access your information the bottom
line folks is if your smartphone is
important to you try doctor phone today
now available for Android alright folks
so you guys can see that an all honesty
these two phones are pretty head-to-head
and a lot of things with a couple of
things you know going over to the s7 but
the biggest thing of all that you guys
can see is that if you run multiple
programs you open programs open open
open open all day long and close you can
see the pixel handles that much much
better
the real only difference between the two
is the 820 processor and the 821 so
obviously the 821 is handling things a
lot better so at the end of the day if
those things matter to you then
obviously the Google pixel is the winner
but like people say out there the price
right now the Google pixel is like way
off the hook the s7 is a little bit
cheaper so that might be something to
think about
I'm Elric you've been watching tikka
tomorrow like usual more information
will be down below that like button
hopefully you go Chuck Norris see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
