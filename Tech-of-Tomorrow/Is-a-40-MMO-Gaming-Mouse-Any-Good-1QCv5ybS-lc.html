market all offering a myriad of special
features and pretty lights and to
probably end up having direct this
week's paycheck just to grab one but is
that always necessary can you spend as
little as 40 bucks to get the kind of
performance that you want we're gonna
find that out today by taking a look at
the you techsmartt Venus gaming mouse
here on tech up tomorrow now the first
thing that I think a lot of you are
going to notice about this mouse I know
it's the first thing that jumped out at
me is just the huge 12 button macro
setup on the left side of the mouse in
my opinion not the best thing you can do
for looks and it also makes just regular
restful use of the mouse kind of awkward
but of course that's not the reason for
this design it's so you have a nice
compact way to access a large number of
macros all from just your thumb which
we'll talk about a little later that
aside though the rest of the mouse is
pretty good-looking the shape all around
is really appealing to the eye
outside of that valley of buttons and
the UTech logo not only looks really
good but has a nice light-up effect
going on that's shared with the macro
buttons and the scroll wheel while those
macro buttons do feel a little weird for
your thumb to rest on the rest of the
mouse is contoured pretty nice for a
right-handed user the left and right
mouse clicks are just a little concave
for your index and ring fingers and the
right side of the mouse has a little
groove for your little fingers so the
left side of the mouse aside overall
this is actually a pretty good looking
and comfortable Mouse now as always
though aesthetics alone are not the only
thing that matters here our chief
concern of course is how this thing
performs which thankfully the Venus has
some really solid customization options
and performs really well under strenuous
activity first off the customization
which on the Venus isn't too
over-the-top with just one exception the
basic options cover all the main
standards pointer speeds scroll speed
acceleration double click and pulling
rate with light options including color
brightness and pulsing rate but the DPI
options are where this thing really
starts to get a little crazy the Venus
is capable of hitting a dpi setting as
high as sixteen thousand four hundred
which is absolutely ludicrous with your
pointer settings set to their lowest
you'll get really precise controls or
via your pointer speed high it'll
achieve absolutely ridiculous Mouse
speeds which in all honesty I'm just not
entirely sure is that necessary you're
going to still feel just enough
precision with lower mice that max out
at around
8,200 or maybe even 5,600 having the
option to go the side doesn't
necessarily ruin anything it just seems
a little bit unnecessary as for how this
can be customized the Venus offers the
ability to have five different dpi
profiles that you can quickly switch
between but what's really nice about
this too is that right on the mouse is a
little light meter displaying what level
you're currently using so that way you
have an easy method on keeping track of
what current settings using just by
glancing over now as four additional
buttons from Macker options the mouse
features on the top your traditional
right and left mouse clicks a scroll
wheel that just has one click option of
simply pressing it up and down arrows
meant for dpi adjusting and an
additional small button located just
left on the left mouse click that while
programmable is initially set for being
used as a fire button to instantly
triple click now of course the real big
time macro options on this mouse though
are located on that left side with that
valley of 12 different buttons which are
initially set to being used as a number
pad now when I first got my hands on
this mouse my biggest concern was just
how easy it is to actually press the
button you mean to because when they're
all compact together like this it seems
like it'd be really easy to accidentally
hit the wrong macro which at first is
definitely true but as you begin to
practice with it it's actually pretty
easy to find the button you intend to
use thanks to the way the buttons have
this little up-and-down rigid design
going on you develop this little touch
memory of knowing things like the five
button is located in the middle near the
front slanting inwards so provide you
take a little time to actually practice
with it it's not that hard to use but
there are still some issues with it
first off while it is pretty easy to
find a specific button quickly switching
between them can definitely have some
problems since you have to feel out each
individual button on top of that they
are really close together and not all
that large so if your hands are a little
bigger or if you have it at least just a
bigger thumb it's pretty easy to
actually accidentally hit multiple
buttons at the same time rather than
just the one you intend to so is the
Venus the best mouse out there on the
market well not exactly but for 40 bucks
it handles like a dream it's great
looking it's comfortable for the most
part during regular use it has really
crisp mouse clicks that feel good for
quick repetitive clicking and as long as
you don't have bigger hands the macro
Valley can be really useful provided to
take the time to practice with it if you
need a gaming mouse for mmo's or any
other
game genre that's going to benefit from
having a lot of macros and you don't
want to break your wallet doing that
then this is a great solution well that
was my review of the you techsmartt
