you guys know that once before we got
our hands on the bitchin try stellar
case but unfortunately when deep cool
shipped it from China it came with so
much damage we were not able to use it
and do a bill but this time around we
got one that has a window in it so you
can actually see the build and that's
much cooler anyways for those of you who
missed it the deep cool try stellar is a
pretty amazing case it features the
v-shaped frame solid steel construction
and this time around now that there's a
window we can actually see the build see
the video card and put some cool lights
in there for a more badass build
disassembling the Trice teller is really
easy to do you guys can see that all the
parts are removed very very easily you
guys will also notice that trice teller
has three separate compartments and
these are used for different things the
very top compartment is considered the
GPU compartment
you also have a motherboard compartment
at a department for your power supply
and all your wiring you'll also notice
that everything on the Tri stellar is
very easily taken apart this makes
access to the case very simple and
making your build much more simple and
ergonomic
and in the very center of the Tri
stellar you guys can see the power
button this also lights up when you
finish your build
some other features for those who missed
the last video the Tri Stiller SW
actually only takes mini ITX and other
boards but it can use full-sized video
cards even up to some of the longest
ones and if for some reason you don't
want to use the top compartment for your
video card you can actually use it to
store a liquid cooling radiator so
that's pretty much it folks we just
wanted to give you guys a quick update
let you guys take a real quick look at
the Tri stellar SW because now our build
is coming so this is Tekken tomorrow
thanks for watching we'll see you guys
back here later for more videos for more
information all its stuff that will be
down there below that like button and
look for a system real soon this is
