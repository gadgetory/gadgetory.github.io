i han't got no feet to walk around that
big-ass show i'm still bringing some
text to the table and still some pretty
cool tech now you guys all know the
gigabyte a or series is the series of
badass cards you saw the RX 580 super
nice card lots of features huge cooling
apparatus what's at the end of the video
you guys said was alright because it ran
that really cool well now we've got
a super duper fast version of ARS and
this is the 1060 GTX model this thing is
super fast super quiet lots of features
and seems like right now the mid like
market range mid level range is like
where everything's popping at seems like
right now anything under $300 between 2
and 3 hours that's the video card range
that people just want to bite and sink
their teeth right into now real quick
before we jump into the video this will
be the last video you guys see we only
have the average frames per second I
know that everybody out there said hey
guys change your stuff up so we have
stuff that's why actually a couple days
we have any videos we figured out stuff
out so we know how to give you guys all
the stuff that you guys want so we'll be
able to bring the table now the power
draw the boost clock and the low the
average frame per second and the highest
frames per second beyond that though
let's jump in let's check out the
features on this badass card and wipe
the end of the day I think you guys are
going to go damn I want that

at first glance the ARS GTX 1060 just
looks absolutely cool giant X in the
middle kind of like the x-men you also
see two hundred billionaire fans on the
top and the looks of everything on this
are just very nice and sleek they're not
minimalistic but they're not
over-the-top either they're to me just
right now if you flip the card around to
its bottom you guys can take a look at
that giant cooling apparatus that's on
the ars card you see a lot of aluminum
heat fins and inside you see the copper
heat pipes now one thing that's really
unique about this card however is that
the copper not only covers the GPU it
covers all your memory as well making
sure that everything on your card
remains cool and running quiet during
your entire operation the fans on the US
are also designed to be very efficient
they offer 23 percent more airflow at
the top of the card they feature an
angular design which actually benefits
the card and they also feature this
thing
which is a 3d active fan which means
that when the car doesn't have any heat
the fans actually shut off so if your
card all of a sudden the fans aren't
running don't think and freak out it
might be that your cards just running
very cool and gigabyte calls this
cooling solution the wind force 2x now
usually the rear end of a card is pretty
boring all you see is copper heat fans
and heat pipes but on the ars you see
the VR Lake now these are two extra HDMI
ports and you connect them to 4 monitors
and/or VR device at the same time with a
total of three display ports and three
native HDMI ports that can be used
interchangeably under VR mode for all
types of gaming configurations but the
really cool thing however is when you
restart your PC all the connections are
automatically detected so you don't have
to do anything else in your settings to
be up and gaming on the top of the card
and let's just face it this is what
you're going to be seeing inside your PC
if you have a clear window we see the
extreme gaming logo right up there and
this kart also does feature total RGB
functionality so if you love the RGB
theme it's here you also see a little
light off to the side which says fan
stop if your fans not running you're
doing that 3-d fan active mode well then
you know that when that's on the fans
not moving and up above that you guys
see the single apron power connection
and it's recommend that you have a
minimum of one watt power supply to run
this bad boy
now you guys see there's no SLI finger
and honestly I think that's kind of sad
that they don't have an SLI finger it's
the one thing about the rx 580 that I
think a lot of people are jumping on
because you can do crossfire with that
but with this card
no SLI what's up Nvidia and as far as
the inputs go there are three display
ports three HDMI ports and a single DVID
port and then last but by no means least
is the ARS back panel
I gotta admit folks I really do like
this feature I think you guys do as well
it's very elegant it's very tough it
keeps your card from having any damage
whatsoever and you don't damage your
hands if you accidentally touch it you
don't get no cuts nothing like that I
like it a lot
I know you folks do as well some of the
specs you definitely want to know about
this card are the boost and base speeds
now the boost clock on this card is 1873
megahertz with a base clock of 1645
megahertz
this is in their overclocked mode they
also have a gaming mode which features
an 1800
47 megahertz boost and a base clock of
1620 megahertz
this card is still made on the older
sixty nanometer process it features a
memory clock speed however of 9,000 26
megahertz and that's one of the biggest
things about this car is that it
features altra fast gddr5 memory the
card also has 192 bit memory bus and it
sizes it at 59 millimeters by 281
millimeters by 137 millimeters but one
thing you need to take note of like I
said before this motherfrakker is huge
and takes up almost three slots if you
don't have the space inside your PC yeah
I can't force it because if it don't fit
don't force it alright Tech fans so
there you have it the extreme edition a
or is gtx 1060 from gigabyte what it
looks like the specs and all of its cool
stuff with that said though let's jump
in real quick check out our test system
and then let's check out those
benchmarks the test system that we're
currently using is a pretty nice test
system features in x99 motherboard 59 60
X CPU 16 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance
memory features a very nice case a nice
SSD everything in this system is just
pretty much over the top but it works
great for gaming and like I said before
folks this will be the last video we
don't have the 1% point 1% lows but with
that said let's rock out to the
benchmark song and check out the scores
one thing you guys should seriously take
note of however is this car was the
absolutely coolest running card out of
all that we tested it 64 Celsius under
maximum load now I know on the box it
says that this card has a boost of 1873
megahertz but at its best we were seeing
2,000 mega it says the boost alright
everybody so there you have it now you
guys can see this card is awesome for
one thing it runs really really quiet no
coil whine nothing like that at all if
the card is actually in a really cool
room and you're just playing like
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons types of games the
fan will shut off and be completely
silent that's really cool and as far as
the 1060 s go discards like almost one
of the facets that there is and as far
as the scores go you can see it went
back and forth back and forth with the
RX 580 and we're talking about the a or
s version of that so that's a pretty
even competition right there you know a
oars versus a oars now the one thing is
this card is actually a little bit more
expensive though this card's coming to
market about $299 which is about to or
whether twenty bucks I think higher than
the rx5 a so that's a small gap but this
card like I said runs really really
quiet low power requirement like I said
four nor wise to recommend a power
supply so I mean pretty much almost any
system can handle that heck it looks
good at the end of the day I got to say
this is definitely a card that I would
give an editor's choice to it's one of
the fastest cards there is in its class
I know it's a little pricey but for all
the features and everything you get I
think it's in a day it's worth it let me
hear what you guys got to say because
right now it just seems like these two
cards just keep going back and forth
back and forth back and forth for that
mid-level gaming thing like usual
everything about this video will be down
but like button hopefully we go Chuck
Norris style on the thing I'm Network
you guys are watching Tech tomorrow
we'll have more tech obviously tomorrow
and if you like what you see hey please
