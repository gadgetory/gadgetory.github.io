good morning everybody I can see that
buddy's wide awake give me his good
morning kiss how are you folks doing I
hope you've had your coffee cuz today is
launch day for andis latest line of GPUs
that's right now today I've got right
here in front of me the msi version now
this is their gaming card of the new r9
280x so with that said let's jump in now
and let's do the unboxing and at the end
I'll point you over to the full review
let's go alright folks so here we have
it the MSI gaming G Series Twin Frozr
gaming Edition r9 280x few folks out
through don't know about it Twin Frozr
is these guys is specified cooling and
it's made for their cards and their
cards only
it's the overclocked edition coming
overclocked out of the box and from what
I have heard I do not believe there'll
be any reference model of these cards at
all every single one of them will be
specifically designed by the
manufacturer it's recommended by fnatic
we'll flip it around the side here
they're just showing you little couple
fan things what I talked about before
it also supports DirectX 11 point to
flip the card around to the back they
just have some more their information on
here their gaming applications advanced
thermal design which we'll get into
which actually show the card military
class for all that really means they use
the highest quality components we've
talked about this before last week when
we unboxed our Lightning card there are
high C CAP solid cap just all
high-quality components is what that
means and also something a little bit
interesting for those looking to capture
video I have something called the
experience predator sheriff for fun so
we'll actually get into that and with
that said let's just show one more thing
on here this is the nomenclature of the
card so if you want to look these
numbers up get more information or
anything even though we will have it
down there description you guys can
check that out
there's a little pop cap here I'm just
gonna go ahead and pop that open the old
box up like always there's a box in a
box in a box and then box in a box
watching it alone yeah but here we go
upside down box this time
so let's flip it back up on the right
side and here we have the MSI now this
thing always reminds me of a Ferrari
with a dragon inside of it was like a
Ferrari dragon or a dragon Ferrari pop
it down now you guys have made a bunch
of claims to me that you really don't
care that much about the accessories but
I have to show them to you guys
otherwise it wouldn't be complete
unboxing so let me just open this up
here you guys have also said that they
almost all have the same things in the
box you're right they mostly do but
there are some variations here we have
right here may DisplayPort standard
display port adapter 1 crossfire cable
nice and flexible there 6 pin 8 pin
power connector molex to 6-pin power
connector DVI to VGA connector the
drivers and utilities disc this will
have everything including all their
overclocking software and all that stuff
will all be on side of this disc I would
recommend though however though as soon
as the card actually gets launched that
you go to the website and make sure you
keep updated through all the Indies
software so box off to the side and then
last we have the quick user's guide
yada yada yada alright we'll get past
that I knew you guys want to see the
card without further ado card ton ton
alright so little anti-static tag in the
back here gonna pull that thing off
there pull it on out of the box you guys
can see in the top here we've got the
red and black colors again very Ferrari
ish with that little logo there again
the gaming G Series now these guys have
all their motherboard lines that
actually match these as well so if you
get their gaming G dish and motherboards
or their gaming Edition motherboard so
all have the same type of things we have
two fans here in the front underneath
that you guys can see all of the
aluminum heat fins down on the bottom
PCI insertion gonna just show you guys
aside you guys can see the heat pipes
running all along the card it's a two
slot design flip it around the back you
guys and once again see the fins here is
the fan power connector right here
keep flipping the card around actually
I'll do this first here we have the 6
pin 8 pin power connector we can clearly
see the heat pipe reading on the side
here and here are some of the end points
for that as well I'm just gonna flip the
card around real quick so you guys can
see they have their little MSI logo here
then on the side we see two of the
crossfire fingers black PCB you guys
always prefer a black PCB here's just a
little bit more information a car just
basically saying what it is flip it
around now last but not least to the
rear i/o single DVI HDMI too many
display ports now when they first
launched the 7970 series cards they all
looked identical this but as soon as
people started putting on a lot of their
aftermarket cooling stuff we saw these
go to two DVI connectors mm I wonder if
that'll be changing with this launch as
well
but for now this is it folks - ATX new
r9 series from AMD everything that comes
in the box of the new msi r9 280x Andy
fans I know you guys have been waiting
with almost holding your breath for
almost years waiting for new stuff to
come out well it's come out now these
cards gonna be priced right around the
$299 mark for all those who are
interested in purchasing this you guys
can check out all that information down
there in the description below we'll
have links to where you guys can
purchase the card more information and
