you're probably going to want to ditch
your mid-range or low range headphones
and actually get yourself a set of
headphones that really kicks butt and
sounds awesome and with that said
today's video is right along that
subject line we're gonna be taking a
look at two different sets of headphones
from the people over at Steel series now
this is their arctas Pro Wireless and
their arctas Pro with game deck now a
lot of the features on the headphones
are pretty much identical although the
one with the game DAC is really
dedicated to doing gaming comes with its
own pretty much sound card the wireless
version is like it says it's wireless
and that's really pretty much the main
difference between the two but before we
get into all the differences let's real
quick let's take a look at what comes
inside the boxes so for those people out
there who really like to get it all
let's get it on
swing the wired version you get the
arctas Pro headphones you get the game
DAC you get all the cables that you need
and all the nomenclature that you need
now in the wireless version you get the
headphones themselves the little base
station whatever cables you need and the
nomenclature and that's pretty much it
not much inside the boxes it's just
everything that you actually need now
like I said earlier both versions of
these headphones have a lot of features
that are really identical now these
particular features happen to be the air
we've ear cups now these are very very
soft and are kind of memory foam --is--
if you want to quote me on that word
they're memory foam which they don't
claim they're memory foam but they kind
of feel that way they're very
comfortable on your ears and they don't
cause fatigue the band that goes across
your head you guys can see there's a
strap inside there so when you're
putting the headphones on your head
they actually grip pretty well and they
don't grip you so hard that you feel
like someone's squeezing your head like
your heads about to pop like a giant zit
they just fit nice and comfortably on
there now inside the technology is 40
millimeter neodymium drivers and this is
in both sets of headphones both sets of
headphones also have controls in the
side and they also both have this little
microphone right here
now this is a bi-directional microphone
it's meant to keep out outside noise
it's very adjustable and flexible and if
you don't want to use it whatsoever you
can push it back inside of here now both
of these headphones also include DTS
headphones X version 2.0 which is
basically surround sound inside of your
gaming environment so with that type of
sound it's like 3d sounds of someone
sneaking up behind you or coming up and
trying to shoot you in behind you'll be
able to hear them and that's really cool
for your gaming environment both
headphones have a frequency response
from ten to forty thousand Hertz thirty
two ohm's 102 DB and the wireless
version and that the wired version also
have a couple different things about
them now the wired version comes with
this little DAC right here and this
particular little DAC is totally geared
for your gaming environment this is also
a dedicated high fidelity USB DAC which
has a legendary ESS sabri 9018 reference
stack inside it also has controls for
your volume your chat mix which is a
balance between your game and your chat
audio this way your vocals aren't louder
than actually the in-game gameplay so
your voice isn't just so loud you're
going over the game it also features an
equalizer a high res audio option and it
also has a stream mixer which means you
can mix a lot of different things
between your game chat mic and your
auxiliary audio into a single output now
the wireless version includes a
transmitter base station which you can
connect via bluetooth and lossless 2.4 G
Wireless this way you can connect your
headphones as well as another Bluetooth
device all with the range up to 40 feet
that's pretty cool right the base
station also has controls for volume
chat mix and an equalizer and you also
get a lot of other various options now
in the back of the base station
there's optical in optical out USB to
connect to your computer the DC power
connection a lineout and align in all
the controls are all done right from the
front of the device and you also get
that same equalize that I talked about
before
it has presets in there some of them you
may like if not you can program your own
but everything's all inside this box
your wireless your Bluetooth
connectivity your control ever
all inside of here and that's what your
headphones connect to as well so instead
of having a wireless little box you have
this little box the wireless version
also comes with two batteries that have
a battery life of ten hours each and you
can charge them on the side of the
wireless base taking a look at both sets
of headphones side by side it's really
hard to tell which is which but there
are a couple of differences for one
thing the wired version comes with
lights that's right so if you like
lights and all that cool stuff those are
only on the wired version but the
wireless version it actually has a
compartment for you to put the battery
and like I said battery life is ten
hours per battery so with both batteries
you get about twenty hours of gaming not
quite a full day but still that's a hell
of a lot of gaming time so just for
shits and giggles because obviously your
audio reproduction in your and it's
gonna be through whatever you're
listening to let's real quick let's take
a sound test and see if you can hear a
difference between these headphones so
let's first check out the Arctic Pro
with the game deck
now let's check out the wireless version
for some people these headphones might
seem a bit expensive but they really are
on the higher range of headphones from
all the features that these headphones
have - the way that they sound and one
thing it's really cool is that beyond
the wired and the wireless version the
sound quality is pretty much identical I
don't think that if someone put the
headphones on your head and didn't tell
you you know which was wired and which
was Wireless that you'd really be able
to tell a difference whatsoever and
that's one thing that I think is really
really cool about them like I said
before as far as the audio while you're
listening to your headphones like if
you're in your living room which is
where I think kids would absolutely be
perfect for the specially for the
wireless version if you're in your
living room and you play a lot of games
and you watch movies and all that stuff
and you haven't have a Playstation 4 as
well the wireless versions are gonna be
really awesome for you I can't wait to
try them in my living room and play
around with them as well because that's
just something where I feel that they're
gonna shine I got to test him inside the
gaming room but I really didn't get to
try them in for my big-screen TV where
all my controls are sitting on a nice
table and everything else and I think
that's gonna be a pretty cool experience
now if you're into the totally wired
thing and you like all the features and
everything that come with the gaming and
all that stuff and you also want some
additional features for streaming inside
of your Playstation 4 then the wired
version just might be your thing but
these headphones can take all the
explosions all the gunfire all the loud
booms bangs and everything else you
throw at them they sound really great
there's no vibration there's nothing
like that whatsoever and they can get
really really freaking loud on your ears
so these ones come to market they are
two hundred and forty-nine dollars these
ones come to market they are three
hundred and twenty nine dollars we'll
have links down below to both of them so
you want to check out more information
or possibly get a pair for yourselves
well then you can do that I honestly
feel that these headphones are a little
bit more on the pricey range especially
to a lot of the headphones that we see
that are in like the 99 to $159 range
but if you're looking for the absolute
best quality you want to have great
sound and you really care about you know
having something in your head that's
can they give you fatigue even at four
hours of use than hey these artists pros
just might be what the doctor ordered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
