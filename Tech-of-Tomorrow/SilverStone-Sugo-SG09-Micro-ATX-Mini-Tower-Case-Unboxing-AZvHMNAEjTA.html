channel Tuesday morning I'm Elric your
host now today we're gonna do an
unboxing first took an overview of a
brand new case and the people over at
Silverstone
this is their Sugo Series s go9
I was thinking oh it's not sg-1 now the
Stargate team not my original favorites
but hey it is an SG o 9 case now this
thing's very very small it's supposed to
have a weird front mounted power supply
you guys ever heard of that before a
power supply that mounts in the frakkin
front well this thing suppose to have it
so anyways we'll gander over here real
quick and we'll look at the Box just you
guys can see it the Silverstone
designing and spraying at the little
snowflake logo USB 3.0 ready here we see
it the Sugo series SG o 9 redefining
performance and small form-factor
computing now has a lot of things that
supports graphic cards of any length of
any link that's what it says so you
should be able to put a 690 in there
7990 anything should go in there
it supports full tower CPU coolers which
means it'll support a big old CPU cooler
even inside this little box I want to
see that support Strider + PS use up to
a thousand watts mandatory cable routing
designed ample fan slots for maximum
airflow motherboard back panel opens
behind CPU area for a quick cooling
assembly which means basically you can
access it and if you have a backplate
you can take it off here in the side of
the box real quick we're just gonna go
over to the camera come up here I won't
even talk about it cuz you guys don't
want to hear me talk about all of it but
here are all the specs I'll just let you
guys take a quick look at those but for
you guys after you guys gonna see all
the stuff all the way down the material
the model motherboards drive bays
cooling system expansion slots front i/o
port power supply expansion called
extra and then the dimensions 220
millimeters by 295 millimeters by 3 and
45 millimeters says it weighs 220 3.0
liters now these guys aren't even being
kind I don't see a trance I didn't do
any uh and just for us dang nabbit
alright have a long one on the box folks
these guys actually a lot just shows you
a lot of stuff here I'm just gonna go
quick on that
you see all that ki Jing all right let's
go inside this damn thing all right so
up here on top got a little strap it's
got a strap on wrap the bat and I hear
that's a really good strap you hear the
sound all right there we got it
take that now I know the cameraman
handed me a knife earlier back here the
old trusty knife need one of these for
an unboxing of this type now we'll jump
back over here I'm going to make an
incision right here another one here on
the top I'm gonna pull the case back out
a little bit here one more right there
and there we should have it all right so
there we go I want to try to do this
kind of funny so let's try to like make
it like a monster coming out of a box
I would eat you why not
unboxing there we go it's out of the box
take this thing slow roll it over here
get out of the way all right you know I
got assault the Cameron sometime just go
back at the same time of day if I didn't
solve camerman all right so now we're
getting down to the a degree and bam
boom we have it so let's look at the
outside first you can see up here on top
it's only gonna take one of those little
mini slotted CD players it's looking
like maybe when you get inside it takes
some over right now something like it
takes a slimline one airholes
USB 3.0 headphone speaker on button or
on button reset button see what else
goes on here so I might start
disassembling this thing here soon folks
I got figure how it goes the dobby
doesn't go that way so let's flip it
around take a look at this side also
folks do the smell test even being away
from that this thing has that new
product smell it smells pretty good all
right I want the camera to get up here
really closely because it's gonna be a
hard shot to actually get this is the
weirdest that I've seen yet now
check this out the power cable goes
right here in fact I'm just gonna pick
this up and bring it over you folks look
at where the power cable goes that is a
very very interesting design like I said
the power supply is supposed to mount in
the front so look check out that out
when my looks I got it up here let's
look at the back you guys can see
there's a fan got four Bay's down here
so it looks like you can probably have
two video cards or a video card and one
sound card your i/o is gonna sit right
here
your Rio if your motherboard which is
gonna be weird because there's a power
cord sitting over here to the right all
right so let's sit this thing down
there's no window there's just some
other Bay's here so I'm gonna go ahead
and start figuring out how to
disassemble this system so let's start
at the back I will start taking off all
these screws which by the way I am never
doing any weird things with didn't have
to use my knife and have to do anything
else these are coming out very very
easily I'm glad
some people say what the factory they
tighten SuperDuper tight you know for
shipping reasons but I mean you should
still be able to get them off with your
fingers you don't have to actually run
out and grab a tool just to remove a
dang screw but another factors if you're
actually working with the case you
probably do have a screwdriver on you
anyways so you're building a system
right okay so moot point either way all
right folks now there was a screw that
was right here on the side which I had
to remove someone waste your time doing
that so we could pull the entire unit
pocket so now the entire unit comes off
you can see it's one solid shell all the
way around nice easy a solid shell go
ahead and set that down let's go ahead
and take this thing and let's look at
the top giant fan here on top hopefully
to be nice and silent flip it around
here's why your cable man what's going
to be here's where the power supply goes
now this is really weird
the power supply goes in the front of
the case now I actually feel kind of
like a slight retard I probably should
have went out and got a power supply
since to the sole original do this but
will actually do a building it and we'll
show you the full bill power supply
mounts in here though to the side very
very weird having a power supply and not
from the front
now the motherboard is going to be
mounted it's going to go back there
against the back wall like I said before
you are iowa's here the power cable for
the power supply is inside of here so
when the power supply mounts in here
you'll have the cable right there to go
to it
all of your accessories and everything
are all inside this bag
you've got rubber feet rubber grommets
and looking at the design you would only
able to use like I said a laptop type CD
meaning the slimline CD or dvd is all
you're gonna be able to use here on the
top because of the slot right here so
I've went ahead and I removed the screw
down here in the bottom which allows
this to be completely pulled off we can
see there's a single fan inside of here
along with a cable go ahead and bring
this up down so you guys can see the
internals of the system like I said
before the motherboard will be mounting
inside of there across the back and this
back panel back here you spin around
view folks as well this panel is also
removable which means that if you do
remove this panel this area right here
is absolutely big enough to get to your
CPU and move the backplate for using
bigger type coolers so all in all it is
a very very unique design it's totally
different anything else I've seen and
that's about it we're gonna probably
build a system in this folks and then
we'll bring that to you so alright folks
I hate users face but honestly this is
like brand-new to me I'm kind of
tripping out in design it is a very
unique design that you gotta admit it
the SG own eye is very trippy have you
ever seen any other case that has the
power supply mounted in the front with
its own power supply connection in the
back of the case I have yet to see that
so I give them definitely a thumbs up on
originality for that I hope you guys
liked the video like it if you did also
make sure you subscribe because I got
lots of stuff going on and we'll see you
back here on the channel
tomorrow peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
