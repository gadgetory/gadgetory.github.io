you don't have a lot of money well if
you've got 50 bucks
then Kula masters Elite 110 is the
solution it you're probably going to be
looking at this thing is awesome it's
only 50 bucks and with that said let's
just shut the frak up and jump in and
check this shiz neck out alright folks
so here we have it the cooler master
Elite 110 mini cube liquid cooling
support can have 120 millimeter radiator
inside this little tiny cube supports
full-sized PSUs vga cards with 210
millimeters
it says ample storage for three hard
drives or four SSD dual super speed USB
3.0 support all in the box says PSU
model so I'm imagining that some models
out there are going to come with a PSU
this particular model did not pinch is
why we said it was the 50 bucks model
nothing much on the side except for some
more than nomenclature the UPC code in
case some folks want to look this up in
their country for buying it you guys can
check that up as well as the model
number right there then just on one last
side we have the specifications not that
many of them not going to read the box
I'm just going to show you guys a screen
so you guys can check it out for
yourself you prefer it that way
but basically folks I mean check it out
man 50 bucks is a really low price and
everything's getting smaller these days
so that's what's going to make this
thing interesting so we flip the old
knife out there take a little cut there
a little cut here this thing should be
really really nice and easy to get out
of the box it's not real heavy or
anything so I simply go slapping
anything around so into the top comes up
you guys can see inside how its fact so
I'm just going to go ahead and grab the
old plastic right here on this one it's
going to be nice and lightweight out it
comes one box away there's an
instruction manual inside of there
before I smack the cameraman again I'm
smack in with the system in one hand
here's the manual and then we throw box
at Karimun over the head and over the
way she goes out into the blue two
little side panels right here you can
hear it banging around on the table as I
do it two more screws Oh got him once oh
we got him twice alright you guys love
it and I know you guys always ask me why
am i throwing stuff at Jesus he's such a
nice guy I don't know it's just part of
the day
deduct most the time trust me he's
gotten pretty agile in the last two
years so here we have it check it out
folks out of the box
totally flat black all the way around
the side now we'll start disassembling
this thing but first let's go to the
side right here on top it's like we have
power button 2 USB 3.0 mic headphone
looks like your hard drive button and
this may be the reset button so when I
get to the manual and take all that
we'll see let's see if the front panel
is removable yes it is so you see I took
one little pull right there the front
panel did come off so now spin it around
so you guys can see the fan that's in
the front try to get my hand on the way
there so you guys can see that better
and then all the cabling also as well so
try to get an angle with that so you
guys can see all the cabling in there go
take it off to the side here there's two
pop screws on the top here I will try to
remove them by hand at first both these
are way too tight so alright folks so I
try to take these off with my thumb I
couldn't do it so I had to get a little
tool to help me break the initial
connection there this is a little tiny
screwdriver still there in there very
tight they probably use some kind of
machine to stick these things in there
in the factory because yeah they are
pretty tight so if you're getting this
case I would suggest that you break
yourself out a screwdriver and prepare
yourself taking screws out because I
wasn't able to do it by hand now I've
used the tool obviously Ivan around I
begun them also and I'll just take them
all off and this is kind of boring folks
to see this but we can probably in a
speed of your life but you guys like to
see it also this one's coming off a lot
simpler dissemble the entire thing for
you folks because we know you guys like
it to be brought all the way down to his
bare as it can be and we're with you
there so take some second more but you
get more right ok so this whole piece
now slides off one completely piece air
oh alright maybe not but hey you know
good mod it right yeah okay all right
then and by the way there is a manual
here so for looking up everything it
does it has the installation guide which
will tell you all that stuff I'm kind of
a guy I like to just take my stuff apart
and go for it a lot of you guys are the
same type of way we're going to the side
we've got some kind of metal cabling
here go ahead and just remove this
little zip tie thingy although it's not
a zip tie it's a little twisty thingy
get that out and Kabam alright then
these are all your parts for your
installation interesting interesting
interesting including a little tiny
little tool all your offsets everything
for your motherboard so let's look
inside let the room so I mean I don't
think it's going to fit some of the
huger like super EXTREME video cards but
most video cards will probably fit in
this pretty easily the front panel you
guys all saw has additional things to
hook on to the headers of your
motherboard and everything for obviously
the controls in the USB and all that
good stuff you get a single hundred
twenty millimeter fan and I mean that is
pretty much everything in the elite 110
for 50 bucks alright folks so there you
guys have it mini ITX style good options
for something so small 50 bucks coming
into the market now a lot of people out
there I think you guys are going to be
interested in this you've always said
