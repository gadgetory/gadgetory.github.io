tomorrow and today we feature the ipod
touch 4th generation not much of a
different design from the previous but
it is a lot thinner so without further
ado let's go ahead and just take a
general look around the device and i'll
be back with some more information ok
guys so here we have the fourth
generation ipod touch and you can see
that it is a slightly thinner than the
previous version and everything else is
generally the same the look of it the
capacities come in 8 32 and 64 much like
the previous generation before it we
have the standard 30-pin dock connector
cord to the usb of course your regular
headphones and of course the device
itself on the bottom we do have the 30
pin connector for your plug the
headphones and of course the microphone
at the bottom there and pretty much the
same goes for the top one big adjustment
is they did switch the on/off switch to
the other side as we take a look at the
front of the device here we do have the
beautiful 3.5 inch widescreen
multi-touch display 960 x 640 pixel
resolution at 326 pixels per square inch
the big discussion these days is exactly
the little nuances between the iphone 4
screen in the ipod touch but as you can
see here it looks good on this side as
we're looking at it you do have your two
volume rockers one being blocked by my
cohort here but that's okay same shiny
back that we have come to know with the
ipod on the front you do have again the
front facing camera and facetime is
available via Wi-Fi as we turn back over
to the rear of the device you do have
the rear facing camera with microphone
disappointingly it is less than a
megapixel for photos but the recording
is 720p up to 30 frames per second let's
go ahead and just give you guys a simple
idea of what that looks like personally
i think they look good we've got some
cherry tomatoes to the left and i think
some tomatoes on the right but the image
quality does pretty good i would like to
compare it to the iphone 4 so
video here is a beautiful looking cat I
think it looks pretty darn good the
lighting is good in this picture and
again back to the tomatoes laying is
good in that so in proper light you
can't go wrong good macro on this device
as well for the lack of megapixel I
personally think again it does look good
so as we wrap this up they do come again
like I said earlier in 8 32 and 64 gig
the wireless Wi-Fi Bluetooth enabled 2.1
the battery power on this device will
run for 40 hours on your audio and seven
hours of video so you definitely can't
go wrong there charging times according
to Apple fast charge in about two hours
would be eighty percent full charge in
about four hours so that is our first
look at the ipod touch 4th generation i
hope you guys enjoyed this and we'll be
back with some more things and battling
out with the iphone 4 alright guys so
there you go first look at the 4th gen
ipod touch but now it's your turn we
want to hear in the comment section
below some of the things that you want
to see compared between the ipod touch
4th gen and the iphone 4 so again let us
know in the comments section below we'll
go ahead and test it out for us and even
if you found something that you think
nobody else has or nobody else found let
us know we'll go ahead and take a look
at it and we'll try it out ourselves so
guys that's coming up next I'm going to
show you guys a little bit my gaming
skills or lack thereof so with the dog
barking I think that's going to call it
quits because I got to go let her in so
you guys take it easy and stick around
for more videos from tech of tomorrow
and I'll talk to you later sooo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
