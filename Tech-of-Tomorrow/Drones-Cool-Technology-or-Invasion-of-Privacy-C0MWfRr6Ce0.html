once again detective tomorrow where I'm
going to talk to you guys about
something that I think is very very
interesting now I must say right off the
bat that this store I'll be telling was
inspired for something that I saw on the
verge want to give them props for this
because that's where I saw it first
don't want to cheat them out of the
story that they gave but I have some
other things to talk about as well
beyond that so you guys all know about
cellphones everybody's got them and the
technology goes into them is pretty
incredible nowadays most cellphones will
out proceed any of the computers that
ever came out a long time ago and you
can do a lot of things with these phones
one of the things is controlling drones
now there's a lot of different
applications that drones can be used for
in the past they've used them for you
know helicopters that have no people in
them filming movies you know some things
good some things you might think are
kind of you know star trekking creepy
but you know some are really cool so
obviously there is the spy side of
things you know you can have a drone
flying through the sky going out
searching doing its job as a war machine
those applications Exorcist they could
also use them further things though
picture drones like this you get
monitored all the time they show this
program where basically it monitors
everywhere you go everything that you do
now I know that some people gonna say
it's an invasion of your privacy and
maybe in some ways that may be true but
there could be some positive things
about it say you were a person who had
medical problems and you want to
voluntarily opt in to something like
this so you know I'm saying so like your
person your older person or whatever you
have a medical problem you could opt
into a program where they monitor you
all the time because of your health so
if you're walking down the street and
all of something something happened
automatically would go up you know what
I mean - like their drone technology
alert something close to you send the
medical and possibly save your life now
that's something that I didn't see the
verge talk about whatsoever they didn't
actually touch upon that they touch
about a lot of other stuff just not that
particular one now they have lots of
drones for home use people have these
things you guys have seen them they
showed them up at CES before thing
flying around
remote-controlled now they're gonna have
these although for your phone as well
there's a couple them that are out and
they showed these as well which is
pretty cool you know you've got a little
thing flying around you could actually
connect cameras to it or I think device
are coming out where you can use these
to take it around fly it up and film now
invasion of your privacy big stickler
here now currently there are no real
laws regarding this type of stuff so if
you have a drone you're out wandering
around you know what I mean
wandering around the neighborhood or
something like hopefully no criminals
are out there trying to think their
master plan up you know and trying to
use it for any devious stuff but I mean
literally you could monitor a whole
neighborhood and everything else you
know with a little drone up in the sky
in my neighborhood we'd probably just
find a way to shoot it out of the sky Oh
found it codes you know but that's my
neighborhood yours might be the same you
know you know consistency varies but
drone technology is coming and it could
be cool it could be bad it's all
depending on your outlook think about
farming okay farming is one application
where drones can be really cool so going
up and down checking all the plants
making sure the plants are watered
making sure that the soil and everything
is all doing good by things that are the
soil monitoring and it could basically
take care of a crop much better than you
or me ever could because you know we're
human we have to think of other things
we might forget something hey Bob did
you remember to water the plants today
oh crap you know what I mean but if you
had a drone doing it you can get really
really good results also check this out
freeways traffic accidents things like
that if you had drones going up and down
the freeways and there was an accident
automatically you could have medical
stuff once again on the scene to take
care of things just by that technology
now I don't really feel that that at all
is an invasion of privacy anything that
I think can help save a human life I
think I'm down with I want to know what
you guys have to think as well in the
comments below let me know also I'm
gonna go over and write an article and
I'm gonna go ahead and pop a poll on
there as well that your vote will count
so you guys will say hey you know hey
you know these drones are cool I'm down
with it you know what I'll say oh no you
know screw drones you know I want them
to be shot from the sky like the evil
bastards they are you know I'm saying I
want to hear what you guys have to say I
think it's gonna be a very very
controversial issue in the future I mean
I gotta be honest with you you probably
feel the same if you walked out your
front door and those are drone things
flying around filming you I think you'd
be rather pissed off I know I wouldn't
be I try to get my baseball bat and
smack it right off the bat I really
don't think anybody didn't do anything
too creepy but check this out guys like
me and you and some other guys out there
who review stuff for a living we're off
we're going to a rock concert like the
crowd is let's just say horrible you
know what I mean and I have my little
thing and it flies on down there and I'm
getting front-row access to the concert
filming the band and getting all my
sound feed from somewhere else so I've
got this totally awesome bitching video
that I can get the most incredible
angles that I've never gotten before
because think about it now man if I can
control it then cooling up off my phone
you could almost fly almost on the stage
level and film the whole damn thing
front backwards sideways all off a drone
so I think there are a lot of really
cool applications I'm looking forward to
seeing what's coming out obviously in
the future I think that there will be
new laws that are passed cause people
gonna say no no okay I don't want to
drone on my front yard so if you're
putting a drone on my front yard you've
crossed my privacy line and you know
well we've already talked about what's
gonna happen in most neighborhoods so
you guys know that like usual man I
always love to hear what you guys have
to say interaction with you folks what's
most important to me once again I want
to thank the verge for give me the
inspiration for this story but I think
drones have a really cool future going
on for lots of different purposes I know
the military obviously they're gonna use
them hopefully we don't just create you
know some kind of completely drone army
to attack some innocent country you know
for they're like you know let's say oil
rights or you know mineral rights or
whatever rights and you guys know what
I'm saying
we're known to sometimes to go out and
do some crazy stuff so hopefully that
doesn't happen so anyways you guys I
love you I hope you guys like this video
I'm really totally like actually does
this drone technology pretty much like
in the next week I plan on going out and
buying me some type of thing and
starting to screw with it and make
videos with it because I just think it's
cool anyways like I said hope
you guys like this video hit that like
button if soldier not subscribed to tech
her tomorrow hey I don't really
appreciate it and so with the gang here
at Tech of tomorrow like usual all the
information will be in the link in the
description below and I'll have a
full-blown article over on this and a
poll over on WWE Tech of tomorrow see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
