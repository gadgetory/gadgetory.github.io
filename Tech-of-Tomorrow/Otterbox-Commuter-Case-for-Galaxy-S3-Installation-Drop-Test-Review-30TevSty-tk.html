Tekken tomorrow Elric Faris your host
once again and today you guys know that
last week I have graded my service I
switched over to Verizon I got myself
the new Galaxy s3 from Samsung and I
originally gotten one phone cover from
my friend Jonathan and you guys seem to
like the videos so much so I thought hey
what the hell I'll get some other ones
and let you guys see those as well now
otterbox is one of the top companies out
there for making phone covers people out
there have made videos of throwing
phones off roofs and all kinds of crazy
 using this now this is their
Commuter Series it's made for people on
the go it even comes with a very nice
screen protector inside the box even the
box itself believe it or not is stuff
you can hear this it's got a metal even
clip on the top so this thing's just
tough all the way around so let's move
over to my desk right now and let's go
ahead and let's install this new phone
cover on my galaxy s3 so let's go park
folks so here we have it obviously it's
the OtterBox
it's the Commuter Series Stiles
protection for the samsung galaxy s3
it's got its little code right there for
scan stuff in here's the back of the box
it says it protects you from bumps
shocks dust debris x' scratches all
kinds of stuff it's also comes the
screen protector and there's two layer
protection so that said let's go ahead
and take out of the box
nothing else in there so sit down pull
it out here's the OtterBox for Planet
OtterBox gonna show you basically
probably all their cases you bought more
than a great case show you a bunch of
different people once again little logo
fit around gives you instructions on how
to do it so let me go ahead and take it
out of here on the inside I'm trying to
get out here is a screen protector pull
all this stuff out of here get that out
now I'm not gonna go ahead and use the
screen protector because you guys know
that last week when I got mine out he
put a screen protector on so I'm not
gonna need to use this but here's the
case cover itself very very tough unlike
the little cheeser when we had earlier
you know this one's very very solid very
rugged you have things that cover and
you just pop them off so I get on the
phone so now we'll go ahead and begin
the installation process there's
actually two pieces to this there's the
rubber insert and then the hard outer
case so wrap the bat I'm going to go
ahead and slide the rubber case over on
the phone
now I haven't done too many of these
only a couple of them but because this
case is such a much tougher case the
installation process is a little bit
more difficult then after you get that
in you just slide the case finally into
the external case making sure you pop
the buttons and everything in there and
then there you have it now this is a
very tough case
as you see I'm dropping my phone my
phone's not getting damaged so it's a
very very very tough thing which is what
it's supposed to be it's a Commuter
Series you guys didn't see my phone
still working no problems at all so hey
guys thanks very much for watching if
you're interested in picking up this
OtterBox product for your Galaxy s3 make
sure you check out the link in the
description below but as you guys can
see it's very straightforward it's
two-piece even comes a screen protector
and as you guys can see from me dropping
it it actually does protect the phone
pretty well we'll see you guys back here
on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
