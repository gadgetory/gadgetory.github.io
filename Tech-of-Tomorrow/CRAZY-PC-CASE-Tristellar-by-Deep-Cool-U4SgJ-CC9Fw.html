out of your favorite sci-fi magazine the
gamer storm try stellar power buy deep
cool is one original looking case
featuring a compartmentalize design that
features three different sections to
hold your components this is something
that people are really going to want to
check out and hey space it's the final
frontier baby in today's market we're
almost everything you see is completely
free hash the Tri stellar does offer a
truly unique design it looks totally
like something that you're going to see
in like Star Wars or some space program
kind of like a fighting ship or just
something from outer space you're not
going to see that very often I kind of
wish these folks would have sent me one
with a window on it cuz I could have
showed off my build more but I know a
lot of people just want to use a simple
build inside just have a cool case if
you're welcome go hey that looks awesome
now if you want to take this thing
that's made out of complete aircraft
aluminum repaint it make it something
even more awesome you have the ability
to do that and since this thing's made
out of aircraft aluminum it's going to
be made very very well and very very
sturdy now like I said previously this
thing has three separate sections in it
to hold your components it has a
graphics card cabin and the cabin
supports full length of the 320
millimeter graphic cards to connect
these videos to the motherboard there's
a short PCI extension cable also
included is a 90 millimeter case band
which provides sufficient air flow to
the cabin as we start to disassemble the
case you can see right next to the
graphics card slots there are also three
2.5 SSD bays these also have a hot
plugin capabilities this is a really
cool thing as well because it keeps the
video cards away from the heat of the
motherboard align the motherboard to be
cooled separately and the video cards
themselves I like this idea next up is
the motherboard cabin now the
motherboard cabinet supports mini-itx
motherboards with a low profile base up
to 80 millimeters from either Intel or
AMD and inside of here you can also fit
120 millimeter radiator this is cool
flows people wanting to use an
one one liquor cooling system and if you
don't want to use a liquid cooling
system you can also install 120
millimeter case pan instead as long as
the radiators not installed now next up
is the power supply cabin the PSU cabin
is capable of accommodating 160
millimeter length PSUs it includes 23.5
HDD bays with hot plugging SATA ports as
well and this cabin also supports a
single five and a quarter slot loaded
optical drive on the very front of the
case run up the bat you can see the
gamers storm logo and that's actually
how you turn the case on as well now to
connect the components together the
cables pass through the hollow aluminum
spine of the system now this has a
v-shaped
frame which comes with an LED power
button at the front this is also how you
turn the system on and off the i/o ports
on the Tri stellar are great for
accessibility and include two USB 3.0
ports and an audio and mic port overall
you guys can just see that this thing
just spews originality I mean literally
have you ever seen a case like this at
all now I know there have been some
people out there Coolermaster came out
with the CM storm stacker and it offered
some component type things but it was
not like this at all the way the Tri
stellar is designed looking really like
I said off the pages of something from a
sci-fi magazine is just incredible now I
got to give a shout out right off the
bat to mr. Bill Owens because Bill Owens
is this crazy modern guy and he's using
this total custom build that'll just be
insane you guys know who Bill Owen is
he's a total custom builder I want to
give a shout out right now to Bill Owens
we'll have a link down below to him as
well you guys want to check him out
because he's doing this total radical
custom build using the Tri stellar case
and I think it's going to be incredible
we'll also be doing our own build over
here at Tech Audemar we've chosen a lot
of those parts so stick around and see
what we've got coming because folks I
think you're going to
like it thanks again for the people over
at deep cool for providing us with this
awesome case like usual all the
information will be down there below
that like button hope you guys will like
that button and go some Chuck Norris
crazy on it and just hit that show more
button and you can see all the
information head over to their website
I'm Eric thanks for watching techno
tomorrow if you like what you see hey
sub I'll see you in your REM box
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
