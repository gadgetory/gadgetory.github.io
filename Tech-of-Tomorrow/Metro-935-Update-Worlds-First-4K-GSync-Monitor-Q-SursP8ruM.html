of news in a while but now we've got
some pretty interesting stuff to tell
you folks so you guys all like 4k you
all want 4k some of you guys out there
bitch you can't afford 4k but everybody
likes 4k and everybody likes g-sync now
some of us like the g-spot better you
know cuz it's an orgasmic place to be
but if you mix for K&amp;amp;G sync together you
get something really cool from the
people over at acer this is their new xB
280 HK now the xB to ath k-pax an LED
lit LCD panel with a resolution of 3840
x 2160 it's got a 170 degree viewing
angle displayport 1.2 input as well as
for USB 3.0 ports it also comes with a
sers low dimming technology which
actually adjust things up to fifteen
percent now there are a few things that
are going to make me go hmm now acer I
don't know they're not my favorite brand
kind reminder that car called pacer and
they weren't one of my favorites either
but we'll have to actually see how that
pans out now also this thing is not an
IPS monitor you'd think you know at 4k
the damn thing would be IPS but hey
that's my opinion what do you folks out
there thing down the comments below let
me hear what you guys have to say about
this is this a win or is this up lose
let us know next up with a heavy you
guys have been asking for it every
comment every videos where's Metro

this close to being done but we have an
update also some of you folks may not
know it but we've been actually
developing a whole different type of
website for you guys this time we're
going to have one that's based on a
format a very community type of place
and we've been building that we're
actually hope you folks or join that and
with this video will introduce it to you

captain Kevin here here's part of the
news the three victims were part of a
cxs girl lighten up now that was very
very awkward that was not Kevin hold on
what you guys have found Kevin okay they
found Kevin thanks I'll right now in
terms of PC gaming one of the biggest
pieces of news to come out this past
week was valves official launch of its
in-home streaming now what this means is
if you're running two pcs on the same
network and both are logged into the
same steam profile you can have your
more high power pc handle the heavy
lifting and processing and stream
gameplay over your more lower end pc or
even better a laptop because he wants to
let something as silly as a bathroom
break stop you from playing your
favorite games at the highest settings
possible now not only can you stream
gameplay using this feature but you can
even remotely install set up and launch
games so you can keep walking trips over
to the hosting PC down to a minimum now
the one bad side of this is the fact
that it is currently limited to certain
os's those of you that are running on
windows XP Mac os10 Linux or even
steamos can't use this function just yet
but that will of course change
with time let sit for my little side
part on today's news I'm gonna give you
