edition of tech of tomorrow now today
we're gonna be taking a look at a
product from the company H I s this
product is their new ice qx2 HD 7970
now this card features 2048 stream
processors it has a core clock of a
thousand megahertz and a boost clock of
1050 megahertz
it has three gigabytes of gddr5 memory
and the memory speed is 6,000 megahertz
or 6 gigabits per second also has a 384
bit memory interface now some of the
features on this card are going to be
it's cooling they say it's going to run
17 C cooler than your standard card and
also 15 DB quieter so it's supposed to
run quieter and cooler go ahead and move
it to the side right here there's some
more features flip it around the back
real quick so now you see the back of
the box we can see once again we see
they have their cooler quieter there's
also five heat pipes it's looking a lot
like the toxic cooling we've seen on the
vapor x series of cards we have the ice
q cooling technology which is part of
their name the ice q x2 or x squared as
we move down the box we see high quality
components and says six dynamic phase
controlled pwm I see H is cards are
something more the five dynamic
controlled pwm IC phases provide extra
power stability and overclocking
capability to the card hmm interesting
full solid state capacitors solid state
choke here's some of their standard
features right here obviously does I
affinity let's move on now and start
taking a look at the card go ahead pop
the cap here just see the box inside the
box so we have the box outside the box
I'll go ahead and pop the cap good
remove the cover where right off the bat
we'll just pull the card on out of the
box so we'll do things differently here
let's take a look at the back of the
card first
you guys can see on the side of the card
here are the heat pipes I'll actually
flip it around so you guys can actually
see it a little bit better that way and
see the H is logo right there - 8 pin
power connections so up here in the back
of the card we see the two crossfire
connections that we can do quad
crossfire down here is the pci 3.0
interface the cards obviously a 2 slot
configuration you guys can see the heat
fins all right here sure you guys the
bottom of the card again where you guys
can see the cooling once again like I
said it does resemble quite a bit the
toxic cooling that we've seen before in
other cards I'm sure these guys have all
their own stuff but it's pretty similar
and then check out the front of the car
we see two twin turbo fans put the H is
logo the nice big X so the card actually
does have some really good looks to it
now we see the rear i/o we can see the
rear i/o is based off the original ASIC
this is based off the original one you
can see it has a single dual link DVI
HDMI and two main display ports now
there is some other stuff though in the
box and those would be the accessories
let's begin to pull those out of here so
we see the H is faster cooler quieter
can be the driver seat and everything
would be inside of here and open that up
kaboom
there you go there's CD and everything
including the case badge is all inside
of here next up we have another CD this
is some turbo your graphics card
assistant so this is probably going to
be something to do with their software
for boosting the card DVI to VGA adapter
crossfire connection
and then finally precaution taken during
transportation they're basically making
sure to tell you that you lock your car
table so it doesn't snap off and break
your system most people know that so
that's it folks that's everything that
comes in the box of the new H is HD
Radeon 7970 Ice q x2 or x squared hope
you guys like this video if so hit that
like button and show me you guys
appreciate it I can't wait to get this
card in a system and see how it runs see
you guys back here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
