there in YouTube land and the world it's
me LR care once again on tech of
tomorrow in full 4k bringing you another
unboxing and first look this time it's
something really nice this time it's the
matrix platinum gtx 780 I know you guys
kind of mocked the 760 card we showed
you but there ain't no way that you are
mocking this badass card right here
because this is a sis's top-of-the-line
really super duper bad boy and me and my
trusty cane here are going to show you
this product so let me slip it out of
the way let's first take a look at the
Box ba-boom you guys can see this notice
things the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 i3
gigabyte GD r5 Ava GPU boost clock of a
thousand seventy two megahertz CPU base
clock of a thousand six megahertz memory
clock set at 7000 megahertz DVR v
they're gonna a four bit memory
interface so the maximum digital
resolution of 4096 by 2160 okay Coolio
blah blah blah will flip the top right
here let you guys see this nifty stuff
here a box Hey yada-yada box with a nice
window here for you guys to check out
where is there and right now alright
we'll get a close-up of this right here
this right here is the nomenclature of
the card so anybody people look out
there to buy this to babble you can
check that out there here's the back of
the box yummy yummy but now let's
actually check out the car let's get
this thing out of here and let's see
what it's all about so where does this
thing open up at all right up here at
the top got a nice little flap pup pup
cap KABOOOM Kabam and away she blows the
box there is one big box there baby
alright kaboom box out of the way in
fact box and cameraman oh I like this
outdoor stuff a lot of room to throw
stuff
it's pretty awesome stuff I came this
close maybe even that close alright so
check it out folks let's first talk
about all the accessories let me pull
all those out of here set the car off to
the side so we've got their little back
book which has inside of it the speed
set-up guide and then we have two 6-pin
two eight pen power connections in case
your power supply doesn't come with what
you need then we get a case badge with
the Aizu Republic of gamers ROG that's
right this is one of the rog series of
cards which is unfortunately i found out
to price me enough is not the republic
of gummy bears i'm sad i thought was a
real book of gummi bears and i was
hoping to have some but nope it's
republic of gamers so let's move on
let's start taking out the card we'll
have to bat we can see right here in the
front we have two different types of
fans now these are used for different
things one is used to actually get air
into the car via there's users circulate
there around the car to keep the card
cool a lot of people ask why they're two
different fans on there well that's the
reason why you guys can see it matches
the rog theme it's red and black looks
really cool very nice down here you guys
see the PCI now one thing really badass
and bitch and I have to say though is
check this out the heat pipe is totally
badass and black it's really
cool-looking a black heat pipe all the
way around the side of the card looks
really really nice you guys can see in a
close-up right here this is where the
fans are being plugged in additionally
here flip it around let you guys see the
top of the card where you can see right
here Republic of gamers which is also
really cool this lights up when it's
plugged in pretty awesome stuff still
once again matching the color theme as
far as power requirements go this card's
kind of nifty on the end here you have a
single molex connector and then as we
spin around the card to the side you can
see there are two eight pin connectors
up here we have two of the SLI fingers
then we have the backplate which
everybody loves and some guy the other
day so he was tripping out when I was
smacking the backplate well hey man what
do they get back plates for it's Menten
so that protects the card and that's one
thing it's just totally really bitching
about this now
Zeus has a lot of patents the winds
picking up out here and one of the
patents they have for like their tough
series is their armor and stuff so they
probably the serious patent on this as
well because why the hell not it's
really really cool well flip it around
show you guys who are I oh we're ioin
almost every nvidia base card that we've
seen from these guys has been the same
DVI DVID single DisplayPort single HDMI
so pretty simple stuff all the way
across the board the card is just
totally awesome looking you know being
that it's a 780ti adds being a matrices
everything it's gonna be one of those
more expensive cards now I don't even
think this thing is currently for sale
anywhere in the world I think we're
actually one of the first people you can
get this up when JJ was at our house you
know I smacked him with that crowbar we
just decided that we just keep whatever
we get our hands on that day and so we
were able to get our hands on this as
well so you know I mean if you're gonna
steal stuff why not just go the whole
gambit no you guys know I'm just jiving
with you but that's pretty much it folks
man matrix platinum gtx 780 Ti for the
people over at a Zeus rog series you
know this thing's gonna be bitchin down
below the description we'll have all the
information that we've got currently on
this card when the card does become
available for sale we will jump back and
we will link that down below like usual
like buttons down there I hope you guys
like this sort of video if so you guys
