gtx 980ti amp extreme edition was like
the fastest booking curves that we
tested in that series now will the GTX
1080 from zou tech follow in those same
footsteps mm-hmm will it I think you're
gonna be pretty surprised this is one
awesome and freakin bad ass card it's
big it's bad it's pulled and it's faster
than freakin greased lightning you're
gonna faster than the flash but who
knows let's check this card out so few
fans out there who want the full monty
we're gonna go ahead and do the unboxing
and few fools out there thinking about
letting some funky comment well we've
got a something for you as well so
anyways here's the front of the box you
guys can see how they're good stuff
eight gigabyte ice storm echo armor
freeze tick heckle fan freeze tick
rather echo fan and spectra yadda yadda
it's a box some people like to see the
box so I'll spinner on the side you guys
can see that why I'm there I will take
the knife and make myself a slight
little cut trying to make this nice and
gently here in fact we don't even use
the knife there's a piece of tape here
and I think this time it might be
actually easier just to pull the tape
instead of cutting the box so here we go
I will just pull some tape there and I
actually messed up and cut the box oh I
messed up but that's that so anyways
here's the back now they have a lot of
stuff on the back of the card as you
guys can see I storm efficient cooling
for max performance spectra stylize your
cards light up your game which means
basically there's gonna be a bunch of
lights on the car like everything else
that's out these days where you can
change all the lighting all the RGB
stuff you know that all 16.8 million
colors you have to gather all that stuff
HECO fan increases air flow for superior
cooling and then firestorm which is a
fine tune for enhanced intelligence
which is you know basically using their
software and stuff and precision X if
you guys haven't used it and with that
said then is there anything else in the
box and that's pretty much it and
nothing on the bottom yep I guess there
is some stuff on the bottom but it's
nothing to really be talked about just
serial number so let's begin the
unboxing so and see what comes inside
the box so like usual it's going to be a
box sets in we have a box inside the box
yada yada like usual that's the same
thing all right then here we go so tech
black box
well Louie all right pop around the side
pop the cap we have a nice phone thing
I'll throw a cameraman Oh almost cut his
neck off with it I was that close all
right then so here we go we have this
little ZOTAC little thing here inside we
have the driver CD case badge quick
installation guide good stuff there yeah
all right all right two 6-pin to eight
and then again another two 6-pin to
eight connections right there and that's
pretty much everything that comes in the
box
obviously the card comes in at any
static bag but now let's just move on
and actually talk about the card the
specs of speeds and feeds and all that
other good crap you guys can see right
off the bat that the amp extreme card is
freaking Jai normos and it's three fans
in the front and the card size and an
amazing 12 inches a real lady pleaser by
five inches high and it's almost a two
and a half card slot design this bad boy
is big and also you guys can see this
little thing on top says push the limit
this will all light up so you guys can
have all those awesome colors inside
your card now if we flip the card up to
the top side you guys can see there are
two eight pin power connectors and you
guys can see there's cooling fins going
all the way from the front of the card
all the way to the back of the card this
thing is totally geared to be cooled on
the killer level and we flip the card
around onto its side you guys can see
the heat fins that are running all the
way through and you can also see the
copper heat pipes that permeate
throughout the entire card itself now we
flip this bad boy around to the back
plate you guys can see once again it
says push it to the limit and I got to
tell you guys that this is amazing this
is pretty much the most massive badass
back plate that you're going to frickin
get it is just amazing you guys can all
see there's a chip right here this is
for your power boost which makes your
car go SuperDuper fast
and you guys can see up here on top
there are two SLI fingers for doing SLI
configurations I believe with these
cards you can do up to quad although
only using two it's what's suggested by
the people of remedy at this moment at
the very bottom you guys can see the PCI
insertion slot as well and lastly the
card outputs feature the following a
single DVI three display ports and an
HDMI connection now let's talk about the
feeds and speeds now the cuda cores on
this card are twenty five sixty eight
gigabytes of gddr5 X memory 256-bit
memory bus the engine clock on this
thing however is overclock base clock of
seventeen hundred and seventy one
megahertz and a boost clock of 1911
megahertz right out of the box doing
absolutely nothing the memory clock is
set at 10.8 gigahertz just like the
founders Edition card the recommend and
power supply is a 500 watt but the power
consumption on this card is much higher
it's a 270 watts and those could connect
those dual eight pin power connectors we
showed you earlier alright folks
real quick before we jump into those
benches and rock out let's real quick
take a look at our test system and we
did find the upgraded to an i7 now it's
time to bang your head without smashing
your screen to the benchmarks on
all right so there you have it the zotac
GT x 1080 amp extreme edition
fast right average boost clock at
nineteen fifteen megahertz that's
 incredible
they say nineteen eleven but it's even
faster than that you guys can see that
this thing is be able to be overclocked
too easily to 2.01 gigahertz so that's
incredible
I didn't really want to push it any
further because I didn't want to fry my
car because I'm really trying to push to
get another one to build an SLI system
you're watching ZOTAC in in hint and and
I don't want to blow my car too but I
think that you could push it even
farther if you wanted to maybe put in a
cooler room you know have where we live
at it's pretty dang hot we live by the
desert but this card still kicked a lot
of ass so just like last time around
it's the fastest card now I haven't
tested the Lightning car MSI has that
card out yet that's the only one I've
ever seen whose numbers ever came really
anything totally close like this but for
now I got to say this is the fastest
1080 that I have seen now we will try to
get a hold of EVGA and see if we can get
their super clock Edition and see if it
beats this and then we'll try to move
into the arena of the water clock cards
and see how they do and see if we can
get even further performance but as it
is the epic stream once again kick
serious ass it's just one giant ass car
it's big and it's heavy so if you're
looking to put it like in a little mini
system it just ain't happening
I'm just going to say that this card's
big it's long you guys saw how big and
giant this card is almost three card
slot card it's just so big
so that's really the only caveat about
it but beyond that you're looking for
SuperDuper fast GTX 1080
you want to be faster than hell and you
don't care about size all you care about
killer performance this may be the card
for you I know and watching teka
tomorrow down below that like button I
hope you guys know what to do by now
will be all the information on this we
should purchase one of these things for
yourself and stick it in your system and
kick ass
