I'm Eric Faris your host and today we've
got something very exciting to show you
what am I talking about I'm talking
about Corsairs latest platinum memory
that's right we're talking about their
Dominator series memory and this stuff
looks incredible I've got the 16
gigabyte kit here behind me let's jump
in and let's actually take a real close
look at this product and why it's gonna
be awesome to stick inside of your
system let's go
sorry folks here it is here's the box of
the corsair dominator platinum 16
gigabyte kit you guys can see right here
it's Intel XMP certified those Lilly's a
little small for the camera to probably
get in there he probably won't be able
to get that but you guys can get the
gist of that here's the back of the box
also features course that are linked
it's when the new technologies from
Corsair what actually links up to other
parts of their hardware so you can get
temperature ease and that type of stuff
really interesting so let me flip around
the side here take it over there pop the
thing apart you got two things right
here take on the side right here one of
these little things earlier actually
came and kind of popped off when I was
just messing around it so we'll go ahead
and pop it pull these things out they
are very beautiful so there's like a
rubber little thing around here dink
dink the ding I'll check that the
Cameron right number to get this back
oops get these things out of here bah
boom alright so now let's take a look at
these things so here we go right here
dominator platinum you're gonna go ahead
and remove it out of this plastic now
these are set for XMP profile of 2133 if
any of you guys don't really know
exactly what that is
alright so check this out
these are honestly some of the most
badass sticks of memory that I've ever
seen I think that you guys are going to
completely agree the black the silver
totally ultimate neutral colors you can
put it in any build it's still gonna
look badass regardless you've got the
cool coarser logo right here flip it on
the back the nomenclature on the side of
the memory is C M d16 g x 3m for a 2 1 3
3 C 9 which means as Cass and rest are
going to be at C 9 snap folks I'm just
gonna go ahead I'm gonna take these out
here I want to get my mouse pad over
here because I think these things will
actually really look cool on this
background and maybe maybe they'll still
look good on this background so I'll
keep it here I like it looks really cool
for you folks I'm not going to remove
these out they all do look essentially
the same obviously but still I want you
guys to be able to see them so there's
both sides
here the other two sticks as well you
guys get a solid look of how they come
this is very fast memory now what you
want to do folks as soon as you take
this memory you put it inside your
system you want to go in get into your
BIOS go in and click the XMP profile go
and look through your BIOS different
motherboards have in different places
enable the XMP that'll automatically set
it for 2133 in some systems you said it
differently you're gonna be overclocking
your system may cause problems so
remember to set your XMP profiles
alright folks so that's it I'm pretty
excited I can't wait to do a bill with
this I know you guys are pretty excited
please leave your comments below this is
the 21 33 megahertz XMP memory this is
the new corsair dominator Platinum 16
gigabyte kit unboxing thanks we'll see
you guys here later on tech o tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
