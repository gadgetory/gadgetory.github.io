I know there'll be a bunch of rocks
being thrown we're gonna be taking a
look at a card today that is over locked
out of the box has two fans requires a
six pin power connector and it is just a
wee bit faster than another version of
the card that requires no additional
power whatsoever I'm talking about the
asus strix version of the gtx 1650
honestly this is probably gonna be the
shiniest turd you're ever gonna see
let's jump in let's check it out you
guys have been following the channel you
know that we've been using a seven
hundred dollar system to do all of our
testing we're continuing to do so
however with this particular card being
that it cost one hundred and eighty
dollars it would push the system up a
little bit over that seven hundred
dollar margin that we're trying to hit
actually pushing it up into the next
bracket which at that point I would
probably do something a little different
now we're gonna show you ten games with
this card and then we're also going to
show you some comparisons compared to
the zotac card now one of the things
about this particular card that some
people may really like is it does have a
backplate this card has a solid
backplate on the back so if you're into
us a backplate and that is really
something that's important to you this
particular card does it it also has two
fans on the front but do these two fans
actually bring more cooling to the card
I mean at the end of the day it's really
important right two fans do they bring
more cool into the car being two fans
and that you need a six pin power
connector to do it now this card has RGB
lighting and it's pretty and all of that
stuff but performance and price for me
is where everything's at and with that
said let's jump in now let's check out
ten games and then let's check out the
comparisons and if you want to see the
system that we're using we'll have a
link below down to that video so you
guys can check that out and see that
system you guys all seem to like it
really a lot and honestly if you look
around you could probably even cut that
system down to about five hundred
dollars with a few changes so let's rock
out to the benchmark song let's check
out those benches
you guys can see in the comparison
charts though that the zotac card only
gets about one to three frames per
second different than the a Zeus card
that's not really a lot to me I don't
think really anybody out there is gonna
say oh my god that's a grand bit of
difference especially for the price to
performance ratio now you guys can see
this card actually stays at 63 Celsius
but the zotac card that required no
additional power and only had a single
fan only round 1 Celsius hotter okay so
that pretty much wraps this up and in
conclusion I just want to state straight
off that I would never buy this card me
personally I just I don't really find
anything for me personally out there why
this particular card would appeal to me
now there may be some people out there
who really care about the backplate and
they care about the two fans but this
particular card really only got a few
frames per second than the zotac card
even though it's overclocked to you know
the high heaven and it only really ran
at one degree cooler so for me
personally unless you know you really
are just a fan of the strict stuff and
you want the two fans and you don't care
about the six pin power connector or
anything else about that then possibly
this might be a card for you but from
strictly a performance versus price
aspect I just cannot see this card being
a winner in the market I'm just sorry
it's just I just can't I can't see it
because for the price of this at 180
dollars you can get a much better card I
mean you can even get a much better card
on NVIDIA side of things so I mean
either an AMD card or an Nvidia card
there are other cards on the market that
I feel just offer better performance at
the same price as this you know gtx 1650
with the nice fans and the RGB ylides
and you know all that good stuff that
you get you know but honestly I feel
that a zoo pretty much took something
and I man me but it's almost like taking
a turd and just shining it up
the shiniest turd that you can get
because you got all these fancy fans you
get nice RGB but the chipset itself just
isn't really fast enough I feel and
that's like I've said before you're
using a version that's for an old
computer work and just stick in and that
and the 1050 Ti and other cards there's
still some other cards out there that
are still doing better so unless you
know GI you know she need absolute you
know you need touring shading or
whatever it's pretty much just
irrelevant so at the end of the day like
I said I mean sure choice it's your
money you're gonna do what you want to
do but me personally I would not
purchase this card it doesn't offer
enough performance for me to spend that
extra money and RGB lighting all that
stuff to me is honestly in a video card
completely irrelevant I don't really
even want it or need it in a video card
and everything's going RGB including my
underwear so it's just gotten off you
know off the hooks who really needs that
stuff I want a card that runs cool
requires the absolute lowest amount of
power that it can get and a price that I
can afford but if you feel differently
there will be a link down below where
you can buy one of these cards for
yourself check out more information and
all of that good stuff so I milk you
guys been watching techo tomorrow you
guys well like what you see here sub up
to the channel we'll be good to go we'll
see you back here on our next video
like I've said millions of times you can
turn notifications but as many people as
you'll see in the comments say half the
time you don't get notified so I don't
even know what the point of it is
anymore
YouTube is definitely broken but thanks
for watching I'm glad to see you here
peace we'll see you back from the
channel for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
