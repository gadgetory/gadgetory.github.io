and honestly this could be probably a
seriously pivotal time in the entire
gaming industry now there have been
other people out there that have had
gaming streaming services you know they
edgy force now and stuff like that but
stadia is owned and run by Google now
Google obviously guess what those
suckers run and own pretty much all of
the internet the Internet belongs to
Google so when Google says they're gonna
have a streaming service for games that
means that it's going to probably be one
of the biggest things to ever happen to
gaming ever and it's going to have a
massive effect across the board in many
different areas I mean really the way
this seems from their launch and from
all the talk they're doing I honestly
think that right now gaming is going to
change first off anybody who has a
device that can stream the Google Chrome
browser can play all of these games and
what's even more crazy about it is it
doesn't require higher-end hardware on
your end so let's just start right there
stadia comes out doesn't require any
kind of great hardware to play it how is
this going to affect companies like
Nvidia who want you know $1,300 for
their high-end video card and even a.m.
be charging you know seven or $800 for
their you know cards we haven't even
seen na'vi yet how will this really
affect the market if you'll be able to
play games and here's something else
cool not only can you play these games
on any device you can seamlessly
transfer and play your game from every
device so you could literally start out
at your house playing on your PC and
then all of a sudden you hop on the bus
to go to work you could be playing your
game and then go to work hop on a tablet
continue playing your game and plus you
can share all of your game
across all the social media services as
well
making it so that you could interact
with YouTube and everything else
automatically and seamlessly so this is
really crazy
no high end hardware can be played on
pretty much any device as long as it can
support the Chrome browser now that's
really really insane stuff now right at
launch they're saying 4k HD are 60
frames per second with surround sound
and that in the future we're gonna see
8k with the same thing and whatever new
features come out at 120 frames per
second that's right a hundred and twenty
frames per second now that's just insane
now if you're gonna be able to play
games at 120 frames per second that look
absolutely amazing why would anybody go
out invest money in any type of console
right I mean the console business this
is going to be really crazy which is why
I've said before you know guys are all
in B's in the console market no that's a
whole nother stuff we're gonna talk
about the console mark it's not gonna
mean anything really if this concept
idea if it pans out the way that it's
looking like it's going to pan out it's
going to be incredible I honestly cannot
wait to see this actually hit the market
because it's going to be in saying no
longer are you gonna have to go out and
get high-end hardware to play your games
and you're gonna be able to play your
games I mean anywhere I mean check this
out so let's just say like you're at
your home and you live in Los Angeles
and you're playing a game with your
buddy who lives somewhere else out in
the world all of a sudden you have to
fly and you have to go to New York you
don't have your PC you just have your
phone well guess what you can continue
playing that game with your friend and
you can start off right where you left
off and you can do screenshot capturing
all of this stuff and share it around
the media now I know that with the Xbox
and with the PlayStation you know they
do have features like this and there's a
lot of you know features like that that
are also in the GeForce now and there's
other platforms but here's the whole
thing like I said before Google pretty
much owns and runs the
Internet and they are going to have so
many partners when it comes out that's
going to be in crazy crazy thing because
everybody is going to want to jump onto
this platform and I'll be making another
video where I talk about AMD because
honestly AMD is in this as well now this
can be a game-changer for AMD because
all of these games and everything are
being run off these crazy servers the
GPU that's going to be powering all of
these servers features a ten point seven
teraflops powered chip 56 compute units
HBM to memory the CPU is going to be a
custom x86 processor 2.7 gigahertz hyper
threaded with avx2 technology the memory
16 gigabytes of total ram up to 484
gigabytes of transfer speed with level 2
and level 3 cache and 9.5 megabytes and
these systems will all be at Google's
data center powering all of this gaming
let's just talk about raw computing
power now the ps4 pro it has 4.2
teraflops of total power the xbox ex
that has six teraflops and the stadia
has a whopping ten point seven teraflops
you can see it actually right off the
bat blows everything in the console
market hoop right off the dang table one
of the biggest pushes by Google about
stadia is its ability to take advantage
of multi GPU technology now UL
benchmarks they've actually made a
custom multi-gpu benchmark to show you
all of these numbers most of the people
watching this video including me are
youtubers and something really cool
about stadia for youtubers is you can
actually join into a game with a simple
single click of a button and that's
pretty cool so not only can you go out
watch all these games share your
information if you want to join the game
you simply click a button and guess what
you're in
sharing that exact gaming experience and
you can do this with some of your top
favorite gamers that you follow which is
actually really cool we all like really
cool controllers right I know I do
now the stadia controller even though
you don't need it necessarily if you
want to get the full-on gaming
experience you're not sitting in front
of your keyboard you know using a
keyboard and mouse then this controller
is going to be really cool now it kind
of looks like a bastard hybrid child of
an Xbox controller and a Playstation
controller it's like they got together
they had some crazy sex and all of a
sudden this is their mutant baby you
know but overall it looks pretty cool
and it's gonna have a lot of features
that are gonna help you actually play
inside of the game um you can actually
hit a button and have the Google
assistant and the Google assistant will
help you it'll help you actually locate
any game that you want to do it'll go
through all the social media stuff
searching for information on the games
that you want searching for like the
latest games or whatever you set it up
to do for you so that's actually
something very interesting I haven't
seen any of the controller that actually
you know implements that feature and if
you're a person like me I use the Google
assistant everyday I pretty much been
talking to my phone
yo Google what's up I'm looking for this
you know I mean an all day long I'm
communicating with the Google assistants
so it's pretty handy so check this
here's an example of what I'm talking
about say that you're in-game you're
doing a dungeon troll or and all of a
sudden you're gonna start losing life
and you can't find your treasure you can
actually just hit the Google assistant
button asks where this stuff is that get
all the information and continue playing
your game with seamless gameplay you
don't even have to pause it or anything
else you can just sit there and play
your game and have the Google assistant
help you through the game is that gonna
be cheating who cares
alright now check this out google also
announced that they're gonna have their
own gaming company now called stadia
games and entertainment and that's just
crazy it's gonna be Google's very first
gaming studio and with all the money
that these guys have behind them and the
thousands of partners that they have
around the world you know this is going
to be panning out and it's gonna be just
Hugh
these guys have all the world-market
money that's on the internet in their
pockets so Google right now has a chance
to completely and totally change the way
that we play games and the way that we
interact with our audience and how we
interact with our games
they say that stadia is going to be
announced sometime this year no official
date as of yet but when it does come out
if it's not buggy I think that it's
going to change the way that we play
games forever and I want to hear what
you guys think do you guys think this is
the most craziest and most gnarly
announcement that we've heard in years
because I really think that it is and
when g-force now from Nvidia is cool I
mean it's a cool concept and everything
and there were the very first people I
think that really started doing this
this streaming service like this they
had the ideas before because it's CES we
were looking at that stuff a couple of
years ago but we all know that Google is
the hugest hugest company I mean Nvidia
swings a big you know I'm saying
but Google swings a bigger one they're
probably the biggest biggest in the game
right now they've got a ton of money to
spend and develop games and if this pans
out it's going to be incredible I can't
wait til it comes out I'm gonna be
buying the controller and everything
else and actually my son Aaron is the
one who actually alerted me this morning
like I made a post this morning about
this little system that we made that was
comparing it to an Xbox I'm if you guys
want to check that out we'll have a link
down below that it was good a PC the
size of my hand actually beat an Xbox
and in some ways yeah it does another
ways maybe not we'll also have links
down below for more information so if
you guys want to check out more stuff
about this you guys can do it um hope
you guys like this video if you're not
subscribed I would love to see you guys
back here on the channel make sure you
have notifications turned on or for some
reason the people at Google don't seem
to really show my videos anymore because
I'm not one of their court Ritt business
partners but I think I'm gonna have to
be pretty soon otherwise this is like
literally gonna squash me out slowly but
surely like a linen with no juice I know
you've been watching Tekken tomorrow I
always thank you guys for being here
wanna hear
comments want to hear your thoughts love
to interact with you peace see you guys
back in the channel for more tech on
tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
