tech of tomorrow I'm Eric here with
buddy the dog and today we've got
something really hot and exciting for
you guys to take a look at this is the
new Amazon fire TV now we're gonna bring
you guys the unboxing the features and
why at the end of the day the top 5
reasons why you're gonna want to get
your hands on this brand new product
from the people over at Amazon let's go
so Before we jump into those features
let's see what comes inside the box so
inside that little black box you get the
Amazon fire TV it's size in it 4.5 by
4.5 by point zero 7 inches and it weighs
nine point nine ounces which is 281
grams comes with remote which also has
voice control the power cord to triple-a
batteries in the Quick Start Guide so
pretty much everything you guys need to
get up and going so feature number five
is something that I love to take
advantage of and this is Amazon Prime
now if Amazon Prime you get a lot more
than just movies in TV you get a lot of
shipping stuff but with this product you
get Amazon Prime that seamlessly
integrated inside of it to having no
third party vendors nothing else like
that this is actually made from Amazon
for Amazon TV so you know that the
quality of it's going to be very great
controls gonna be awesome just a much
more seamless and integrated solution
than you've seen ever before on any
product you also get 40,000 titles right
off the bat with Prime and you can get
up to like 200,000 movies and other
shows all available through Amazon Prime
so it's a really cool service that has a
lot to offer and with this new fire TV
it's right inside the box next up very
exciting feature number four ASAP angry
Samoans
and penguins what no oh well what it
really stands for is advanced streaming
and prediction it actually learns what
movies and shows you like and gets them
ready for you to watch the more you use
fire TV the more accurate a set becomes
dynamically adapting to your viewing
habits
so essentially what ASAP does is this
say you're watching an episode of The
Walking
dead and you're on like episode three
what this does is it predicts that
you're actually gonna be watching more
episodes and it has those pre-loaded in
the queue so they're automatically ready
for you to watch no waiting no
downloading just instant awesome
streaming pretty much instantly anyways
what the hell feature number three is
voice search now in the roku products
the Apple based products this is
something that does not work very well
at all and something that's really
really cool about the fire TV remote is
that the actual microphone is in the
remote so instead of acting yell across
the room yeah you can just speak right
into you or remote control and then it
will take advantage and break it to the
programs that you want to watch that's
something that nobody else has and it's
a very very cool feature that is
featured only on the new fire TV from
Amazon feature number two that's right
now you folks are going to love this and
I know people out there where PC gamers
are going to go huh snuff at this but
check it out few people out there who
like Android gaming this is going to be
pretty cool because its entire device is
basically based off Android technology
now you guys would be able to get game
starting off at $0.99 going up and this
is gonna be pretty cool because you'll
be able to sit here and play games right
on your TV in your living room and they
also have a separate little joystick
controller that you can get that's
completely wireless for forty dollars
now with that thing you can download
these games just sit in front of your TV
on Amazon Prime and take advantage of
those games now like I said obviously
for PC gamer you're gonna be like aunt
whatever but for people who are used to
playing Android device games you're
gonna be at home and you're really going
to like this feature
now unfortunately demand for these
things right now is frakkin insane folks
but we have hours on order this should
be here in the next couple of days so if
you guys would actually like to see a
demo of that make sure you guys hit that
like button and let me know that you'd
like to see it hit that like button if
you want to even leave a comment and say
hey I'd love to see that and we'll bring
it to you folks now next up is feature
number one powerful pecs oh wait all
right I mean specs now check these out
folks this is the very first set top box
to ever have a quad-core processor
sir inside of it now specifically the
fire TV contains a quad-core Qualcomm
Krait 300 1.7 gigahertz processor with
an Adreno 320 GPU and 2 gigabytes of
memory now what that Adreno 320 GPU
equates to is four times of performance
of the Apple TV the Roku and the
chromecast
it also features eight gigabytes of
internal storage Bluetooth 4.0 5.1
surround 7.1 pass-through and 1080p up
to 60 frames per second so I folks I
hope you guys like this video personally
there's a product and I know that I'm
going to use I've been using my
playstation forever and a day I like
this much much better you guys can see
it has lots of great features coming to
market for $99 like I said you guys will
be able to get that separate remote
control little joystick thing for 40
bucks play all your games and games only
started about a dollar so it's gonna be
really really awesome stuff so for
pricing availability all that stuff
would be down there below that like
