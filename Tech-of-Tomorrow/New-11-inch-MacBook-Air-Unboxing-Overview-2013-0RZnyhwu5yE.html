back once again detector tomorrow we're
always bringing you all the tech all the
time now today's video get it probably
some kind of version to challenge me
because I know some of you folks out
there in the PC realm always love to
hate on the Apple products but
unfortunately I'm a tech er I like all
kinds of tech no matter who it's coming
from I just like tech so what's the tech
on the deck hey that kind of runs right
today's tech on the deck is the
brand-new 2013 MacBook Air 11 inch now
this thing's really actually quite
excellent for what it does about $1000
it's very lightweight though okay that's
one of the main things 9 hours of
battery life it features the Haswell ult
CPU this thing actually has 1.3
gigahertz standard but actually turbo
boost to 2.6 kicker so think about that
double your speed in the turbo mode it
comes with 4 gigabytes of memory or 8
gigabytes depending on what you want I'd
suggest buying the eight gigabyte though
if you're buying it right from the store
should not to mess with because you
can't upgrade it later once you do it
that's it has 128 gigabyte PCIe SSD we
talked about the earlier one of other
videos this is going to have really
incredible transfer rates boot times and
everything else now it's got 11 inch
screen 1366 by 768 it's not Retina
display but it's still pretty cool the
big things about this thing are
portability how it's going to look and
how it's going to perform for nine hours
outside so with that said we've got it
right here let's unbox it and let's see
this back bar though now I'm got my
trusty knife can click that thing out
here make an insertion right here
let's go ahead and take my little trusty
blade around the sides here take my
trusty blade around the sides all the
way around here just basically cut the
thing completely out of its little
package there all right nice and easy
peel off the back and that's gonna be
pretty pretty simple there now we'll go
ahead and pop the cap here let's be
cooperative and baboom and we flip it
around and thar she blows inside the box
nice small and elegant go ahead and pull
everything out so here's the inside of
the box folks little take things came
out I need to do that but go ahead and
pop this out now so here's the unit I'll
set that off to the side and let's look
what comes actually inside of the box
beyond the unit so we've got the design
by Apple in California little thing
right here this is their blue it's all
falling apart on me here sorry about
that folks so we get stickers a couple a
pur stickers the MacBook Pro err a
little hello Quick Start Guide
get the other way then inside we can see
right here we have the power cable and
the connection to the wall socket blini
right there there's all your power
circuitry go ahead and set that out of
the way so there's nothing else in there
we'll get rid of that and let's move on
to the actual product etc let's take a
look at the back for a little feet on
there spinning around
now this thing's very lightweight it's
very very thin as you guys can see it
almost doesn't even feel like I have
anything in my hands it's honestly that
lightweight so let's now flip open the
top it's got screen protector in here
I'll go ahead and remove that and let's
check this little bad boy out now these
guys can see it as a standard keyboard
has all the other little portable Macs
have your touchpad your 11 inch screen
and up here we have our little camera
those people want to take their picture
be online with a little webcam
let's close it let's take a look at some
of the connectivity we've got the
headphone USB 3.0 and the charger all
located there on the back there's no
connectivity whatsoever just a nice
clean back panel flip it around the side
we see the Thunderbolt and then another
USB 3.0 connector now the 11 inch screen
is pretty cool you guys can see it all
here but the big things about this thing
or that if you go to the airport you
don't have taken out your bag at all
it's so small and so portable you can
leave it in your bag like we said before
this thing's going to have nine hours of
battery life so that's going to be
really incredible for the person who's
on the go all in all I think it's pretty
cool the touch pad everything works
pretty easily you just click on stuff
and go to it I like this thing so far
we're probably a lot more testing on it
as the days go by and bring you guys
some more videos but this is just pretty
much the unboxing you guys folks see
what it was so I'm Eric hope you guys
like this video if so you guys know what
to do pound that like button if you're
not sub the challenge you like what you
see then please do so and we'll see you
guys back here on teka tomorrow for more
tech goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
