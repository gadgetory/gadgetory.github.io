I am so you guys can obviously this year
asus is releasing all kinds of new
monitors now we're about to take a look
at 29 inch monitor that has all kinds of
features that i've actually never seen
before on any monitor yet to come to the
market so JJ this model we're back here
this is this one right here this is the
MX 299 Q and this thing has all kinds of
stuff which we're now going to get into
you guys can see back here behind me you
can see you've got food you've got two
full screens back here being fully shown
in this monitor I mean the resolution is
2560 by 1080 in episode JJ so tell us
some of the absolutely awesome things
about this thing other than just I can
see just by looking at it small bezel
huge work area yeah so you nail two of
the things one it's a super wide aspect
ratio which like you said for
side-by-side based content or linear
workflow if you're doing audio editing
video editing database excel anything
like that where you need a huge amount
of work space it's fantastic but then
again the ID so the industrial design is
just it's awesome looking right I mean
super thin bezel we've got this real
simplified nice a medical aesthetic that
goes down on the bottom but the cool
part is that for MX it's not just about
super high image quality this thing is
utilizing a awesome high quality IPS
base panel so you get great color
fidelity so you can see in the imager it
really pops it's sharp it's clear it's
got great effects as viewing but we also
want to be able to incorporate sound so
MX we actually have our sonic master
team which is an internally developed
team which specify
develops audio corporations for certain
products we have a relationship with bno
who do some extraordinarily high end
audio designs and we worked with them to
integrate actually some really nice
solutions so we have specially tuned 3
watt speakers that are built inside here
along with actually an audio processing
chip that's integrated inside here as
well so if you want to go ahead and have
your playback whether you has a watchin
tech of tomorrow YouTube online maybe
listen to music via Spotify or Pandora
listen to some music that you've ripped
to your computer or you know playing a
game or listen to a podcast you got a
great clear soundstage good tonality
good fidelity and overall really nice
obvious
pretty loud you said it's 119 DB hundred
20 DB it's great I don't have the final
rated specifications but it's very high
in terms of the actual audio processing
in addition to that you also got a line
level input so that if you even want to
go ahead and take out your cell phone
you know an mp3 player a tablet you can
go ahead and connect it to and have
those speakers play back for you as well
so I'm going to mount looks like a
docking station as well all gold into
one so you know for use of the maybe you
want a more clean desktop if you don't
want to have to have speakers maybe I
don't want to put on my headphones it's
a really nice integrated experience for
having awesome picture quality great
vieni experience whether it's video
content or production oriented workflow
as well as that great audio experience
it's built into it now if you guys out
there to note we've gone to meet up
somebody you guys have seen so we show
80 DB in a room and 80 DB can pretty
much fill a big room with sound so just
picture 120 DB is going to be able to
even fill that room with even more
louder and fuller sound yeah so overall
really impressive we're really happy
about this this is gonna be coming soon
in q2 as far as the overall timeframe
and as far as projected price point
599's what working out right now MX 299
q from a Zeus look for it soon we'll see
you back here on techo tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
