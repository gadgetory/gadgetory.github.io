Braintree payments hey what's going on
Tech fans we took a few days off that
holiday over here in the States but
we're back with more video goodness here
on teka tomorrow this time was something
really cool the defender system
why because defends high prices ah
that's right and this is pretty cool
system the only Calvin I'll say right up
front is I thought the wiring in this
thing was a bitch get all the wiring out
of the way on this particular system of
the way it went yeah it's just not there
but everything else but the system is
really nice now we showed it with the
original I 340 160 CPU that we use in
this because you guys also the 8350
sucked and the only reason I used no
CPUs maths because they were cheap so I
abused him but you guys all said no way
man and i3 is much better so we use the
i3 but we also did something else we
tested with an i5 4460 and with an i7
4770k so you guys can actually see the
differences between that entry-level i3
CPU or your upgrade ability all the way
up to an i7 so with that said let's
check out the defender being a budget
system
I needed a case that could not only fit
the build but also came with an internal
power supply just to cover the cost and
keep everything down but the arc
technology case that we got it's pretty
cool it has a lot of room inside plenty
of room for all of your bays and all
your drives for all your hard drives and
all that stuff we even put a CD Drive in
this baby but the good thing is if you
want to change that power supply out
it's no problem at all because there's
plenty of room in there to put even full
size PS use inside the arc technologies
case for the defender build we wanted a
motherboard that was small compact but
yet affordable so we chose the MSI h8 1i
the h8 1i is a socket 1150 motherboard
that supports ddr3 and CPUs from the i3
to the i7 and for the CPU cooler hey we
just use a CPU cooler that came in the
retail box keep that shit cheap we use
the Crucial Ballistix sport eight
gigabyte kit now this is two four
gigabyte Stix ddr3 1600 megahertz this
stuff's really great price and fit our
build and eight gigabytes is just
perfect for gaming for the storage we
needed something that was fast enough to
load up quickly but still store our
games so we chose the Seagate
akuto one terabyte hard drive 7200 rpms
and perfect for this build and for those
hardcore pc enthusiasts who demand a CD
player hey we've got one it's by LG
electronics and it's a multi reader DVD
DVD RW and also your standard CDs and
last but by no means least the video
card inside the defender is the gigabyte
g1 gtx 1050 featuring 2 gigabytes of
gddr5 and once again perfect in the
price range or the defender system
alright Tech fans you guys asked for you
guys said in any budget build man use an
i3 so hey we used an i3 4160 in our
initial testing because that's what you
guys said and that's perfect for a
budget build but then we step shit up
just a little bit and we installed an i5
4460 and then we step shit up a little
bit more and installed an i7 4770k at
the end we'll have all different prices
for these different builds but hey the
first builds under $500 but real quick
before we check out those benchmarks
let's hear a word from our sponsor over
at Braintree payments Braintree is a
code for easy mobile payments maybe

learn more at Braintree payments comm /t
ot now let's check out those benchmarks
- the benchmark zone
you
as far as the temps go and everything we
decided we just show you guys what it
was like with the i7 because that's
going to be the hottest of them all you
guys obviously know that an i-5 is going
to be cooler and an i3 even cooler than
that all right fans so there you have it
the defender which was actually under
five hundred dollars and you guys might
have seen for the very first time we
actually bought a used CPU from Amazon
that i7 4770k we jumped on that was a
used CPU at right around 200 bucks so
upgrading this system will be very easy
for folks out there especially if you're
willing to roll the dice like we did and
get that you CPU I mean it's through
Amazon so it's going to have that same
warranty and everything so hey why not
like I said in the very beginning of the
video the only caveat that I felt was
the cable management this thing was next
to impossible but beyond that you guys
can see this system is pretty flexible
you can put in more CPUs you can put it
during video cards obviously a 500 watt
power supply I don't think you're going
to be able to put an SLI in there
whatsoever that's probably not happening
but beyond that everything's good to go
so I'm network you guys been watching
taken tomorrow like usual everything
about this video all the way from our
sponsor to every part we use in that
system and even the ones that we you
know changed out they'll all be there
we'll see you guys back on TECA tomorrow
for more PC goodness here on the channel
