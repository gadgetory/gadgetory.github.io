system this time I want you to introduce
yourself to everybody out there let them
know what you actually need what your
primary thing is because you've been my
contact upon time yeah we go back a long
time yeah laughter knew who you have a
Technical Marketing Manager for us my
name is Nick and I take care of all
media relationships and take care of
product guides I take care of any kind
of technical marketing messaging going
on for our motherboards or graphics
cards especially awesome and now we're
gonna be taking a look at the brand new
matrix card and this thing is like what
a completely AIO video card this is a
way radio card first time so Nick
shortens things because I got sick
deciding today I own a video card from
the outside it looks like your standard
kind of triple slot or 2.7 slot card
yeah it does it looks just like a big
card does not look like there's any room
inside this for an AI yo is this has
been something that's been in
development for well over two years and
a couple of GP generations and something
that we've finally mastered and going to
release now and in the next few months
Michael Rick mentioned I'm gonna go
ahead and open it up here you're gonna
get the entire water cooling unit under
the shroud itself so typically you would
have to mount the radiator up to the
case somewhere and have that tubing here
you have radiator we have the tanks we
have more radiator so you have almost a
240 millimeter radiator we have the pump
all integrated and their whole plan we
this is the size of a cold plate that
you would get in a CPU or GPU all-in-one
cooler yours is bigger Nick and then
this is the cult right that we've
developed so it sits on the RAM with
some thermal pads we back for you over
pasta Ram as well because the ability to
close yeah so it's able to cool not only
a GPU but its surrounding components as
well yeah and this is the amazing
all-in-one card it's just insanely crazy
I didn't you know what I didn't even
think that anybody actually ever
probably even do anything like this I'm
having thought about
like this that is amazing and you know
it really does not weigh that much more
than some of the other you know big
cards that I've seen you know companies
out there in the world this really isn't
that yeah it's a little bit heavier but
if you're gonna be mounting it like it
is in this case it's not gonna really
matter because you're not gonna get any
any you know yeah any kind of any kind
of sagging whatsoever a lot of cases are
coming with the vertical mounting
options now so you can do that so what
is this anyway since we're here this
thing just makes totally cool to I fall
I call that memory so it's a totally
tricked-out system we have our ROG
Dominus extreme that you're going to be
seeing soon probably in the next few
months if maybe in the next month or two
on on reviews Intel's doing a sampling
on this and then the matrix 20 Ti we
have our G scale Trident of course that
are blinged out and looks like diamonds
yeah doesn't it just like that
early 2000s rap video intimately and we
here at a zeus and we're doing a thing
with the memory memory that looks like
diamonds in italy at the bottom you see
wherever norton new thor 1200 watt psu
those debates on this hammer see sonic
platinum and give you the readout of the
wattage that you having so we tricked
out a see sonic the best see sonic we
tricked out and upgraded everything
about it and added a nice built this
system for you guys well there you have
it though the first a i/o video card in
the a zeus matrix not bad at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
