tech of tomorrow I'm network Faris you
guys know me now a lot of people asked
me what do we use when we're doing our
filming the equipment that we use how do
we edit and all that stuff so we thought
we'd go ahead and take the time and give
you a little tour of our control room
and what we do in our recording stuff so
basically the camera that we use is the
canon d60 we found this camera all
around just offers the most even we're
taking pictures or for filming it works
really good now for a long while we were
using just the standard lens that comes
with the camera but now we've gone ahead
and we've upgraded and we're using the
tamron di2 now now this is a 17 250
millimeter lens that's when we're
actually filming this video with so it's
pretty damn clear as you guys can see we
also use for a recording of our vocals
everything you know the audio we use the
thing from zoom this is the h1 it's a
very easy little handycam thing most on
a handycam it's a handy little you know
microphone thing and it just sits on top
the room you guys can't see it but it's
up here on top of my head the camera
moves up there you guys will see it it's
up here so that's it right there such a
record everything on so those are two of
the really main things that we use the
lens that we've gotten now seems to work
very good for wide angle and close-up
shots so we're really happy with that
lens the one that came with the camera
it actually starts off at the higher
millimeters and these so we're actually
not losing anything by buying we're just
gaining all the way up with this lens so
as far as the editing goes we use our
mac pro in the background here for tech
of tomorrow you guys can see that in the
background back there and we always use
a couple different programs when we're
doing this type of stuff now why do you
guys always say why don't use a PC this
that and the other believe me if we
could use a PC we would gladly do it but
we found that saving time saving energy
and having the best tools available
makes our day go by much smoother so we
use macs we use Final Cut Pro and we use
logic you guys see back behind me is the
mac pro and then over here is the
monitor now on the table back here i'm
kind of turning around to the saddle
change a little bit but here in the
table back here you guys can see these
are our Yamaha monitors your studio
reference monitors you guys can see a
link in description you guys are
interested I really
he is the best I mean it pains may vary
but every engineer I've ever had to come
over here and check this out and
listen to it and see it rooms like hey
wow that's really cool it sounds great
so we're really happy with that over
here we have all of our audio interfaces
we have a lot of different stuff for our
guitars and stuff because we write like
most of all our music for our stuff we
use our fractal this is the axe-fx to
this is one of the main things we use
for recording all the guitars and stuff
like that for bass and vocals and their
compression everything we use this right
here this is the universal audio la 610
we use the in Samba by Apogee this is a
great interface you either buy this or
you spend ten thousand dollars and go
all pro so I'm like right in that little
you know range between being super pro
and pro and that's where it's affordable
I'm not that rich you guys think I am
but we say four years device different
pieces equipment up here is our Sam amp
this is our base leg little thing for
like recording heavy metal and bass and
stuff this little thing makes the really
nice sound on top we've got the monster
power that Pro 2500 this is the power
conditioner we've got everything plugged
into that you know that way everything
works good so some things that are hard
to see but if the campaign like he'll
probably just take like a little spin
the room you told me took a lot of
different pictures you guys can see this
is like the heart of everything this
entire room is completely soundproofed
all the way around all the walls have
been sound insulated we even
accommodated for the window and the
distance so the window doesn't even
cause any problem with the truck is
driving by or something you know but
even then it's rare the room states very
very quiet so you guys see that all the
way around and then over here in between
over here which will be showing you some
other times you guys have seen in some
of the videos is the window that leads
into my vocal and guitar sound booth so
that's over there the cam will swing
back around to show you guys the room as
you can see we had soundproof all the
way around the entire room
which is pretty cool stuff we were
really happy we wanted a home studio
that could really kick ass and make
great sounds now everything from the
pain cylinder to my songs to the
benchmark song that all you guys love
was recorded right here within this room
in my house so over here is my keyboard
my good old trusty Yamaha my KX eight
this thing's awesome and these are all
my different fisherman pedals so if you
want to try some different weird
acoustic type stuff you get some
different sounds off of these you guys
will actually hear some of this type of
effects when you hear the new song
sunset beach will be on the next couple
days so that's it folks do you guys
really want to know all this stuff just
look in the description below and I'll
tell you all the different stuff that we
use I mean we're really doing pretty
good right now we really happy that you
guys like us don't forget that we're
also having the 30k sub contest that is
going on as well we like to always
constantly keep giving you guys stuff
and we appreciate the love back you guys
have always asked we thought we'd bring
it to you and show you how we do our
stuff and what we do it with so peace
out this has been a behind-the-scenes
look at hey tech of tomorrow and who
does all the filming well let's take a
look real quick this is Jesus he's our
cameramen and he's the guy who does all
our filming and editing protector
tomorrow so say hi to him and we'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
