we get in house to review always has the
word gaming attached to it whether it's
really for gaming or not but the product
that we're gonna be looking at today
from Bank you it's actually marketed as
an entertainment monitor you guys are
going okay like what exactly is an
entertainment who monitor what is that
stuff huh well an entertainment monitor
means it's pretty much geared to do
everything that you want to do it's made
for playing games it's made for watching
movies and the fact that it has 95
percent of the colored gamut you can
actually use it for editing videos and
stuff like that perdy well also so all
in all this particular monitor is a nice
product it's the e W 30 to 70 you kind
of a long name the 30 to 70 you and uh
it's a UHD monitor 3840 by 2160 for
millisecond and gray to gray response
time quite a few features inside of this
bad boy I've got it right here behind me
so let's just jump in let's take a
closer look at this mother and see what
it's really all about
and does it entertain it features a
thirty one and a half inch screen 3840
by 2160 resolution and it does is that
60 Hertz now the thing about this is
that it also has free sync technology so
if you guys don't know what free sync
technologies it actually locks
everything in your system and makes it
so that your games play absolutely great
the reason that this monitor probably
only has is 60 Hertz refresh rate is
because it is a 4k monitor you get the
full UHD at 4k and it's probably a
little bit hard to get a monitor that'll
do you know 144 Hertz or faster at 4k
now the panel is a VA panel which means
it's right in between an IPS panel and
one of those VN panels that people seem
to really hate on this particular
product has a three thousand to one
native contrast ratio like I said it has
95% of the DCI p3 wide color gamut which
is used for doing editing and stuff like
that 16 to 9 aspect ratio has a
brightness level of 300 CD has a hundred
and 78 degree viewing angle like I said
before the response time is 4
milliseconds great agree on the screen
and the
time was also very very short you guys
can see it it's only eight point four to
eight point five milliseconds which is a
really really great lag time which means
it has almost no lag whatsoever now the
design of the monitor is pretty cool now
the only thing that I would give it a
little bit of a caveat is this as far as
the adjustments of the monitor go
there's really not a lot to talk about
you really just get tilt controls that's
really the only thing about it that you
get now one of the very cool
technologies about this particular
product though is that it has HD R + bi
which is brightness intelligence now all
of this can actually be accessed by a
button on the front right hand side of
the monitor you can see it has a little
HDR logo right there this has actually
four different settings for you to
choose from
you also get quite a few picture options
as well so whether you're gaming playing
a movie you have different settings to
either set it like they like it on a
preset or you can set it to exactly what
you like another really nice thing about
this is the brightness intelligence
level this means that no matter whether
you're in a bright little you're a dark
lit room but color hue of the monitor
actually changes automatically you don't
have to do anything whatsoever this is
really good I care it also features
flicker free technology so even though
the monitor is at 60 Hertz you're still
able to look at this monitor for a
really long time now some people might
you know stop a little bit and say oh
you know what is I protect you
well if you're staring at a monitor
screen for eight - even 12 hours a day I
care protection is something that is
very important to your eyes I mean let's
just face it you only have one set of
eyes and I think that a lot of people
really take the eye care protection
stuff they take it with a grain of salt
and think that's really no big deal but
when you're looking at a monitor for a
really long time you'll notice that some
monitors actually make it so you start
rubbing your eyes or you feel like
you're really getting fatigued this
particular monitor I was able to play
games and surf the internet and I did it
pretty much all day long yesterday and I
never got a headache and I never felt
that my eyes were being strained I'm
sure that the freesync technology is
helping a big you know a big deal inside
of games but even just surfing the
internet and everything everything is
really nice to look at and
having that brightness intelligence that
automatically adjust no matter what
rumor environment you're in that's also
pretty cool stuff the OSD controls are
located in the bottom right hand front
of the monitor they're actually located
right underneath the monitor they're
very easy to access and you can see you
can scroll through all of the different
adjustments very very easily
now one thing you guys are gonna find
very interesting also about this
particular product is it features
something called smart focus now what
this does this actually highlights
certain areas of your screen so if you
are watching a video or something you
can actually highlight just the area of
the video that you're watching or
actually wherever you want and you can
have that stand out separate from the
rest of the monitor another interesting
fact about the ew32 7 to you is the fact
that it actually has upscale resolution
now for you people out there who've
owned DVD players you in the past they
have these 4k DVD players and said that
upscale the picture to make it look
better it actually filled in all the
blanks and made a nice denser higher you
know clarity resolution picture this
particular monitor has that feature in
it so if you're watching something that
actually has you know a lower resolution
or something it's actually going to make
it so that it looks better so it looks
kind of like it's a 4k image that's kind
of nice you don't even have to have a
DVD player it does it automatically now
as we turn around and take a look at the
back of the monitor there's not a lot to
talk about here there is however a base
amount so if you want to mount your
monitor a wall it does have that option
through the basic connection now as far
as all the plugs and stuff like that you
get a USB type-c 2 HDMI 2.0 s a single
DisplayPort a headphone jack and
obviously your power cable port now like
I said before the only real caveat about
this particular monitor is the fact that
it's not very adjustable whatsoever but
then again it's not really geared to be
a gaming monitor or a Professional
Series monitor where you need to have
portrait mode and all that other stuff
so being the fact that this is a
multimedia monitor that probably isn't
that big of a deal for those fans out
there wondering hey Elric what exactly
comes in the box well obviously you do
get the monitor itself that's a
no-brainer right you get a type C power
cable you get the standard power cable
and you get a DisplayPort to main
display port cable as well inside the
box you also get a manual
and a driver's seat you notice a lot of
monitors don't come to the driver CD
whatsoever they just automatically sync
up through the plug-and-play but this
particular monitor it does have a driver
CD so you guys can see that this monitor
does pack a lot of punches inside the
monitor and for those people out there
who really don't know what HDR is or HDR
plus what HDR technology does is back in
the old days if you had a monitor you'd
notice that they have bleed to the back
you'd see their light coming on the back
you'd have hot spots on your monitor
where certain places were brighter than
others with HDR technology the lighting
is actually spread out amongst the
entire monitor so everything on the
monitor you have darker darks you have
brighter colors and everything just
looks its absolute best with HDR
technology and in fact it seems like HDR
is kind of like the RGB of the other
world you know I mean everything the
computer world is going RGB everything
in the entire industry is going
HDR so the features are really nice I
want to stress again that the I care is
really nice if you're staring at your
monitor for a long time I really like
the fact that it's a flicker free
monitor and all that stuff and there's
another feature I didn't mention this
particular monitor actually has 2 2 watt
speakers that are built inside of it and
guess what these speakers actually don't
suck music sounds good video sounds good
and these speakers can actually get
pretty doggone loud as you guys can see
right here
and watching movies they look absolutely
great all the colors in this particular
panel like I said before our 95 percent
of the color gamut so you're getting a
lot of the nicest colors that you can
get only really an IPS monitor has
better looking color and those monitors
are usually a lot more expensive and
they have slower response times slower
refresh times this particular monitor
sits right in the perfect pocket for
that and you guys can see that games
look absolutely great as well with the
free sync technology
you're not getting any lag whatsoever
you can play games for hours everything
looks great there's no screen tearing
whatsoever I know that the 60 Hertz
might seem like it's not really fast but
when you're dealing with a 4k monitor it
actually is classed enough and makes the
screen look perfect when you're gaming
alright Tech fans so there you have it
everything you want to know about the
brand new bank you 3270 you monitor now
this particular monitor like I said has
a lot of features packed under the hood
freesync technology for millisecond gray
to gray 16 and 9 aspect ratio 3840 by
2160 full UHD 4k stuff a lot of great
features now the only thing about this
monitor that might freak some people out
is that this particular monitor is $500
which is about $100 more than similar
products on the market but the eye care
technology inside this monitor is
something that a lot of products out
there don't have whatsoever and you
really have to pay attention to that
because the eye care may seem like it's
just oh it's just some kind of you know
funky little thing but it's really not
these guys have won awards for this
particular technology and if you stare
at your monitor all day long really it
comes down to is how important are your
eyes is that extra hundred dollars that
you're paying for the eye care and not
to have fatigue is it really worth it
I think if you're somebody who uses your
monitor for everything which means
you're a gamer you edit videos you watch
movies you do pretty much everything on
your monitor then this monitor says
right in the pocket of being pretty much
a perfect product it's not as great as
IPS monitors there's a little bit better
color gamut on those those are really
made for it
they're not really made for gaming but
this particular panel it's right in the
center of everything so if you're
looking for a really nice monitor to
everything it's gonna do it really nice
it has great technology under the hood
like I said the ability to not adjust
the monitor that kind of sucks is you
can't raise the monitor up you can't do
portrait mode or anything like that but
really since it's not geared you know
specifically as a monitor for editing
and stuff like that I can see why
they've omitted those particular
features because you want portrait mode
you want all those things to be able to
just especially if you're a person who
does art strictly for a living you want
to probably have a monitor that you can
do a lot more adjustments on but a
modern that's meant for everything and
needs to sit in a really tight pocket I
think this product really succeeds at
what it does I always want to hear your
guy's opinion like usual we will have a
link down below you can check out more

particular product or buy one for
