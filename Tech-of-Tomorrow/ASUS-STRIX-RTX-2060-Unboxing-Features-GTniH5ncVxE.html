admit that song rocks too so now let's
actually check out this brand new card
from the people over at a Zeus now this
is an RT X 2060 and this card is the
advanced edition of the Strix gaming
series now there's actually three
different versions of this card that on
the market the one we have is the
advanced version they have one that's
called the overclocked version and then
just one that's a standard district
version this one's the advanced version
and honestly it has a lot of cool
features in the car that Aizaz is
claiming that nobody else has at this
point in time so these features inside
of this card should be kind of an
industry's first for these guys on the
release of this card so with that said
though real quick something kind of
different about this car - is it comes
with six months of this wtfast and for
those of you guys who are anal here's
real quick a front SH out of the box
where you can see that little wtfast
thing we're gonna check that out and
actually see if that works and it's
worth the money but it actually comes
with a free trial that's worth like 60
bucks inside of the box here real quick
is a shot of the back of the box for
those of you who love that stuff but now
let's actually jump in take a look at
the card and see why this card has a lot
of features that are a lot different the
other so I'm gonna take the little side
a little tab here let's go ahead and
just open that up unfortunately get a
little rip on the box they're kind of
hard to get it open as it is I'm gonna
go ahead and just put the card out on
the table so nothing really much here it
says Strix on the box so that actually
in three different places so they're
gonna make sure you know that this
mother the Strix Strix matter right so
now let me get the other part out of the
way go ahead and open this part of the
box up see what all comes inside of the
box we talked about the features so
right here on top I've got a little
packet with these ooh stuff here this is
gonna be the driver CD and all that kind
of stuff a lot of times though you're
gonna want to go online and download the
latest drivers anyways but it does come
with CD all kinds of little norman
culture so few people who are into that
it has it I think most of my
know how to install the video car by
this time go ahead and take this off we
will check it at the cameraman like
usual
wu hao is really clean till the Cameron
is in missed him by that much oh really
I didn't hit him I swear all right so
check out we've got some cable ties here
so this is for making sure that when you
install your car that you can get all
those cables out of the way and have a
nice clean bill go ahead looks like
that's really all that comes in the box
is that so after that there's nothing
else in the box it's now empty comes
with the cards in my hand the card and
this and that little nomenclature book
which I showed you right here so it's
this this and this comes in the box so
whoa I'll just drop that sucker it's
kind of hefty I'm gonna tell you it's
not a light card I'm gonna go ahead now
to remove the card from its handle
static bag now right here we'll start
off on the very front of the card you
guys can see there are three fans now
these fans are a completely new
technology on the card these are the new
triple wing blade fans and they have a
maximum airflow that has a hundred and
five percent more air pressure against
the card than previous generation fans
mean that you're gonna get a lot more
airflow across your card now underneath
the fan array I know it's a bit hard to
see but there's actually a bunch of
aluminum heat fins underneath here
features a brand new technology called
max contact now what this is it's a ten
times flatter heat spreader which
results in better GPU heat dissipation
and it also makes two times more contact
with the GPU chip resulting and improved
thermal transfers which just keeps your
GPU running cool now from the bottom of
the card you can actually take a better
look at the heat fins they actually
cover the entire length of the card and
with the new max contact technology try
saying that three times in a row I'm
really looking forward to see how the
temps get on this card not take a look
at the top of the card you guys can see
it has the nomenclature of the card just
took hold a couple more things you can
once again see a lot more
of the heatsink you see there's a single
six pin in a single eight pin power
connector it's also recommended that you
use a 500 watt power supply to power
this card take a look at the rear of the
card you guys can see there are a lot
more connections down here and these are
all for the Asus fam connect to this
allows you to hook up two different
connectors on your motherboard and
totally control the way the fans work on
your card so you can customize it to any
type of family at you want now take a
look at the back of the card you guys
can see there's a really nice heat
shield there's little places that are
around it which is allowing some of the
heat to dissipate you can see that right
here it's also very easy to remove the
screw patterns very simple so if you
want to remove it and upgrade your card
to something different you'll be able to
simply do that there's also a little
button right here that controls the fans
and something I haven't talked about yet
is this card features something called
aura sync it's a brand new technology
for the lighting it gives you complete
control of the card and even this back
plate itself actually lights up but if
you don't want any lighting whatsoever
you just want to go old-school you can
just use this little button right here
and simply turn off all the lights and
you don't have to worry about any of
that RGB stuff if you don't like it but
for those who do like it or a sink is
going to offer something totally
different than previous generation cards
taking a look at the connectivity in the
card one thing I really like is the
color of it because a lot of the back of
your systems are gonna be the same color
as the back of this card so that's
pretty cool now you get two HDMI outputs
these are HDMI 2.0 you also have two
display ports these are 1.4 and it has
HD sees apart of 2.2 so everything need
to connect it's right there you can hook
up four monitors at a time unfortunately
it doesn't have any kind of DVI or DVI D
connection but most of the monitors
these days don't even use that type of
connection anyways having a dual BIOS on
your card is a really nice feature
because let's just face it sometimes you
get a little too excitable and you're
overclocking and you make the card so it
just doesn't start with a dual BIOS all
you do is simply switch over to the
other BIOS and you're up and running
again and you can flash the old BIOS
back to the original buy-outs and you're
up and going on both files is up again
then you're up and going with both
bios's again and you're good to go
that way your downtime on
being able to play games is really short
the entire process of this card is made
on what they call Auto
xtreme technology which means that
there's no human interference it's all
done with no dust no nothing in a
contained factory so that it has the
highest specs available for
manufacturing processes for those of you
wondering just how long and how wide the
card is well the card is 11.8 1 by 5 2
by 1 point 9 7 inches long it's a 2 slot
design card and like I said previously
it's recommend that you use a minimum of
a 500 watt power supply as you guys can
see this card not only looks nice it
also has a lot of features the max
contact alone should prove to be very
interesting because the more contact
that you have with the GPU and the flat
of that surface the better it's gonna
take all that heat and just dissipate it
away from the GPU allowing you to get
much better boost clock speeds now
before I bounce out here I want to talk
to you guys about the boost clock speeds
on this card now as far as the reference
car which is the founders edition it has
a base clock of 1400 and a boost clock
of 1680 now the base clock on this
particular model is a little bit lower
the base clock in this card is thirteen
hundred and ninety five megahertz but
there's also two different modes there's
the overclocking mode which is at 1740
and then you have the gaming mode which
is at 1710 so right out of the box this
card is going to be overclocked much
faster than the founders Edition and
with all of the cooling features the new
triple you know the triple fan
technology and all that creating a much
no higher pressure base on the fans
hopefully this car will run extremely
extremely cool what I'm hoping I see in
my testing so I'm Eric you guys been
watching ticker tomorrow this has been
the unboxing and features of brand new
Asus Strix RT X 2060 card lots of
features under the hood let's see how it
test and how cool it really runs in our
