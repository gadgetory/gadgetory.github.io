tomorrow channel and I'm lucky enough to
hook up with the man Steve Vai himself
with his new signature guitar from
Ibanez under $2,000 Steve Hughes tell us
like there's a couple quick words about
this awesome guitar of yours it's coming
out I can of too busy playing it you do
that all the time but you're like the
most maestro a guy of all time so I mean
no it's it's a it's a new Jam but we
wanted to bring the price down a bit
without sacrificing a lot of the the
playability and the quality so and the
cool thing is it's I always liked you
know those old strats that kind of cake
so here we come to the part where my
dumb ass actually turned the microphone
off Here I am interviewing Steve by the
guitar god my idol of guitars and I turn
the mic off basically though he's just
basically telling me that all the
features booked our I asked him about
the electronics in the guitar what they
were compared to $3,000 guitar he kind
of laughed and said they were pretty
much the same exact things as you can
see the guitar has two sets of humbucker
pickups and one single pickup in the
guitar this is Steve by his design all
the neck and lay is really nice as well
and the color the seafoam green he says
that he chose us as one I kind of agree
with it because it kind of brings
old-school guitars and new-school
guitars together with his design I just
gotta say it was totally awesome
to meet Steve
and I wish my dumbass without turning
the microphone off see guys we've
actually heard him saying this instead
of me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
