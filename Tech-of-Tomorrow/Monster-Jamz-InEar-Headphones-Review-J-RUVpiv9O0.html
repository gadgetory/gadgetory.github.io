YouTube land l affairs editor in chief
here at tech of tomorrow well last week
I brought you an unboxing of monsters
new jams in her earphones and today I'm
going to bring you the full review so
starting off right off the bat but talk
about how comfortable they are I have
these things in my ear and I've been
taking him in and out of listening to
stuff on them for the past few hours
they don't give you a headache and
there's no discomfort whatsoever while
they're in your ears sound clarity is
very well and outside noise is not
completely cancelled out but it is
pretty cancelled out so for any people
out there who really want something
that's a nice upgrade to listen to their
music these are very very nice they're
small they come in a great little case
that you can travel out anywhere you
want to go and they'll plug into your
computer iPhone device or even any mp3
player that you have out there now the
control talk feature that's what these
will only work with your Apple stuff it
won't work with the other stuff but this
is actually pretty cool to using this
feature you can actually answer your
phone or change the songs that you're
listening to write out the thing that's
right on the little line here in your
headphones so over all these are pretty
cool now the only thing that might be
daunting to some people about these
headphones is the price because they do
cost about one hundred fifty nine
dollars but if you get them on sale
somewhere you can get them for around a
hundred and twenty dollars now I know a
lot of people out there going to say why
in that hell when I buy those damn
headphones even for a hundred and twenty
dollars when I can buy others well some
of the things that monsters famous for
his rug ability and making high quality
products all the stuff that's used
inside of these headphones from the plug
all the way up to your ear is made of
very high quality stuff now I've used a
lot of other in
stuff in my ears especially like when
try to deal with the stuff with my phone
like that little thing you answer your
phone with and they've all given me
really bad pains inside of my ears these
with the ones that come right out of the
box fit snugly in my ear block the
outside stand up pretty well and are
very very comfortable so the top three
things about these things are how well
they're made how well they sound and how
well they function so if you're a guy
out there and you have an Apple device
these phones are even better for you
actually I think monster probably did
gear these tours you know the Apple
crowd so they'll probably two people to
actually buy these most but overall I
give these things a solid editor's
choice here in tech of tomorrow they're
a little pricey but they actually kick
ass and the things they do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
