once again to the channel me and buddy
the dog here to bring you some tech now
the other day we brought you guys the
Titan X and showed you guys that it
pretty much was the fastest gaming card
you could get your hands on now some
people freaked out about the pricing
we're like oh my god that thing's
extremely pricing Willy obviously it
isn't Matt I mean the Quadra which is
its bigger brother which is the fully
unlocked Pascal chip is a five thousand
dollar card so this is kind of like you
know a cut up version at only $1,200 but
this time we've got the full 25 a gaming
suite that's right in 2k 4k and 1440
let's now check out the Titan X or some
people are calling it the Titan XP but
it really just tight next just Pascal
branded and uh let's check that out man
let's check out those games and real
quick you guys can see here's a test
system we've been using this for the
past few review so get used to it this
will be here for a little while longer
and with that said let's rock
all right folks so there you have it 25
games tested on the new Titan X Pascal
flavor also as far as the async and all
the computing stuff doing we will be
doing some videos that are direct
head-to-head comparisons with AMD to
show the differences we're still using
some of the old sayings we're using we
know that Vulcan is here that some of
the stuff is moving in the direction of
Vulcan and as more things get Vulcan
we'll start using Vulcan more and more
and we'll have this card Direct with all
its Vulcan features compared against the
AMD cards in just the future videos so
with that said like usual down below
like button love the information for
this car if you're looking to get one
for yourself if you're crazy gamer but
like I said if you're the Oberer gamer
who does not care about spending cash
the tight necks Pascal version is the
shoot of the soup it's the new King of
the Ring and that's just how it is I'm
Mel work buddy the dog once again gzip
in the camera we'll see you guys back
here for more tech on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
