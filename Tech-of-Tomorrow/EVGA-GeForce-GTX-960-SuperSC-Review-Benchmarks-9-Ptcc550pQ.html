Heisenberg with chicken Omar Hagen Elric
with tech of tomorrow all right so like
I said it's 6:00 a.m. it's early in the
 morning what am i doing up
in the morning what are you doing up in
the morning if you guys are in the East
Coast or somewhere else in the world
that may not be 6:00 a.m. but here
California Pacific Standard Time it is
launch day launch day of what well that
is the brand-new gtx 960 from nvidia now
this thing is supposed to be the 1080p
sweet spot card and i think you guys are
going to agree that with an entry-level
price of $200 and frame rates above 60
frames per second in almost every game
at high settings I think you guys are
going to be pretty impressed now there's
a lot of cards coming out to the market
from reference in Zion stay after market
designs River River reference design
let's see it's 6:00 a.m. I barely got my
 together but I'm here for your
video today I have one that's not only
super clock it's super super clocked and
this is the brand-new EVGA super super
clocked gtx 960 coming to the market
about two hundred and nine dollars
featuring a CX 2.0 cooling and with that
said let's jump in and let's check out
the speeds and feeds about the new gtx
960 the new geforce gtx 960 is based off
the GM 206 chipset and has been designed
to deliver great gaming performance at
1080p with the graphics settings cranked
up and FXAA mfa a or 4x AAA
enabled the gtx 960 will even deliver
playable frame rates with 4k dsr when
playing MOBA games like League of
Legends the geforce gtx 960 ships with a
thousand 24 cuda cores and 8 sm units
the memory subsystem of the geforce gtx
960 consists of two 64-bit memory
controllers equalling one
a bit with two gigabytes of gddr5 memory
there are 64 texture units and 32 rap
units the TDP of the 960 is hundred and
20 watts and a recommended power supply
is a 400 watt power supply not too much
at all thermal threshold is at 95
Celsius the base clock speed of the
geforce gtx 960 is eleven hundred and
twenty six megahertz but the super super
clocked version comes in at twelve
hundred and seventy nine megahertz which
is quite an increase the typical boost
clock speed on a reference card is
eleven hundred and seventy eight
megahertz the booze clock speed of the
super super clock version however is
thirteen hundred and forty two megahertz
which is also quite an increase the
memory clock is set at seven thousand
and ten megahertz and nvidia is saying
that these cards will overclock even the
reference ones to at least fourteen
fifty megahertz so fourteen hundred and
fifty megahertz just for a standard
overclocked card out of the box that's
pretty damn good with that said though
now let's take a closer look of the
brand new EVGA super super clocked gtx
960 as we take a look at the card we can
see right off the bat there's a black
shroud covering the far the card
featuring two fans the EBG name and the
name of the card the geforce gtx 960 the
card also features they're brand new a
CX 2.0 cooling that also features a 6.2
power phase design as we flip the card
around down to the side you guys can see
that there's a cooling apparatus all in
case between that shroud and that
contains a bunch of aluminum heat fins
and then some copper heat pipes as i
flip the card around to the rear you
guys can also see that there are three
heat pipes emanating from the rear of
the card as we flip the card around to
the other side you guys can see that
once again we see the EVGA geforce gtx
960 and we also see the SSC in bloom as
well there's also more of the heat fins
and then the single eight pin power
connector which is required for powering
the card as i flip the card around of
the rear and you guys can see it has a
completely black PCB which also matches
the black heat shroud in the front which
is great for when you're building a
computer because black matches pretty
much anything next we take a look at the
rear i/o where io features five
connections which features a single hdmi
a single dual link DVI and three
port connections now let's take a look
at what actually comes in the box if we
were doing an unboxing this is actually
what you would see so here you have it
everything in the box there's actually
this really cool poster that we put up
on the wall which you've been using the
background now you guys can see that as
well so all in all a pretty cool package
ok so there are all the speeds and feeds
what the card looks like now let's jump
in take a look at the test station and
then the benchmarks as you guys can see
our test system is a pretty much
mid-level system it's nothing too
outstanding it's nothing too crappy it's
right there in the middle all testing
was done at 1920 by 1080 P we also use
all the latest drivers from Nvidia and
AMD for all of our testing
but you're back alright then rocking out
to the benchmark song so there you guys
have it the brand new EVGA super super
clock gtx 960 now the temperatures on
this thing were pretty incredible idol
33 under full load 71 celsius that means
it's things running really cool and it
came to overclocked out of the box in
most of the tests it actually beats the
760 quite a bit making it a very good
card for the money
pretty much all these cards at launch
like the 660 to 760 they were actually
even more expensive than the 960 s at
launch
like I said 199 dollars for our
reference model two hundred and nine
dollars for an overclocked version like
this that's incredible back in the day
if you bought a car that all is
overclocked and super clock stuff on it
they would charge you at least 50 or 60
more dollars now they're only charging
you like 10 15 bucks which i think is an
awesome thing now question we want to
ask you guys do you guys prefer videos
in 4k or do you guys prefer them at
1080p at 60 frames per second like we're
bringing them to you today something we
just want to know so you guys give us a
note down below so for me I think this
card is a serious editor's choice card
it is the sweet spot for teh AP gaming
look almost every game we threw at it
all the tests over 60 frames per second
over a hundred on others that's actually
really good and on mobile gaming 4k
that's going to be pretty damn good few
people out there or just do you know
World of Warcraft and that type of stuff
that's not my cup of tea but for you
guys out there to do it you're going to
be in like flint this card's going to be
something to want to be hooking your
hooks into like usual all the
information for this car will be down
below at like button which god I hope
you guys are going to go Chuck Norris on
because I was up at 6 a.m. damn it so
hit it just saying so you guys looking
for a card like I said down below there
below that there will be all that
information just hit show more info
where you want to buy the card any more
information it'll all be there so you
guys can see I'm hyped um kinda want to
finish the video so I can go back to
sleep and actually get on with my day
but that's it guys it's early morning
thanks for watching techo tomorrow
launch day is here the gtx 960 is
arrived we have the zotac amp version
coming up for you
guys as well so stay tuned detective
tomorrow
say my name say my name say my name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
