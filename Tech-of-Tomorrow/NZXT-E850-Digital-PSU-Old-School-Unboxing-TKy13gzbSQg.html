computer out there needs a power supply
and you guys all know that you know
buying a really cheesy cheap power
supply is probably a good way to not
only have to replace your power supply a
lot of times but also severe chances of
burning out your system so you always
want to make sure you buy a pretty
decent power supply I've showed you guys
cases in the past that were really
cheesy and I had like a cheap 550 watt
power supply in them and you know some
of those systems last for years other
ones break really fast but using those
particular power supplies are only for
like really low low-end systems and low
budget stuff this particular power
supply though is the NZXT II 850 now
this is a really really nice power
supply it's going to come to market
about a hundred and forty nine dollars
for an 850 watt power supply
it features 80 plus gold rating it's got
three 12-volt rails but the really big
thing about this is the way that you can
monitor the voltage and the temperature
all through a digital power supply and
unfortunately this only works in Windows
10 so if you have camps offering odd
stuff you can totally monitor each rail
individually or the temperature of the
power supply and that's something really
interesting plus I was really hoping
that it totally digitally control all of
the power because being digitally
controlled means less air than anything
it's going to be analog so if it's a
totally complete digital power supply
through and through that's gonna be a
really great thing but today we thought
we'd just say hey well let's bring you
guys the unboxing let's take a first
look at this power supply in this
particular lineup I believe they're
going to have three different power
supply starting off at like six hundred
and something watts so you can go all
the way up to the 850 and also the weird
thing though is that the price
differences between the three different
versions is only about ten dollars so I
mean if it was me if I can get an 850 in
paying one you know $20 more than paying
for a sixty I think I'm probably gonna
go for the 850 just because you know I
can probably power all my stuff in fact
this particular power supply it'll even
power two cards so it will do two cards
in SLI or two cards in crossfire
whatever your preference is but with
that said though let's jump in now let's
do the old fashioned unboxing and just
see what comes in the box and uh
what it is so let's start off by taking
off all this nasty shiny plastic it's
nice when it's brand new but sometimes
on camera that can look kind of glarry
getting a Glary in your eyes so let's
rip off all the classic get all that
stuff off of there and not fall over on
the dog get all that stuff take it and
throw the plastic at you the audience
that's right okay so with that setting
let's go ahead and find out where the
next opening the box is I believe it's
right over here no now you've got me
trickery they've got more stuff on the
box I got to work with but hey it's an
unboxing so let's unbox it anything
right so I'm going to go ahead and pop
the cap here on the side open the box up
go ahead and set it down over here no
you pick and you folks can see it as I
unbox it so there you go let's go ahead
and pop the cap everything's in there
really SuperDuper tight I mean extremely
tight okay so we have an NZXT blue bag
pull that out of there this is obviously
going to contain all of the different
cables for the system we'll go over
those in just a minute and show you
exactly which ones come inside the box
nice little bag though for storing stuff
we have the NZXT manual and then we have
this nice little silicon snack to snack
on lady every box you're supposed to eat
this stuff no I'm just kidding you're
not supposed to eat this stuff I'm just
kidding with you but it what this stuff
does is keeps all the moisture out of
your box so it's traveling around it
gets weather where there's rain or
whatever this actually absorbs all the
moisture so it doesn't go in your
product y-you see it all the time
alright so here we go PAH boom and you
get this box out of the way here so here
is the power supply comes in a nice
little case why it comes in a nice
little case I don't know if you're just
going to take this little case right
here to get rid of it and never use it
ever again now as you guys can see it
features a completely modular design all
the way around the power supply itself
is actually quite small it's a very
small power supply all things
considering all the components that are
used inside this power supply are also
extremely high
quality parts you guys can see all the
nomenclature about the power supply
right there so obviously if you're gonna
buy one you'll see all this stuff
yourself on the backhand side we see the
power plug and an on and off button
I like having on and off button not a
power supply oh if you notice if some of
the 1500 watt and those type of power
supplies sometimes they don't they don't
have a power button on them that kind of
trips me out because I always like a
nice power button both the other side
the power supply are completely
identical
nothing crazy there and even though it's
hard to see underneath hair is a fan
that's keeping your power supply running
cool I know it's a little bit hard to
see but it's there trust me now as far
as the connectors inside the box you get
a single 24 pin ATX power cable you get
two four by four pin CPU power cables
you get six PCIe cables these are the
six plus two kind which can be made into
an eight pin you get six SATA cables six
peripheral cables one mini USB cable and
then finally there are the mounting
screws themselves for mounting inside
your case and then the power cable one
thing really nice about this particular
unit as well as has a 10 year warranty
so it's a really long warranty it looks
really nice it's clean all those digital
features all in all I think this is a
pretty nice looking power supply now all
I need to do is install it in the system
install that cam software and see how it
does in real time okay so there you have
it the unboxing and first looks of the
brand-new NZXT 850 power supply
like I said 850 watts 149 dollars all
those nice digital features the fact
that it's completely modular every part
is really nice inside of it it's
well-built it's not even like really
gigantasaurus in size it's actually got
a really perfect size so it'll probably
fit in any case you have out there and
if you want something that's solid
something that has a good warranty you
guys who know NZXT know they make really
nice products we actually have a
building coming up with another NZXT
case the purple ones if you guys might
know what that is so like usual level
link down below so if you want to see
more information about this particular
unit or their other units or buy one for
yourself you can do so I'm mark you guys
been watching Tekken tomorrow I'd love
you to be sub to the channel make sure
you have notifications turned on and if
you
my normal fans hey let's let you guys
know the patreon site is up and going
and you should support us through there
so peace out we'll see you guys back on
the channel for more tech on teka
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
