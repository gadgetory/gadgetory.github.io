again a lot of products really seem to
overuse the word gaming it's attached
all kinds of things to chairs to Mai's
you know yada yada yada we've talked
about it a bunch of times but sometimes
certain products are actually geared
towards gaming and we're gonna be
looking at a monitor from pixie oh this
is the px5 a high you Lusa now this is a
twenty four point five inch monitor it
features a TN panel which means you know
the contrast ratios are gonna be kind of
a little bit weird the color it's not
gonna be the greatest but you're gonna
get really super fast everything else so
you know your response time is gonna be
one millisecond
it's gonna have two hundred and forty
Hertz for the refresh rate all kinds of
crazy stuff now the panel itself like I
said is a TN panel and from the front
you guys can see it's pretty standard
stuff here now this particular monitor
does have almost completely bezel list
design now there is a small bezel it's
not really that big so if you wanted to
put multiple of these monitors together
and create like some kind of surround
thing you could do that without a
problem now this particular panel
supports HDR it has a brightness of 400
CD and it has an aspect ratio of 16 to 9
this particular panel also has a
contrast ratio of a thousand to one and
it reproduced colors pretty well but I
don't think it really uses the full
sixteen point eight million color gambit
and the monitor was a little bright but
this is an LED backlit panel so a little
bit of brightness is to be expected now
another thing that's kind of different
about this particular monitor is that
usually the on-screen display is located
right on the front of a monitor usually
right underneath the right hand or left
hand side but on this particular model
it's actually located on the back of the
monitor now there's a little joystick
that you use to control everything and
it operates pretty well it's not exactly
the most you know
ergonomic in the world but it still does
function properly
now this monitor also supports
which means if you have an AMD video
card inside of your system you're gonna
be able to use all of that technology
without spending any extra money um I do
not think this particular monitor
qualifies for g-sync compatible no where
does it say that so I'm not really
expecting that out of the box but for
all those people out there who have an
AMD card in their system which is
millions of people out there this
particular monitor look right up to your
system no problem at all and one thing
about the 240 Hertz is that inside of
the OSD you'd expect there'd be a
setting inside of here to set it to the
240 Hertz spectrum but you don't have to
do that whatsoever this is all actually
done within the Windows environment
another thing that's kind of neat about
this monitor is the stand
most of the gaming monitors that we've
seen the stand usually let's just face
it it sucks
now this particular monitor also looks
like it's kind of a vase amount of all
right out of the box now the stand takes
is a couple of screws you just pop it on
and it's on there but you can do a lot
of different stuff with this particular
stand you can actually use portrait mode
you can spin it around just a lot of
different settings that make it really
economic for pretty much setting it up
so no matter where you're sitting or
what you're doing it'll be comfortable
for you to view now one thing this
monitor does not have whatsoever there
are no speakers built into this monitor
whatsoever and some of y'all might think
that that's a lag but I don't really
feel that it is because most of the time
especially if you're a professional
gamer you're going to be using
headphones anyways now like I said
earlier this particular panel is a TN
panel and TN panels are known to really
sacrifice a couple of things as far as
the contrast ratio goes and as far as
the color goes everyone knows that other
panels are better but these are really
the most commonly used panels on the
market and they do offer the very
fastest response times around now as far
as the input lag goes on this particular
monitor it was only twelve milliseconds
and in the world of milliseconds mean
that takes a thousand to make a second
twelve is really absolutely nothing and
the human eye won't be able to detect it
at all
now in the back of the monitor as far as
connections go there's a connection for
the power cable there's a connection for
your headphones
there's a single DisplayPort and there's
also an HDMI one an HDMI - connection
now one thing that's very important to
pay attention to only the HDMI one and
the DisplayPort will support the higher
functioning hurt so if you want to use
the monitor setting it that 240 Hertz
you're going to have to use either HDMI
one or the DisplayPort connection and
just in case you need there's also a USB
2.0 connection as well now as far as
just sheer gaming goes obviously this
monitor rocks I mean everything that you
see on screen looks absolutely great
there's no ripping there's no tearing
you can play on this monitor for hours
and hours on end and I think that's one
of the real reasons why they're touting
this is a gaming monitor because with
all the high refresh rates there are
high response times just everything
being you know - its Oberer maximum you
can stare at this panel for a long time
and play your games without having eye
fatigue
this panel also features three different
low blue light options so if you're
gonna be staring at the screen for long
amounts of time this is a great option
to have also there's a bunch of
different settings for different things
you're doing like for gaming for
watching movies most monitors have it
this particular monitor has it as well
now as far as movies go and watching
stuff like that yeah this panel is going
to be just fine is it going to be the
absolute best color reproduction if
you're editing videos you're doing stuff
like that no I wouldn't really recommend
that and this monitor is not geared for
that doesn't say gaming / you know
editing / blah blah blah strictly touted
as a gaming professional monitor and it
has the features to back that up
tn panels are known to be the gaming
standard they really are they're like
they said the most commonly used they
have the fastest stuff around so you've
got you know one millisecond that's
really fast 240 Hertz 12 on the lag not
really too much you know negative about
the monitor until we get to the price of
the monitor now this particular monitor
comes to market at almost 300 dollars
and that's a little bit pricey compared
to some of the other monitors on the
market but the thing is how much time do
you spend in front of your monitor and
how important is protecting your vision
and not having eye fatigue to you so if
you're a person who is a light gamer and
you really don't do a whole lot of
gaming this particular monitor may not
be the one for you but if you're
somebody who takes your gaming seriously
or you're a professional gamer being at
25 minutes it's really portable it's
gonna be strictly 1080 sono 1440 no for
KBS none of that whatever it's just full
HD what you know basically means it's a
1920 by 1080 panel it's a solid thing
really the only caveat to this
particular monitor I have to say is the
price it is a little bit pricey but then
at the end of the day you have to
balance out what's important to me is a
fatigue and maintaining my vision more
important to me than just spending it
and that
strip it of money you have to really
think about that and depend on what your
solution is for you like I said if
you're a light gamer you might be like
yeah you know what I really don't need
that particular thing that's not for me
but if you're someone who sits in front
that monitor for hours and hours on end
these features can definitely be
something that could benefit you and
allow you to do this without getting a
headache or going oh my god I'm just
sick of gaming so many things on the
screen anyways like usual like and all
her videos all have a link down below so
if you guys want to check out more
information by the particular panel or
get one for yourself you can do so I'm
mark you've been watching tech o
tomorrow thanks for watching we'll have
links down below to our music to our
patreon all that kind of stuff if you
like what you see then hate sub the
channel we love to see you back here
make sure you turn the notifications
bell otherwise you won't know what we're
