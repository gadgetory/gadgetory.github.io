welcome back once again to tech of
tomorrow where today we're gonna be
talking about mobile phones that's right
not video cards I don't know what's up
but I would have thought this last AMD
launch you guys would have been a lot
more excited but it seems to be kind of
a ho-hum launch people took it ok but I
know all you guys love mobile phone
technology so I got a chance to upgrade
my phone to go from the note 2 to the
new Galaxy Note 3 I got that back behind
me and I've also got this cool little
thing right here called the galaxy gear
now this thing is gonna be really cool
the one I got actually kind of looks
like a Dick Tracy watch you guys will
see us do the unboxing and honestly
since I was a little kid I've been
talking about this my mom even said it
like when I got this she was like oh wow
that's really cool
just like Dick Tracy when I was a little
kid I think even back in the early
1900's people were talking into a watch
like device now I've got one so instead
of bullshitting around let's just jump
in and let's see what comes inside the
box then talk about the technology
between these two products let's go so
alright my friend Lee's here we have you
for us the two boxes for the verizon
samsung galaxy note 3 and the samsung
galaxy gear now right off the bat I want
to make it very clear this is very
pricey stuff and right now this has very
limited connectivity it only connects
with this and a couple other products
now they're promising an update in the
future to work with more stuff but for
now it's very limited now with that said
though that's pretty much the negative
let's jump in and see all the really
good things though so here's the box I'm
gonna go ahead and just push this thing
out of here it's nice and simple then we
got a box inside of a box again so I'll
go ahead and put the cap here
we'll start off popping out the foam now
right off the bat you guys can see this
thing has a beautiful screen let me turn
the right side up 5.7 Super AMOLED
gorilla 3 touch screen now this thing is
going to be very bright it actually
comes in at 1080p
now there's a 13 megapixel rear camera
and a 2 megapixel front camera and this
thing shoots in both 1080p and 4k pretty
amazing stuff
put around in the back and also folks
were at this angle a lot of you folks
before complained about this being
plastic well now it's pleather
that's right faux leather and it
actually feels pretty nice it feels a
lot more quality than the old stuff did
now you have a thirty two hundred mil
amp hour battery in this thing and it's
supposed to last for a full 24 hours
between charging and 21 days in standby
mode pretty incredible stuff here's one
of the controls on the side now you can
see these controls are almost clear and
inside of the phone itself it's just so
ultimately sleek put pater to the top
here you have more connectivity flip it
on the other side more buttons you guys
can see you can really barely even see
the buttons and I apologize for shaking
a lot of you guys asked why do I shake
well I have really bad diabetes and I
had nerve damage from my operation so I
do shake a bit so I'd appreciate it you
know if you don't make fun of me if you
want to comment it's cool but the making
fun of me kind of hurts my feelings a
bit there folks but check this out it's
thin it's very very light weighs six
ounces it's also about six inches by
three inches by a quarter-inch the exact
specs that'll all be on the website I
know you folks were totally in a
technology you're gonna go check that
out I'm just like basically showing you
the unboxing the s-pen has also been
improved upon you guys can see that
right here there's actually a better tip
on it now so hopefully when you're using
it's gonna be a lot more accurate and
stuff I never really use the last one
that much but with the improved stuff
I'm hoping to use this one if it's more
user-friendly I'll definitely be down
with that also down here folks this
actually looks different than your
standard phone connection this is
actually a USB 3 but it's actually
backwards compatible as well so you'll
have no problems using it with multiple
devices to charge so that's pretty much
the phone and the specs of it has a 2.3
gigahertz quad core processor it's a
Snapdragon 800 you have 32 gigabytes of
internal storage and 3 gigabytes of
internal RAM so all in all it's a pretty
damn spectacular thing for being so thin
I mean this thing's thin it's light I
haven't put the battery in Jonathan said
it's gonna change the weight we'll have
to see when we get there so let's go
ahead and see the rest of the content
pulling out here I guess is gonna come
to the center of the box here yep all
right so here we go I want a tie camera
range for you folks button pop that open
here's all the rest of the goodies that
come with the phone I'm just gonna go
ahead and set that off to the side you
get all these get to know your phone
things get to know your phone familiar
as they come to telefono product safety
and warranty information important
consumer information consumer
information about radiofrequency
emissions a weight that's actually in
English all right start with that and
then last one the global support
calling-card
dun dun dun I got a PIN number and
everything else so I guess you having
trouble your phone globally you can call
these people and get support and make
sure your yeah it's taken care of
so we'll set that up to the side here we
get the charging connection wire go
ahead and just uh pop that open there so
there we go so like I was speaking of
earlier folks the connection for this is
USB 3.0 which you guys can see right
here but it's also backwards compatible
so if you have all those old phone
charms that you invested in they'll be
able to work this will just be a little
bit faster here you can see the blue
designating USB 3.0 and get that out of
the way then we have some tools here are
some tools they gave you this time some
tools and some parts and never see that
with a phone usually but now you get
tools and parts to operate on your phone
interesting then here's a little charger
and plug that into the wall and plug
it'll thing into it like that I know
most people know this but they're gonna
be people out there going oh I never
seen that before so here you go plug
that bad boy into there the other end of
this into your phone like so let's see
here we go the nice charger first time
for everything and so there you go
that's how things all plugged in plug it
in your wall begin your charging now
last but not least up is the battery
like I said before folks this is a 3200
milliamp hour battery supposed to have
24 hour battery life and 21 days of
standby that's pretty incredible
so that's all this stuff before I
actually put the battery in the phone
let's take a look at the Galaxy gear now
I've got a mess
for me let's clear this mess up a bit
and take a look at the Galaxy gear so
Galaxy gear now if you folks don't know
what this is this is kind of like a
wristwatch that actually works in
conjunction you can answer your phone
all that kind of stuff all off of your
wrist just like a Dick Tracy movie when
I was a kid so come let's pop the cap
and check it out folks look at the color
scheme very Dick Tracy check this out I
mean I don't really know exactly how
this works but oh yeah that's all it is
it has this no it's gonna be too tight
for me I'll maybe have to do an
adjustment on it cuz right now this is
too tight for me you guys can see I mean
I can't buckle the thing and that'll rip
my arm off look at that Dick Tracy style
shiz Nick right on my wrist it's even
got the color scheme buttons right here
let me go and pull it off my wrist I
really do hope this thing is adjustable
and pretty sure that it is yeah I see
over the side there's an adjustable band
right here so to make it longer all I
got to really do is just move this thing
down so never done that before but let's
figure it out so ya see there you go
folks I can move it around to wherever I
want we pop it back in here there's a
little clip inside here I'm trying to
get that in there there we go
pops it back in and then I can reboot
the watch back on my wrist and hopefully
at this point it won't to rip a nice
hole in my wrist top there we go
kaboom on my wrist and good to go
pretty interesting now anything else
comes in the box let's check it out so
this right here is actually the charging
dock go ahead and pull that little bad
boy out okay it's it gives instructions
little Samsung logo a little plug right
there then we've got the charging wire
and little mechanism right here
and that's pretty much it that's what's
coming with that so I'm good and pull it
back off my wrist one more time
and the first time put that thing on
there actually kind of cut myself not
bad but too interesting so I don't know
man since I was a little kid I've so
been looking forward to having something
like this I know it's pricey and stuff
like that but I'm really looking forward
to having it so there you have it the
Galaxy gear and the Galaxy Note
three and all of its beauty now remember
this is the Verizon version that I have
other versions might have different
content really think they will much but
they might possibly have so we really
want to make that clear
also the 4k ability to film are you guys
interested in seeing that now I know
what not many people have 4k monitors
you're not going to look at that in your
1080p but still if you guys would like
to see us make a film and do something
with that hit that like button and let
us know in the comments below because
we're totally down we'll take the 4k
thing make something cool and funny for
you folks to show you and you'll get an
idea of how well the camera does in 4k
so that's pretty much it I hope you guys
did like this video I can't wait to
change the phone get all my information
on it and start using it daily then I'll
get back with you guys of the full
review of it I'll probably do it in
written format which I'm better at but
we'll see how it goes with that said
hope you guys liked it like I said if
you're not subscribed hit that sub
button and we'll see you guys back on
Tekken tomorrow as I actually use the
phone and the galaxy gear see</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
