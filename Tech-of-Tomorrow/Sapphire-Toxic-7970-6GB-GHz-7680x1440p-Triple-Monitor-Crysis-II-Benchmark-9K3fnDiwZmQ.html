again on tech Audemar YouTube channel
Elric ferris Errol someday we're gonna
bring you guys something really cool and
really fun now you guys have all seen
Crysis 2 it's one of my favorite
all-time games I've ever played
I love Crysis 2 but how many of you
people out there and seeing Crysis 2
played at a resolution of 76 80 by 1440
that's right so today when we bringing
you guys is the new sapphire HD 7970
Giga her two dish in the card this is
the one that's the toxic version has six
gigabytes of RAM I mean it's an amazing
thing and it's geared towards multi
monitor technology that's what really
separates it from the other beast now
behind me I've got three of the high-end
27-inch monitors I've got one of the
Dell and two of the HP's these monitors
by themselves all have a resolution of
2560 by 1440 but we've combined all
three in a panoramic view for you guys
to check out in 76 80 by 1440 with
everything set to its maximum all the
bells and whistles so with that said
let's jump in and let's check out the
gameplay from a bunch of different cool
angles in complete surround vision let's
go
so what do you guys think of that
actually what's really cool is if you
back way up from the game it's much
cooler to play I actually found playing
this close up I got dizzy and kind of
sick and almost threw up a couple times
because three different refresh rates on
three different monitors is just insane
but when I backed up it was really cool
to play but the only thing is you got to
set a wireless keyboard and mouse but
tell me what you guys think I think this
thing is incredible and it really shows
off the new sapphire HD 7970 gigahertz
toxic addition card we'll see you guys
back here on tech of tomorrow with more
7680 by 1440 goodness tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
