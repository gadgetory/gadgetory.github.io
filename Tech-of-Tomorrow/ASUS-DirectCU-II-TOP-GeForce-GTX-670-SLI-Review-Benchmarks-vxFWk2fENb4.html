those out there who just like tech
it's me Elric back here once again the
Technodrome our YouTube channel to bring
you guys a really cool video of the Aizu
s-- GTX 670 that's right this is they're
really unique version it is their direct
cu2 version you can see I've got two -
these cards behind me and not only these
cards the direct see you to their top
cards as well which means they're geared
for overclocking so before we actually
jump in and start showing you guys the
rest of the video let's take a really
closer look at the test station
all right folks so before we jump into
the video let's take a look at the test
station now every good test ation starts
out with its motherboard we decide to go
with the X of a nine platform and we're
using the Asus Republic of gamers this
is their rampage for extreme motherboard
all kinds of features LGA 2011 you guys
can see it's all laid out nicely we're
using a water-cooled that you can see
over to my right here this is the
standard Intel water cooler ruining the
i7 38:20 this is a four core cpu running
at 3.6 gigahertz is its standard rate
next up is the memory this is from
Patriot this is the division 4 this is a
32 gigabyte kit of ddr3 memory XMP
profile running at 1866 megahertz down
here below that we have our power supply
this is a silverstone 1200 watt modular
one release semi modular now right here
we have the Aces Zone our essence sound
card I hooked this up to spin this thing
and it sounds incredible after that we
have the two video cards these are
obviously the Asus GTX 670 Direct see
you two top cards they require dual six
pin power connections we have those
right here they connect right up here on
the top you can see all the heat pipes
running across the top right here over
here we have a single sli connection now
we'll get onto the hard drives and stuff
down below here I decide to go with all
SSD drives so I've got a couple of them
hooked up here on the front and for my
standard drive I've got the Intel 520
series SSD this is the 240 gigabyte
model I actually end up my ocz octane
drive so we could actually get a better
look at it goes in the back of the
system this is a 512 gives me plenty of
room for all my games and all the stuff
that I'm doing so this is our test
station folks let's jump in now and
let's show you guys how we actually do
our gaming tests alright folks not you
guys have seen the test station
everything else before we actually go
into benchmarks we're gonna show you a
couple different things here so we'll go
a lot of explanation for the video card
driver it's 300
one for two this is the very latest
video car driver that you can get over
Nvidia so if you've got a card out there
and you've brought it from any other
manufacturer make sure as soon as you
install the video cards restart your
system and go in that you download the
driver and then install it so right here
I'm going to agree and continue
I'm just going to use an Express
installation you guys can see this on
the screen right here and now I'm going
to install the driver so after we
install the driver give me just a second
and we'll be back and we'll talk about
some of the testing moving forward now
as soon as you jump into the Windows
environment the very first thing you're
going to want to do is hop into your
Nvidia control panel you're gonna want
to do this because you want to make sure
that your cards are set up for maximum
SLI performance so here you can see
right here in this window when you first
enable the cards they're not set it's
disabled then with a click of a mouse
button the screen changes and then you
have it enabled that's the very first
thing that we did also next we ran fur
mark to test the heat of the cards we
set it for 2560 by 1600 for the
benchmark burnin that we're gonna do but
as far as just the testing goes we use
the straight up test which is 1080 which
is 1920 by 1080 which gives us the heat
of the cards so we ran that you can see
that both cards are getting hotter than
71 Celsius now as far as the games go we
set everything to its maximum
performance value first of all we're
gonna show you Batmen you guys can see
here we set everything to its highest
value screen size at 25 16 everything's
set to as high as it can be now we're
gonna jump in and we're gonna show you
one of the actual test videos that we
use we use Metro 2033 you guys can see
this here on the screen we have
everything set to its highest value and
we'll go ahead and for this particular
one we'll go ahead and run it and let
you guys see it
you guys can see up here in the corner
this shows all the frames per second
all right folks
so we're not going to show you every
test but I just thought it better if we
complained at least one of the tests to
you guys so you guys can see right here
average frame rates was 40 for maximum
frame rates 180 4.57 and the minimum
frame rates was 7 point 61 now this was
run with this at 2560 by 1600 with all
the bells and whistles set to its
highest we're gonna be running on two
resolutions 2560 by 1600 and 1920 by
1080 so that said let's jump into the
benchmark song and see the rest of the
benchmarks
all right folks we got to rock out man 2
the benchmark song always loved that you
guys can see that these two cards in sli
mode performed very very fast now they
also run pretty cool didn't get hotter
than 71 Celsius which i think is pretty
well also now we're going to talk about
another aspect of a car before we get to
the conclusion this is a Zeus's GPU
tweak which allows you to go in and do a
lot of different stuff to your card
including the overclocking over here to
the right we can see that we've already
enabled gpu-z it shows you all the
different aspects of the card right now
we're currently in the tuning mode we
even go in here and manually adjust
things and if you'd like them to be your
voltage your memory whatever you want to
do you can also go online to live update
live update allows you to check all of
your drivers allows you to change your
BIOS you can see it shows both GTX 670 s
and their current bios that are on them
if I want to change them I'd click that
and it would show me if I actually was a
newer BIOS here's the settings and
here's where you're going you can set
this to your boot up on your start you
can remove or enable the skins also has
the tools you have or tuning live update
recording hotkeys you can set all around
here there are a bunch of different user
profiles actually available on the
screen profile 1 2 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 are all
available here and this is a really cool
piece of software we have another video
if you missed that go check that out in
the description below over at
motherboards org we explain how to use
GPU tweak fully and how it affects your
overclocking using one of these cards so
right folks that was a lot of
information we gave in this video sorry
this video was a little bit longer than
others but we were trying to give you a
lot of information that's why I want to
do the procedures of how we install the
card how we setup the SLI how we do our
testing our test station all that other
stuff it's just a lot of information but
we want you guys to have that now at the
end of the day these cards go from
anywhere from five hundred to about four
hundred and sixty dollars online
so to get a pair of them an SLI is going
to cost you around $1,000
but you also get a shitload of power
also the drexy you top cards have a lot
of flexibility as far as overclocking
all the scores that we showed you today
we're with the GPU tweak and able to
allow the cards to do their automatic
overclocking you guys can see that all
of the scores are very high compared to
other cards out there these things also
run relatively cool GPU tweak runs
really well it's simple to use so at the
end of the day you get a pair of cards
that run very very fast they'll play any
game you want any resolution you want
including multi monitor technology since
they have so much stuff banged into them
I know they're a little bit costly but
if you're a fan of Nvidia cards and you
like this type of thing you're not gonna
care about the money
you're only gonna care about the
performance so great performance very
cool GPU tweak aces support and warranty
I gotta say that senators choice here on
TECA tomorrow see Oh see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
