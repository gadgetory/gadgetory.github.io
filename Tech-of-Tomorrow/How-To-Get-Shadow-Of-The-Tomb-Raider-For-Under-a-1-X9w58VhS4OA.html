is going to be one very exciting week

you know why they calling it shadow of
the Tomb Raider does lore crop like have

that but check it out since the game is
that and I know all kinds of people want
to get their hands on this especially
the guys who are going out and getting
r-tx card and stuff they're really
wanting to get their hands on those
brand new games so check it out we're
going to give a copy away to you the
viewers that's right and I know some
people hate Twitter they go oh my god I
hate Twitter like I don't use Twitter
I'm sorry I can't please everybody

things on Twitter so I'm gonna have a

it's a really great game it actually
even has an inside can benchmark so for
doing benchmarking and stuff like that
for game testing it's a really cool card
the game looked even great really on an
AMD card like we started playing the
game while we were doing the 64 and the
56 bit testing and the game just looked
amazing we're gonna be getting into the
art stuff later on this afternoon and
seeing how that looks but honestly the
game looks great on an AMD card and this
is with none of you know the spectacular
RT X features that are supposed to be
out there to make this game like be even
more realistic so I really can't wait to
do that but you guys can see gameplay
looks really nice in-game is fun the
graphics are nice there's no blurriness
that the characters all look well drawn
out so far just visually
this has been a very pleasing game I
can't wait to actually get in and play
it for more hours on end and doing it so
