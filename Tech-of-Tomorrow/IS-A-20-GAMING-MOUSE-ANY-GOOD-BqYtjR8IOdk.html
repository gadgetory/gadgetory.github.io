their new premier pro SP 920 SSDs
feature blazing fast speeds and size of
the one terabyte for more information
check out the link below now if you guys
want to see more of these budget gaming
products I want to see your guys's
comments down below and I want you guys
to go Chuck Norris on that mouse button
hey what's up everybody
Elric here on tech of Dammam now I know
that almost all my fans out there are
gamers and that gaming gear can cost a
lot of money so with that said we're
here to find out this 20 dollar gaming
mouse is any good
so what is this I got in my hand this is
the e-blue mazer Wireless Gaming Mouse
for 20 bucks so this little monster
features wireless 2.4 gigahertz
transmissions and connects via a USB
dongle now as far as the range goes this
thing goes from 6 to 15 meters which is
actually plenty of range for your gaming
mouse to work this thing sizes in at 124
by 85 by 38 millimeters and weighs 88
grams now one thing to take note of
though the weight is not adjustable but
it actually feels pretty good and for me
I was actually totally stoked at how
this thing fit in my hand I have what I
would call pretty much a medium little
fat hand and this thing fits perfect in
my hand now as far as the buttons go it
features a six button design left right
the center scroll wheel to side
multimedia buttons and a dpi button
which is located in the middle another
thing to take note of though the DPI
button doesn't actually show you what
it's changing but it is adjustable from
five to 12 to 18 to 2500 dpi which is
actually quite enough for most gamers as
far as power goes this thing just uses
two double-a batteries if you're going
to be using it a lot we suggest using
rechargeable batteries and we'll have a
couple link down below that like button
which are very affordable for you to
choose from now as far as operating
modes go you get actually a couple you
have on with lights and then you have on
with no lights you don't want to disturb
anybody or wake them up and then you'll
have off with obviously means there's
not going to be any lights whatsoever so
that about wraps it up folks as far as
features go and down below that like
button will have all the information for
you can purchase one of these for
yourself now as far as my personal
gaming experience goes I had absolutely
no problems with this whatsoever I'm not
the kind of guy who likes to program his
mouse so programmable buttons to me mean
nothing the fact that it fits in my hand
very well is awesome and this thing
actually worked on both my PC and my Mac
seamlessly without problem so I have to
say for $20 this is a solid deal now
maybe longevity the product may not be
that great since is made in China and
you know it's kind of a new company but
for 20 bucks what have you really got to
lose I really hope that you guys like
this
and if you guys want to see more budget
gaming stuff make sure you guys leave a

please go Chuck Norris on that like
button so you know that you appreciate
