to the channel glad to see you guys here
now what's going on today is we got a
laptop from this company they're called
cleveo now these particular guys they
only OAM things which means they don't
sell things directly underneath their
name but there are a lot of different
models out there from this company now
the one that we're gonna show you today
is actually a pretty cool model there
are a couple of things I don't like
about it we'll talk about that later on
the video but overall it's a pretty
doggone nice laptop we'll also have
links at the end of the video to models
that are very similar but the exact one
that we're looking at today it's not yet
on the market or probably be really soon
but it's really a nice laptop has 4k
gaming Sound Blaster software on there
that creates the eex effect on the
latest software from windows because at
a certain time when Windows shifted into
Vista 7 and 10 they took out some of the
code that allowed EA X to be in there
and with the software you have now it's
going to put all that stuff back in
there allowing all kinds of your older
games to have EA X totally built into
the system which means when your listen
to your headphones you're gonna get that
totally surrounding thing that you want
to get you know the experience of
footsteps behind you hearing what's
coming at you all that will be in the
cans and I think that's pretty cool for
gamers but what that said though let's
jump in real quick let's check out the
laptop let's check out its specs let's
see the performance and let's see at the
end of the day if you be willing to
spend your hard-earned cash
to grab one of these bad boys for your
travel bag alright folks so let's just
check out the laptop first of all you
guys are gonna see and it's a 15-inch
screen which features full 4k that's
right so it's 3840 by 2160 all on a nice
laptop screen it's at 60 Hertz and
believe me it looks very very nice
because check it out
it also has G sync built inside the
laptop so right along with your video
card you get that G sync technology
which means that none of your games are
gonna have any rips any tearing
whatsoever when you're game and if you
gamers out there know what that is you
know that's really nice technology also
powering up that screen is a six
gigabyte GTX 1060 video card also
underneath the hood is 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory we running at 2400 megahertz
an Intel Core i7 78 20 HK CPU featuring
four cores eight threads a 2.9 gigahertz
base frequency and an amazing 3.9
gigahertz turbo frequency I have to say
that's a pretty damn nice boost right
one thing really nice about this CPU
however is it only has a TDP of 45 watts
which means when you're up playing your
laptop the bottom may get a little bit
warm but it's not gonna get so damn hot
that you can't hold it in your hands
like I said earlier there were a couple
of things that I really didn't like
about this particular model and the 500
gigabyte standard hard drive is one of
them I mean come on and at least a one
terabyte drive should be in this and if
not something like you know a small hard
drive with a you know a terabyte SSD
with it but just a standard 500 gigabyte
hard drive I find that to be a caveat
for me I mean some people like we do it
for our testing and store all their
games an external hard drive but
honestly if you want to have some that
you can take around with you everywhere
and not have a bunch of external baggage
no no no having a 500 gigabyte hard
drive to me is kind of an Achilles heel
in this particular model let me know
what you think as far as connections go
on the right hand side we first see all
the audio connections then we see an SD
card slot 2 USB 3.0 ports the land port
and all the way at the top you guys can
see the Kensington lock on something
like this you probably definitely want
to keep it locked up if it's out in
public on the left-hand side we see two
more USB 3.0 ports next up a USB type-c
to display ports for external monitors
and HDMI port for another external
monitor and then the power port for your
power connection now in the bottom this
particular unit you guys can see that
there are a lot of different slits
inside the laptop that's to help take
the heat away from the CPU and the GPU
and keep your laptop running cool and
down at the bottom you guys can also see
there are two built-in subwoofers
supposedly to give big booming sound but
it really wasn't that booming as we all
know RGB has become the latest thing
it's like the cool thing to have in your
computer and guess what yep this
particular model has RGB it's all in the
keyboard keys which are totally backlit
and look really nice in a dark room and
you can see them all very very clearly
now this is something I'm gonna tell you
guys which is my idea
I hate
boards that sit flat like that so I've
gone ahead and submitted my patent to
have a keyboard that actually lifts up
on the laptop and so if you don't laptop
but sorry laptops if you don't know what
that means I'll explain to you hold on
you guys see how the keyboard is totally
flat like this right that's completely
uncomfortable for me totally
so I've invented a thing to actually
make the keyboard pop out and lift up so
that way when you're typing on the
keyboard it's at a much more ergonomic
level and I think when they start
implementing this and putting it into
laptops it's gonna be much more
comfortable for people all around the
world tell me what you think because I
know there's a lot of other people that
agree with me but don't try to steal my
idea cuz like I said I've already
patented trackpads or something that I
also have really never been a big fan of
I'll admit it when I go on a trip even
if I have a laptop that has a trackpad I
don't care man I'm taking a separate
Mouse when I'm gaming period that's just
how I am this particular one does I will
say work a lot better than most usually
I hate them so bad that I wanted to
throw my frickin laptop across the room
within a few minutes but this one is
pretty accurate it works good also
something I want to mention that's
really important to me may not to you if
you're a total gamer but to me is a very
important feature of a laptop the text
on this thing is amazing honestly my
Acer predator monitor basically supposed
to be the same thing right g-sync
technology I have even a better video
card my text looks like dog I can
barely read it as blurry it looks broke
up the text on this laptop is super damn
clean I have to say the text on this is
a if I had two more arms I'd give it
four fricking thumbs up because that's
one of my favorite things about this
laptop the text is unbelievably clear
you can see it no matter where you're at
and to me that's an important feature
and like I said if you're just a gamer
you might not give it crap but honestly
if you surf the net and do a lot of
stuff why isn't clear text better than
blurry text and that's something I
really like about this laptop now we're
gonna jump right now into the scoring
and all this stuff obviously we use
Windows 10 with the latest upgrades and
all that stuff we use the latest
everything that we can get our hands on
the latest drivers that are available to
time our testing and sometimes believe
me I guys will test them you go hey man
that's not the latest driver well that's
it's happened because we'll test
something and then two days later
they'll come up the new driver I'm not
gonna just keep stopping and retesting
forever the video would never ever come
out but with that said though
let's now let's jump in and let's check
out how this thing performs we omitted
the 1440 scores because the resolution
on this thing for 1440 was just freakin
wack it's made for 4k or 1920 and 1080
and that's what we tested it at so let's
rock out to the benchmark song and let's
check out the scores let's rock
as far as temperatures go the I 778 20
HK had a minimum temperature of 46
Celsius and a maximum of 89 Celsius and
the GTX 1060 got as hot as 75 Celsius on
Macs and at 49 on minimum so all right
there you have it the specs the scores
the temps all of that good stuff now
before I bounce out here I want to talk
to you guys about one more aspect about
this laptop that's really cool like I
said before the realtek audio is
powering the sound but on top of that is
a layer of creative software and it's
really cool they have two different
things inside of here they have creative
alchemy now what alchemy does is it
allows you to go ahead and hear all of
those e^x sounds from older games on
your Windows 10 Windows 7 or Vista
computer because something happened when
they transitioned and they remove
something out of it were those
particular games in newer stuff don't
give you that full IX experience but now
with alchemy you can just click a button
and all that e^x wonderful stuff inside
your headphones will be back and if you
have obviously a 7.1 5.1 surround sound
at your house it'll do the same thing
but I think most people are gonna have a
laptop are probably going to be using
headphones for that full surround sound
deal they also have something inside
which we've talked about before in
another video which is their Kinect
stuff now Kinect is pretty cool because
inside there you can totally customize
your audio environment there's all kinds
of things for watching movies for
playing games for changing your voice
for changing the equalization I mean
honestly there are just so many ways to
customize your sound environment in that
I think you'll spend a lot of time in
there just playing around stuff and
hearing the different things that it has
to offer because like with the sound
warping thing like you can be in a game
playing and initialize this and it'll
make your voice sound like Darth Vader
like Tweety Bird I mean you can have a
lot of fun screwin around with this type
of software when you're in game so
overall if you guys are audio buffs and
you're looking for that little bit of an
edge and software you know that's gonna
create a nice you know audio environment
for you then this creative stuff is
something I think you'll really like
about this particular unit now overall
probably the biggest caveat to this
laptop no matter who they're gonna OEM
it to is going to be priced because well
I'm looking for all these models even
ones roughly
you are all pretty pricey because they
all have you know awesome features you
guys know Nvidia charges for the g-sync
thing so you're either got to pay for
that g-sync technology all that ddr4
memory having the latest you know eighth
generation CPUs from Intel in there all
these things are the latest and greatest
and you guys all know it's technology
comes out when it first comes out it's
fricken pricey so they're going to get
you for that money now you probably can
find other lower end models from these
guys that have a little bit less specs
they'll still probably play games pretty
good for a little bit less money but if
you want a laptop it's totally badass
has a lot of features and it's gonna
play your games even at 4k hey man these
are pretty cool models and although it
didn't play 4k at 60 frames per second
totally it was around 30 to 40 most the
time still on a laptop being able to
play 4k like that's still pretty cool
and you can always drop it down to 1080
and you guys can see those frame rates
just jump up like a mother so at the end
of the day if you want an awesome laptop
it's gonna cost you a little bit of
money 500 gigabyte hard drive not really
digging that too much but you can always
put it on an external drive and be up
and going wherever you want it's just up
to you
I'm Elric like usual like I said we'll
have some links down below like button
that will show you some different models
for you to choose from and I hope you
guys like this video in the way we
presented it so peace out we'll see you
guys back there on teka tomorrow for
more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
