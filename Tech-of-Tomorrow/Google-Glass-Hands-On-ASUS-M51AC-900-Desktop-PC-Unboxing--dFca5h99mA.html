techyv tomorrow I'm Miller cure host and
today we're going to take a look at
something very interesting we're
actually going to take a look at it in a
kind of a different way so what I have
here to my left is a complete system by
the people over at Asus now this is
their new M series and this is the m50
one that we have here we'll get to the
exact nomenclature in a minute but this
thing is gonna come to market at about
eight hundred ninety nine dollars and
it's completely built and distributed by
Asus direct now I have on these glasses
on my face right here these are the
Google glass and my buddy over at TLD
today they actually use these things to
unbox some kind of Nexus 7 thing and he
goes hey dude I think it'd be kind of
cool maybe you usually would like it if
you guys filmed an unboxing so today I'm
gonna film the unboxing of this through
the Google glass and all admit it's a
bit odd for me because these guys mainly
wear these things not even the lenses
but for me that was odd I'm saying put
the lenses on it look normal so let's go
let's check out what comes inside this
box and what the system is all about
from the people over at a soup
alright folks so check it out here we go
and unboxing through Google glass so
we're gonna first start off with the box
you guys can see it from the top it's
got their eco box which is made out of a
bunch of recycled stuff so they're
saving the planet by that we'll just
keep moving down we see desktop PC
obviously the Asus name but now let's
flip it around to the side now over here
is what's gonna be the most important
stuff
imma trying to get up here with the
glasses so you guys can see everything
I'll start off right here I'll slowly
scroll my way down where you guys can
see all that and then over to the other
side you guys can see the intel
nomenclature the m-series and then we
can clearly see what the model number is
right there the m51
AC US 0 1 5 s now we'll have a bunch of
different links to model numbers I'm not
sure if this exact one is hit over on
Amazon or anywhere yet but we'll see
there as we go on let's flip it around
again you guys can see it's just the box
here nothing too exciting about that
whipping around the other side it's just
the box yeah yeah yeah there's my
address whoop-dee-doo so let's flip it
let's turn to the side here cuz we're
doing this differently so and this is
different for me too
so go ahead and take the knife make a
nice little slit right down the side
here come around to the side right here
again make another quick incision down
the side I have to admit that going
through these glasses because I'm trying
to concentrate it's a little different
for me and right there just almost made
a boo-boo we could add a nice little cut
of my finger on the video that would
have been fun right lovely stuff so make
sure I keep that blade away from me it's
like cut this thing pop the cap now as I
pop it you guys can see inside the box
there is another box and this is all the
accessories probably is there a keyboard
let's see what's in here
so look down at this thing pop little
tab here whoops Oh made a boo-boo rip
the cardboard trying to think and do too
many things at once so ok obviously
we'll take that out I'll just set that
box off the side we get the Asus
keyboard let's go ahead and take that
completely out of its packaging it's a
wired little keyboard nice easy keys
though all the way down I feel really
very very
kind of spongy and Mac like not exactly
like that
but sort of like that you guys can see
right there clearly the Asus name flip
it around the back of show you guys the
back now there's nothing on here to flip
this and make the keyboard go to a
different angle I'm not too stoked about
that I like my keyboard up more of an
angle but then again they're probably
just kind of kicking this in with the
system so we'll set that off to the side
you guys can see that you guys probably
got a glimpse of the cameraman and those
guys off to the other side as well cuz
they're here working let's go ahead and
try to gently remove this system go
ahead and just pull it out nice and
gently there and I know that I will send
something from my contact this right
here you guys can see this this is the
Seagate backup plus um they want to
emphasize that all of the USB
connections here can super power charge
anything not just your media devices
they can do anything so let me judge any
device it'll work fast they want to be
do some testing with this so I will so
inside the box folks you guys can see
the padding in there I've got one more
little box right here let me set that
one out to the side you guys since in
the backyard there move the system back
kind of interesting doing something
different here today so it's a all
interesting for us all so let's pop this
open right here we have the power plug
you guys can clearly see the old power
plug right there right up in my Google
glass space next up we have the mouse
squeak-squeak-squeak
bring that up till Google glass on my
face kind of really weird I mean I guess
this could traditionally or you know
untraditionally prove to be very cool
I'll go over here you won't keep seeing
my cameramen and that's the mouse got
that and then we have an additional
power cable here my guess is if you want
to put another video card in your system
or it's possible in there I wouldn't
think that since it's a 60 Ti so here's
a system now this system features and
the new core i7 4770k and eight
gigabytes of ddr3 1600 memory
8x combo reader 60 DTI videocard super
charging abilities Wi-Fi and everything
else so let's just take a look at the
elegance of the system itself so I'm
gonna start off here at the front well
slowly work my way down you guys can see
it all looks very smooth you've got USB
3.0 standard USB headphone mic
everything up here on top all your Bay's
right here open up you have all multi
card readers and all that stuff here in
the front and you can see there's card
readers for every different type here so
you have to worry about buying any kind
of external unit so for work and
productivity that's really good stuff
keep moving down flipping these little
bays oops
next Bay please let's see here ah there
we go so inside of there you guys can
see the blu-ray combo Drive you guys can
see all that I can see it I hope you
guys can see it it's inside there then
this last Bay right here is just an
extra Bay where you guys can stick it
out if you guys can actually see inside
of there but deep inside of the case
there's actually SATA connections so you
could probably mount inside of here an
SSD or some other type of device and
just have that sitting right there
looking nice and pretty beautiful all
the way down it actually feels nice and
smooth and it's very clean looking so
let's just flip it around take a look at
the side we just have their nomenclature
of their name then we'll flip it all the
way to the side so you guys can see it
better through the Google glass down
here at the bottom you guys can see we
have enjoy efficiency world-class
quality number one in reliability
designed for power media performance
with style the essentia pc hmm comes
with Windows 8 I didn't know they work
on it the essentia OPC that wasn't
actually any the nomenclature I read but
hey what the heck so let's take a look
at the rear you guys can see the power
supplies up here cable plugs in here
rear i/o
got all the different type of
connections that you need right there
and if you want to use onboard video you
have that you can use that actually in
conjunction with the video card let's
flip it around to the side
all right folks now I have a trusty
screwdriver in my hand so I'm gonna go
to head down here you guys can see I'll
go ahead and just remove this first
screw
nice and simply will set that off to the
side will appear to the top screw I'm
going to take that one off as well and
now let's see inside the m51 dunt dunt
dunt dunt uh kaboom now check it out
cable management's nice and simple you
do get a 2 terabyte SATA 3 hard drive
you guys can see it's a very small
motherboard you guys can see the memory
right there 8 gigabytes of ddr3 memory
cable management's ok in here there's no
blocking of the airflow or anything so
it's gonna be ok you guys can see
they've just got your typical fan on
there here's your video card they
actually have a support thing down here
this is great folks actually you might
not think there's anything but when this
computer ships video cards can move
around with this inside of here
protects the video card from shipping
around if you're a person who moves
around a lot and you move your sister
around a lot you're gonna appreciate
that feature so last let me just take a
look at the very top of the system for
you folks here's the very top it's nice
and smooth and elegant it's got designed
plastic in there it looks elegant this
thing does have clean looks clean design
I'd have to actually break down you know
all the parts get the motherboard number
and break it all down to you know see
what it was worth but at the end of the
day I think this is probably going to be
a pretty cool unit for people out there
who like to have their systems pre-built
we're going to now bring in the test lab
I'm gonna have Captain kevie run some
tests on it do some games on it so you
guys can see that footage as well and
then we'll see if this system is
actually worth you know the close to
nine hundred dollars that they're asking
for it some of the features like I said
before will be the really powerful USB
charging they really want me to
emphasize that to you folks this thing's
really got great Wi-Fi in it and great
charging abilities as long as a lot of
the other parts inside this isn't that
you guys know and love so I'm Mel Eric
here on TECA tomorrow bringing you guys
my first Google blast unboxing and
thanks to Jonathan to TLD and his team
for lending me these Google Glasses
things to do this all for you folks now
like usual down there below the like
button which I know you guys are going
to hit as powerfully as you can
