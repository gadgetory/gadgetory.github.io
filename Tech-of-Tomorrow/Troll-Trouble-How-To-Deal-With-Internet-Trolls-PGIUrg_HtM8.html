thought I'd do a video about something a
little bit different like normally I
always bring you guys tech videos and
all that stuff but that today I thought
I'd do a different videos first time
you've ever watched a channel ever then
welcome to techyv tomorrow I'm hour this
is my dog buddy
mr. Jesus point oh behind the Camrys our
editor and all that stuff so you don't
know the team that's our team and
basically today's video I thought I'd
make a video about honestly how to
behave and how to address yourself
online especially like on YouTube
because everybody knows that trolls have
become so powerful that people have
actually shut down their sites and just
completely given up on YouTube due to
trolls and it's it's really bad and
first of all I want to dresses myself
personally I want to apologize when I
lost motherboard's org and I was really
sick and I my feet cut off you know I
started looking at trolls as my personal
enemy and I started attacking them and
cutting them out and threatening them
and doing all kinds of stupid stuff that
I should have never ever ever done so
first of all I just want to apologize to
all you people out there even though you
guys have sent me death threats and told
me how terrible I am how better you are
that everything that you do than I do I
should have never responded to you guys
in kind I should have ignored you so I
apologize I was not the better man but
the thing is trolls you cannot do
anything with them you cannot like
respond to them in crazy ways the only
way that you can really respond to them
at all is in a sarcastic joking manner
with something positive and turn their
thing around if you can't take the
comment that much needle eat the comment
otherwise you need to reply with
something witty and if they call you out
on something and you're wrong just be a
man about it and say hey I was wrong and
apologize and say you'll do better next
time it said I'll put the dog down he
gets spicy after a while there when
patience sometimes sitting on my lap I
think he wants to be the star of the
show and just doesn't know how to talk
yet he's learning though trust me so
honestly I just want to make this video
today to tell you guys that if you're
having troll trouble don't respond
crazily to them I've seen a lot of sites
recently honestly go completely out give
up and just say hey
not doing my side anymore screw YouTube
I can't handle the trolls honestly it
hurt me hurt me a lot I used to get a
lot better traffic and stuff more views
and stuff than everything else before I
put my head up my ass and made a video
and stuff and I did stuff to trolls out
there making them giving myself
attention to them there's one thing I
want you to think about trolls send you
a message puts it on your channel or
whatever and you respond to and you say
something totally creative that person
like all the people out there usually
see is what you say to them they never
see the original message from that
person that's never displayed it makes
you look like a crazy person this has
happened to that cake lady
remember that lady who's out there think
she was in Arizona Nevada or something
the big cake thing she like talked to
all kinds of crap went online attacking
all of her thing being sane people oh
we're so keeping awesome you have to
respect this well honestly you don't
have to respect me it's my job to earn
your respect and when I screw up and I
do something hey maybe I deserve the
troll it's up to me to be the better man
so for all you people out there
seriously stop beating them say
something nice to them and if you can't
take their comment whatsoever just
simply delete their comment and ban them
off your channel if you don't ever want
to see them again I'm gonna tell you how
I do it okay
if the person is repeatedly leaving a
bunch of psychotic messages I go and I
take a look over on their page now I see
their page that all they're doing is
leaving psychotic messages on a bunch of
other people's pages then I just go
ahead and I delete them and I ban them
and get rid of them because obviously
they're doing nothing but trolling if I
go look at a person's page and I see
they generally are just maybe making it
common and not mean to come across like
a troll I might fleet the comment or
just cinnamon essence matches in saying
hey man like I don't really like that
kind of stuff but you cannot threaten
these people you cannot tell them how
great you are like Scott Grove and blow
my mind I read some of the message like
oh we I thought some of mine were bad
who we yeah these are the craziest ones
and now his channels gone so I love all
you folks I appreciate you I try to do
my best during your guys respect you
know I know I'm not the youngest guy in
the planet some you guys say oh he's an
old guy trying to
cool but you know wisely I'm not an old
guy being cool I'm just a guy who's cool
that's all there is to it and no matter
what you think I know I'm a cool person
like my friends like me I'm into music I
have a good time with my life so if you
want to hate me because you don't like
something in my video that's all cool to
you but if you leave the nasty comments
I'm either gonna respond with a smile
delete or ban you you're not gonna ever
get me in the situation where I'm gonna
send you nasty messages and stuff giving
you control of my life so you can take
it and run around the web making me look
like a total crazy person like I went on
dalliances page I apologize some of you
people there were a few to post out
there I just finally eventually gave up
and made this video so anybody out there
you're watching this I was one of those
people out there and you were when those
trolls who did it
please humbly accept my apologies I ask
for your forgiveness and I hope the rest
you can honestly learn from my mistakes
I'm Eric this is Tekken tomorrow hey if
you want to leave a troll comment down
below I give you this one chance to be
an ultra troll so leave your comment
otherwise me and buddy the dog we got
better things to do we have better
things to do in fact I think we're
installing some kind of awesome cool
digital doorbell so I'm off to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
