once again the tech go tomorrow YouTube
challenger bring you the unboxing and
overview of the brand new google nexus
10 you guys have all heard about it is
like the very first 2560 by 1600 screen
to ever hit the portable market let's
jump in and let's check out this awesome
new product alright folks like every
unboxing we have the box the front and
then we have the back of the box now i
actually had opened this up previously
to familiarize myself this a little bit
better so give you guys a better
unboxing and we could just jump into
things kind of left it the same but it
was though so all the plastic and
everything is still on it here and we'll
go ahead and pull this out good and
remove the front now in the front 2560
by 1600 300 pixel per square inch 10
inch screen out this is better than
anything that we can see even an apple
product even their lateness retina type
stuff is not as good or as dense as this
this thing's actually better than even
my 30 inch dell monitor so let's flip it
around go ahead and remove the plastic
off the back where you can see once
again says nexus by Samsung get it and
peel off the plastic up here there are
two cameras a five megapixel camera and
a 1.9 megapixel camera go ahead and flip
it around right here we have the micro
HDMI connector I'm going to spill in it
around here here we see the volume
rocker bars the power on which I'll just
go ahead and do now anyways we spin it
around flip it up to the top micro USB
headphone Pogo charger now up on top
here are the speakers so your sounds all
going to come from up here kind of going
through this thing over here now we'll
do a little demo so now let's go ahead
and unlock it
give you guys a google chrome demo head
over to tech of tomorrow alright folks
so here we use the Google you see we're
on the tech of tomorrow here's our
website when the latest reviews we did
right here was on the Maximus five
extreme then when they're you guys can
see it's got plenty of viewing room
everything is very very crystal clear
now this has an arm a 15 CPU and a
Mallee t 60 for GPU which are all part
of the Exynos 5 dual core has 16
gigabytes of internal storage and 2
gigabytes of RAM has all kinds of Wi-Fi
connectivity but to me really the
biggest thing about this is this screen
2560 by 1600 300 pixels per square inch
in the old days even trying to render
something like this in Photoshop but it
took a whole bunch of time so this is
actually quite amazing you guys have
heard me say it before I can barely see
this thing is so clear and even though
I'm out of camera range and I'm looking
at it from a completely sideways angle
the screen is still totally completely
clear and that's pretty awesome so that
means if you're watching a movie or
something on here you got your friends
standing around by your side they're
actually going to be able to see this
very clearly themselves so now that said
let's just hop back out and let's
continue on and let's look at the
accessories package go ahead and set
this off to the side a little bit more
inside the box here go ahead and open it
up we have our micro USB to USB cable
we have the power adapter plug adapter
and then we have the actual plug itself
where the USB goes here and this thing
very interestingly plugs into here so
check this out stick this into here and
then voila there's your plug want to
take it out remove it out it also seems
like the Pogo little adapter is missing
from in here I don't see that I do
whatever see the quick start guide and
the warranty guide let me keep
dismembering the box and maybe there's
some other accessories in here but so
far I don't see them and nope that is it
so there's actually no Pogo accessories
in there whatsoever just what you see
right there on the table right here I
also folks was able to borrow real
quickly and get my hands on the nexus
for the phone now I'm not going to
really do too much on this but I will
just turn on lets you guys see it see
the interface once again you see your
google for searching and everything much
smaller screen obviously but this is the
foam version i'll actually have some
comparisons on this as we come up in the
later days but for now I just borrowed
it so i can get familiar with it alright
folks thanks very much for watching I
appreciate your views you guys know what
to do if you guys like the video make
sure you hit that like button and show
me some love we have all kinds of
contests as you guys have seen we've got
all kinds of stuff coming up so make
sure you're subscribed to the channel
look up for all kinds of comparisons
where I compare this phone to others and
we see what you want to buy at the end
of the day here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
