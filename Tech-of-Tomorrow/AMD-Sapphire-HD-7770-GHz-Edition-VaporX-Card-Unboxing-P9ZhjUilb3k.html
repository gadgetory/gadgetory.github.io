taking tomorrow to bring you guys a nice
new unboxing now you guys are like a
indeed there's gonna be something
special for you guys and those of you
like sapphire even better this is the
new sapphire this is their 7770 we and
what kind of edition is it well you can
see behind me it's the vapor x edition
now there's a girl on the cover as well
she's wearing shitty little things she's
cold I didn't see like you know a little
you know hardness of any kind of little
headlights going off or anything so she
must gonna be that goal but she's worn a
suit back there so anyways let's see
what comes in this box and what's so
special about this new card from the
people over at sapphire it's getting
chilly in here
all right so first off we're gonna open
this thing with my trusty knife oh wait
that's that I know this is a noise
anyways check it out when you see the
from the box this is the sapphire
sapphire HD 7770 this is the gigahertz
edition vapor-x cooling edition have a
couple additions all rolled into one we
see the girl in the cold suit but it's
well pad you don't get any headlights or
anything I'm kind of bummed out about
that that would've been exciting one
gigabyte gddr5 memory
it's the overclocked edition as well
there's a lot of additions in this card
it's got more additions than a limited
edition you know I'm saying
HDMI high speed we guys know that of
everything these days it has an HDMI
connector usually it's really important
28 nanometer process these are some of
the features on the front flip burn the
back of the box just so you guys can see
it got awards in the card the box the
girl once again she's in a pose she's
like looking at me like what's up bitch
you want to mess with me in the call I
can cut you alright I'm just messing
around guys so anyways for the unboxing
go ahead I'll take my little trusty
knife make an incision here don't try
this at home I am a doctor after that
we'll pop the cap open get the box out
now we'll see my famous thing of opening
the box upside down but I'm gonna open
it up and once again like always it's
upside down see that I'm famous for that
you upside down unboxing I should just
call it that today's unboxing is the
upside down unboxing alright so here we
see inside of the nice brown cardboard
we have lots of cool looking plastic
with stop you must connect the graph
board the computer's power supply
warning warning danger Will Robinson
show my age their connectors out all the
little accessories the accessories that
come inside there little quick peek at
the card oh yeah tease me please man
alright good the way real quick more
stuff here in the bottom so let's get
all that stuff out of here once again
we'll just throw stuff the cameraman oh
he might not use sound effects oh
they're pretty loud on it so so we've
got right up the bat we have the HDMI
cable one HDMI cable molex to 6-pin DVI
to VGA got the case badge the driver CD
cameron's love this today
sapphire quick installation ride that's
right
got him every time - here it is the
sapphire sapphire tech this is their
little Club you joined this club you
become an instant gang member if you
ever get into a fight all you do is call
fun or a bunch of guys - in sapphire
clubs they were there to back you up on
your dog no I'm just kidding but
there's a little card here meant when
you see that but hit that part now I'll
stop tossing stuff the cameraman he's
looking at me like with an evil look and
it's lucky that I though on the other
hand have the knife remember the Cameron
I've got the knife all right now start
off the further card which there's a
nice little plastic mesh here I will go
ahead and remove this you get bit up
closer you guys can hear this let me get
to the mic - you get that I'm gonna do
this so we can hear what it sounds like
to rip the plastic off let's start out
by taking the measuring tape most cards
are actually about 9 inches long some
are shorter but that's the average this
one is exactly 9 inches long somewhat of
a lady pleaser I'm sure they prefer a 10
or 11 inch card better but hey you know
what it's the average
oh man the camera says you can't please
them all damn that's harsh feel bad for
those guys here we go we got 4 inches as
far as the width goes it's also a dual
slot design most cards are these days
probably gonna be about an inch an inch
and a half and with it's about what it
is engine and width so we'll flip back
around we can check out the twin fans in
the front here nice and spinning the
vapor-x
technology is all underneath the car we
can't really see that as I turn the car
to the side we can start to see some of
the vapor-x cooling it's evident right
here in the heat pipe running on the
side of the card we can also see where
the cooler connects to the GPU right in
there as well flip it down this is the
PCI as a look at the bottom here we can
see the pcie 3.0 connection I'm gonna
flip it around again show you guys the
back we have one single 6 pin 75 watt
power connector right there you guys saw
that inside of the kit it actually came
with the cable if you don't have that
that'll make it easier on people old
power supplies off the side we see the
sapphire logo then we're gonna flip it
around the back of the PCB now this is
an interesting colored PCB now you guys
always complain about the blue ones I
don't
I'm going colorblind but this thing just
I don't know it looks Bluegreen to me
this was almost like a card that got
pulled up out of the sea but I like it
now you guys always bitch about the PCB
color but that doesn't matter to me
I like this one it looks cool it's
different if you want to remove it and
use some kind of alternate cooling you
just be removing these screws right here
and popping it off the front so last but
not least let's take a look at the rear
i/o two DVI cables one HDMI and one
standard DisplayPort for me honestly
folks this is my favorite type of rilin
any card because usually people have a
lot of DVI stuff but I like having a
standard DisplayPort and a standard HDMI
I hate when they put the many things in
there a lot of people have those
adapters inside of their cards I'm not
really a favorite of it this is the way
I like it so I can't show you everything
in the box I threw it off the Cameron
but that was it folks today we brought
you a tech go tomorrow the new unboxing
of the South Fire HD 7770 vapor-x
edition card look for the full review
very soon I'll be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
