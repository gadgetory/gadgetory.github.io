Internet it's me your host our embarrass
gonna take her tomorrow channel with my
co-sponsor today buddy the dog mr. buddy

everybody so today we're gonna bring you
guys something cool you guys all know
coolermaster famous for their half
series of cases we've got a new one of
those came out real soon for you folks
as well but today we're gonna be taking
a look at one of their latest keyboards
from their awesome CM storm series of
stuff now this is a brand new keyboard
this is their new quickfire gaming
keyboard this thing's pretty awesome
tabled being the unboxing and the first
look of this little thing which i
actually have over here that said before
the dog starts licking my face let's
jump to the next scene and thus to be
actual unboxing first look shall we
alright mean but you'll see in a second
alright folks like every unboxing first
thing comes the box let's just talk a
little bit about the features this thing
has high durability gold-plated cherry
MX switches that are rated for over 50
million keystrokes pretty impressive
stuff that means also if you're hitting
a lot of keys a lot of times they're not
going to go bad on you also multimedia
control keys for convenient sound
control I mean you're going to go to
control your saturday from the keyboard
itself nothing new there but should be
cool nkr oh and USB mode now the NDA are
only that's why was talking about a
minute ago mkr modes when you get all
kinds of keys like when you're doing
combination moves and stuff like that
and with nkr okies you won't have any
problem with the thing freezing up or
anything like that that's a very
important feature for those people who
play the multimedia online games or
they're doing a bunch of magic spells
and stuff like that very important stuff
also this thing has 14 karat gold plated
ultra-low latency USB plugs a storm key
that deactivates the Windows key a
thousand Hertz driverless pauling one
millisecond response time on the keys
very very fast red backlighting for
gaming key clusters strong braided cable
to protect the connections and last but
not least premium non-slip rubber
coating this thing is all supposed to
have totally laser etch keys and a lot
of other cool stuff all right you guys
are Cena for the box real quick I'll
just jump around flip to the back to see
you guys can see this show some of those
features and everything there I've got a
couple of knives here knife number one
we're going to do a dual little thing
here knock number two she one
interesting put the little thing around
so you've got 20 plastic tabs here when
you try to do this off stuff moving the
wall guy do it 120 I did it cool I'll
underneath the knives I'll set those off
to the side so the cameramen doesn't cut
himself or I don't cut myself or someone
does it get cut okay alright so we're
open it up she got a nice plastic
protector right here take this go ahead
and just pull the keyboard out see where
else we got in here alright well we've
got that let the plastic thing little
sound effects here as I toss it off the
side oh hey it came back at me Arliss
it again stay over there you're not a
boomerang your piece of plastic put in
your place all right quickfire pro Quick
Start Guide mechanical gaming keyboard
to show some different key strokes in
there this one's also the brown version
I guess there's going to be different
models this for different regions like I
guess if you live in China stuff you get
a different one OOP that one sliding up
the desk alright so underneath here
cable management or like sir I haven't
forgot about this you guys really school
being this a long time ago this is to
remove the keys that's right to remove
and replace the keys it's you to that or
it's the Gaius power ranger ring
I've ever seen in my life one of the
other I think it's that though so here's
the cable for playing in the keyboard
let me go ahead and just do wire it
we'll see how long it is it looks pretty
tall I mean I'm 6 feet tall so I think
this is a six-foot-long cable-- nice
gold plated ends there let's move on
here is the actual keyboard itself a
nice packaging we shall remove it now
dun dun dun dun dun dun oh no alright so
let's check this bad boy out let me get
an angle here with a camera and get some
really cool shots right there you guys
can see the keyboards laid out just like
pretty much like all the other keyboards
are I really like the keys the cherry MX
stuff it's going to all be very nice for
the gamers out there WASD is placed far
apart I'm gonna bring us up to the
cameraman closer you guys can see
there's actually some decent spacing
between the keys you're going to like
that or love that personally i like that
it gives you a room between the keys
makes it very good for gaming I don't
know how will be for typing but let's
move over here here's the keypad we got
the CM storm logo right there go ahead
and flip it around the back
here's a total back side we have little
flippers here for angling the keyboard
up here is a sticker on here saying do
not remove ok ok I won't remove it then
I shall be ever obedient so you're
looking around this thing folks I spin
it around just trying to see where than
hips up at all so when you buy this
keyboard you start looking around you
wondering where to hook it up I actually
looked around for a second it's actually
here under the underbelly so it's kind
of actually honestly I don't know if
this is such a superb spot to put this
in this isn't all that ergonomic I don't
think to actually put the thing in it's
actually not going and all that well at
all so it's probably one of those things
that's like super simple but super pain
in the butt ok so there we go I finally
got it in so hey that's it folks thanks
for watching teka tomorrow this was the
new CM storm quickfire pro you saw it
here on tech of tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
