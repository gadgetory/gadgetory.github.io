you doing I'm Network you are watching
techo tomorrow today we're gonna have a
head-to-head battle between two cards
that are exactly pretty much the exact
same price this is on the AMD side of
things the RX 590 and on the nvidia side
of things the brand new GT x16 60 TI now
both of these cards are about two
hundred and seventy nine dollars so I
think that's a pretty equal thing so I
want to say something right off the bat
like all of other videos why show the
cards and comparisons against everything
but I figured right off the bat we might
as well compare things at cost because
let's just face it when you go out there
to buy something whether it's AMD
whether it's Nvidia the only thing that
you really should be looking at is the
performance and the way that the games
are played on the card that you are
choosing that should be it everything
else I feel should be left off to the
side of the road because when it comes
to my money I want what's gonna be the
absolute best for me and I leave
everything else off to the side of the
table now with that said the news otech
card is pretty neat now this is there I
would assume their entry level 16 60 TI
card they have one actually I'm unit
that's above this one it's a little bit
more expensive actually as a backplate
now you notice the two fans on the front
of this card are actually two different
sizes it's just kind of like my nuts
they're duplex
I don't do personal there you know
thinks is a problem for everybody
alright yeah but anyways you can see the
fans are actually two different sizes on
the card underneath the two fans you can
see the rest of the cooling apparatus
it's got a bunch of heat fins at all
that stuff obviously it's going to have
something attached to the GPU as well
then it's gonna go up from there into
those cooling fans and these fans are
gonna blow all that heat and dissipate
it away from the car keeping the card
running cool now like I said this
particular card doesn't have a backplate
but one thing really cool about this car
though is it will fit in about 99% of
the system's out there in the market
that's right so chances are if you have
a system and you want to upgrade to this
card it's going to fit inside your
system it only has a single requirement
which is a single 8 pin power connector
little bad boys right here single 8 pin
power connector
they recommend a Ford and 50 watt power
supply but I bet if you had a good
foreigner watt power supply and you had
this in your system you'd probably be
good to go
fifteen hundred and thirty six CUDA
cores inside this bad boy six gigabytes
of gddr3
192 bit memory interface seventeen
hundred and 70 megahertz on the boost
clock on this particular model here so
pretty nice boost clock we'll have to
see if it does a little bit different we
do all the testing which was coming
right up but that's pretty much this
card it's pretty much I think I feel and
since it's $279 I guess it's going to be
considered mid-level now and not
entry-level so this is actually probably
a mid-level card but a 590 is also a
mid-level card as well so with that said
though let's real quick check out our
test system if you guys would actually
like to see a video more about our test
system and break it all down we'll do
that for you but I decided to stick with
the i7 8700 K now the motherboard is the
a Zeus Maximus hero we have 32 gigabytes
of GDR phone memory on this bad boy I've
got a 256 gigabyte SSD for the boot
drive and I have a 2 terabyte drive this
is the Seagate Barracuda drive now as
far as the drivers that we use for
testing you guys asked we told you the
exact drivers so on the Nvidia side of
things we use the latest beta driver
this is the for 1891 driver and on the
AMD side of things we're using the 19.2
driver reason the latest anniversary
edition of Windows and every game is
patched and everything is it's updated
as we can get it with that said though
let's jump in let's rock out to the new
benchmark song and let's see how these
cards do head-to-head
the zotac 1660 tea I got us hot is 75 C
under a full load and the XFX Fatboy 590
actually got as hot as 81 Celsius
alright so there you have it a
head-to-head battle between two cards
that are completely and identically
priced if you got two hundred and
seventy and nine dollars and you're
looking for a card these two cards are
definitely tutored in the same category
now with that said this card I hope you
are gonna really probably hate it on the
AMD side of cards but the 1660 ti
actually does beat the 590 between two
and ten frames per second and on doom I
think almost 20 frames per second so
this card actually wins and as far as
the heat goes this card runs a little
cooler
like we said 81 Celsius on the Fat Boy
75 Celsius on the zotac so at the end of
the day I would have to say for a mid
level card this is definitely going to
be an editor's choice card I haven't
seen the version that's right above it
I'm gonna ask so tack for it maybe I can
get that thing on my hands and does see
how it does but at the end of the day in
this particular battle for the same
exact price cards I have to say that the
Nvidia card is the clear winner in this
category I'm Eric peace out let us see
you guys back in the channel if you're
not subbed
