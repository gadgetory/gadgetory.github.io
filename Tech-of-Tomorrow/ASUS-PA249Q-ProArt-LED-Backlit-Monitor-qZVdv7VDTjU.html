now we're going to take a look at the
pro art series of month the people at
Asus now this is made for the person who
is definitely a worker gamers can use as
well because they love the perfect color
separation but this monitor is really
made for those people who need perfect
color separation to work in that work
environment this right here is the PA 24
Q and we're gonna let JJ talk about some
of the absolutely great things about
this monitor coming to market soon so
you nailed it on the head ballast this
is really focused at people that are
interested in content creation pa Series
is our Pro are so those people are doing
video production they're doing a
professional print calibration or
anybody this may be a serious a serious
amateur hobbyist maybe the 30 days
they're doing video or they're doing
photo work and like you said they need
color fidelity color separation and
overall accuracy and really tight pixel
pitch you can even see here just with
this going on the color separation and
the rocks between the mold and the
different color rocks is very very clear
on the blue sky you can see the
different shades of blue and the white
and the clouds and everything that
background is very very clear I'm
thinking that this thing is very
competitive with like what easel plane
are other types like that anybody that's
looking at a Professional Series monitor
you're getting a super high-end IPS
based panel especially design
electronics package where we have
specially tuned and calibrated monitor
from the factory with ICC profile
support we have both Adobe on 99%
coverage as well as srgb coverage
there's six color independent access
control so you can independently adjust
as needed you have an integrated USB 3
hub you have full rotation pill until
pivot adjustment all built into this
Plus this overlay here it's not like
defect in the monitor it's actually a
quick technology so if you want to go
ahead and have different overlays for
different production purposes you can go
ahead and just select the one that works
best for you and you can go ahead and
have that Cui's quick and easy
adjustment now this thing's also 1920 by
1200 it's right so it's not your
standard 1920 by 1080
this has more real estate that's correct
so that's really nice for
that are looking for additional
horizontal workspace so once again for
people that are content oriented this is
a big plus because normally we have
other awesome PA quality panels but
that's 1920 by 1080 this one gives you
that bump up to the additional workspace
1900s by 1200 yeah just looking at it I
mean I can tell the color separation is
just amazing the monitor is totally
clear you don't see any blur and it's
even all the way across the entire
screen yeah so um I'll some high end
monitor that's going to be coming to the
market very soon what we don't have that
on here we're also going to be releasing
a new updated PA panel for 2560 by 1440
so for the guys that are right now
familiar for our PB 2560 by 1440 which
we've shown on techo tomorrow as well
we're going to be coming off the newer
professional version of that one so all
the great professional images you get
here is also going to be applicable to
that panel it's just going to be at even
a higher resolution Wow okay well that's
it folks
so alright guys anybody out there
looking for a high quality monitor you
know asus has you covered this has been
a great video we'll see you guys back
here and tech damara's and bring you
