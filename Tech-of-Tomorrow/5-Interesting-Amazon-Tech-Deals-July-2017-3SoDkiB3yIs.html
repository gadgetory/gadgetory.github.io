back once again to the channel where
I've gotten five different items from
over at Amazon to show you guys today
and I will say off the bat that a few of
these items were actually sent to me by
companies to show you guys and a few of
them I bought myself now
the Sanders floating globe is a really
cool little desktop product it's not
really you know useful for anything but
it actually looks really cool and we
were actually first starting to film I
kind of put my hat on over the hood
again yeah and the globe light popped up
now this is a $21 product that actually
looks really cool when the lights are
all down I know we got all the lights up
right here to the video but if you have
this in your office and the lights are
kind of dim it's a really cool thing I
mean like I said it's not the most
absolute useful product in the world but
if you're looking for something that
just looks kind of cool on your desk
people when they walk into your office
if they see they're definitely going to
go hey what is that man what's that cool
little floating globe and it's kind of
weird because it works off different
magnetic pressure I don't know if you've
ever taken
two magnets and pushed them together and
seeing how the force pushes them away
this works off that same type of
technology you basically just get it in
the center without snapping the top that
is and then and there we go now you see
it's actually floating in between the
two magnets which is you know kind of a
really cool thing if you're looking for
something for your desk something that's
really cool it's only 20 bucks not going
to really break the bank or anything I
think it's maybe 21 bucks right now
still it's a really cool nice little
thing just look at and once again it
popped up to the top so there you have
it it's kind of cool it's got nice
little nifty lights it plugs in you know
and as you see sometimes it gets
magnetically screwed on yet I think it
was kind of funny though because you
know we were filming all the bureau it
really never did that at all but now it
seems to be want to do it quite a bit so
let's move on lately there's been a
giant trend with people using their
phone to film and photo almost
everything that they do and that's where
this product from picture comes in they
actually have products that will do all
kinds of different things for your phone
they have a macro lens they have a fish
eye lens each one of these lenses can be
bought separately they're about $54
right now but on their site you can
actually buy them and
kit and they're actually really nice
they just took up very easily onto your
phone and the different things that they
have will do the different stuff now I
have one right here this one right here
is the macro probe so if you don't know
what macro pro is some people night so
don't laugh so real that is all right
that's for like doing really small
things and taking pictures of things
really close that are really small so if
you do that a lot on your phone the
macro one is the one for you next up
we've got the super fish eye Pro you
know fisheye lens it's all round it's
all weird kind of psychedelic like the
50s that's another one the grand angle
pro is simply a wide-angle lens and this
helps you get more in your shot and then
last but not least we got the telephoto
Pro if you telephoto one means things
that are far away it actually helps
bring those things in closer so you can
capture them on the camera in your phone
and they're all going to look pretty
clear these products are very very nice
and at fifty four dollars right now it's
the price they are on Amazon they're
definitely worth checking out so like I
say if you're a person out there and you
use your phone for doing all kinds of
filming photography and all that kind of
stuff these can be very very handy and
they're very well priced you guys have
seen a lot of anchor products here on
the channel they're really nice they're
usually priced very decent as well today
we're going to look at the sound of core
2 now this thing you can listen to for
66 feet away you can hear this thing it
has great bass and one of the things I
really like about it is that you can
actually listen to it for up to 24 hours
and that's pretty incredible that's a
lot of time that you can listen to a
speaker not having to recharge it like
every few hours is something if you're
on a trip or you're at the beach or
camping and you want to be listened to
your music then hey that's something
that you're going to really appreciate
if you like a Bluetooth speaker that has
a lot of bass you're really going to
like the sound core too and it can work
with any type of Bluetooth device out
there so it doesn't matter what brands
you have it doesn't matter what you're
using if it has bluetooth you can
connect and listen to the sound cords
ooh it also features IPX five water
resistance and it actually has a
built-in mic and that's kind of crazy
the sound court two also features 2 6
watt high performance drivers for giving
you a lot of sound in a small package
like I said before the sound Court 2
offers you 24 hours of continuous sound
and that equals about 500 songs which is
quite a lot of music and best of all
when this product originally came out it
was about $90 but it's on sale right now
for $45.99 so you can get this thing at
a deal now this next product you're
either going to be saying yourself wow
that's either completely useless you're
going to be going wow I could really
really use this product now the tech
boss is a digital thermometer for your
shower and what it does is it measures
the temperature water and tells you how
hot it is now for some people this might
seem like it's really ridiculous but I'm
a diabetic person I know there's other
people out there in the world who have
problems with being able to know how hot
the water is and this can result in you
scalding your skin hurting yourself and
believe it or not even get yourself put
in the hospital so if you're a person
out there and you have diabetes so one
of these type of conditions you're
really going to appreciate this product
a lot it's completely fabulous it has no
battery whatsoever and somehow it's
actually powered from the water running
through it in your shower which is
really incredible because you want to
worry about plugging it in you're not
worried about electricity you don't have
to worry about any of the things
whatsoever it's very reasonably priced I
know this product is kind of a niche
market but I got this particular product
because I have diabeetus like I said and
sometimes in the shower I do get out of
the shower and my skin looks inge
because I can't properly detect how hot
the water is so for me even though this
is a very niche product it's a very also
important product that made it some like
I said seemed absolutely useless but for
people like me and other people like
that this is going to be actually very
valuable and very affordable product ok
Tech fans now this next product might
look like a laser gun from the future
but no it's not it's actually an outdoor
HDTV 1080p antenna which is kind of cool
I know that some people out there don't
have really have access to getting cable
TV and all stuff like that so if you're
one of those people or just somebody who
planned somebody doesn't want to pay for
TV you can get a lot of different
channels from this product it's actually
really well priced it hooks up outside
now the one caveat I do have to say
about this is the cord is a little bit
I feel for being something that you're
going to put outside but you can't just
run a cable and then hook it up on your
roof and you'll be absolutely fine but
that's a little bit technical I don't
think like anybody who's older or
grandmas going to you know some like
that's going to be able to do it but if
you have your TV by a window you can
simply take the cord put it outside of
your window outdoors and you'll be good
to go now with a lot of the newer TVs
that we tried it with it didn't really
work that well but any of the older
technology especially those TVs that you
know use rabbit ears and stuff like that
this will actually be probably a miracle
product for those people because it'll
be like oh my god I can get all these
mass amounts of channels Optus now like
usual where you live and stuff like that
we'll definitely have you know an effect
on how well this works if you live an
area that's covered with mountains and
stuff like that that block signals
you'll probably most definitely have to
matter on your roof but if you live in
the city and stuff like that where
there's lots of signal bouncing around
you'll find this product is very easy to
use you simply put it together and that
takes a few minutes of your time you do
have to assemble it plug it in adjust it
and you're good to go so this is another
one those products that you're going to
be like hey I could really use that
you're going to be like Elric what are
you thinking I mean sometimes I feel
that way to trust me but you know it's
an interesting product putting it
together was a few minutes but in all
honesty I mean in some ways there's this
thing look a giant has frickin laser gun
like always bubbling down below the like
button where you can check out all these
products for yourself so you want to get
more information or purchase one you
guys can do so I'm Ellerth you guys been
watching teka tomorrow this was some
cool stuff from Amazon so if you're into
this stuff hey should I get it out face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
