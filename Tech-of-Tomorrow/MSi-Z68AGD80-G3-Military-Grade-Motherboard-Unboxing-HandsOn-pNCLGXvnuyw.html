Tomorrowland at least I hope you're not
taking tomorrow and since you're here on
the ticket of our YouTube channel I'm
Eric Ferris you're hosting today we've
got a cool z68 motherboard to look at
from the people at MSI today we'll be
doing the unboxing for you guys to show
you what some of their features what
comes in this is their z68 gdad this is
the revision 3 motherboard has lots of
features that said let's jump in and see
what comes inside the box
alright so see you outside the box see
all that good stuff going to go ahead
and pop the cap now all the goodies are
inside so I'm going to go ahead and set
the box up the side and said all the
goodies after the table for you guys to
see right the bat we have the
certification of quality and stability
this is their so-called thing the
military class to stuff it's just a
fancy piece of white paper with some
silver stuff but hey it's still cool
marketing got some instant connectors
here these are for using an external
device for measuring your power voltage
and stuff you just took these into that
on your board and then you can check all
your vultures and make sure things
really good to go on that then we have
the five year warranty if you register
the motherboard you get a five year
warranty with it pretty good stuff there
it's a good long warranty we have a
breakout box here this is the breakout
box for the USB 3.0 and you flip that
around the correct way they paint it all
up nice and blue for you kind of it's
kind of like an airline part almost slap
that down over there then we've got a
bunch of cables right here these are all
your stuff for connecting your drives
these are your SATA and the power on one
here's another one of those comes with
two of those so you get two powers and
you get to actually four cables let's
see here one two three four yet so in
total of four cables and to power things
there here's the rear I oh it's all
clearly marked out you guys might not be
able to see all that but everything's
really clearly marked on it at the hdmi
to DVI everything's on there with the
light CPU so right here we have the top
quality and stability software
application guide this debate is going
to show you all the stuff you're super
charger and all the different features
of your board teaming Genie like this is
basically to show you everything about
that for you guys remember the march on
motherboard I actually did an unboxing
of that I motherboards the target looked
really cool i was a really nice board
but anyways back to this and let's see
what else we got in here we have the
actual the warranty manual i'm sorry
excuse me the users guide we have the
user's guide here at the top quality and
stability z68 GTA III user's guide we've
got a giant-sized quick guide it's like
a giant size poster i don't know i don't
want to get to how to focus on this but
it's basically just a giant
I am grateful work of the motherboard
it's humongo hopefully can all see that
pretty good they're actually even tells
you more about the rear i/o and
everything it's just a giant basically
information thing about the motherboard
I wouldn't have to unbox the thing I
could just show you this little picture
right here tells you everything but
we'll keep going because we're doing
unboxing and then unboxing means
discovering what is inside the box right
right so here are the headers that these
go from your case onto the motherboard
these fakes for easy connections for all
your power on hard drive and all other
stuff those are right there we've got
the driver and utilities thing right
here this is the CD with all that good
stuff on it then we've got another quick
installation guide for the USCG team so
this is probably going to tell you a
little bit about that stuff more
information for you guys and then we
have one cable here this is the SLI
cable it's for a single SLI connection
that's we get inside the box so all this
stuff right here if you look over
motherboards org this will be the
written review this will probably be in
the content section so we'll go ahead
and pull that off and we'll get to board
stuff in a second here alright then
probably back into camera range now this
the motherboard it comes all sealed its
bag I'm going to open it up up here now
one single piece of tape holding in
there go ahead and pull the motherboard
out first off we'll start off you guys
you guys can see the PCB is completely
black looks very good all the MOSFETs
everything is completely cooled off your
extra power your standard power your
other standard power this right here for
hooking up any kind of stuff for reading
multimeter whatever's right there the
board supports 32 gigabytes of ddr3
memory you can see that right here the
eight gigabyte sticks are now out and
available so flip it around right here
you guys can see here all the different
SATA connectors you have both your Intel
and your marvel on here as well the
white ones being the true six gigabit
ports flip that around again z68 g dat
you can see we have one two three
about before of the PCI 16x slots we
have two standard PCI slots and we then
again i have two pci 1x slots which
there are some device is now on the
market for sound we can see we have THX
dolby this is going to support the
standard that's high enough for using
all your blue right stuff at about 180
be so you're really good to go there
then we have the overclocking genie and
the onboard settings right here for
restart and everything else right there
so you can turn the board on you can
reset it or you can overclock genie at
all from right here that's actually
probably going to be more applicable for
people using on a test bench and stuff
but still kind of cool things to have I
kinda didn't say this but around the ZIF
socket you can see there's actually
pulling your room for an aftermarket
heatsink or whatever the new ones that
they're coming out there really
efficient so this would be really good
board let's flip it around take a look
at the rear I oh now this board is a
fully fledged outboard you see that we
do have the video here and here so we
have both HDMI and DVI video connectors
we have audio over here this is a
digital we have the old-school analog
ps2 and keyboard mouse ports we have
powered esata combo port two USB 3.0
ports firewire and two shotgun enabled
ports for your land so and then last but
not least I guess we do have all the 7.1
8.1 audio ports ones in there I don't
know exactly which chips that's being
news we'll go over that in the review
but basically that's everything that
comes in the box so thank you for
watching today we brought you the
unboxing of the new msi z68 g dat gen3
motherboard featuring military class to
hardware today was just the unboxing
look for the full review here and take
her tomorrow i'm very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
