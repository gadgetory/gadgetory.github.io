once again to the channel okay so you
guys saw yesterday's vid where I talked
about the reasons that Intel right now
their platform is kind of an well
there's actually a sixth reason to that
we've seen some of the reviews come in
and we're seeing that these chips are
running hotter than hell and actually
burning up people's system so that's
reason number six
- honestly avoid Intel's latest you know
this I 9 and X 399 stuff just kind of
fishy now this video I want to talk to
you guys about how I feel that in 2018
AMD is going to completely dominate the
mainstreaming buyer in the computer
world there's just a lot of factors that
are geared towards that way first of all
this big huge Intel debacle on their
higher end stuff nobody is really going
to want to spend the money and buy into
this stuff especially right now with all
the problems that are going on that's
going to attract more and more fans to
AMD now we know Intel will fix this
stuff in the next few months is they
actually prepare you know and pull their
pants back up from having them caught
down they'll fix those type of things
but by that time honestly the damage
will be done I'm just saying the damage
will be done when you see the brand new
epic CPUs that come out and you see the
thread Ripper come out and all these
CPUs that are super high-end at half the
cost of their highest end CPU that
possibly will still be having problems
by Christmas this year you're going to
see just everybody using the AMD
platform and going over to that there
will be the people who still use Intel
obviously there's going to be diehards
and people like I've already got
comments saying you know oh you've been
paid by AMD I'm not joking ok this is
just the facts man you guys all
know them you know we're seeing actually
more and more problems with the Intel
eye 9 and x2 9 platform as the days go
by it's not like you know we're hearing
more good stuff like oh yeah they fixed
it it's awesome oh this is bitchin
totally cool we're not hearing that and
as the months go by you're just going to
see more and more fans who were on the
Intel side flock over to AMD now when
2018 rolls around next year you all know
that the Vega the top and Vega should be
out by them and I said this before my
video I told you guys this to you guys
also that was and it was coming
out in a month where is it I'm just
saying you know well get that light
knock it over so at that point you know
they will have their Vegas stuff all out
now when baby hits the market even if it
doesn't do you know phenomenally like
you know there's always hype it doesn't
do that well it just does even just a
little bit close ten Vidia that's going
to put Vidya in the hot spot I'll tell
you guys why most people when they buy a
platform they either choose like Intel
and NVIDIA or they go all AMD well as
AMD has the absolute most kick-ass video
cards out there along with their
platform it's doing better than Intel
well then you're going to see people
switching from Nvidia to now we haven't
seen Nvidia actually drop their pants
obviously like any company they have
their marketing sh memes and trams like
anybody that's just business you know I
mean you can't really take it personal
because everybody's just trying to sell
their stuff and do the best marketing
job they can and it's pretty damn
ruthless but I don't think we're going
to see Nvidia really caught with their
pants down because it's truth the matter
is Nvidia does have a lot of technology
under their roof right now but they're
just holding on to and they're always
this way they probably have cards that
are two or three gems ahead
they just don't release them because
there's no reason to because thinking
it's release to the next card and you
know kick back and wait but if they said
on their laurels in 2018 I see even the
Nvidia fans losing a lot of their fans
and moving over to AMD because if AMD
can keep up the pricing they've already
got the stability going down it's
getting more stable the platform's
getting better you know if they have
stuff that's all compatible together
people like to put their stuff together
so if people are using AMD CPUs AMD
motherboards you can figure that most of
the time they're going to want to put an
AMD video card on their system because
it just makes sense I mean think about
it logically if you dress you want to
match you don't want to be wearing a
polka dot shirt striped pants and a hat
with sparkle I mean this just
doesn't go together and I feel that PC
fans in their mind they feel like they
should really keep everything all
together because it'll run better and
there probably is some truth to that how
much truth I don't know I don't have a
measuring stick for truth because the
 meter is usually bigger but you
guys know what I'm saying so in 2018 if
AMD keeps up the way that they're going
they're going to completely dominate the
mainstream now are they going to
dominate the entire top end probably not
because if you piss and vidi off they're
going to release some cards that will
totally wipe out anything and they'll
stick their nose in there and say
you am
I mean they were actually known to do
this so if gets too bad you can
really see that maybe Nvidia might even
jump a generation ahead on their card to
really like you know I'm Sam don't take
this the wrong way but I could see
NVIDIA you know honestly saying hey
let's put you back in your place
you know and release that card if that
happens that could be really one of the
only saving graces of the entire thing
you know I'm saying and obviously for
the super duper top end you know you
probably still see people getting Intel
CPUs because the Xeon in the market
that's male making movies and all that
stuff they haven't adopted too much into
the AMD segment but if AMD like can
really get their stuff even better
you'll see them more in the 3d market
and making movies and odd stuff and
maybe a and B will even start taking
over in that segment as well but for
mainstream even it is right now it seems
like AMD's really winning the AMD
company has a lot of fans very loyal
strong supporters out there you know I
mean I've always supported them
they've always been the underdog and I'm
for me I've always worked to the other
dog you know you always want the
underdog to do better which is face it
you know it's the underdog you've got
the big best super guy and you got the
underdog you know so for me I like to
see the underdog win C and a and B come
up the lather and do changes that make
their company better is a good thing to
me and I think it's a good thing to you
guys too so like usual I want to hear
your guy's opinion do you guys also
agree with me that when 2018 gets here
when beta gets here that AMD will
completely dominate the mainstream
segment I don't know if they'll totally
take over the enthusiasts segment yet
there'll be a part of that that they're
using as well but I know that mainstream
my mind in my heart I feel AMD's is
going to completely dominate I'm oh you
guys been watching Tekken tomorrow
always love to hear you guys opinions
once again a special shout-out to our
sponsor these guys have a really cool
app that you can search everything with
all at one time if you're into that kind
of thing you might want to check it out
I'm Network you guys been watching Tech
and Ammar more information be down below
