year is winding down this is pretty much
gonna be our last tech video of 2016
that's right so we've done something
kind of interesting now since it is the
holidays and I got a bunch of family
coming over you know my kids coming over
I wanted like show off kind of so like
this system that we're doing today it's
called the Omega system why is it the
Omega system well the Alpha systems
begin the Omega is the end and this is
the last system but not only did we
build this crazy system in the in one
9:09 case we built this entire like
gaming gear so my kid comes here I can
kick his ass in battlefield one
I'm not according to him but we'll have
to see anyways so we built this cool
gaming area and it's kind of cool
because we got this chair from vinegar
and it's a really nice chair I'm sitting
in it's very really well made it's
comfortable so he gets to check this out
he gets to check out the system we've
got a couple brand new products that we
got the people over at creative we got
this mo for mouse and this crazy other
vanguard keyboard so we got just a lot
of cool stuff just in this little area
plus we did a complete time-lapse build
of the system so you get to see the
Omega being built that's right and it's
it tired to hear on tech of tomorrow so
with that said though real quick let's
jump in and let's check out the parts we
use in the build and stuff in the
desktop and then at the end of the day
let's see is the 909 actually a really
great case to do a build in or that just
look good let's see so starting off
obviously the build has the N win 909
black case now this thing is completely
crazy priced this thing is 421 dollars
and 32 cents now that's on Amazon you
might be able to find it cheaper
somewhere else but obviously this case
being what it is is big and it's
fricking pricey as well really really
made for show is it for go yeah we'll
talk about that in a minute
for the motherboard we want the gigabyte
Gaz 97x gaming g1 Wi-Fi motherboard now
this is a great motherboard and in fact
this entire
is made off parts that we just had lying
around here that we missed this year for
our review so we're using all those
parts so we can see them this board is a
little bit pricey right now sure you can
find a different board but this one
matches looks cool too for the CPU we
want the intel core i7 4790k now this
thing you can run it on turbo at 4.4
gigahertz this thing is actually very
fast CPU when you guys see the test
results should be like damn it is if you
guys follow the channel you guys know we
made this totally killer system using
the deep cool case well we also had one
of their deep cool coolers that we just
weren't able to fit in that system but
it looks really nice and this this is
the deep cool gamers storm it's an AI a
liquid water cooling system they call it
the captain 240 X it's actually under a
hundred bucks and works really damn well
and I really got to say I like the
pulsing red thing it's just cool for the
memory with two sticks of Kingston's
HyperX fury I'm furious about this stuff
16 gigabyte kit - 8 gigabyte sticks 1866
megahertz ddr3 stuff this stuff looks
nice and matches this build really nice
for the boot drive we wanted something
very fast and early this year at g.skill
kicked us down with the Phoenix now this
is a 2.5 inch 240 gigabyte SATA 3 Drive
it's fast it's perfect for the build if
you guys are like me you probably have
origin games steam game battlenet you
name it you're gaming it in that case
you need a really nice fast drive so we
chose the Seagate constellation this is
actually the only part out of the bill
that I went out of my way and actually
bought at the store it's pretty cool
though it's 2 terabytes 7200 rpm drive
and it's very well priced 2 terabytes
for 70 bucks hell's to the yes the video
cards are the only other part in this
bill that I didn't just have here these
are 2 EVGA geforce gtx 1080 founders
edition cards i actually just called up
a homie of mine who works there he gave
me the card to this build so thank you
very much and as you can see these cards
look great the founders edition for me
is actually a perfect card if you're not
doing a liquid cooling or if you're
doing a liquid cooling because the fact
that most of the fans will fit it better
than any aftermarket card all the brand
new pascal cards require what's called a
pro sli bridge to run properly so also
we got one of those from EVGA it's the
PGA pro SLI bridge HB and then last but
not least the power supply and I gotta
say folks when you see the price you're
gonna laugh your ass off because it's
just ridiculous but we had this
Silverstone one lying around so
obviously we're gonna take care of
business and so we used it now this is
the Silverstone Strider plus now this is
a really nice power spike don't get me
wrong it's completely modular it
features a lot of different things it's
got a great guarantee on it it's 80 plus
silver but obviously at $400 people are
going what the frak and now let's check
out a word from our sponsors easy ACC

out that time-lapse filled
now a few things I want to mention you
guys about the inland 909 obviously this
case is downright fricking beautiful you
have to admit as far as just elegance
and looks goes this case is really
really awesome but I got to say that
that's kind of where it ends the
nine-oh-nine has some serious cabinets
that I think for the price would
probably keep most builders away from it
the first of these is is that the air
flow is kind of weird and kind of
restricted due to this giant back
housing that they have on the 909 like
this back housing is kind of cool
because you can like fit a radiator back
there you might have be able to fit a
power supply in there or something but
it actually makes no sense in the build
whatsoever and what's even worse is that
when you're trying to actually plug into
your proof reels it's really hard
because the peripheries are actually
like a you know six inches inside of the
case too for you to plug them in which
is just a really negative thing I feel
about the case some nice things about
the 909 however is it does have plenty
of room for expansion you can see up on
top there are just tons of room for all
of your drives you can put a lot of SSDs
a lot of hard drives in here and still
have room for expansion now a couple of
things I really do like about the 909 is
it's made of tempered glass and aluminum
so it's really not all that heavy that's
what you'd think plus the glass does
look very very nice and all the controls
are very easy to access you get a power
on button then you get USB type-c that's
right there's a USB type-c connection
right on the side then three more USB
3.0 ports and then you get your light
control button there's also HD audio so
those things are very nice and like I
said before inside the case
expandability is really nice there's
lots of room nothing will cut your hands
whatsoever that's everything about the
case that's nice as far as looks go it's
cool but a thing that I gotta say
airflow is kind of weird so on the front
I have two fans that are doing pull so
they're pulling air into the system and
then I have a single fan in the bottom
and that's doing push and that's pushing
all the air out of the system I didn't
put any fans in the very back of the
case because like I said there's that
whole area back there where the
radiators at and I didn't really think
that work all that well so overall I
have to say
909 looks great but as far as airflow
goes and those type of things it's a bit
lagging I also had a couple items like I
said before from creative I had the
sound blaster Vanguard ko8 keyboard this
is really cool keyboard it lights up
it's very very nice
has a great tactile feel to it but then
I also got a mouse now this is the mo
for Mouse from sound blaster and it's
pretty cool as well next year when these
products get released we'll bring you
guys a full review on them and the chair
that I'm sitting in is a chair by
vintage air and the chair is really cool
it's made very very nice it's
comfortable but there are a few caveats
like if you try to scoot up in this
chair you might fall on your face so
that's just a little bit weird the Omega
system is wearing the very latest
edition of Windows 10 it's called their
anniversary edition if you try to
install the latest Nvidia driver you'll
find out exactly what I'm talking about
with that said though we did run some
tests so let's check out the performance
on the Omega I think to be impressed
all right folks so there you have it the
Omega system the last system of 2016
here on techno model now I'm gonna state
right off the bat obviously a lot of
these parts that we use in the build are
like really expensive foreign dollars
the power supply come on 300 hours from
motherboard and you can buy many many
different parts to build a build like
this much much cheaper reason that we
did it is that we have parts all year
long that we're getting from people are
saying hey man here review this review
this review this and sometimes those
parts they get skipped over so we took
all the parts basically that we didn't
use in any of the bills this year and
just put them inside this case to do
this build so this is no kind of
representation of hey a cheap build that
you can get for a price or anything like
that whatsoever I mean I should have
just called the leftover system because
that's kind of what it is it's like the
leftover system all the leftover parts
that we have this year we put inside of
this because well I owe the review on
the 909 and when we take care of
business around here so that's it guys
thanks for sticking around thanks for
all you support through 2016 we're gonna
have another video coming up but that's
just gonna be you to wish you guys happy
holidays it announced the system winner
if you guys missed that man we've had a
contest where I've been announcing
winners all the way up until Christmas
day so it should have been in on that
and got a free gift but anyways there's
still time so like I said everything
will be down below that like button
hopefully you guys will Chuck Norrises
 out of that thing I know you've
been watching teka tomorrow we'll see
you guys back here for more tech videos
in 2017 peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
