here once again on TECA tomorrow today
we're checking out something totally
badass from the people over Nvidia and
although it has a 1200 dollar price tag
still has a lot of the same damn
features as $5,000 bigger quadro brother
what am I talking about I'm talking
about the Pascal version of the Titan X
this card is meant for extreme gaming
for doing extreme everything you can
even make some videos on this bad boy so
with that said though let's jump in
let's first check out the card itself
check out the speeds and feeds and then
check out those test scores and see why
at the end of the day you might want to
spend that 1200 bucks and get yourself
an nvidia tight next let's go so first
off let's check out the visual aspects
of the Titan X now everybody wonders
okay how big is this card well this card
is 10.5 inches long by 4.3 inches high
and features a 2 slot design on the
front it features a single black color
design and a single fan this is perfect
though I think for any bill because
black will pretty much work with any
system out there as we flip the card
over the side we'll see there are two
power connectors for the power a single
eight pen and a single six bed now it's
recommended to use a 600 watt power
supply because the power draw is 250
watts and as far as the maximum GPU
temperatures go this card's recommended
run at about 94 celsius at max and on
the top of the card you can see the gtx
logo as well as to sli connectors inside
powering this card are 3584 and video
cuda cores the card features a base
clock speed of fourteen hundred and
seventeen megahertz and a boost clock
speed of fifteen hundred and thirty one
megahertz and check this gamers the
Titan X features 12 massive gigabytes of
gddr5 X memory with a memory speed
running at 10 gigabits per second it
also features a 384-bit memory
controller with a memory bandwidth of
480 gigabytes per second and all of
those great features that you saw on the
GTX 1080 release as far as Pascal goes
are all passed over the
ATX things like simultaneous multi
projection VR and videos Ansel nvidia
sli ready nvidia g-sync technology
nvidia game stream technology nvidia GPU
boost microsoft x Direct X 12 the Vulcan
API opengl and can use any operating
system from windows 7 through 10 linux
and freebsd x 84 as far as the
connections go on the tight next we see
31.4 display ports a single hdmi 2.0
port and a single dual link DVI port but
what's really amazing is that tight next
features up to 8k support which means
you could run to 4k monitors at the same
time and still be kicking ass but the
best feature of all about the titan x
come on it's the back plate so that's
what the card looks like that's all its
specs now let's check out that benchmark
system real quick and then after that
let's jump in and rock out to the
benchmark song let's check out those
scores
so okay Kennedy out there
say wow that's what I can say well it's
1,200 bucks as you can see in gaming
minimum fifteen percent maximum thirty
percent so if you're an uber gamer out
there and all you care about is the best
of the best you don't care about price
the tight mix is definitely the
king of the block plus if you do a lot
of work station at home you do
editing and stuff and all that kind of
crap you're going to want to get
yourself a tight net and since this is
the Pascal version it features all kinds
of great stuff now you always hear about
the AMD side of stuff with direct
compute well all that's built into this
car in our next video series that we're
going to have will show you all the
other features about this card beyond
gaming this is just video one of a
series of videos that we're going to
have on the type next featuring Pascal
this is the first one and as you guys
can see the gaming aspect of this card
is seriously frickin kickin frickin ass
and like i said if you're the upper
gamer and you want the best of the best
you know as well as I do the price isn't
 when this car hit the nvidia
website my friend Mark from Babel tech
reviews out there checking out trying to
buy one they were sold out within an
hour lots of people buying multiple
cards so they can do SLI hopefully we're
gonna get another card and do SLI for
you as well wink wink if you guys are
hearing a certain video take the frick
and a hint but anyways I'm our this is
