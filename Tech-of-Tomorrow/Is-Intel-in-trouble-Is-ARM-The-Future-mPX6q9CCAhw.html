while
and now that both AMD and others have
started to compete with them in both the
server and debts not marina the pressure
is on for them to be more innovative
only a few years ago AMD was not even
really that competitive with Intel on
the CPU side of things but with the
release of their rise in CPUs in the
last few years this has shown that a
company can literally come up with new
technology that can compete on the same
playing field in a very short timeframe
Intel on the other hand has dominated
every aspect of the market for decades
owning the server and laptop market and
making a killing in their desktop market
as well the thing is the writing is on
the wall and AMD is already starting to
compete with Intel in the server and
desktop arena and even though at the
moment until still owns a laptop market
it seems that things are happening that
could threaten that market as well we
also see until now developing their own
so-called dream team to help them ensure
that they can continue their market
dominance and they hope with the release
of their 10 nanometers CPUs and new
graphic cards they can continue to be
the number one dog in the junkyard armed
technology was developed by a company in
the 80s called
acorn in the UK and it was developed as
a coprocessor to be used in the PBC
microcomputers of that time what they
found out however was that they made a
mistake when testing the chip and forgot
to hook up the power connection however
the chip still ran and it was discovered
that the chip runs on very little power
they were very surprised to see that the
chip only needed a tenth of a watt to
run which was just amazing but the
problem was that there was no
applications to take
advantage of this technology in 1984
however when the Apple Newton was
released a bit later the chip made its
first mark using armed technology and an
arm CPU in a product and having Apple as
their first client solidified their
presence in the market opening the gates
for their technology to bloom and
letting companies know they were the
go-to company for low powered CPUs in
the 90s things changed quite a bit
forearm technology as their cpu was used
to power the most popular Nokia phones
during that era establishing them firmly
as a marketable product in the PC
industry more always seems to be better
meaning that AMD Intel and NVIDIA have
always set their sights on more
transistors means more power hence just
like the modern CPU market of today more
cores means well more power arm
technology however focuses on getting
the absolute most out of their
technology and they work on getting the
better or similar performance but using
less transistors to get the job done
this equates into better efficiency in
the design by having less switching
activity in each clock cycle which means
hey less power is required as well the
arm business model is also a lot
different than other CPU manufacturers
as they do not make or fabricate any of
their own CPUs they just designed the
course and then license out that
technology to many different companies
like Apple Qualcomm or even surprisingly
enough Nvidia these companies then take
their CPU core designs and add whatever
technology around them for their
particular need and then make their own
versions of the arm CPU for their
products and video uses their Tegra chip
in the Nvidia shield and the intended
switch also uses an ARM based CPU as do
Apple's iPhone and iPads and since so
many millions of these products have
been sold globally that have used an arm
SOC there is
really a good chance that you own one
right now in your house arm also designs
its own architecture and the way it
scores are designed and work is very
different than say Intel or AMD Intel
and AMD both use Syst base x86
architecture where arm uses a risk based
architecture and what this means in
layman's terms is that games and
software that you use on your PC they do
not work directly with the ARM
architecture and that means that the
software has to be completely recompiled
into its native ARM architecture or run
through an emulator to be able to run on
your windows-based computer most of my
audience probably scoffs at the idea of
arm CPUs being in their prized gaming
machines or simple office systems and
they probably consider arm tech to
really only be good for portable tech
like phones and tablets but for your PC
they're probably like Yeah right after
all
low power and battery use is one thing
but a PC that uses an undirected power
supply that means there's plenty of
power to go around so who really needs
an ARM based CPU in their PC anyways
well you might be surprised to learn
that there are three ginormous companies
that want to change your mind and start
implementing arm technology to the
desktop market and these companies are
doing everything they can to push on
technology to your high performance PC
Qualcomm Microsoft and Apple all want
arm technology to be inside of your
computer so instead of saying Intel
Inside it might just say Qualcomm
Microsoft or Apple inside which would be
a big edge to Intel oh no now what comes
with doing business with these giant
companies well you get better software
more powerful CPUs and more support for
the application and desktop market the
big question however is why on earth
would Apple and Microsoft the two
biggest software providers on the planet
want to embrace arm technology with x86
CPUs are doing just fine and both AMD
and Intel latest CPUs are
nice and worked very well on the x88
platform so why is arm suddenly so
appealing to them there are several
reasons why but it's really all about
profit when you break it all down as
both Apple and other companies on the PC
side of things have just had some a
horrible experience with Intel CPUs and
Microsoft Windows especially with
laptops from the Windows Vista to
Windows 8 era causing profit loss and
embarrassment all the bloatware and
other software garbage that previously
came on your laptop or device so the
manufacturers distributors cuz make a
few extra bucks to help lower the price
could now be eliminated and now allow
companies to omit all that crap software
and still make and sell a product that
makes a decent profit margin but they
want to achieve this goal without really
sacrificing any performance these issues
caused many users to make the switch to
Mac products after having multiple
issues including reformatting and
removing unwanted spyware from their
computers like Lenovo superfish who
needed to find a way to make profits in
any way they could you have probably
heard it many times from the old and
young alike that they do not care about
spending a little bit more money on a
system that just works and offers a much
less painful user experience all around
let's just face it a lot of people feel
that Apple computers are just easier to
use Microsoft has been fighting this
problem for years now trying to get less
unwanted software on their products and
bringing the overall cost down to
attract buyers by using arm technology
the cost on manufacturing products can
be decreased enough to never have to
include a bunch of unwanted bloatware or
spyware even on entry-level systems ever
again this will allow the users to have
a better user experience closer to the
Apple side of things for ease and use
and let's face it stability for years
after being beaten by Apple and being
frustrated with a stagnated PC industry
Microsoft developed the surface line to
grab back some of the market
sher lost to Apple over the last decade
Microsoft had a plan for OEMs to develop
their own products around this
technology but the laptops and tablets
sold very well and became a huge success
and now many professionals from all
walks of business have begun to use
surface devices as the market grows in
both the laptop and tablet market
Microsoft has to be competitive with
Apple and orders survive and as more and
more businesses use these products in
their daily work they need to continue
innovation and making the user
experience as easy as possible this has
become impossible however with working
with Intel or AMD Intel's lack of
innovation and Andy's inability to
provide chips and high volume has forced
Microsoft to change how they develop new
products and with Apple being very
innovative with many of their products
Microsoft needs to make changes to keep
up society's demand for better products
Microsoft truly dropped the ball in the
mobile market and this is becoming more
apparent all the time and with the huge
success of Apple's iPhone and iPad
Microsoft got a solid wake-up call to
how badly they positioned themselves in
this market let's just face it they
failed arm was a major factor in Apple's
success and as new form factors are
being introduced Microsoft's make sure
they stay on the forefront of technology
as to not get left behind again like
they did previously in the mobile market
from foldable phones that will bridge
the gap between a phone and a tablet and
like I said before how long before we
see a phone or a tablet that can become
a full-blown PC or a screen that can be
stretched to be used with your phone
tablet or PC the possibilities are just
endless and arm technology will be the
key to these new products and allow new
innovation into the market Intel
themselves have been trying to make
their own low-power arm style CPU for
years with little success leaving the
door wide open for arm technologies to
gain market share and be implemented
into new products things like AV XD
and micro ops all run better on
risk-based architecture over a kiss'
base one due to their ability to run
better for parallel computing which is
the future and Intel has been using
these technologies to make their kis
type architecture work more like
risk-based text so that it can perform
better and this is obviously the way the
industry is headed adding more
instructions and bloats to the x86
system was fine when we were getting
amazing performance jumps every few
years but that is just not happening
anymore and with parallel computer
working better on risk-based
architecture things have to change as
the code gets more and more bloated
transistor switching this means there
are power higher requirements as well
Intel's y series of CPUs will continue
to have lower cores and require less
power Y arm CPUs use a simpler code that
requires less transistor switching and
less power so that they can develop
eight or sixteen core CPUs without the
need for huge amounts of power or memory
bandwidth making it a very appealing
technology for the future
this explains why Microsoft wants to
make the move to ARM based systems when
it comes to innovation but they still
have to consider overall hardware
performance if you take a look at the
very modest Snapdragon 835 CPUs running
against an i5 7 Y 54 CPU in x86
simulation apps the ARM based CPUs fall
significantly behind and the i-5 runs
about 50% faster in multi-threaded
applications and over 100 percent faster
in single threaded apps but when running
applications in the native arm 32-bit
code the 835 actually runs faster in
32-bit and comes very close in 64-bit
mode as well and let's just face it when
it comes to battery life there is no
contest at all with the 835 having the
ability to run for 16 hours compared to
the i5
ten-hour battery life which is almost
double these tests were all run on
identically based HP Envy x2 systems and
the 835 system comes to market at $100
less making it a more attractive buy too
many
on a budget so you get a system that may
not be as powerful in some instances but
in others it works better and the
battery life difference is major so it's
something to definitely consider these
CPUs come from an armed SOC that was a
bit old and was modified from phone
technology to work on a PC but now
Qualcomm is releasing the Snapdragon 800
seven millimeter eight core chip
designed solely for the laptop market
both AMD and Intel have new lower power
CPUs but how will they compare to the
eight CX is yet to be seen on the Intel
side of things we see the i7 860 5u with
a boost clock of 4.6 gigahertz four
cores eight threads and requires 15
watts of power and on the AMD side of
things we see the new rise in 3700 u
four cores eight threads and requires
also 15 watts of power and it also
contains a much powerful Vega graphics
processor on the other hand however we
have the new Qualcomm SDHC X coming to
market with lower standard clock speeds
and unknown boost clocks
it contains eight cores and requires
only seven watts of power so on paper
the HDX looks very promising the HDX
also contains an adrenal 680 GPU as well
it does seem though that AMD will most
likely have the most robust onboard
graphics chip the current arm products
that already use the Qualcomm 830 and
850 CPUs they can run many of today's
hottest game titles like fortnight pug B
and Grand Theft Auto 5 etc and it can
run them at 1080p as well and what's
really interesting is the 8c X is
supposed to be at least three times
faster than the previous generation ARM
based CPUs and a whopping 60 percent
more efficient than the 850 you can see
Qualcomm is really upping their game in
a short time on the PC platform the 8c X
will also support Vulcan and DX 12 so on
paper the specs look very competitive
against both Intel and a
d and if things move the way they want
they will also be able to compete
head-to-head with other resto seize and
put a dent in their sails all of these
things will be a very appealing factor
to all the major players like Dell HP
and others who can now make a profit and
still pass on that savings as the
consumer as well as advertising similar
performance in native programs and with
improved battery life which I feel is a
really important factor to many end
users Qualcomm is also working
hand-in-hand with Microsoft to run their
enterprise software and are working to
further support arm technology and this
could have a major impact on the market
at large Microsoft Surface line now has
some ARM based products but surface line
products will eventually be all based on
arm technology but for now we still see
Intel and arm versions of the surface
products another sector of business that
will also get the attention of arm will
be embedded desktop market like the
small atom based machines that Intel
currently sells that have been designed
for simple office work you know these
are those small little pieces you see in
bank's offices and other areas of
business and this market is a very huge
cash cow for Intel and currently no one
is really threatening that market but
Qualcomm those boys want a piece of the
action and that will take a lot of
Intel's profit away another factor is
many businesses work hand in hand with
Microsoft and having an option to sell a
system through their OMS and
manufacturing partners that would not
only be cheaper but possibly just as
powerful that is a very appealing factor
with Microsoft pushing for all
windows-based products to run on arm
technology that alone should be a huge
red flag to Intel especially the server
market once dominated by Intel alone
we'll also see more competition as ARM
based servers are also becoming more and
more relevant and this trend will most
likely have a snowball effect and
continue to grow segment by segment
Amazon
one of the biggest companies on the
globe just announced new ARM based
servers and it seems that many of your
well-known manufacturers will soon have
ARM based products for almost every
platform
there are many Intel based servers
currently running well everywhere but
arm servers cost up to two-thirds less
upfront than Xeon based servers and
since they use less power the savings in
the long run electric bills
is even more making them very attractive
to the eye of many new businesses that
want to save money not only up front but
in the long run as well AMD has also
entered the server arena and is already
giving Intel a bit of competition with
their epic line but ARM based servers
could be bad for both companies if you
look at the cost benefits alone arm
servers even in the current state are
very effective cost-saving solutions and
as more companies adopt ARM based tech
products both AMD and Intel will now
have to change their focus to compete
with this old but now more relevant ARM
based technology giant data servers that
rely heavily on saving power will also
turn their attention to servers that
save them money and overhead cost and
since Intel currently dominates this
aspect of the market they will be the
one who suffer the most by this
transition and look out Intel 7
nanometre ARM chips are coming and when
they become available with their higher
clock speeds and better performance we
will see arm technology being introduced
on probably every aspect of the market
since arm technology rules the mobile
and phone market and now Microsoft and
arm have teamed up to take on the
portable market as well Intel and AMD
who are both in this market
competitively will now have another form
of competition coming from supergiant
Microsoft who had the funds to invest to
make affordable and more user-friendly
products available to the public this
however is not the worst news to Intel
as Apple has now announced they are
seeking an ARM based solution for all of
their Mac product lineups including our
iMac as well as other Mac desktop
products this would mean no longer using
and buying Intel chips a serious
ouch to Intel's business model
the new iPad pro from Apple that runs on
arm technology is surprisingly a very
competitive and user-friendly device the
writing is on the wall arm tech is
coming of age and may soon be a huge
threat to Intel's business plans but
Intel is not dead yet as the x86 program
still run better on intel-based chips
and until more companies embrace native
arm code they will still have the chance
to make a comeback the terrible
integration of Intel's latest chips into
the new MacBook Pro showed serious
integration issues being so hot that
could not even run properly and that
just makes a cooler more efficient CPU a
clear roadmap choice for Apple arm is
nailing the coffin on intel on many
aspects of the industry and even Intel's
10 millimeter processors may not save
them from ARM based systems but this
industry it's a tricky Beast and until
may yet pull a rabbit from their hat and
avoid putting more nails in their own
coffin the bottom line is arm CPU
architecture has already started to
become more robust and we know its power
efficiency is better by a large margin
sowhat's popularity and support will
only grow as it gets better
will ARM architecture actually knock
Intel off their perch well it seems the
future may hold some hard times for big
blue and until better make some changes
fast or the hurting will be on thanks
