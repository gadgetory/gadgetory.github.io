welcome back once again to another
edition of tech of tomorrow it's been a
pretty really damn exciting week in the
tech world I mean there are just tons of
things going on if you're following it
you probably know what's going on for
the PCs enthusiasts they have a huge
thing called copy Tech's over in Taipei
and this thing is huge all the computer
vendors all gather there all kinds of
people are there I don't really like to
fly too much so that's kind of why I'm
not there and at the same time for Apple
lovers they had their WWDC where a lot
of things were talked about including
their new iOS 8 and their new Mac OS
which is going to be called Yosemite not
like the park or the Sam guy just
Yosemite now for the people out there
who hate on Mac I know that some of you
guys out there this isn't gonna be your
cup of tea but I've got a little dummy
mock-up model right here of one of the
supposed new iPhones is gonna be coming
out this fall and this thing's the
iPhone so called six now this thing has
a 4.7 inch screen and that's pretty much
what I know about it so far but I dig at
the dummy model in my hand so for you
people out there who are Mac fans going
hey this is pretty information that I'd
like to hear about well I have that
thing right here in my hand and it looks
pretty cool and compared to some of the
other iPhones that my friends have had I
have to say that even though this is the
dummy mock-up version it still seems to
be a lot better made now one thing I'd
want to clarify for the Apple fans crawl
out of the woodwork and start giving me
tons of when I say this thing's not
made well to me what it is it's very
very small when I hold it in my hand
just feels so small and so fragile that
I think I'm going to break it I mean I'm
a guy with big ass hands and I'm hearing
I think my hand just feels so small now
I know that some of the new Samsung
phones are kind of getting that way and
hopefully everybody will pick up their
damn ball and make a good phone that way
me and you don't have to worry about our
damn phone getting broke just because
it's got some cheese in this in it this
one feels a lot better a lot tougher has
a bigger screen I'm sure all the other
features about this are going to be
coming out as the months unfold but once
again back in the PC world over at
Computex all kinds of crazy is
going on now you guys all know they have
a brand new chip that is just hit the
market so the cpu that
talking about is the brand-new i7 4790k
Devil's Canyon CPU now this thing's
shown some amazing overclocking
capabilities with ln2 all the way up to
six point four gigahertz in the fives
when you're using Aaron water cooling
but to get six point four just right out
of the box the retail processor is
pretty damn good but the only ket side
to that is how many people are actually
gonna run lnto at their homes this is
where I get a little bit weird about the
overclocking world like Vince and
all these guys go out then they
overclock the share these CPUs but if
you ever seen the equipment that they
use to do it on like I own a couple of
them they're very expensive like the
machining cost almost $2,000 to get into
let's just using a little pop melon -
that can be pretty cheap but I actually
bought some of these phase machines and
to do this stuff isn't what the normal
home user is going to do so yeah for you
extremists out there this six point four
number is like oh yeah bad as I can
catch that but for you guys who are at
home which is so like me who build your
commute with liquid cooling and stuff
you're looking at getting interact the
five point four five point five range
which is still pretty damn good for the
brand new CPU from Intel like usual if
you guys want to see more information
about this down below that like button
we will have all the information just
hit the show more and you'll get all
that stuff down there below that like
button next up 4k we've been actually
talking a lot about 4k lately in fact
this video is being brought to you in 4k
some people out there don't quite
appreciate it yet a lot of people say oh
you know my monitor doesn't support 4k
but you can still see how clear it looks
even if you put it at even lower
resolutions it just looks so much
cleaner and with that in mind Intel is
now predicting that 4k monitors will hit
the market next year and around the $400
range so that's gonna be pretty damn
good as 4k makes its emergence on to the
scene you're gonna see lots and lots of
new stuff now what's really going to
piss you off is this though Sony and
others right now are fighting for 4k
dominance which means that right now
what's going on is if you buy a samsung
4k TV only the Samsung format of 4k
movies going to play on it and I
personally think that's just a total
bunch of you guys need to right
now fix the standard if I go out and buy
it for
okay movie it should play on every damn
TV and every monitor I have I want to
hear you guys opinions on that because
personally I think that is really an
affront to what everybody is trying to
do we're trying to get everything to
work together and that is just once
again segregating and making us work
apart also for you guys out there who
are loving portable gaming hey-zeus has
just announced there are OGG x 500
laptop now this thing's gonna be
incredible because it's kind of all the
super specs for gaming and a 4k monitors
so picture that man you can be out on
the go playing your games in full 4k in
a portable world now aside from the 3840
by 2160 screen resolution that measures
15.6 that is two hundred and eighty
pixels per inch this 2.2 kilogram beast
will feature i7 processors along with an
Nvidia GT 860m
one thing though you need to take in
consideration the flipside is this right
now anything to do with 4k takes massive
amounts of power to edit it to show it
everything and only like the 295 and 780
Ti right now have the power to really
push this stuff so will a laptop
actually truly have the power to pump
out 4k in a way that you're gonna like
while watching this video you guys may
have noticed that I have a system back
here behind me in case some of you guys
missed it I'm sure my loyal fans have
already seen this you're going yeah I've
