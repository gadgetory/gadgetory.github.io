back to channel again me buddy the dog G
behind the camera so here in America
it's Memorial Day and I know that you
know other countries have their own
Memorial Day and stuff and I wonder if
your guys Memorial days seem to be more
sacred to you folks out there in the
world than ours do because it seems like
every holiday we have Memorial Day
Christmas no matter what it is it
usually involves partying and spending
money which I don't mean to be a dick
but I mean is that what all these
holidays are really about I mean do they
actually mean a thing anymore
does any holiday mean anything Christmas
even though I know the people out there
don't believe in God or anything is
supposed to be a celebration now of
Christ you know that's what it's
supposed to be Christ's mass basically
but nobody really does that a few people
did is mostly about going out spending
money retail holiday and giving people
bunch of spending your money now
all my friends Memorial Day weekend
they're basically off to party I haven't
heard one person say hey man you know
it's really a sad thing about all those
dead soldiers over the years and that's
what it's about
I mean honestly in your country do you
hear back because here in America I
don't really ever hear anybody
addressing the holiday for what it's
about honestly they just don't
today's Memorial Day obviously there's
gonna be people out there partying
getting drunk is probably being fights
arrests all kinds of for the police
to deal with when all honesty memorials
today should be a more solemn event we
should all be taking the time to reflect
about all the soldiers that go out there
and die for the country I know some
people don't believe in soldiers or
anything in that but honestly those
soldiers died so that you could sit back
and talk about them and mock them
or do whatever you want to do because
without soldiers like that including
myself I'm a vet a lot of people
wouldn't have the freedoms that they
have so us dumbasses would go out and
join the military and go do that we do
so because we care about our country now
some people may say hey screw the
country screw that you know and to me I
was born here I was raised here so I'm
an all-american boy and I think we
should all take time to honestly reflect
on Memorial Day about all the people who
have died to do that not just from our
country from all of you countries around
the world I know that everybody has a
military service and everybody's lost
family friends loved ones in some kind
of crazy-ass event that they're probably
not even being told the truth about
about how they
and that's just how it goes so honestly
for a moment let's just all reflect and
be appreciated that people that have
given their lives so that we can all
enjoy the lifestyles and the freedom
that we have I'm our buddy here's you
behind the camera happy Memorial Day for
everybody out there don't get too drunk
and too up and get your ass
landed in jail or a ticket or anything
like that
take it mellow and just have an
enjoyable weekend if you can reflect on
why you're actually having this weekend
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
