star go far
a movie star drive a big car what's up
guys they call me Cypress over the hill
so hey what's up guys me I work here
once again on Tech or tomorrow
now I low a lot of you folks out there
want to be youtubers I get emails about
it all the time I don't only have a time
on time to give everybody a personal
like introduction on it so I thought I'd
do a video on it so basically today's
video is so you want to be a youtuber
right well let me talk to you guys a
little bit about being a youtuber one of
the very first things if you've been
thinking about being a youtuber is
deciding what exactly do you want to do
on YouTube and is your YouTube
experience a business one are you
looking to build yourself a dedicated
audience and make money and be totally
you know dedicated to YouTube as your
full-time job because that's pretty much
what I do
that's what I do all the time and that's
the first thing you gotta decide for
yourself do I always want to do this for
fun and maybe make a few bucks if I'm
lucky or do I want to dedicate my time
to doing this and to be a full-time
youtuber now being a full-time youtuber
a lot of people think oh my god it's
just free products and free and all
that stuff but there's actually a lot
more involved if you want to be doing
this for business a lot more stuff
there's contracts Everywhere agreements
with people you have lots of price I can
build up you don't do the reviews you
get in trouble so one of the first
things you just gotta absolutely decide
is what am I doing here on YouTube and
once you get that out of the way the
next thing you really want to decide is
well what exactly do I want to cover do
I want to cover computer parts so I want
to cover guitars do I want to cover
consumer electronics TVs watches
whatever you have to decide what exactly
you want to do and then focus in on that
you can't really spread yourself too
thin lis trying to do a bunch of stuff
cuz you'll actually distract your
viewers that's happened to me before I
just start doing some random cuz
I'm like hey this sounds like fun if
you're like dude would you doing in
your channel what are you doing here so
though it's like the first two things
and then I got to tell everybody like
one of the biggest things and you have
to ask yourself this is how much do you
really like
hagh Rafi and editing and all this kind
of stuff now my adopted son Jonathan
from TLD like his whole life has been
like dedicated to liking that kind of
stuff like as long as I've known him
he's loved cameras he loves odd stuff in
fact he's the one who pushed me over
into like doing YouTube stuff because I
was a writer most of my life but he
loves his stuff and you guys can see how
big his channel is I mean I'm will admit
I'm not really too much into photography
I kind of suck at it which is why the
cameramen obviously and I don't really
know too much about the editing part of
it I know about products and I like to
do videos and I have a good time doing
it so I mean I have people to help me do
that but if you really are into that
type of stuff you're gonna have a much
better chance right off the bat of being
a youtuber because if you love all that
stuff and you can be self-sufficient
doing it you'll have a much better
chance of doing stuff for one you got to
pay other people you don't have anybody
else involved it's best to be
self-sufficient now the next question
you got to ask yourself is do you have a
personality that's funny and
entertaining because let's face it
nobody wants to go watch a YouTube on
video where some sour puss
sitting there going we all work all day
when we go out and we watched YouTube
videos even I've learned myself it's
much better to be entertaining so can
you be an entertaining person because if
you're Bob with no personality and
you're trying to make youtube videos you
probably won't be very successful no
matter how good of a cameramen or editor
you are because let's just face it
people come to my youtube channel I
don't even know if they even care about
the products like most of my friends say
dude I just come to the channel to see
you because you're funnier than and
I like it so people come to the channel
to see your personality but the better
your technical skills and how good
you're doing stuff also counts I mean
you can see the guys that are out there
that are doing these huge channels
marques you can see him you know unbox
therapy oh man I'm having a brain fart
here um I got Austin hospital beds I was
like hey guys but all those guys that I
know they really love photography and
they love editing a lot more than I
honestly do these guys live for that
kind of stuff so if you have that type
of personality and you see these guys
they're all friendly they're having fun
that I would actually have to say that
you might actually be a candidate to
become a youtuber so
this is just part one I'm gonna do a
four-part series where I talk about
different things so if you're choosing
your area and stuff I'll tell you how
you can work on that and get stuff I'll
talk about how financials go I'll talk
to you about how to tag and do your
video so that you can get the absolute
best optimization and SEO when you put
your video up so we'll just do a few of
these videos but first up this is video
one so if you want to be a youtuber take
a really hard cold look at yourself take
a look at your skill set and then if you
have those things that I talked about
then hey man you might be an
up-and-coming youtuber and as you can
see many people have a lot of success
now if you talk to John he'll say oh man
you know all these channels Bob elated
they don't do it it's like Oh Bob but
honestly I think that the more funny you
are the more people want to come see you
over and over again is how you're gonna
get a crowd because I've seen guys out
there who have websites and I watch
their stuff and you ever heard the old
expression you know a smiles not in the
in the mouth it's in the eyes you can
tell from someone's eyes if they're
really having a good time or just faking
the you know I mean because people
can be a comedian they could be like a
 hate comedy actor they've been
doing for years you know I mean but they
still go do it a channel and you can see
it in their eyes that they're not really
too much into it you know what I mean
and so I think that really has a lot to
do with it so like I said if you love
camera stuff you love all that stuff
you're into technology and you think you
have a funny personality then I think
you qualify for step one of there's a
video to consider that you might just be
the next person to be a great youtuber
I'm Eric you've been watching teching
tomorrow we've got more videos please
let me know the information down below
anything that you guys want to know or
ask please leave me a comment down below
and I'll be happy to address all of them
in the future videos this is part one
peace out
we'll see you do you got it what it
takes to be a youtuber</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
