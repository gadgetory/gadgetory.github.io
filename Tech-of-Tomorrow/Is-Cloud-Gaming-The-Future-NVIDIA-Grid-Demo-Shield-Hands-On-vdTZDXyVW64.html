echo tomorrow at our coverage of CES
2014 once again here with Andrew fear of
nvidia and this time we're going to talk
to you guys about something called their
grid this is beta technology where
basically you can be able to download on
to your device that's right this is
going to be unbelievable on your shield
wherever you go they're going to have
games for free for you to download i'm
going to enter talks more about this but
this is really exciting stuff yeah this
is really good evil technology so in the
latest shield software update we
launched their great beta app and what
this does it look next into our servers
in Northern California and we have about
10 games load on the server where users
can log in and play any game and the
cool thing is up you don't even need a
two-force pc to do it you don't need any
pc this is connecting to a server so you
can see here i have a library of
selection of games i can simply just go
through find a game and i click a button
and that was happening as the server is
now starting up the game is starting to
see the game
sending it to my shield device right
here you can see here that took only a
couple seconds launched this is now
streaming super street fighter 4
directly to this device there's no
download occurring I not to download it
it's not an android game it's all
literally a video stream coming and it's
absolutely totally free no charge at all
right now they think they got about
maybe what is it let you have a 10
titles right now you guys have we have
about 10 titles right now we have
capacity for about five thousand users
we are the servers are in Northern
California but I've had people connect
as far away as Florida Philadelphia even
Ireland Ireland lat IL ads and I are
when they're connecting and playing on
their shield so that's really cool stuff
now when's it's going to be available
for the public to be able to get their
hands on and start playing with but you
can do it now you're a shield owner it's
not a bit we made it something available
adjust for shield owners we haven't
decided what we're gonna do with it or
if we're going to make it like a paid
for service yet so right now it's just
made up will probably last you know four
to six months and after that we'll
figure out what to do with it right on
alright well thank you very much Android
totally appreciate that man awesome
enjoyed the show thank you see you guys
