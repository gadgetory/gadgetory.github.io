in the mail and I went and looked up how
much it costs I was like totally blown
away I'm like wow a gaming mouse but a
gaming mouse that actually cost over a
hundred bucks that's right now we all
know that things with you know the title
gaming on them sometimes you know put a
little bit of a higher price tag on them
and a lot of times these particular
products don't really deserve to have
that on it now when I saw the price of
this the first thing I really wanted to
do is just say alright man I want to
beat this thing up because epic gears
what are you thinking trying to sell a
mouse at this high of a price how dare
you but as I started playing with the
mouse and start checking out all the
features of it and everything I was kind
of like hey wow this is kind of a really
cool product I mean it honestly has more
options than any other mouse that I've
ever seen out there be it for a gaming
mouse industrial mouse working mouse
Mickey freaking Mouse it has a lot of
different options now first off most of
the products that you buy out there on
the market are either left-handed or
right-handed this particular product is
not either one it's ambidextrous you can
use it with your right hand you can use
it with your left hand you know so it
doesn't really matter if your user out
there who is a left-handed person you
can get this Mouse and be totally comfy
if you're a right-handed person the same
type of deal or maybe you're a person
who can use both hands at the same time
do you conduct two of these up and have
double the shooting capacity wouldn't it
be cool if you could do that I don't
know if you could but could you imagine
that dual gaming mice you're trying to
shoot somebody's head shot with two to
promise'
oh and if you're really good maybe you
could shoot two people at once woo you
get some serious point this thing games
then wouldn't yet many ways all right
this particular product is really
interesting because for one thing it has
like I said lots of features now on this
particular Mouse there are seven buttons
six of them programmable you have a mid
scroll button as well like usual you can
do all of your adjustments on the fly
right here on the top of the mouse which
is like really cool so if you
want to change with the DPI's you can do
it all on the fly time to worry about
that and you can actually change by
these modular cartridges the different
type of Gaming Mouse that it is or its
right you can either make it so it's an
optical mouse or you can make it so that
it's a laser mouse that's right and
there's also two different Emraan
switches for your buttons up here so you
can change between the purple and the
orange now the orange buttons they're
got 20-member gotten they got man twenty
million clicks and on the purple which
are considered the pro version fifty
million clicks now another thing it's
kind of trippy is the modular devices
that you can change out the optical it
actually is twelve thousand dpi
yeah twelve thousand dpi and 8200 dpi on
the laser one thing you're gonna notice
is that the morpha x comes in a metal
box that's right this thing is
definitely a heavy metal for sure and
inside of that little metal box are all
kinds of cool stuff right off the bat
you're gonna see there's a QuickStart
guide then you're gonna see there's the
different modular devices like I said
before there's two different types there
is a laser and there's an optical you
also get the purple and the arm switches
like I said you get the removal tool now
you know this is this little epic gear
thing to the left actually there's
nothing there it's just actually showing
you the nomenclature now another thing
that's really cool about this particular
product is it can look two different
ways that's right so if you don't like
one color you get both it guess what you
can change the color to what you want it
to be also inside the ten you get the
mouse itself obviously it comes with a
1.8 metre graded cable which also has a
gold-plated in so it should last quite a
while now before I jump in and actually
disassemble this bad boy I want to talk
about a couple other things now in many
of the products that you see out there
they have gaming profiles but these
gaming profiles in this particular
device you get five of them and they
also have LED lighting that you can
match up with that by the way didn't
mention that before BES it as complete
RGB lighting and you can program that
stuff to your heart's content but the
best thing
is is that you can scroll through all of
those gaming profiles right here with
this little button on the mouse I just
think that's pretty cool so other things
about this mouse that are pretty cool is
it has adjustable weights there are
actually 4 5 by 15 5 gram little weights
inside this bad boy that are magnetic
I'm gonna take it apart and show you
guys that and also something that's
really cool is that you know many people
when they're gaming they have different
ways where they lift the mouse up and
all this type of different stuff in
their plane they lift up they go over
here and do this well this particular
product actually has programmability
to match that so however your gaming
style is you can set it to that now
that's just some really cool stuff it
really is really interesting now check
this out this thing can be disassembled
so easily as pressive pops off now you
can see right in here there are the four
little weights all these little weights
are removable so no matter what kind of
weight profile that you get their
magnetic later do I pop one out of there
they can pop in and out I like them with
all the weights in it myself
that's just my preferable I like a
really heavy Mouse but if you don't like
that and you want to make it lighter
it's really easy to do they need to
continue disassembly just pop off this
part right here and now you guys can see
right in here we have the orange Omron
switches these ones I told you I have
you know 20 million clicks of the
lifespan so we're probably gonna last
forever now on the bottom your lost
little thing right here you can pull it
out go here we're going to go ahead and
get this right here so I'm going to
change out that particular part now and
by the way we're changing out the
optical sensor for the laser sensor I'm
just gonna go ahead and pop that in
there now one thing interesting about
the different sensor cartridges the
optical sensor cartridge has up to 250
IPS tracking speed and 50g acceleration
and the laser sensor cartridge has up to
a 150 IPS tracking speed and 30g
acceleration the Morpha x has an
adjustable report rate of 125 to a
thousand Hertz and remove the on run
switches they're really easy as well you
just use the included tool they pop in
and out really simple and like I said
before you can change the color
of the mouse which is really cool so we
can put this mouse together and we'll
take it from being gray to now being a
little white mouse a lil white mouse
well pop these things in there's two
little clips here you got a pop on once
those are wrong is popped back piece on
and voila now we have a white gaming
mouse um personally I don't like the
white one I honestly think that the
silver or gray whatever color you want
to call this face Gray Ghost gray I
don't know whatever color calling it
silver I like this particular call let
me know what you guys think let me know
what color you guys think as well now as
far as in gaming goes the mouse worked
really easy
I couldn't tell much of a difference
though between using the laser and the
optical I'm not a professional gamer you
know I'm a hobbyist gamer guy you know I
like first-person shooters with all that
type of stuff I didn't really see any
great difference and pretty much between
the two different switches they felt a
lot of light to me there wasn't really
any noise difference or anything like
that they both work absolutely fine
being able to program when you lift your
hand off the table when you're gaming
that's kind of interesting to do because
I noticed that what I'm gaming it just
depends on what I'm doing as well you
know what game I'm playing is how often
I'm moving my hand cuz some things I
totally keep my hand on the table I
don't ever move it other times I'm
lifting it up and moving it around so
just having that ability is a really
cool thing like most products nowadays
yes there is a software suite and guess
what yes you download it from the
website nothing new there right and
pretty much you can program anything in
this mouse honestly probably hence its
name I mean you can change everything in
it to your heart's content you honestly
can when we first got this product like
I said I really kind of wanted to feel
like oh man you're like you're over a
hundred bucks but
no but honestly at the end of the day
after playing around with it and seeing
it even though I really couldn't tell
you know much of a difference I can say
this I had absolutely no problem with
the product whatsoever even you know
read everything even on a straight-up
desk without a mousepad whatsoever I was
just playing on the desktop and it
worked just fine when I put it on a
mousepad it didn't really matter what
type of mousepad that I was using it
just seemed like the different type of
mouse pads that I use it got a little
bit faster like I was using one of those
really hard matte mouse pads it was
going it seemed a lot faster when I was
just using the desktop but that could
just be me but overall it's a really
solid product and there really is no
other product on the market that can
make all of these different changes for
the product so even though at the very
beginning of the video I wanted to be
like no I think it's a really good
product now for people who have medium
to small hands this will probably be a
really nice product for you I have a
medium sized hand it fits perfectly for
me all the buttons are really well
placed I mean the buttons are pretty
much the standard said it but you're
always gonna see you got your to click
buttons right here your scroll wheel and
you get the two side buttons over here
just like pretty much every other Mouse
out there um it is very comfortable it's
wide enough for I don't feel like my
hands completely smothering it if you
have a really giant size hand than I
think that you know may be a problem for
you and there's probably some
professional gamers out there and if
people who are even more into gaming
that I am can can tell you know a little
bit more of the subtlety about the
nuances about this particular product
than I do like I said I'm a hobbyist
gamer I love to game and do all that
stuff but there are some people out
there who are totally pro gamer you know
pro gaming people and they might be able
to notice these little nuances even more
than I do
but hey I'm Alaric thanks for watching
techno Mar like usual we'll have a link
down below so if you guys want to check
out more information about this I even
think there's a few other videos out
there on the market and I pretty much
think that everybody out there who has
done a review on this product has said
hey it's great other than some guy in
Amazon who was like this thing's
terrible and I don't know if I really
trust his review or not because he
didn't give any specifics of other why
it was terrible he was just like oh my
god it's terrible
and I don't really think I trust that as
review I actually probably trust people
who take the time to take it out play
with it mess around that and do that
kind of stuff you know those kind of
people I'm gonna trust more than just
somebody who leaves a random you know
message on a you know on a page on
Amazon so hey if you guys aren't sub hey
