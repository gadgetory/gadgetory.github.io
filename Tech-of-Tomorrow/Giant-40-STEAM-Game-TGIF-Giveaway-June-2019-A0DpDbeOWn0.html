guess what it is that's right it's TGIF
Friday and that means more games for you
the fans and this week I'm just gonna be
giving out 40 different steam codes to
all of my fans whether you're follow me
on patreon Instagram Twitter wherever
you're following me at we're gonna make
sure that we get about 10 games to all
of those people now a lot of people say
oh I don't use social media blah blah
blah I mean you don't really have to
totally use social media I mean even
have an account you don't really have to
do it and if you want a chance to win a
free game and these are actually really
good games to like no one's ever
complaining that it's a bad game most
the time I get people thanking me how
much they like the game and a lot of
times I spend you know time trying to
find games that certain people like to
play so it's well worth your while to do
it all you need to do is be following us
here on Tucker tomorrow on our social
media things is the same thing all you
do is follow like share leave a comment
and then I'll be picking 10 winners from
each one of those social media
categories and then giving out all those
games to you folks it's really easy it's
really fun stuff and why not have a
chance to get a free game and if you
follow me on the social media platforms
you can see that people have been just
really stoked with all the games that
I've been giving out so I like to give
back to the community as much as
possible this is a pretty cool way to do
it so there you have it I don't care if
you're sub to this techo tomorrow
channel I mean I'd appreciate views of
it but it doesn't seem like the sub
counter you've been working in fact what
I've heard is for every sub that we get
it actually takes away 4 subs so you can
try it out yourself but that's whether
people have been saying this thing is
just completely broken but we're here
until we're doomed so hey you know what
to do like leave a comment and I will be
picking you don't worry you know I'm not
there's nothing really to do here you
know except for the announcement here on
YouTube I can't contact you on youtube
there's no information exchange youtube
basically sucks on many levels that's
why we're trying to slowly switch things
off to patreon but there you have it
hey go check out the social media stuff
we'll have
links down below to all those different
places so just go over there follow the
few steps and then you could win a
really cool steam game peace out
thanks for being a fan of techadon
warning if you're not a fan you just
want to be a free game hey I'm down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
