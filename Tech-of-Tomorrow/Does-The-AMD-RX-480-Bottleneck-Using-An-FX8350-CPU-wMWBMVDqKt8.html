in a cave underneath the ocean or just
out in space you guys all know that the
brand new AMD R X 480 has hit the market
this morning
Suzy at MDA lifted we had that video for
you now you guys can see in that video
if you happen to miss it for some reason
we'll have it back here behind me you
guys can see that the RX 480 is doing
really great at 1080p and 1440p in fact
the scores are almost identical there
you just barely even noticeable
difference between the two which is
great now we omitted the 4k stuff
because this card that we're testing a
gigabyte version it's about $300 so it's
not really geared for total 4k but we're
going to do another video on that
anyways later but I know many people out
there in the world have AMD based
systems a lot of people have 83 50s a
lot of people have 60 163 hundreds
basically there's a lot of AMD CPUs out
there now you guys all saw that last
week we built the icarus system and you
guys all said hey man why don't you wait
till the 480 comes little boy hey we
told you we'd revisit it so check it out
we're revisiting so this is pretty much
the Icarus system with the brand new rx
480 inside of it let's test this
motherfrakker out and let's see how it
does on the AMD platform and just real
quick before we rock out to the
benchmark song if you guys want a list
of all these parts we'll have them down
below that like button which hopefully
you guys go crazy on now let's rock out
and let's check out those benches
so I folks there you have an AMD
platform and the brand-new Rx for you
you guys can see that this thing is
still pretty much consistently at 60
frames per second with the game turned
up with pretty much all their stuff to
the maximum you can adjust settings
around and if you want to you can pretty
much guarantee 60 frames per second at
every game at 1080 and 1440 you might
have to mess with the settings a little
bit but you can get there no problem
even with the game set at their highest
things you might have sacrificed just
like one thing or the other it's not
going to really affect the overall
gameplay it's it's a matter of
preference so $300 card in the AMD
system you guys can see it's kicking ass
now the only aspect about this card that
like just wasn't very good at all was
the overclocking the overclocking of
this card just was not great whatsoever
the boost on the card
most of the time ran at about 12 66 and
1267 which is really weird because
that's almost exactly what AMD did
predict act to be so that was very
accurate in their Department on that
thing but beyond that hey do you guys
don't want to spend a lot of money and
especially if you're an AMD fan these
cards are going to be about $300 for the
8 gigabyte version and come on 1440p 10a
that's where most of the action is this
day these days anyways and the 480 it's
kicking ass with a using Intel system or
as you can see an AMD based system I'm
Eric you can watch in TECO tomorrow
we've got more videos coming in put the
rx 40 gameplay and more see you here on
the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
