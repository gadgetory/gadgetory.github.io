once again at Echo tomorrow now you guys
may have heard that google has a new
product that's hitting the market this
is the new Nexus 7 made by the good
folks over at a sous now these things
aren't going to be in the market till
next month but we were lucky enough to
get our hands on one and I've got it
right here in the box so today we're
going to bring you guys the first look
you know basically kind of an unboxing
and then we're going to compare it to
what it's geared at competing at which
is the new Kindle Fire product now both
these products come into market at one
hundred and ninety nine dollars but
there are some very significant
differences between that and this
product now I really know that Amazon is
really great for reading books and
they're probably still going to be the
leader in that department but this
thing's made to work with Google's own
store so not only buying this product
you're actually buying into the Google
store now if any of you guys want to
know off the bat we actually took a look
at this and we were actually quite
shocked to see that you cannot put at
all any type of Kindle app on here now
mostly their products out the market
that I've seen you at least allow you to
stick a kindle app on it use it this one
did not have that available I don't know
if they will in the future I know
they're competing but you know people do
like a choice so right here's the
product I don't really have a complete
unboxing because my friend John who lent
it to me his channel is out there and
that's tldtoday or tech packs lunch and
dinner he's the guy who went to me
thanks Jonathan so he didn't actually
give me the charger so I don't have the
charger everything else is actually here
but the charger so we got the box right
here
get it out of here
sooo anyways guys after a minute there
Rory you guys saw I open the box up and
this thing actually fell to the floor ok
what fell to the floor it broke we were
able to put it back together and it's
actually pretty damn durable it's
actually working no problems no damage
whatsoever to it this thing has a lot of
unique features in it it features the
NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor now
this thing is a little tablet with a
quad-core processor the kindle fire it
has a dual core processor so right off
the bat you know you're going to get
more power with the new google nexus 7
now the screen also features a higher
resolution and on full brightness there
actually is a big difference you can see
them a lot clearer so here my hand and
bring up to you guys just show you guys
the screen real quick flip it around
show you guys the back this is the white
special edition one that only developers
got to the side angle so let's start out
by taking a look at the screen that I
have right here in my hand the screen
features a 7 inch 1280 by 800 HD display
216 PPI it's a backlit IPS display and
has a hundred and seventy eight degree
viewing angle now one of the big
differences I noticed between this is
the kindle is if you set both these on
the table which we're going to show you
in a couple of minutes you'll see the
difference this one still remains very
very clear where the kindle begins to
fade the farther that you go and the
difference of the angle that you're
looking at this one also features a
front-mounted 1.2 megapixel camera you
can see that right up here on the top of
this the screen is also made of scratch
resistant corningware glass now can you
guys at the writ of scientific glass the
stuff they used to blow inside of the
laboratory and all that this is that
type of screen but at another level
because it features anti-scratch so that
means it's not going to scratch your
Dean you might have to run by lands
expensive covers to put on it it's just
going to look good this thing is also
really cool because you can watch videos
and movies for up to nine hours you can
surf the internet for up to ten hours
just generally stood me around and look
how very very just clear it is
these are all your magazines and such I
guess John likes Family Circle how sweet
these are his apps not my I just want to
say it's got bruce looking like a boss
now you guys know that the main
application that most Android units have
been using out there even if you
jailbreak the thing as they so called it
has been the Ice Cream Sandwich well
this is actually a newer version I saw a
lot of comments on the videos asking
what that is this is jelly bean and so
jelly beans only available currently on
this particular unit now all the
wireless stuff and all that stuff that
you're going to use the same exact type
of things you have on the Kindle Fire
their wireless features are all exactly
the same they do the exact type of
things they both have a standard USB
connection for charging and they both
have an internal keyboard and we'll show
those differences in those look like as
well so this thing way it's about 12
ounces the kindle actually weighs about
14 ounces the kindle is actually a
little bit thicker this one's a little
bit thinner now let's just use some head
to head comparisons between the new
google nexus 7 and the kindle fire
alright folks so here we have them side
by side on the left we have the new
google nexus 7 on the right we have the
amazon kindle fire now the main
differences between the two are the way
that they get their information and how
they use it the one on the left you're
going to be using google play you're
going to be using the amazon store on
the kindle fire that's pretty much the
mainstay so I feel right now that
Kendall is still really geared towards
books it was the book leader it was the
company that basically start up with the
books so they're going to be the people
who are going to be doing the most with
books now Google Play though is totally
geared towards gaming and all that type
of stuff and I think it's going to be
more in that direction now you can see
they both feature a 7-inch screen but if
you move these around in different
directions you can see that the angle on
this allows you to still totally view it
very clearly 178 degree viewing angle on
this plus it's 1280 x 800 the resolution
of the kindle fire is 10 too
for x 600 so there's a big difference
right off the bat and the resolution and
the way you can view it if you turn the
angle on this one a lot you can see that
the viewing on at the screen gets more
blurry and more blurry just try to show
it you know apples to apples or oranges
orange how you put up put them together
start moving them together you can see
you can still see the google one much
better as you change the angles it's
much much better as far as the battery
life they're pretty much equal this
one's supposed to have a little bit
longer of a battery life this one is
both thicker and weighs more this one
weighs 14 ounces which is just 2 ounces
under a pound this one weighs 12 ounces
and is much thinner just flip around to
the back now they make people care about
the back but you can see the back on
this one it's made of it like a nice
soft plastic rubber type this is made of
semi type material you can see this one
clearly says Kendall this one clearly
says Nexus here's what it looks like
when you turn both units on this one you
slide to unlock this new slide the
opposite direction to unlock now there's
some really cool stuff on this as when
watching a movie let's take a look now
let's actually see what a movie it looks
like you guys can see a movies very very
clear on here you can also put
headphones in like an usual many other
device is doing headphones if you want
to hear clarity and have privacy but the
screen itself very very clear the IPS
display is very nice but alright so
that's looking at a movie so we'll get
back out of there you can see it right
there Transformers Dark Side of the Moon
get out of here here's what it shows you
like all the different types of stuff
that you have on here has
recommendations and everything you can
go back into the google play store has
all the different TV shows all of your
different apps so if you guys are inside
the app store and you want to go and you
surf the net make a couple clicks over
you got some choices you can go right
over to google chrome and bang you're
right out on to the net you can go to
youtube and hey check this out on
youtube there are some videos lose this
guy wait I think I recognize this
handsome fellow hey I know this guy you
guys know what that is though but you
can watch all your videos and stuff like
that you have google search you can go
right in there and type your google
search now on the kindle fire it has the
internet but it works a little bit
differently there's search engine search
features are slightly different I got to
say something the quad processor
compared to the dual core processor does
make a big difference for like anything
you want to want to be doing as far as
watching videos multimedia and
everything like that it's obviously the
Nexus 7 is going to blow away the kindle
because it's newer technology and the
kindle I really feel was geared towards
a guy you know wants you to read books
and it's really for books my mom has
been used this thing quite a while she
likes it I actually bought the nexus 7
for myself but I'm sure there's a whole
lot of more differences I just got this
tablet and today so I'm learning about
it but you guys can see that there are
some significant differences between the
new Nexus 7 and the old kindle fire I
say old nap because you know this is
geared to be the kindle killer now this
is one option I think that really is
going to make a difference to people
because for me the bigger the key is the
easier my chubby little fingers can
smack on to them you guys can see the
kindle fire on the right it has much
smaller keys than the new Nexus 7 the
Nexus 7 has much larger keys and those
will be easier to hit for people with
chubby little fingers like me a small
but I think a pretty good feature to
point out also let's show you guys how
to turn the volume turn the volume up to
full blast genocide that's right
up and down the volume turn that bad
with full blast here we go everybody's
favorite Angry Birds let's get a little
angry alright everybody so let's play
what I feel it's like when the most
popular games and finest games there is
that simple that's hangry birds walk it
down Oh who's your daddy i'm hearing the
little second level here now just a
little venturing here in the screen also
musically which is kind of cool you can
make it small as you guys to see i miss
there do they change the screen but
death can see you can change it which is
x here and i'm really stinking here
these that and revert oh hey look at
that Kabam
all right let me go back to the same
screen size all right guys here we got
another game on here this is the old
fruit ninjas is actually a free app so
anybody can get it they're gonna start a
new game take the classic hey hold the
bombs away one thing got to be really
careful of is hitting the home button
cuz if you hit it it just takes you
completely out of the game now it's a
few times nice you got to really keep
your finger inside the screen here it's
actually easier that way to free fruit
combo good
oh well anyways game over but that was
fun so hey everybody today you know we
brought you guys the Nexus 7 is our
hands-on look it really feels nice it's
very easy to browse I'm not saying that
the Kindle Fire is a hard product to use
because by no means is it but this one
to me is more going towards the lines of
becoming a really portable tablet with
lots of features you can easily check
your email on this watch videos do all
kinds of other stuff let me hear you
guys has questions let me hear you guys
opinions let me know if you guys plan on
buying one and why and then we'll get
more information on this thing and bring
you guys into the video in the future as
I actually learn more about the tablet
like I said I've just had it a day and
i'll compare him some more thanks for
watching we'll see you back around teka
