hey what's going on fellow youtubers I
work here once again on Tek doum are you
guys all know battlefield one has hit
the stores and we've got ourselves a
copy and we've been playing the shit of
it the last couple of days now most
people out there don't have really
really high-end systems in fact lots of
people have older systems with older
parts in them that they've just upgraded
so few folks out there who have an older
AMD system and you're thinking about
upgrading to a 40 or you have a 40 or
thinking about buying the game let's
check out battlefield one on our system
that was under 600 bucks now the first
thing you're going to see is all of the
settings and we put everything to its
most uber and ultra settings so there's
nothing else you can set higher in the
game and now we can check out the system
that we built now you guys can see this
systems built up an AMD 6300 with an RX
for eighty eight gigabytes of memory a
one terabyte hard drive and msi 970
gaming motherboard and finally a la
justice case that actually has a 40
power supply built inside that powers
the entire system just fine now let's
jump in though and let's check out
battlefield one on this system and see
how it kicks ass in game
sir
Oh
you guys can see the graphics inside of
this game or just freaking amazing and
this games kill or everything's
exploding around you and shit and you
can get killed so fast if you don't pay
attention to what the hell you're doing
because this game is really quick action
we've jumped back in time obviously with
battlefield 1 and during the campaign
mode is kind of crazy cuz you do some
funny stuff as you move along through
the game so let's just move along and
start shooting shit
we came from all over the world so many
of us think in this world would be all
right of passage our great adventure let
me tell you
Oh
avoided the charger overrun we need to
bust through TV I am counting on us
you damaged in east wind around keep
going driver
keep your eye on the ground ha
do that machine got clothing down
we've got them on the run haha
katrien country
well chase friends all the way back to
Berlin
if you get a clear shot on that block
and feel God you taking
hold on
time field gun
shoot that will come of it
good shot open up our fr√§ulein
stay focused man
push-on damaged roof for anything that
moves
making of my game
instead of adventure we found fear una
casa
ship coming down
now flying is also a lot of fun and you
can do it with the keyboard mouse you
don't actually need a controller or a
joystick and that makes it really cool
and once again you guys can see the
graphics are just freaking killer
having fun
it's wilson and pay attention eyes
forward
some of them wasn't exactly by the book
so toss the damn book and live a little
where's he going now leave it see those
rocket balloons weapons check fire will
I can do that
watch with that
you see those targets on the ground yeah
I see them try using the Rockets on them
get a film buried in the ground targets
jasus crushed what do you think we shoot
him down
hold on
you all right back there I make that up
looks like there's only one black
you can say that again less than 3 now
we're at to be doing if you feel really
dangerous trust me
watch my back
like taking position below I see them
let's put them out of action quickly
Jack him up
just a few hotties left
nice like that
it's kind of strange and I think it
might have something to do with the
recording software we're using since
fraps wouldn't work whatsoever and we
didn't want to bother hooking up all
that hardware stuff but you guys can see
that sometimes the game does dip down to
like a very low frame per second only
from a nude second and then it jumps
back up so we're seeing 90 frames per
second almost at the highest and when it
dips all the way down to the bottom huh
it's kind of down there but it's only
for a quick second and I think it might
have a lot to do with the recording
software not actually the video card
itself
stay on the fighters until the next wave
Rosie
at the end of the day though folks you
guys can see it does not take an
expensive system whatsoever to play
battlefield one and get those great
frames per second everything pretty much
about the game you guys saw is over 60
frames per second obviously there's a
dip here and there and like I said
previously that might have something do
with the recording software because when
it's not on we're not really seeing that
whatsoever and when you're in game you
really don't notice it at all either
it's kind of like almost like a blink of
an eye and then you're back and going so
obviously a system that's under 600
bucks with the RX 480 is kicking ass and
playing battlefield one like a
muthafucka and if you guys want to build
a system like this for yourself we'll
have links down below like button where
you can check this out and build one for
yourself make the changes you like I'm
Eric you've been watching Tecna tomorrow
we'll see you guys back on here for more
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
