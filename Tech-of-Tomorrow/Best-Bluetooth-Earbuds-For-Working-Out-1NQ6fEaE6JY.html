mellow sound hey welcome back glad to
see you guys here once again on the
channel many folks out there have a very
very active lifestyle for those people
having a pair of earbuds that not only
can they listen their music on they can
also answer their phone and still do
normal things while doing their workout
is very very important and if you're
like me I really don't like to invest a
whole lot of money when I have wireless
Bluetooth headphones you know especially
the inner type because at the gym
they're very easy to get lost or damaged
or something like that and you really
don't want to invest hundreds of dollars
in these things because face it you're
out running around jumping around doing
things at the gym with weights very easy
to get smashed so for me under $30.00 is
a very optimal and a great price point
for this type of product now today we're
going to be looking at something from
mellow sound first time we looked up
were like Miele sound like nope it's
mellow sound keep you feeling Mel so
what are the mellow sounds well these
things are pretty cool because they're
under $30 they're wireless bluetooth 4.1
noise cancellation 6.0 which that means
pretty much is that when you answer your
phone and do stuff like that you'll get
cleaner conversation time because it
keeps out kind of the ambient noise the
background no it's not going to
completely like block out everything's
or like your depth the music's off but
it's pretty good for like engine noise
on a plane or background noises a gym
and stuff like that all the operations
on these things are simple so with that
said though let's real quick let's check
out what comes in the box the features
and then why for 30 bucks these things
are a great deal the bellow sounds come
in this nice little box and inside the
little box they come inside their own
little case so we'll first off we'll pop
that out of there but I think today oh
there's also whoo look at that balancing
act there's also their own instruction
guide so if you for some reason don't
know how to connect to your Bluetooth or
something or don't know what it is or
something maybe this will be like you're
a holy
maybe no anyways that's out of the way
so other than that though everything
else you want is inside this little
package so we'll open that up take a
little zipper zippy it zippy it up and
inside just some simple stuff you get
the earbuds themselves which actually at
first come in a plastic bag you need to
take those things out of there and you
can see how the design is as far as the
headphones themselves go they're pretty
simple you get one for the left hand
side one for the right hand side and a
cable connecting them both will talk
about the features and how they work in
just a second but for now let's continue
the unboxing they also come with their
USB to micro USB charging cable and last
but not least a bunch of different size
earbuds for different sized ears so
regardless of whether you have big ears
small ears there'll be an ear cup in
there so they'll fit inside of your ear
and they'll fit perfectly now the reason
that earlier I said that these things
are really geared towards joggers and
people working out all that is because
they have these nifty little cups right
here or these little connectors or do
you want to call them that go run into
your ears when you're bouncing around
and doing stuff they don't fall off at
all as far as the controls go in the
mellow sounds on the right hand side you
see the power button which also doubles
the button to answer your phone on top
we see a couple buttons now these
buttons on top or for two different
things you can either hold them down to
fast forward or rewind your songs you
know I'm old-school by saying that but
it's basically toggled to next or you
know previous you can also use this
volume volume just a simple tap back and
forth and that's how you control the
volume now on the bottom there's also
the microUSB jack for charging your
phone via the cable that's included and
last but not least this button also
doubles as a third thing not only is the
power on answer your phone it's also the
play and pause button as well pretty
nifty right as far as the mellow sounds
comfort goes they offer you three
different types of sizes for your
earbuds to insert inside you ears so
you'll find one that will actually fit
and fit perfectly and the little hooks
that go over your ears they make sure
that the earbuds fit inside your ears
and never fall off when I was doing
things like walking my dog checking the
mail and even jogging down the street
the earbuds never fell out and they
never felt uncomfortable either
answering the phone was a pretty simple
affair my phone rang I click the button
I answered it and I was up and talking
to my homie as far as the sound quality
goes I have no
at all when I'm out running or working
out in the gym I mainly just listen to a
lot of metal music and it reproduces
that absolutely fine you can even turn
the volume up loud enough or you can
hear anything outside of these earbuds
whatsoever and what's cool is that you
can actually pair them up to two devices
at the same time so if you have like one
phone with some type of music and
another device is something else you can
actually repair to both those device at
the same time and pairing to them is
very very easy it's a simple handshake
and then you're up and listening to your
tunes inside the mellow sound earbuds is
an 80 milliamp hour battery and this
will keep these headphones going up to
seven continue hours of music or talk
time which my mom will love and it only
takes two hours to charge them up you
have a 240 hour standby time so a lot of
listening time on the earbuds also last
but not least I don't know why a lot of
people still ask this these will work
with any type of device that supports
bluetooth these are bluetooth 4.1 and
they are backwards compatible so don't
have to worry about what kind of device
you have who makes it if you've got
bluetooth you've got sound last but not
least if you take the earbuds out of
here you don't want to put them away
they very simply hang around your neck
and they're so lightweight you won't
even know they're there I'm our you guys
been watching teching tomorrow like I
said these are really awesome product
for those people who want quality
Bluetooth connectivity they don't want
to spend a lot of money and they want to
be able to use it with any device that
they have and not have to worry about it
and best of all like I said they're
under $30 we'll have a link down below
like button where you guys can check
these out or get one for yourselves and
we'll see you guys back here for more
tech on teka tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
