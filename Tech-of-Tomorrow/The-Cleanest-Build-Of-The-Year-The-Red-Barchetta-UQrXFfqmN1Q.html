that a lot of people out there don't
have a lot of cash to get good christmas
gifts and they're actually still some
people out there who don't even have a
pc at all
they have kids who'd love to have a pc
to play games but hey unfortunately they
can't afford it and that's what today's
video is really all about the system
they're gonna be presenting today is
actually a gift for some friends of mine
in Washington they live in Tacoma
Washington and this family really has no
money whatsoever they have kids like I
said they want to play PC games and
there's no way on God's earth they could
ever afford to get anything really good
so I decided to get with a few companies
and build the system and just give this
to them for Christmas they have no idea
there'd even have you even watched it
one YouTube video in their entire life
because well they don't have a computer
now before I jump into this and talk
about all the specs inside of this
computer and why I think this build is
actually really cool for you folks out
there it's just a build idea I want to
say we're at the bat we didn't consider
price in this whatsoever
I grabbed the best parts that I had
sitting in my house I contacted west
from NZXT david from kingston and a few
my friends and got parts for this build
now before we totally jump into this
build though let's check out a word from
today's sponsor course they're having a
pair of headphones is crucial to that
all night gaming sesh and of course our
HS 50 stereo gaming headset has the
comfort sound quality and durability
that you'll need to game all night with
adjustable ear cups and plush memory
foam for exceptional comfort the HS 50 s
also include the legendary Corsair build
quality featuring rugged metal
structural components to ensure
long-term durability they also include
specially tuned 50 millimeter neodymium
speaker drivers to bring you superior
sound quality with a wide range and
accuracy
the only directional microphone is
easily detachable and is also optimized
to reduce ambient noise for enhanced
voice quality VHS 50s are also Dischord
certified so you know your mic and audio
drivers have been tested and evaluated
for crystal clear communication and
outstanding sound the volume and mute
controls can be easily accessed on the
right side of the ear cup for easy
adjustment on the fly
if you're looking for affordable
high-quality pair of headphones give the
corsair HS 50 stereo gaming headsets a
try you won't regret it
alright so if you're looking for some
kickass headphones it check those out
now let's jump into the build build idea
for Christmas as a gift that's why I
titled this video the best Christmas
gift ever I guarantee when these people
get this and by the way I'm not just
giving them this computer I'm giving
this computer
these speakers right here a matching red
and black keyboard from Corsair matching
red Mouse everything is going to be
pretty much totally red themed now
probably so many people out there pierce
gonna go but Elric you're using a cpu
from Intel yeah I am I'm using an Intel
CPU and my traitor to the cause and my
from the dark side
no just itís builders came together so
awesome so look at the build itself now
this thing is completely utterly clean
you guys can see the design honestly
anthe did such a wonderful job on this
on building this computer there's no
restriction to the airflow whatsoever
and I know a lot of people commented on
this power supply when we did the
unboxing they're like oh man you know
what it's not modular that power supply
sucks now even though I don't agree with
that I will say that a modular power
supply would have been probably a little
bit easier in the build then than the
one that we use it was a little bit hard
Anthony was like one yeah trying to get
that thing in there but you guys can see
the end result this thing is totally
clean and actually all the parts that
are pretty much using this are all
top-of-the-line stuff and you guys know
that AMD video cards are still off the
hook in price this is a Vegas 64 card in
this build by the way my only one I had
until I got a brand new and today from
power colors so thanks a lot to DOM for
providing its that sample but now let's
move on and let's talk about actually
all the different parts that are used in
this build and I think at the end of the
day that even though I know a lot of
these parts are unaffordable you guys
can change out the parts to whatever you
want this is just a theme I'm calling it
the red Barchetta
so that's why I can you know red theme
the red bar chatter if you guys don't
know it it's a rush song it's pretty
badass song so check it out you rock
fans out there but everything about this
thing is high-end it's completely silent
it's running right now the microphone is
just above my head and you guys aren't
hearing the system so it runs completely
utterly silent as well when you play
games and system heats up the video card
fan does increase you can hear
little bit of sound from it but nothing
like the old days of lawn mowing
so first up let's talk about the case
it's the NZXT 8 700 i mid-tower case
this thing is really cool you guys can
see that it's totally clinging inside
there's not anything in the way of doing
your build plumb to your room for just
about any motherboards you want to put
in there and for those people out there
who like the Ferrari or the AMD or
whatever you want to call you know the
the black and red type of féin build
this will definitely suit you plenty of
room for your video cards everything
inside cable management is also easy on
the back you guys can see that
everything fits back here without a
problem
building the system like I said the only
really caveat to putting it together was
trying to get to the power cables up
till we won the video card and that was
a little difficult with a non modular
power supply but all in all this case is
pretty badass it's unique and mean look
it looks killer for the motherboard
I wanted something high-end but still
something that looked really really nice
and on my shelf I found in a Zeus rock
Maximus 7 and this motherboard has a lot
of features it's still ddr3 slj 1150 but
you guys know the raagh series of
motherboards that are totally made for
overclocking they're totally made just
for you know on the top-of-the-line
stuff for all your video cards this one
has protection and stuff on it like
armor so it just looks really excellent
inside this build there's a lot of these
on sale places but they're kind of
expensive if you could definitely change
out the motherboard to something cheaper
if you wanted to the CPU inside this
build is the Intel Core i7 5775 C
standard clock is 3.3 gigahertz and the
boost clock is at 3.7 gigahertz now
keeping that CPU cool is the NZXT Kraken
X 62 all-in-one cooler now this is a 28
millimeter CPU liquid cooling system and
it really does a great job keeping the
CPU cool you guys will see when we show
you the benchmarks then it doesn't get
hotter than 50 Celsius even under full
load I know some people might say hey
man why didn't you use red memory or
black nerve but I gotta be honest with
you I really like the white memory I
feel that just pops in this build so
when we were doing the build at first we
had a different color in there but when
I saw how the white popped I just
decided hey let's just keep the white
memory in there I know some people have
might disagree but I think it looks
great now this memory is the Kingston
HyperX fury 16 gigabyte kit the kit
consists of - a gigabyte Stix running at
1866 megahertz the main storage drive in
the red bar Chetta is a Western Digital
black one terabyte hard drive as
200 rpm hard drive that is probably the
most common drive in the entire gaming
market now the boot drive obviously you
guys can find a cheaper 240 gigabyte SSD
but the Intel 730 series is pretty much
the fastest most reliable and honestly
one of the best made SSDs you can get in
the market and this thing's really
expensive but hey if you want the
absolute best get the drive with the
skull on the side for the video card I
wanted to get something that matched the
system but was still the top of its
class so we chose the Sapphire Radeon rx
Vegas 64 8 gigabyte card this card is
currently about seven hundred
thirty-nine dollars but I have heard
rumors that price are supposed to drop
within the next month hopefully before
Christmas because this car does come in
at 739 bucks if you do look hard out
there though you can find one of these
cards for $6.99 so that's about forty
dollars less for you guys have followed
the channel you may have seen this power
supply before because we did an unboxing
of this 750 watt power supply a few days
back this is the BitFenix formula power
supply and yes I know it's not modular
but it did work in the build very well
it's 80 plus gold certified it's about a
hundred bucks so I hope it works for a
really good long time in the red bar
Chetta all the fans in this build
totally match each other and that's
because they're all from NZXT and as you
guys can hear in the video they're
totally silent even when the system is
running so overall even though I know
for someone out there who's going to
build and buy a system a lot of this
stuff in here is just way totally
overkill you can buy a much cheaper
stuff I know that anybody can go to PC
parts pick or choose the absolute
cheapest bill take it and put it
together but that's not what this is
really all about because this is a gift
but the theme of the build the way that
it looks the design of all the fans the
cable management all of those things are
something that anybody out there can
emulate and it should be an inspiration
to you seeing this so for all those
people out there going hey I can build a
cheaper blah blah we know all that but
can you build it this clean and this
nice that's where the real challenge
comes in I mean I can put a system
together it wouldn't look like this
Anthony is a professional at what he
does and every time he builds a system
honestly if you guys fault a child they
just keep getting better and better so
as a theme and all that stuff this
system is really solid you could build a
system that looks almost identical to
this
and that would be really cool for you
you know or you can change out every
single solitary part in here and make it
your own so when I do any of these bills
they're really about a theme you know
we've made somebody said hey here's the
absolute cheapest video and I have some
people like that but me personally I
would really rather if I had my way
build the most outrageous systems in the
world I gotta hand my hat's off to jay-z
man because J AJ su Cent's is probably
one of the absolute best builders there
is out there I wish that I had his skill
set for doing that you know Anthony does
liquid cooling but he's not at that
level we're still working to get there
hopefully we will now with that said
though let's jump in and for you people
who care about how the system ran how
cool it ran let's jump in in those
benchmarks let's rock
you guys can see the maximum temperature
on the CPU is 50 Celsius and the maximum
temperature on the video card is in the
mid 80s all right so there are the
scores honestly give me your opinion
down below if you were a person who
didn't have a lot of money and you got
an entire system monitor keyboard and
all that stuff wouldn't you feel that
that is the best Christmas gift ever I
want to hear your opinions down below
because when I was tying this I don't
want people think I was trying to like
you know use this clickbait or whatever
but it's really not I consider this to
be the best Christmas gift ever for this
family they're gonna be completely blown
away by it and hopefully when it's all
said and done they get hooked up to the
Internet I'll be able to hook up with
them and then show them in their family
like actually having fun with this stuff
at their house you know as is right now
like I said they don't even have
internet honestly they don't even have
internet whatsoever so I'm completely
blown but now they'll have a reason to
get the Internet I'm sure once they see
something that's awesome show up at
their door for Christmas they'll be
completely motivated to do that mr. face
you can get internet for like 25 bucks I
know that those people can at least
afford that so like usual all these
parts will be listed down to the like
button so you guys can check them out
you can choose to what you want it you
know choose what you want to use in your
build I mean honestly the case the case
fans the rad and all that I mean those
are actually really internal components
of this build that you may not want to
be changing out as far as the
motherboard CPU goes in the SSD and even
the video card you could replace all
that with whatever you want insight you
can obviously get a cheaper AMD video
car if you're an AMD fan if you want to
get a 240 gigabyte hard drive you could
probably find one for probably less than
100 bucks easily these days um let's
just face it the CPU you could get away
lower in CPU so like at the end of the
day I this is the theme I want to just
point that out me I'm just like force it
in your guy's head it's a theme build
and a gift it's not meant to be the
cheapest build in the world cuz I get a
bunch of comments I'd always just
tripped me out but man I ain't good a PC
parts bigger and build something like
that and I know anybody could do that I
could do that if you guys want to see me
do videos like that please let me know
down below I mean I can go out and and
just do builds you know me and Jesus can
sit around all day long just design
different builds like PC parts picker
and then you guys can build them but I
don't have enough money to buy it that
many things also for my fans we are
going to do a giveaway for the 12 days
of Christmas I'm going to do it
differently I'm
to find the absolute best way to do
these videos so if glean or whatever
there's other things arm and reach out
to other people and you know get my hand
and grip on what these things are and if
there's a better way to do the giveaways
and I'll definitely do them that way so
I'm Eric you guys been watching Tech in
tomorrow peace love to see you guys here
in the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
