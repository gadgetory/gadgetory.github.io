is buddy the dog he is our mascot now
what are we doing here today well today
we're going to be checking out something
really cool which is called the whistle
hence why I was whistling in the
beginning of the video now all you folks
know that I got my foot amputated I
haven't been able to walk or anything
I'm trying to get back into gear where I
can walk and while that's going on this
thing actually is really cool because
why my moms are visiting and she's
helping take care of things I can
actually monitor what my dog is doing
through this incredible thing tons of
stuff I can monitor all the foodies
eating the medication is taking and you
can have up to six people all sharing
the same app per dog which means you
have 6 family members I'll checking it
out now I use it not only to monitor the
dog but also to monitor mom as well
behave yourself so as you guys can see
it's hard for me to walk I still have my
little foot bright song and foots not
totally healed yet but I'm trying to get
around I really just want to get out
there and be with buddy and see what
he's up to and it's been pretty cool to
be able to monitor them with my mom
using this whistle thing but now I'm out
for a little adventure of my own like I
said some of the great features are
remote monitoring the unit's waterproof
has a battery life of 10 plus days
social sharing food and medicine
tracking and the ability to have six
users on the app per dog you can also
take notes add photos and share your
daily adventures some of the really cool
things about the whistle is that you can
set goals like say that you know your
dogs going this far but he's like eating
this much more food and you want to keep
him healthy you can actually set the
goal to be higher and higher and higher
and can also keep track of all the
highlights of when your dog gets the
most exercise the most daily activity
now the goal aspect is important because
it calculates and recommends a goal for
dogs based on their breed and wait do a
cell has data around these two
components which enables an accurate
activity goal for each dog from there
you're able to increase or decrease the
activity so if you actually don't know
how much exercise to give your dog this
is a helpful tool now this thing is only
99 bucks and it works off your phone you
install an app and then with the app you
can remote monitor your
as well so whether you're with your dog
at home or you're somewhere else you can
still see what your dog is doing so say
that you take off you go to the mall or
whatever you want to kind of check it
out you can see if your dogs actually
lazing around the house and drinking
beer and partying or whether he's hard
at work I'm going to make sure buddy's
hard at work when I'm not around not
just lazing around the couch and with
the whistle I'll be able to do that so
if I find out this little guy just
hanging out having a party drinking beer
and watching the football game while I'm
out working well I'm gonna go to good um
I'm gonna have to get him now like I
said this thing's $99 I think it's a
really incredible type of thing lots of
people use this type of program for
themselves if you love your pet like i
do why would you not want to get the
same consideration to your animal right
you want to give you animal
consideration and with this thing you
can do all kinds of things like i said
all his food and everything you can see
how much he's eating you can take notes
on and say okay today he ate this he ate
it well no his food side around for
hours he didn't eat it so it's kind of
almost like having an all-in-one kind of
like doggy program all on just one thing
put a little watch thing around his neck
like you guys saw in the video that's a
little monitoring tool and then the rest
of it you monitor via your phone so I
think for 99 bucks the people at whistle
their team you guys did a good job this
is really understanding for people who
love their pets I think you're going to
really enjoy us because hey come on it's
a lot of fun you can see what your dogs
doing and the same kind of respect you
know what you're done because when he's
doing if you're doing with them will
then hang y'all together peace out
thanks for watching teka tomorrow I love
you guys and by the way if you guys want
to save ten percent all you got to do is
hop over their website and enter the
code tech and you guys can save yourself
ten percent on getting your size so
personal
