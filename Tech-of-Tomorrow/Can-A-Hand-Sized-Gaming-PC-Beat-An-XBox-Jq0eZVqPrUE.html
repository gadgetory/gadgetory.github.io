welcome to another episode here on tech
of tomorrow
now consoles they are pretty cool I
think for racing games for me the best
thing about consoles has always been for
playing racing games because the
controls and everything worked
absolutely great for that the games are
cool
you never had to really worry about
having the you know absolute best
graphics in the world when it's a racing
game and I had a lot of fun doing that
but when it came to playing first-person
shooters triple-a titles and other stuff
like that there just always seemed to be
a big time lag plus the fact that even
though like an Xbox or a PlayStation is
cool and you can now sometimes even use
keyboards and mouse and you know play
the first-person shooter games better
than you used to be able to be able to
do but you still can't cut my frog
removal today some things you just can't
do like let's just face it you can't
edit videos you really can't check your
email and just feel like you're in that
comfy computer zone when you're using a
console so I want to like build a little
system that could actually be
competitive with one of those products
but be much smaller so like today's
video is basically me trying to put
together what I would feel would be a
console killer and them at the end of
the video I don't know what I know if I
really succeeded I can't say at all that
what we did today is a console killer I
think that the concept of what we did is
really cool we have a little ads Rock a
300 it's a little tiny tiny what you
guys will see it's really tiny it's
really not much bigger than my hand and
about this thick
it's um if you've ever seen like 1/2 1/2
1/2 length power supply those really
small power supplies like it seemed like
the four fifties and stuff like that
it's really about that size so putting
parts inside of this really super duper
tiny thing and trying to make it into
the smallest gaming system that was kind
of my goal but being with the
limitations that there were with this I
ran to a couple of problems and with
price started rising up and up and up I
was a psychic oh my god I had to look
you know alright how much really is you
know Xbox s or an Xbox X you know I mean
do I want to spend you know 300 bucks do
I want to spend 400 bucks you know how
deep do I want to get into this and then
look at those factors so there are some
cool things about I think I really do
prefer myself the Xbox over the
PlayStation I don't know why I just have
my account and everything it just seems
to work much easier for me and you know
we're all conjunctive together and
working well so I like that environment
my playstation the only thing I really
do on my playstation is play Rocksmith
and that's really about it so let's
check out real quick this little tiny
system and then after we see the parts
in it and we talk about the price and
that stuff which I'm gonna say right now
I wasn't really all that thrilled with
the overall price it's gonna be
completely awesome that's kind of like
what I feel kind is the caveat the
Achilles heel about this but we'll get
into that in just a second real quick
though let's jump in let's just take a
look at what this thing looks like and
everything now first off getting inside
of this system and working on it is
really really easy it's simply four
screws you pull out a sliding tray and
voila you get access to everything that
you need now like I said before the only
caveat about this thing is no room for a
video card no room for regular hard
drive really no room for Jack diddly
it's kind of almost like what you see is
what you get other than the parts that
are inside of it now this particular
build has an AMD Rison 520 400 Gina this
particular processor also has what they
call the Radeon rx Vega 11 graphics and
that is the graphic engine that we are
using in all of our tests today so take
that into consideration guys look I
can't fit no video card in this bad boy
now the disc meeting itself the a 300 it
cost a hundred and forty nine dollars it
has a hundred and twenty watt 19 volt
adapter for its power unit and they also
have Intel versions on Amazon for 160
and 130 dollars you can do different
builds now as far as your connections go
on the a300 on the front it's really
simple you have your headphone you have
your mic jacks you have a USB 3 and
USB type-c connection as well as in the
top you see the power button on the rear
we see the land port USB 2.0 port USB
3.0 port we see a VGA port now even
though the American market doesn't
really use this connection in the Asian
market this is still used quite widely
we also see an HDMI port a display port
and then a connection for the power
brick with space being a minimum you
can't even use standard memory you have
to use a laptop so dim I'm the best
price we could find with some Tim tech
Hynix I see 8 gigabyte kit ddr4 for 50
bucks um I actually have memory from my
Mac that I pulled out of my old Mac and
just put it inside of here
but this memory is probably a better
price also like I said no room for
really any type of a hard drive other
than an m2 I use the XP gxx 8200 and
this is a 480 gigabyte bad boy but it's
very very fast this solid-state drive is
pretty much everything it's your boot
drive and your storage now obviously
with a little research and a few part
changes you could probably build this
system a little bit cheaper probably
results will vary just a little bit but
the big caveat about this system is that
all these parts are about 460 dollars
now with 460 dollars I'm sure you could
find yourself a nice little mini system
that has an AMD rx 480 in it you know a
different CPU and everything else the
thing about it is it's not going to be
small the big thing around this is that
it's super duper tiny I mean you guys
saw this thing is so tiny tiny tiny and
I've decided that since it's so tiny
that after we do this video with it me
and Anthony are good together and we're
gonna make some kind of cool mod because
we haven't done that in years
we've been talking about it and talking
about it and talking about it and then
with this little tiny system it's time
to build something cool I wish we could
build some kind of robot around it that
would be really cool maybe I'll make a
video will talk about it and come up
with some ideas and we'll let you guys
vote on which one of those ideas you
would think maybe the uber coolest now
with that said though let's jump in and
let's check out this in the
Gaming environment now you guys I'll
tell you right now all the settings that
we're showing you on the low settings
and they're at 1080 because this is not
gonna run 4k we know that an Xbox X will
run 4k but these run between 400 and 500
dollars depending on their model like I
said you can change some of the parts
out here you can get Windows for cheap
you could make this system probably down
around 400 bucks if you really
compressed it down so let's jump in and
let's check out how it does game though
as you guys can see doom looks pretty
cool almost 30 frames per second I
thought it was totally playable I saw no
choppiness whatsoever and the graphics
were really decent in my opinion now the
things that I think that are much better
however about having a PC over an Xbox X
PlayStation or anything else is the fact
that if you want to you can do things
like edit your video if you're making a
video you could definitely edit it on
this computer it may not be the fastest
thing on the block
but it will work and you can do it you
can also stream and you can do a bunch
of other things that you're not going to
be able to do on an Xbox or a
Playstation and that's a good thing and
that's where I think it wins however I
think that overall the fluidity of
everything on the way that the Xbox X is
with its 4k capabilities and all that
stuff I found one for about the exact
same price and if I was only going to be
doing something that was probably
strictly gaming it would be a really
hard choice for me because this system
does game pretty good and it's probably
one of the smallest gaming systems I
have ever seen I mean if there was just
some way to be able to put a little mini
video card in there and boost a few
things up it would be really cool and
hopefully we'll see that in the future
with other stuff but as it is right now
you know the CPU is an AMD CPU and even
though it does have you know rx you know
graphics on it it's all on chip you know
what I mean it's all on chip it's
sharing the memory and everything with
the system
I mean maybe putting 16 gigabytes of
memory inside of the little system might
have made it a little bit faster
probably not that much but it probably
would have cuz you know with Windows 10
it's probably better to have a little
bit more and if you wanted to do that
it'd be still a little bit more
expensive but if you want to be able to
play games have something that has a
totally small footprint I mean this
thing is super small it'll fit anywhere
you hook up a wireless keyboard stuff
like that and the CPU even in a full
load was only 77 Celsius so it really
never even got that uber hot even we
were fully gaming with this bad boy so
at the end of the day I think
as a mini system and the smallest system
around for gaming it's a thumbs up it
beats the Xbox one as I think but it
doesn't beat the brand new Xbox you know
one X and I'm saying because that one
does 4k and I think you can do strictly
gaming a little bit better you know on
that particular device so let me hear
what you guys have to say like usual all
the parts for this build everything that
we did will be down there below that
like button please let me hear you
guys's comments at the end of the day
but my opinion isn't this thing though
if you want something that has the very
smallest space you want to be able to
play your games and you don't really
care you know about playing the best
triple-a titles especially if you play
stuff you know that's going to be
looking down type stuff like RPGs you
know you're a Warcraft type of person
this system will play those games like
butter the only thing it's not gonna
play like that are gonna be the super
duper high and triple-a titled but you
can see doom which i think is one of the
coolest games around is still playable
at almost 30 frames per second and looks
great you've been watching TECA tomorrow
if you're not something like what you
see hey we'd love to see you sub to the
channel and if you don't have
notifications Hey
turn them on we'll see what happens
sometimes I'll let you know sometimes
they don't peace out see you guys in the
channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
