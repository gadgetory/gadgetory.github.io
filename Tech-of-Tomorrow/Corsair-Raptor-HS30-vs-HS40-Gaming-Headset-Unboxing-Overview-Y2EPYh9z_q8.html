doum are glad to see you guys here we're
always bringing you guys the latest tech
and today we've got two products and the
people over at Corsair now these are
their raptors series of headphones we've
got two of them behind me the HS 30 and
the HS 40 now the HS 30 these are coming
to market at about 49 dollars they have
3.5 millimeter inputs and they're only
just 2.1 stereo headphones but they're
only $49 the ones above din the HS 40s
they are based on USB so you'll need a
sound card in like that you just plug
them in and they are 7.1 but they're
also $79 they're a little bit more
pricey
now these both have microphones on them
they're actually noise cancellation
microphones there are 40 millimeter
drivers on the headphones are supposed
to be noise cancellation on those as
well
they're nice and padded beyond that
they're pretty well priced and they're
geared for the gamer hence you know like
the raptor name so with that said let's
jump in let's take a look at them
alright folks so I don't really know is
this an unboxing I guess it is a clear
little plastic box we've got a little
piece of tape up here on the top right
here and there I go I mean a nice cut
they're piling up the actual best
cutting job ever there I kind of cut the
plastic but it's working
so I guess there's more all around the
side here so it's going to remove that I
guess this is a little bit overkill
maybe I didn't really need them I could
as I guess to pop this tape off of there
so there we go the big plastic box these
are you guys can see the 5 30s so I'll
go ahead and now that I have a dollar
destructive plastic stuff just like a
good unboxing of a case I'll just take
them and roll them out there look at
that they roll out nice and simply onto
there all right so here's they look like
outside of the plastic looking nice got
the name right there cut the flippy
folding microphone spin those around
again guys and see all that that's
pretty much the packaging so remember
like I said there's really not too much
gym between this and the other one
except for the seven-point one and the
connectivity beyond that they have a lot
of the exact same features so
oh boy I love unboxing headphones
because once you take them out of the
box I mean that's pretty much it there's
like no way to like really get
headphones out of a box any kind of
super nice and neatly order everyone
I've ever got so cause I'm kind of like
ripping and tearing or smashing women
mean at the smashing part at least the
ripping and tearing part that's an all
fairness so given so here we go we'll
pop these out got some paperwork inside
of here oh they're trying to roll off on
me there don't go rolling anywhere well
look at that they really Foley all right
so here we go the warranty guide we'll
get that out of the way and go back to
our little roly-poly headphones all
right that I'll be able to pull these
little things out of here there's a
couple of slits here so we'll pull those
bad boys out of there
I don't know well Center this just says
uh this just says for any of my Chinese
friends out there please translate this
says what please leave your comment down
below thank you well nothing else in the
box wait get warranty against defects
notification for Australian consumers us
if you are living the land down under
you're an Australian you want to Sloan
there's shrimp on the barbie you've got
the problem I find out my best
Australian accent but what the hell I'm
giving it a go as we run home alright so
here we go the unit's themselves all
bagged up in a nice little plastic bag
here I'll continue to try to go ahead
and cut this up I guess even though this
is lovely I don't know why they do this
because you know I'm putting a bunch of
tough plastic on here and you gotta rip
through you got a cable I don't know it
doesn't always seem like the smartest
thing to me maybe they should just do
this different way I mean cuz look at
this I mean sure yeah I suppose you can
try to cut it in there but either way
then you guy get the scissors up next to
your cable I mean that could just lead
to a mistake I don't know there we go
we'll cut that off get this all out of
there kaboom alright so take a look
right here got your headphone and your
microphone connection right there
simple and gold-plated design moving
down you can see it's pretty well made
got another connector coupler here I'm
going to move down here's our control
right here on and off with volume
control go ahead and just check these
out here's the inside 40 millimeter
drivers nice soft neoprene soft stuff
there on the top completely padded as
well
they're pretty flexible as well as you
guys can see they're not breaking
they're very flexible they're very
lightweight as well
microphone is adjustable can also move
up and down and lock into place now I'm
going to go ahead and put these on my
head of the cam and readjust and I'll
get back at you in a second here alright
folks so I have them on my head I've had
them on a couple minutes here just
shaking my head around and they are very
very comfortable I don't really feel me
getting any head fatigue on these I feel
no spots you know I'm talking about when
you're wearing a headphone or a certain
spot is uncomfortable or you know just
just doesn't feel right these feel
completely fine on my head
the microphone like I said is adjustable
so you can get it up by your mouth
farther if you want to if you don't want
to use it all you just fold it up and
out of the way I don't see this giving
the user any fatigue even after hours of
wearing it's pretty really comfortable
and pretty light alright folks so here
we have the HS 40s now I don't want to
tear these out of the box folks cause
it'd be honest with you we're planning
on giving these all the way to you folks
for Christmas presents I don't think a
person is going to want the open box so
the only difference is this though is it
a 7.1 gaming headset it plugs in USB and
the part that controls the volume and
stuff is slightly different but beyond
that all the specs are exactly the same
as far as electronic the engineering the
way they're going to sound is going to
be the same now there's 7.1 on this so
you'll have that 7.1 separation but as
far as the quality of the sound they
should be very very
more I'm going to do full reviews on
both these products I'm actually going
to make contact my contact of course
there and ask them to send me an open
box one of these so that way I can
actually take a listen to them without
having to destroy the box
alright Tech fans so there you have it
the HS 30 and HS 40 coming to market at
forty nine dollars and seventy nine
dollars respectfully now these things on
my head were pretty comfortable I don't
think they're going to cause you any
discomfort from wearing them I'll have
to put them on listen to the sound when
you guys can see that in the full review
I talked about that but this has pretty
much been the unboxing first look we
take a look at the product now over here
to my side over here you guys can see
another complete set of headphones I'll
be bringing these guys to you guys next
week you guys are all in the headphones
I know that so those guys were happy
enough to provide us with a bunch of
different stuff for you guys to get a
taste of Plus christmas is coming up so
guess we're going to be doing with all
these things that's right we're going to
be giving them to you people that's
right early Merry Christmas that's right
