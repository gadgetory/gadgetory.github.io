welcome back that's right we're yet
you're on TECA tomorrow and I'm Eric
your host oh we bring you all the tech
all the time now the new AMD line of
cards has hit the market and we were
lucky to get our hands on a couple of
cars we got the MSI Twin Frozr gaming
edition r9 280x and we also got the
gigabyte win force r9 280x so we took
both of these cards we clocked them both
the same at ten fifty megahertz they
come out of the box at ten fifty
megahertz on one card and eleven on the
other so we just decide we just keep it
at the tip 30 mega just to make sure
there's no problems at all we ran the
tests there were no problems whatsoever
and pretty much these things are running
similar to what you would see a pair of
semi 970 gigahertz addition cards run at
now what do we use for our testing well
we use a Haswell based system with an i7
4770k 32 gigabytes of Patriots fiber
extreme memory now for our boot drive
we're using a 240 gigabytes and disk
extreme SSD for our storage drive we
have a one terabyte Western Digital
black drive we're using an Evo 212
cooler from the people over at
Coolermaster and pretty much that's it
other than the motherboard which is the
Asus hero this is one of their latest
boards on the rock series and this thing
works really well and is really
moderately priced with that said let's
jump in let's check out some of the
performance and see how these two cards
did
excuse me walking out to the benchmarks
on if you guys don't know it that is the
human Zoo by me and the team here at

link is down below in the description
check it out sorry folks you guys see
the performance results and all that now
like usual these drivers are not that
mature but you guys demand we get the
videos out to you real fast so that's
what we're doing now you guys can see in
some of the tests we were getting you
know 100% double the performance and
some of the other ones we weren't now
these drivers though are very very new
as the drivers mature we'll see a lot
better performance going on and like I
said all the micro stuttering issues
that we used to see on single monitors
are now eliminated
they haven't eliminated a multi screen
and eyefinity but if you're just a guy
who sits in front of your computer with
one monitor you want to do crossfire you
ain't got to worry about anymore that
micro stuttering crap getting in your
eyes and eliminating your you know
joyful game I don't really see it that
much but there are a lot of people out
there who say they can see the micro
stuttering my is just too old I guess
because I don't really see that stuff
now like we talked about yesterday and
you guys can check that out in the video
right over here you guys can use a 79 70
Sedition card in conjunction with an r9
280x and crossfire you just have to use
the 7970 as your primary card so if you
guys happen to miss that video it will
be right over here check that out if
you're not sub the sub button is right
up here and down to the like button is a
link to all the information including
the review if you guys want to check
that out so I'm Eric peace out this new
guys back here on deck tomorrow
