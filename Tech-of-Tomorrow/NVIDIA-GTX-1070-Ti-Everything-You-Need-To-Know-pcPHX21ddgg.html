system look no further of course there
has your answer with their ll series RGB
LED case fans with 16 independent RGB
LEDs in every fan customization is
practically endless the LL series fans
are also engineered for low noise
operation all without sacrificing
performance and with the PWM control
these fans can be set anywhere from 600
to 1500 rpms for precise noise and
airflow adjustments so if you want to
trick out your system with color check
out the course there ll series RGB LED
case fans today alright so once again
special thanks to Coursera for helping
bring today's video to the table now
unless you guys have been living under a
rock you guys probably have heard that
Nvidia is released a brand new video
card not a lot of hype surrounding this
video card either there was no meetings
no nothing just all of a sudden at ten
seventy TI should have bet my door and
hey it's here so there's still an NDA on
the card as far as benchmarks and all
that stuff though but I can show you
guys the cards show you guys the specs
what it looks like and pretty much the
predictability about where it's actually
going to score in the real world so with
that said though let's jump in let's
check out the unboxing the specs of the
brand-new nvidia 1070 TI card geared for
overclocking right out of the box as we
unbox the gtx 1070 TI you guys are gonna
know it so this is a reference model
card in the reference model box so not a
whole lot of accessory anything is going
to come with this you get the card
itself inside an anti-static bag and you
get all the drivers and all that stuff
in a little manual inside of a package
and that's pretty much all you get with
reference base card next up let's check
out the card now this card pretty much
is exactly the same as all the reference
models that we've seen for the last few
years the same single fan design single
blower fan same everything pretty much
in the car - except for the tech specs
inside and one thing nice however even
though this is a reference base card you
do get a nice fat plate I think they've
done this on a couple of lattice models
but I think it's pretty nice and videos
finally jumping on the bandwagon and
including that in their bill his let's
just face it most of reference cards you
get out there they just have a plain
back on them all those little sharp
edges tough you to cut your hands room
short your card so seeing that they're
putting on the reference design is
actually a pretty nice feature and
another thing that's really cool about
this card is it actually supports SLI so
we're still getting SLI support across
the board unlike some of the other cards
like the ten sticks that had no SLI
support the 1070 TI does support SLI now
as far as how big the card is its 10.5
inches long by 4 inches high and
features a 2 slot design just like
pretty much all the reference cards
we've seen for the last few years where
things get different or actually under
the hood there are four graphics
processing clusters 19 streaming multi
processors 2432 CUDA cores a hundred and
fifty-two texture units and 64 ROPS now
as far as the clock speeds go on the
1070 ti you have a base clock speed of
sixteen hundred and seven megahertz and
you have a boost clock speed of 1683
megahertz which is pretty decent but
this card is really geared to be
overclocked right out of the box the
1070 TI also features eight gigabytes of
gddr5 memory with a 256-bit memory
interface and a total memory bandwidth
of 256 gigabytes a second nvidia
recommends a 500 watt power supply
minima to power this card and the TDP of
the card is 180 watts it also has a
thermal threshold of 94 Celsius which
means that this card can get really hot
before it fails and one thing nice about
the gtx 1070 TI is it only requires a
single eight and power connector to run
the card now as far as the connections
go there are three display ports a
single HDMI and a single dual link DVI
connector for the card
alright Tech fans so there you have it
everything that you need to know about
the gtx 1070 TI
except for the scores which i'll bring
to you guys on november 2nd now this
card slotted to come to market at about
four hundred and forty nine dollars so
like I said it's going to sit right in
between the Vega 56 and the Vega 64 and
I guarantee you that it's going to beat
those cards just from everything that
I've been hearing and reading thus far
now I can't say that absolute first
certain because I haven't run the test
but when I run the test I'm pretty sure
that's what it's going to be I really
don't think that Nvidia is gonna release
a card just for shits and giggles
they're gonna release something that's
pretty much gonna be able to be able to
blow away the ante cards and still come
in at a better
price point and with all the problems
that they've been regarding getting a
hold of the vega cards this might be the
card that fills that market and gets a
lot of people's money i'm Elric you've
been watching TECA tomorrow like usual
down below like button leveling for more
information about this card so stick
around because we'll be having the
benchmarks with lots of games coming
really soon peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
