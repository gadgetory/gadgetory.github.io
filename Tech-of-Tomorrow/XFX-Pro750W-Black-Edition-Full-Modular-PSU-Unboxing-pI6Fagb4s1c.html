got going on today well today we have
the 750 watt Black Edition fully modular
power supply from the people over at XFX
now this thing features solid link
technology easy rail technology
it also features true power which means
that the actual power you're saying is
what it is it's also geared for dual GPU

let's jump in and let's check out this
fully modular power supply from the
people at XFX
alright folks like you need good
unboxing I'm going to obviously show you

around show you guys the side of the box
here's the nomenclature so if the new
people looking to go out and buy this
you can see this right here I'm sure
they've got this bad boy for sale over
at Amazon go to flip it around the back
here's the back of the box once we need
to see them talking about their
technology you see their fan 5-year
warranty that's pretty damn good
not going to stay too much on that flip
it around show you guys the other the
wattage you see is in always the wattage
you get this is actually true because
some power supplies say they have more
power than they actually do this one's
considered true power and clean power so
you can see it's got smart sensors all
kinds of stuff on here
extreme heat tested smart sensors
efficient power use just all kinds of
good stuff it's actually little bit more
in the box so I'll show you the other
side because they actually have every
side of their box you guys and see
quieter saves power hybrid fan control
conserves power once again when you see
their solid link technology which
maximizes efficiency and then they're
easy rail Plus technology provides
maximum power that's all right so while
all that stuff let's slip it around the
side I've got the old Punisher knife
right here go ahead and get that bad boy
out there go ahead and find those nice
and sitting spot right here go ahead and
do that just like a doctor go ahead and
pop the side panel up here without
trying to roof the Box open let's trying
to get this little tab open there we go
go ahead and take the power supply out
of the box I'm all in there mister power
supply these little tabs want to be open
and there she blows
out-of-the-box oh that across the room
so here we go the box with inside of the
box box ception spin the box around
let's see if we know whoa spinning box
spinning box alright after the spin will
begin alright so here we go inside X
effects tree get out of the way there X
effects Pro Series power supply unit
boxes inside of boxes these are going to
be all the cables and accessories we see
the pro series PS use 1000 limited Black
Edition 750 watt 1250 watt all those bad
boys are covered right there and this
little warranty thing get that out of
the way underneath we have the actual
power supply itself will when pull this
out of the box and look fully modular so
we're going to set that down get this
out of the camera button myself alright
then so here we have you guys can see
it's fully modular so let's first go
ahead and we'll check it out or actually
let's check out the cabling first let's
pull the cabling out here you guys go
now this thing is awesome everything is
separated completely separated I want to
make so much of a big old mess here we
will go ahead and take these bad boys
out of here get them all out of here
all righty then
there goes back to one of the cables and
we've got another batch of the cables
right here so you both will run one at a
time so let's get them out of there by
the way here are these screws to mount
the power supply to your case
they were there so start with cabling
psu dual four pin 24-pin power more
power more power
even's marked on each one of these
exactly what they are as well you can
see that you can see there's lots and
lots here all types of different power
six eight more moron they even say PCIe
on them you can see that everything is
very very clearly marked you'll move on
to the next set which is your SATA more
SATA molex molex to four pen or floppy
drive molex to 6-pin or actually I'm
sorry excuse me this is the molex no 16
that's actually goes in your power
supply excuse me there and then we have
the six been to more SATA so you guys
can see there's tons and tons of tables
and go ahead and put those away so we
can actually look the power supply
itself but all the way now let's
actually look at the power supply so for
you guys who love totally fully modular
this will fit the bill go ahead take
this out
so let's check this out look at the
camera zoom in here so let's start off
right here on the side the pro 750 watt
black edition fully modular looking
awfully badass so flip it on the top you
can see all the good stuff there 80 plus
gold again then on the other side same
thing as the other side just once it
going to nomenclature in the back always
good to have the fan and then last but
not least where all of the cables plug
in everything is clearly marked
everything is going to be very very easy
to hook up and use it's also important
info it says there are two fan modes
hybrid and normal this little stick
right here and tell you what to do with
it and a little switch here for enabling
it but basically very very simple easy
to plug in completely modular you guys
can see that almost all the cables are
braided in one type or another through
their blade braided or the flat type so
you get either braided or flat type
cables which is pretty good stuff so
that's it man alright folks so there you
have it the unboxing first look of the
new pro 750 watt Black Edition power
supply from the people over at XFX now
this thing's fully modular has braided
or flat style cables should be very easy
to integrate into your system also works
with dual video cards so if you're
running SLI or crossfire this will power
that bad boy up perfectly for you the
fact that it has the 80 plus gold mean
it's going to have continuously great
power and the fact that it's true power
means the actual wattage you see is what
you're getting you're not paying for a
600 watt power supply that says it's
seven and fifty watts now you guys can
