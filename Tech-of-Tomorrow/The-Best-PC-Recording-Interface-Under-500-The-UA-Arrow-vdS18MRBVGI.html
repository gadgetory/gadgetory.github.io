out there on the market all the way from
low introductory ones up to ones that
cost thousands of dollars and when
you're beginning a musician it is really
hard to choose a great product and not
you know break the bank at the same time
now personally one of the reasons I've
used Mac for a long time as I love
Universal audio products I love the
Apollo before the Apollo I had different
products from them and they've always
been my favorite but one thing about
them is they've never really worked in
the windows world they've always been a
Mac based thing well now they've got new
products that have come out they've had
that one that that people excuse me the
predecessor this particular one it was a
USB 3 type product a little bit buggy
with some stuff sometimes it worked
great sometimes it didn't there was a
lot of dropout and stuff so I was kind
mmm now this particular one is the
universal audio arrow now the arrow is
pretty much an entry-level product and
it works with just what both windows 10
but it has to have the update the
anniversary of data or won't work just
to mention that real quick or it works
with a Mac so it works in either
environment and this particular product
is actually going to lead into another
video where I build a system that's
completely PC and completely dedicated
to being my DAW and recording music
which would be pretty cool now this
little things about 500 bucks 24 bit 192
Kurtz recording ability has really solid
dan80 converters inside of it
everything really quality about this but
the really cool thing I think about it
is when you buy it you get a bunch of
plugins right off the bat that are
actually worth more and cost more on
their site than the kid the device
itself so as soon as you buy this device
and you install in your computer you'll
get all this access to these different
applications which are pretty cool and
you can plug your guitar and it's got
guitar emulation it's got delay all
kinds of nice stuff and if you want to
build upon your library you can do it
and if you decide that you really like
this particular product you can always
upgrade it to another one so okay so
enough fun facts let's unbox this the
front of the box is pretty simple you
get a picture of the device telling you
it's the Thunderbolt 3 from Mac and
Windows Universal Audio all right that's
all there
there on the backside it's just
basically telling you that you're
getting a bunch of plugins for free when
you buy this I'll talk up a little bit
more about that in a second though but
that's pretty much all there is to the
box now inside the box pop open the cap
you see the unit itself will pop that
out of there now one thing I'm gonna
complain about right off the bat though
and this kind of made me kind of angry
is it requires a Thunderbolt 3 cable
well it doesn't come to the Thunderbolt
3 cable you have to buy one I mean
that's kind of silly they should have
included that so the unit itself and
this little getting started guide thing
right here this is really all that comes
inside the box so it's a very very bare
minimum you know good thing is though
you don't require a separate power so
that's kind of cool so you not to worry
about your power or anything like that
so here's do you know I'm go ahead just
kill this little tag off it here a weird
sticky stuffs right there weird sticky
stuff all right there we go from the
unit can't follow the floor it's pretty
funny so ok right here are all your
meters for checking everything out when
you're working very clearly easy to see
single knob here all of your controls
are down here you can choose your input
choose different things you preamp your
monitor on the front if your headphone
jack your input jack also inside
powering this unit is the UAD 2 solo
processor so there's a single processor
inside this unit which is probably why
it's under $500 because the next one
above it is about $900 and that's their
twin so this particularly it looks
really nice nice and clean you guys can
see that simple inputs on the back are
you 2 mic inputs your stereo output to
your speakers the Thunderbolt cable and
like I said a minute ago it's really
clear don't need a separate power you'll
get all your power right through the
Thunderbolt cable so no other messy
cable will be lying around one thing
that's really cool like I said the
beginning of the video is right out of
the box you get a bunch of analog
emulator plugins including the world's
only authentic tell atronics la-2a
you also get the 1176 ln a bunch of pull
technique use and you also get the
Unison enabled you a 6-10 be tube preamp
and online in their website you can
expand your library of plugins just
massively I myself own almost every
plugin that they have I've been
collecting them over the years and it
really makes a great recording studio
when you have these plugins for
guitarist and bassist arrow includes
units and technology on its front panel
instrument input giving you access to
amplifiers like the Fender 55 tweed
deluxe the amp eggby 15 end bass
amplifier eaton WT 800 bass amplifier
and now it even includes the marshall
plexi classic and all these plugins work
at near zero latency so this is really
good for songwriting and for recording
if you're wondering if this particular
unit will work with you or computer well
it works like I said before with both
Macs and PCs it does need a Thunderbolt
3 cable that they sell separately which
is kind of a bummer
it requires Mac OS 10 point 2 sierra or
10.13 high sierra
it requires Windows 10 with the
anniversary update that's the 64-bit
Edition requires 6 gigabytes of storage
and it's actually recommended that you
have a quad core i7 or better processor
even better than an i7 the future you'll
also need an internet connection so you
can download the software and authorize
all of your UAD plugins ok so not a lot
in the box well there's not much because
you download pretty much everything off
of the internet but the device itself is
very solid built it's not gonna break on
you has just enough connections to be
simple I mean let's just face it there's
not much on it those two XLR parts on
the back you've got a single entry
single out in the back and stereo for
your speakers plus the power through the
Thunderbolt I mean there's really not a
lot to the unit like I said before the
very beginning of the video I'm a fan of
Universal Audio products I just am I've
been using them for years and I can't
wait to build this PC and see how well
this works in the Windows environment
because it works great with Windows 10
I'm going to be a very very happy camper
I'm gonna tell you guys will be seeing
me come back doing the full review on
this product and talking to you guys
about that now there are a few things
that I have heard and which I expect to
run into there's not a whole lot of
processing power inside as compared to
like an Apollo because there's only like
a single chip inside of it instead of a
quad chip environment so when you're
doing a lot of virtual instruments and
stuff like that you may run out of power
with this particular union that's
something I'm expecting to run into but
here's the thing always somewhere
there's a sacrifice now if you go out
and you listen to any of those Focusrite
products or any of those other products
MOTU any of those products and you
compare the sound probably to this
they're not going to be the same the
sound quality and Universal Audio stuff
is just amazing The Killers recorded
their album completely on a Mac using
that so it's really nice stuff so my
next video is going to be the PC for
this project and then we'll see how
everything works together and if it's a
total thumbs up I'm Elric thanks for
watching you guys down below we'll have
a link where you guys can check out more
stuff about this or even check out more
