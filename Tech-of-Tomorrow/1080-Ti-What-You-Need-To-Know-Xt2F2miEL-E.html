you just simply don't follow tech news
you might not know that Nvidia is
releasing a brand new video card plus
two more cards on a refresh now today
we're going to do the unboxing and check
out the specs on the brand new GeForce
GTX 1080p eye card that's right the bad
boy of the mall featuring GP 102 is a
chipset this thing is awesome so let's
jump right in let's check out the
unboxing
check out those specs and see it's in
the day if you're looking for this card
to put in your system
let's rock so you guys can see that the
unboxing this card's pretty simple not
too much to it you take the box off you
see the cards inside of a nice
protective sleeve there's also some
drivers nuts stuff from some information
a little pack on the back beyond that
you just pull the card out of the
anti-static bag and then we can see the
card itself now the card itself looks
really really nice but underneath the
hood there are some definite changes
that are going on first of all the
cooling has been completely redone with
a brand-new copper vapor chamber and you
guys can also see that the DVI ports
been removed as well now this allows the
card to do is it allows the card to be
cooled at twice the level of previous
generation cards no more DVI port means
lots more airflow going across that GPU
which means you're going to have a
better card and when that means better
overclocking as far as the card size
then it slides in at ten and a half
inches by four inches and it features a
dual card slot design also in the box
just in case you still have a DVI
connector there's a DisplayPort to DVI
adapter so don't worry you'll still be
able to use your monitor there are also
three display ports and a single HDMI
port on the i/o on the top of the card
you can see this card looks pretty much
like all the foundation cards that we've
seen so far it has the nomenclature the
gtx 1080i it has the window and a single
fan blowing air across the entire card
on the bottom obviously the PCIe
interface and on the back I know you
guys hate that a nice sturdy backplate
so you have to worry about cutting your
hands or messing up anything on your
card I always like a good backplate what
about you for doing SLI you guys can
also see there are two sli fingers and
if you're wondering hey lurk will this
card be able to work in my system do I
have enough power well it's recommend
that you have a minimum of a 600 watt
power supply and the card has a TDP of
250
all right tech fan so that's everything
you're going to get in the founders
edition box now let's move on to the
specs and see what's under the hood if
you guys were really thrilled with tight
necks released last year you're going to
really love this card because the gtx
geforce 1080i is built around the same
GP 102 as was used in that card before
with 12 billion transistors under the
hood GP 102 is the most powerful GPU
nvidia has ever made for gaming like all
pascal GPUs GP 102 has been designed for
maximum clock speeds and efficiency
Nvidia engineers have carefully designed
and optimized the circuit paths of
Pascal GPUs this reduces bottlenecks and
substantially increases clock
frequencies over prior generations and
as a result of this effort and also
thanks the FinFET manufacturing process
used to produce all Pascal GPUs Pascal
is the world's most powerful GPU
architecture while operating at the
highest clock speeds of any GPU on the
market the GeForce GTX 1080i ships with
3584 cuda cores 28 string multi
processors and runs at a base clock
frequency of 1400 80 megahertz and
what's even better the GPU boost clock
out of the box is 1582 megahertz and
these speeds are incredibly 47 percent
faster in the previous generation
geforce gtx 980ti featuring 224 texture
unit the 1080 is texture filtering rate
is 350 4.4 giga texels a second and that
amounts to an amazing 85 percent higher
performance than the 980ti nvidia wanted
to save some money and also get the best
performance to the table on this car so
they've incorporated the latest gddr5 X
memory now this stuff runs at 11
gigabits per second and you get 11 gigs
of it to power your cards so it's so
close to a Titan that's amazing
you guys can see in the screenshot right
here that the big thing that they've
done with gbr 5x is that they've made it
work absolutely better instead of having
any clutter whatsoever in the
equalization product you guys can see
with this next generation tech the
memory just works much better all around
which makes your card obviously run
faster you guys can see that the image
on the Left shows the original GD r 5x
DRAM running at 11 gigabits per second
the center where the data will be
sampled is cluttered with data values
that are in transition so it's just not
possible to capture the data reliably
however the image on the right shows the
new gddr5 XDM design with a dramatically
improved data I that in combination with
the robust IO design of Pascal enables a
brand new bar for DRAM io speed when
combined with the GeForce GTX 1080 is
350 two-bit memory interface peak memory
bandwidth top set at forty four
gigabytes a second in addition and
videos latest GPUs also featured
technologies that are designed to
amplify - raw memory bandwidth and give
the CPU core a much higher effective
memory bandwidth and one of these
technologies is known as tiled caching
right now there are two traditional
rendering architectures used on a PC
with high-end gaming GPUs and immediate
mode render is used as shown on the left
many mobile GPUs use a tiled rendering
architecture as shown on the right in
the mediate mode architecture each
command in the input command list is
executed to completion and order when a
triangle is input the entire triangle is
drawn before starting the next one this
architectures advantages include reading
input geometry data only once and being
able to scale input complexity without
running out of resources the
disadvantage of this however is in areas
with a higher overdraw
is showing the blended cloud in the
image above the same pixels can be read
and written many times increasing memory
bandwidth all around with a tiled
renderer the screen is broken into many
separate tiles and rendering is
performed in two passes the first pass
process the geometry and determine which
tiles are covered by each triangle and
writes this information out to the DRAM
then in the second pass the geometry
list is reproduced for each tile one at
a time at a time each tile is rendered
to completion before moving to the next
tile tiles at this point are all size so
all the rendering happens on chip with
only the final color written with the
DRAM tile rendering however has two
significant limitations compared to
immediate mode rendering first the need
for a binary pass adds latency and
complexity to the driver second and more
critical the DRAM bandwidth required to
save and read back fitting information
is a significant bandwidth tax
proportional to the amount of geometry
in the scene pile can only be an overall
saving if the perfect so bandwidth
saving overcome
binning bandwidth tax for relatively
simple low geometric complex content
such as mobile gaming this is feasible
however for modern graphic workloads
such as rich geometry a tile rendering
approach is most likely going to require
a higher overall bandwidth than an
immediate mode renderer Nvidia's Pascal
and Maxwell GPU architecture implements
a new approach they stick with the
proven immediate rendering model for
graphics with no binding process or
binning I'm not exactly sure how this is
dead however within the immediate
rendering pipeline they add a banner
that writes to an on-chip geometry cue
in the level 2 cache once the bend data
fills a preset buffer size with level 2
Pascal renders this geometry a tile at a
time until the cue is processed the
modified raster behavior has the effect
of modifying the working set of output
pixels to naturally say with the
capacity of the existing on chip level 2
cache whereas a single pass restoration
would have overflowed the cache capacity
altogether
Nvidia calls this technique tiled
caching an approach that uses tiled
rasterizer behavior to improve the
effectiveness of the level q cache
compared to a traditional tile or
architecture this architecture realizes
similar pixel bandwidth saving benefits
but without any of the geometry
bandwidth or tax or binning path latency
pesto's new GPUs also feature new
lossless 4.1 and 8.1 Delta's color
compression modes as a result the
geforce gtx 1080i is able to
significantly reduce the number of bytes
that have to be fetched from memory per
frame compared to any prior GPU this
last chart shows the benefits of tiled
caching and compression and how
effective bandwidth is increased for a
modern game to benefit for compression
and tiled caching can also vary from
game to game but in many cases the
combined benefit is much larger than two
times the bandwidth increase one thing
to take note of however out of all the
TI is that have ever been released this
ti actually offers the most performance
increase and is the best TI to be
released as of yet let's talk a little
bit about the latest cooling
technologies in the TI card to cool GPU
is 102 GPU a copper vapor chamber is
being used this vapor chamber is
combined with a large dual slot aluminum
heatsink to dissipate the heat off of
the chip a radial fans then exhaust this
hot air to the
back of the graphics card and into the
PCs chassis this fan also runs extremely
quiet even when the card is under load
and when it's overclocked and finalizing
the design a metal base plate is placed
on top of the low profile board
components what this technology does is
it provides clean air channels for the
best but on performance and acoustic and
offer superior protection to the BCB and
a few one of those people that move your
system around a lot the base plate also
provides Mountain points for additional
mechanical support and just for
comparison this is 2 times the amount of
airflow as the GTX 1080 using 14 high
efficiency dual fits and video is able
to supply even more power to the GPU and
they do this cleanly with less power
wasted as heat this technology
ultimately provides higher GPU boost
clocks and better GPU overclocking with
less heat and noise compared to less
efficient power supplies this is very
important for a large GPU like GP 102
that consumes higher power and this
generates more heat at high clock speeds
due to the Pascal architecture the board
design and the cooling on this card
there's going to be maximum Headroom for
overclocking and in videos rooming that
they've seen cards go as high up as 2
gigahertz now that's some incredible
card clocks alright tech heads there you
guys go what the card looks like all the
specs of the brand-new GeForce GTX 1080
Ti now there's also going to be two
other cards that are going to be
refreshed we'll bring those reviews to
you as they come out now in this video I
want to keep it at least showing up
where you guys can stay interested and
not drag it on for hours and hours but
there are a lot of other technologies
that have come out with this card
improvements all the way across the
board with shadow play with VR works
aash ansel everything and there's also
some really cool stuff with VR so now
you can actually capture VR better
without having to have any kind of
hardware equipment whatsoever and you
can also memorize and capture all
different frame rates so you know
exactly what you're getting to your eyes
I'll do another video on this stuff
later please
give me a vote down below if you guys
want to see all that stuff if you're
only understood and Scoresby because I
want to know what you want to know now
this card is going to do a hard drop on
march 10th from be priced at $6.99 for
the patterns Edition and I'm sure it
will be available all over the place at
that
and like usual we'll have a link down
below so if you want to get more
information or possibly buy one of these
cards to your simple and yet the market
that information will be down there
I'm Elric you've been watching Technica
morrow like I said please leave me a
comment down below if you guys want to
see a video that features all the
different technologies for this card
beyond the card itself and the specs
peace out we'll see you guys back from
the channel for scores and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
