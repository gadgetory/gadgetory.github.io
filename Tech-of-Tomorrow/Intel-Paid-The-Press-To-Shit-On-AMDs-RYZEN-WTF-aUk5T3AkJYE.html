that humanity once again disappointed me
I guess it just can't be helped people
out there just can't help to say
negative things and be negative nannies
all over the place so let's start off
with the video I just made the other day
where I call the CPU risen well I did
that on purpose you guys are all sitting
there telling me that oh you know your
stupid fuck you don't know what you're
talking about bla bla bla bla bla bla
bla it was a joke
you should get a life and maybe lighten
up and this was due to the way that the
people at AMD when they did the rise in
launch talked about the Intel CPUs and
they made fun of Cabul egg and called it
different names I was just doing the
same thing it was a joke plus to be
quite honest with you
rising to me sounds lame is it a reason
is it a longer detergent risen sounds
badass like we've risen from the frakkin
gashes and we're coming to kick your ass
you think about it which sounds better
rising or risen risen sounds more badass
so once again you shit heads out there
who tell me oh he late AMD you've been
paid by into look at there in a second
to do all this you know that last year
you can go check on all the other
frakkin websites I gave AMD more videos
more system builds than anyone else on
the whole fucking face of planet Earth
how dare you come to my channel and sit
here and tell me that I'm paid by Intel
to make these guys look bad let's just
jump over there real quick people are
now leaving comments on my child saying
Oh have you been paid by Intel to make
rise and look bad that's the most
absolute ridiculous and absurd thing
I've ever heard in my entire year in the
computer business my entire life rather
I had been the computer business I've
never heard more bullshit ever let me
just tell you something for facts okay
AMD has an advocate program those
advocate people they get paid to go
around making AMD look glorious and
putting down any YouTube or anybody else
who doesn't agree with their opinion
they're the people who are actually
paying neither Intel Nvidia or any other
company out there as ever in my life
told me what to say in my video never
I've never been called by an Intel
person asking me Oh or should we be
scared of AMD's neepy CPUs if you really
think that I'm not even going to go
there because this is how it
gone traditionally every year Andy shows
up in a giant Superman suit and says we
are taking down until it's their day has
finally come
has that day ever come seriously every
time it's been not we expected bulldozer
you guys even your own AMG fans started
calling it failed dozers you did not me
you calls it that so what does that tell
you
none of the GPUs actually totally beat
anything by Nvidia either on the same
coin it's the same thing over and over
and over again AMD has always been the
price leader that's what they're famous
for man you don't have a lot of money
you can't afford a big old expensive
stuff then you buy AMD I had a song out
there called I love a and being you guys
may have seen some you guys know I know
you have
I mean shows what since you think I hate
AMD should I change the song - I hate
AMD honestly it's just ridiculous
sitting on a full over here is a case
that we have about almost shit $900 and
just in the painting and stuff of the
case if I hated AMD why would I go out
and pay all this stuff and then to bring
that up
I ate it so much why did it last today
and just go out and spend 1200 freaking
bucks my own money to get it I don't if
you can see this or not but this is my
my crescendo receipt right here
hopefully mr. G will focus in just real
quick in his refocus afterwards so you
guys can see it I'm going to bring us up
to the camera yeah I hate them so much
that in order to keep trying to give
them press and stuff
I want out to keep you guys the fan
bottler stuff so now I've got it
although I don't know what happened to
my 1700s it wasn't when I went to go
pick it up so I don't know what's going
on but I did get the 1800 X we figure
these bombs of this and 700 X here we go
put these things around sorry about that
so I've got both of those so these are
in-house now raid to our test system
well as video if that really quickly
plus
got a really nice motherboard for a
great price to bind the combos at my
personal rocks because evening 30 bucks
off your motherboard so that kind of
kicked that so got this new motherboard
the prime X 370 Pro with aura sync
lighting v we optimize ation USB 3.0 all
kinds of good stuff this motherboard I'm
sure we probably an unboxing and show
you guys that if you guys actually want
to see the unboxing please leave a
comment down below and say yes unbox the
a Zeus mobile and we'll make sure we do
it for you so we'll get that out of the
way so this is just crazy stuff there's
no way in hell that Intel or Nvidia is
going to go out and contact any of the
people out that they work with and offer
them money now since what a point of
money some of you guys asked questions
down below in the video is this a
sponsored video if I don't say in the
beginning of the video that this video
was sponsored by that means that we
picked it up at Amazon or somewhere else
now I know a lot of people go oh my god
you don't like you know beat these
people up well you know when somebody
sends me a review sample unless there's
something so absolutely valuable to you
the public that you need to know about
why would I say something if it was like
some silly thing like a driver or
something that was going on that could
be easily fixed before the product even
hit the market like when people send you
stuff and you want to keep working with
them you want to try to at least
maintain a balance of being professional
and not taking those people on the teeth
otherwise you'll become public enemy
number one and you won't get a sample
from anybody if you can't get samples
from anybody you're not making a shit
ton of money you sure aren't going to be
able to go out there and buy all your
samples well luckily we are getting the
point now we are we just bought our own
samples we're gonna try to generate that
way I did get my 1080 Thai sample and is
there something else I want to talk
about I was at the Nvidia Bay excuse me
editors day not but two days ago
every time everyone from Jensen down
talked about the new 10a they called the
1080 ty now me personally I agree with
you when I first heard that even myself
sitting there I was like what the fuck
cuz like I'm used to saying it myself
and saying hey the TI you know titanium
you know but no they're calling it the
ty so if you're that guy out there who's
leaving the comments down below and
talking about all the other idiots that
are calling it ty actually even myself
not calling it time makes mediated
because I've been calling it ti forever
- and I was wrong but hey
I'm going to learn are you so let's just
wrap this all up
nobody's been paid by Intel nobody's
been paid by Nvidia Intel hasn't
contacted any reviewer that I know as
editors day I got some trouble have
talked I don't have a script like
remember off my brain pretty hard so an
editor's day like I talked to many many
people out there about what's going on
with all kinds different things nobody
has been contacted it's never happening
and in fact I would have to say that
those rumors are generated by people
over at AMD their fans seem to be the
craziest if I don't say everything about
Andy that they don't want to say they
lead crazy comments threats all kinds of
other stuff they're just ridiculous
it's just ridiculous stuff grow up if
you want to leave a comment that's
constructive if I make a mistake or I
screw up or anything I will gladly suck
it up and say I'm sorry and fix whatever
I'm doing but to try to assume things
put words in my mouth and shit like that
that is just ridiculous doesn't honestly
I'm just fed up with it
life is short last you've got peace and
harming out about a bunch of bowels a
bunch people blowing your channel
talking shit honestly you people you
make it suck to be on YouTube no offense
what you do who would who wants that I
never get anybody's channel and talk
shit on them even if I see that they
totally screw up I sent to them in a
nice message in a polite way
constructively saying hey man some
people made blah blah blah
you know exactly what I'm talking about
you either have manners or you don't
so please because of my channel have
manners I'm not paid by anybody I've
supported AMD better than anybody ever
has for eternity all my real fans notice
anybody coming to my channel eating some
stupid ads snarky comment about earlier
this and that you don't have a fucking
clue what's going on once again you just
dumb
so I mark you guys been watching Tekken
tomorrow let's cut out all the bullshit
let's focus on facts like I said I got a
badass Radeon case over here already for
all the rides and stuff as soon as we
got our tests done we'll bring all those
results to you to the board real results
to you on the board somewhere like that
won't bring it to result you get every
way try to get all the stuff in my head
all at one time
now you guys might believe this but
there are a lot of people out there he's
a teleprompter and so the whole time you
look and actually look they're looking
at teleprompter I've never once for any
video that I brought you ever did any
learn all those specs and try to
memorize all that stuff to bring a 2 on
camera and trust me it's a lot of
information a lot I mean even an actor
when he goes on stage go to say what
four or five little sentences or
something I got to remember a whole
product thing I got to remember specs I
got to remember this hey Tech's bit Babu
it's a lot of work so hey don't beat
your youtubers up we're here to help you
out sometimes we make mistakes we're
human but most of us when we do we come
back to the table we correct those
mistakes so peace out we'll see you guys
back here on Tekken tomorrow because hey
I'm going to show you guys my test
system for risen plus I got the unboxing
of the brand-new 1080 tae we're going to
drop that thing on the test bed I got
actually new series of video cards 5000
series coming from AMD as well so
everything should be good so living army
don't be a dick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
