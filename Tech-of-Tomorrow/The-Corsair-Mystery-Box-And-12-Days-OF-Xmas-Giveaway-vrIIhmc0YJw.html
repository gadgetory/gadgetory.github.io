season and I've gotten a few really nice
little cards and gifts from a lot of the
people I deal with in the PC industry
but today I got a box by Coursera I
didn't never know it was coming but it's
this little box right here and I thought
I would share with you guys what
Coursera has given me pretty much I
guess for my Christmas gift so this
little box showed up like I said I
wasn't expecting it nothing no paperwork
inside just a present from Coursera so

Corsair has kicked me down for my
Christmas present right so let's do it
man so first off let's go ahead just
take this this little thing right here
we'll go ahead and take it off and I'll
just take this off and if I can get it
off nice and easily which I don't think
I'm going to be able to I was hoping I
was going to be able to but maybe not so
this thing is like it looks like it came
out of the 60s it looks like some hippie

then so we got here box of course there
see where can I pop this bad boy open

little cap right here and you guys will
be the first to see what's in the box
just eating before me so we're open it
up some stuffs falling out already and
voila
there's the box so let me look and see
what's in it
holy macaroni
okay oh wait no check it out hey wait
hold on alright here is a card here is
the dreaming of a white Christmas and
gee whiz check it out
that system looks awfully familiar the
only difference pretty much between that
system and the one I built is the video
card so uh yeah my assistant build thing
and then we got a card right here would
you guys like to see what they said to
me for Christmas
dear Elric you're older than
Santa what Wow that's mean I'm not older
than Santa I don't even have a beard no

great 2018 god 2017 sucked major but so

year for me you guys know I've been sick

got a lot of things going so what all we
got here first off we got a box right

send me some tequila no I'm just kidding

bottle but actually pretty nifty it's
first up on the list then we got some of
this fairly stuff which I want to throw
at the camera but it's gonna make it
freakin mess I'm not going to so let's
go upright the bet so let's check this

RGB SC rapid-fire keyboard which will
actually go really good with that white
build so pretty nice this is actually a
really nice Christmas gift the best one

to admit your box so far heels to the

that and then we got a couple more
little things in here we've got of
course their little box right here

Magnum no just fooling around
but anyways hey it's a really nice
little christmas ball alright now we got
one other little thing in here now big
little butt okay what's this now Oh
alrighty then what is this Oh a premium
headset Stan was 7.1 surround sound so
it's a sound card and a sound bar all in
one let me take it out of this package
so you guys can see it hold on we're at
the top here
and last but not least we have this the
st 100 RGB stand which also doubles as a
7.1 sound surround sound sound card so
all of that in this little stuff so
really cool very nice of the people at
Corsair so far this is the best
Christmas gift I've got so thank you
guys very much and also I run this and
let you guys know
during the 12 days of Christmas it
actually starts today when you guys see
the video but I'll announce the winner
starting tomorrow on Twitter so tomorrow
you'll see two winners but for the next
12 days until Christmas I'll be giving a
gift out every day yes it's
international I talked to you guys about
this before if you guys are
international you live with some crazy
country that I really can't ship to I
will be giving you guys triple-a game
codes so you can play really good games
and everybody wins
you don't have to sub the channel I
don't care about you in that stuff man
subs don't really mean jack anymore
on YouTube so it doesn't really matter
but going over to Twitter follow me on
Twitter if you're already a person who
follows me on Twitter then that's
absolutely great I honestly prefer
Twitter's peer gonna say I don't use
Twitter you don't have to use Twitter
honestly you can get a Twitter account
and the contest and they curate your
Twitter crap if you really don't want to
I don't care but Twitter is a really
nice place for one really good reason me
and you the audience we can totally
communicate with each other through
there's no problems whatsoever when I go
I just randomly go through and I pick
through the people there who follow
channel and I just pick winners and
that's how I'm gonna do it once again
like it's simple I go in I just randomly
go through pick people and give them off
the gifts and so that's how it's gonna
go this time so if you want in you want
to get free gifts and there are nice
stuff man a lot of different stuff I
have mice I have keyboards I have all
kinds of cool different stuff and in
fact if your country's not too far with
if you're Canadian or something I'll
ship to Canada
I really can't stick to some of these
crazy countries like Paraguay and a lot
of places because it's just expect that
this stuff is so expensive like a friend
of mine six string 6 string wizard Carlo
like heels in the Philippines and I've
still yet to be able to totally get his
package out to him because the shipping
is so expensive so I don't want to get
in that kind of situation I want
everybody to be a little get what they
are gonna get and have it quickly in
their hands without any waiting
whatsoever Carlos sorry we got you
covered bro you know me we've been
friends so it's all good to go so the
of the day if you guys want to get in on
the contest hey follow me on Twitter I'm
gonna put a post over there later today
and you can just make a comment and
we'll go from there
other than that you guys all have a
great holiday season I've got a couple
more videos that are be coming out but
then me and Jesus Cameron we're going to
take a well-earned vacation gather our
wits and then come back fresh for 2018
