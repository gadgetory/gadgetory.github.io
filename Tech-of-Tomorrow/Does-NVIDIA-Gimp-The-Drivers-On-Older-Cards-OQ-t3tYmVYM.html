the 2080 and 2080 I that was all really
cool stuff but now it's all out of the
bag and all we have left to do now a
specific game testing we're gonna do
some SLI stuff I got my other cards
coming tomorrow including my Bridgers I
finally got my hands on so we can bring
that to the table so I've got a couple
of videos that I want to bring to the
table this week and the first of these
two videos is actually about driver
gimping a lot of people out there say
that Nvidia gimps their drivers now
another video we're gonna be talking
about is going to be DL SS and what it
actually does and how many games it
actually works with and what it's going
to work with but Before we jump into the
first video let's hear a word from
today's sponsor best Tech if you're a
person who does a lot of traveling
overseas then you know that different
countries use different voltages and you
don't want to get caught away from home
and have none of your electronic devices
work do you guess what 'bestek has you
covered with the best tech adapter and
power converter you can eliminate the
stress of unsafely charging your usmai
products in another country the best
tech adapter and power converter
converts all other countries voltages to
the voltage we use right here in the US
a hundred and ten volts this product
also features the very world's first
sine wave converter meaning there's a
more stable output than any other
adapter or power converter on the market
today this technology can be applied
specifically to your curling iron hair
straightener or any electric toothbrush
you may own or anything within 200 watts
the design is pretty simple there are
two outlets on top as well as four USB
ports on the side of the best tech
device now three of these are standard
USB and the other is USB 3.0 but what's
really cool is that you can charge up to
six devices simultaneously on the best
tech adapter so if you're on the go
never get caught unprepared ever again
check out the best eye power adapter and
power converter and you never have to
worry about unsafe voltages ever again
alright so if the best tech adapter
looks pretty interesting to you we'll
have a link down below so all right
today's video a lot of people are all
speculating throwing dirt and NVIDIA now
obviously some of the dirt is probably
deserved just like any corporation we've
talked about this a gazillion times the
corporations are generally just evil and
that's just how things are individuals
can be good people but corporations in
general are just bad now we always do
here though that Nvidia is gimping the
drivers and what this means is that you
know when Nvidia releases a new car with
new drivers that the other games either
are made slower forcing you to go oh my
god I don't want this card I need to
absolutely buy the newer card because my
games now suck so we decided that we
would test out two different drivers and
see is this actually true so we tested
the previous three nine nine two four
driver we did this on the 1080 TI we
tested this card and we tested all its
glory made sure that everything was good
we did about fifteen games a few other
tests and stuff like that but then after
the launch of the RT X we decided okay
now let's test this on the four 1163
driver which is the latest driver that's
out on the market right now and honestly
is there any difference between these
two is Nvidia gimping the games making
games run slower because of the new
driver forcing you to really make that
decision we're going oh my god all my
games really suck now me to buy a car
well we did the testing if you guys
don't know about our test systems pretty
pretty nice test system features an i7
8700 K 16 gigabytes of RAM all your
standard type of stuff it's a pretty
nice system though all in all we're
using the latest Windows 10 with all the
latest patches we use the w HQ L drivers
399 to 4 and for 1163 like I said
earlier but with that said let's jump in
let's rock out to the benchmark and
let's see did Nvidia GIMP any of your
games
all right so the tester and you guys can
see that either the games perform a
couple of frames better or a couple of
frames you know worse but nothing at all
suggesting that the drivers have been
gimped I mean GIMP to be like you know
you're playing one of the games and all
of a sudden it with the new driver it's
playing 10 frames per second worse than
what you were doing before and you're
like what the heck is going on but we
see you know some improvements in some
games and then a few games that didn't
really do much improve and that's really
to be expected honestly if you even
install drivers and install them and
mess with your system you'll always
honestly get a different score every
time so if you're only seeing a few
frames per second that pretty much
proves that in video didn't do any
gimping whatsoever on these drivers if
they did like I said you'd see a much
farther space between the different
drivers like you'd see you know three
nine nine two four you'd see it running
the driver at some you know really great
thing and then when you install four
eleven six three all of a sudden you'd
be like oh my god like this games like
it sucks now I came and turned this on I
was doing this before and we didn't see
any of that happening whatsoever so I
would have to say that at this point
right now I could not prove that Nvidia
is giving the driver whatsoever now if
other people have run of their tests hey
I'd love to hear your guy's opinion like
usual from what our tests and what we've
seen right here you know and know we've
been paid no money by Nvidia I know
people have a say you're an Nvidia
shield if you say anything good about
anybody you've been paid you know so if
I happen to like cherry pie did the
cherry pie companies pay me off right or
just like cherry pie - I like Coke over
Pepsi was I paid by Coke no it's just a
matter of personal taste and I can tell
you right here with the numbers and
seeing what's going on here there really
is no gimping going on now when future
drivers come out we can go back and test
these things and see if there's a
difference but for now it seems like
there's no shadiness whatsoever going
from the old driver to the new driver so
peace out if you like that device we
showed the beginning of the video we'll
have a link to it plus more information
about the 2080 cards down below peace
we'll see you back here on the channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
