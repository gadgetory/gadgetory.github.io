I'll wreck fairs here and today we're
going to be taking an unboxing and first
tech look at a new product and the
people over at AE soos what's not really
that new but it's still a really cool
product and one of the really good
things about this new zone our essence
XTX card is as a hundred and twenty four
DB signal-to-noise ratio not a lot of
people out there going what exactly does
that mean well that means that the card
is going to be very high and clear
clarity card 124 signal noise Rachel
means you have a large area before you
start getting a bunch of weird sounds
like you know background noise in
kissing alloy or just like this
garden right here you can throw on
headphones and be done with them
unfortunately I got a deal with when I'm
healing today not really liking it but
anyways this card is really
technologically a very very sound and
solid card it's coming to market about
you get anywhere from one hundred and
sixty-four dollars anywhere up to like
two hundred dollars but if you look
around you can get up around one hundred
and sixty dollars online they've got it
at Amazon for about a hundred and
sixty-three bucks so today we're gonna
actually take this thing apart
you
first of all like any good boxing I will
show you guys at the front of the box
open up we're going to go inside of here
now I know you guys hate it and if you
read up the box but I mean basically
that's why these guys make boxes there's
a reason why they do make a box if you
guys take a look at but I was going to
go over some of the really cool things
nietzsche con capacitors all the way
around these the best top-of-the-line
ones they're all gold you can see them
this thing also has op-amp technology
which means that you can basically
change the way the sound card sounds
that's right you can change it from
anywhere from being very high and very
tinny and clear with no bass all the way
down to like a super rapper likes with
like very solid bass but not that much
high-end it's very very real all you do
is you're going to pull these little
heat problems off change them off and
you can actually change the way that the
card sounds and that's head we're going
to refocus and start looking at the card
over here so we've actually open this
box a couple times because we were
checking this card out it was really
cool so
full profit basically the unboxing stuff
so if you guys know the Box a little
thing move that other way so here we can
see the packaging is a plastic overlay
I'll just go ahead and remove that to
get it out of the way the card in the
plastic and underneath is the actual so
the contents of the box so we'll get
that stuff actually out of the way real
quick and let's you folks see that we
have the zone our essence XTX
this is their Quick Start Guide it's
gonna tell you all the different
connectivity way to hook up your card
now this card's different than a lot of
other sound cards out there you actually
have to have a molex power connector on
it that's for the headphone amp did you
get very clean headphone amp clarity
with that let me get this out of the way
this little jack right here which is
actually the one that I will be
utilizing when I put the speakers in
here behind me I've got my out the
cleansing these are my expressionist
speakers I'm going to be hooking these
to the sound card and then plugging them
into my little green plug into my
computer right there I will be using
this plug set that off to the side you
get a zone art essence xef is your audio
precision test report like a Zeus has
gone way out of their way to make sure
that this sound card is totally high-end
it's geared for audiophiles
if you're just a basic gamer who only
has like you know 20 $30 headphones this
is not your town card it's just not this
things geared for the audiophile who
wants to use a really pro set of
headphones one of the great things about
this but they have all the lab results
inside of here which tells you all the
different things about it total harmonic
distortion see the noise ratio all that
stuff if you're watching the video to
say this is an overpriced thing blah
blah blah blah for some people out there
it might be but if you want clear very
warm sound you're going to invest your
money and you're going to want to take a
look at this like I said it's not for
the meek here's the sound card driver
get that out of the way a lot of people
ask in the phoebus video if there was
digital audio on it optical and yes
there was I just forgot to show you guys
a thing my bad my apologies
here's the headphone jack and right here
is the little optical plug this plugs
into the car and your optical cable
plugs in right here a couple more things
here before get to the card this is just
basically a poster and then again a
another poster so two posters now let's
get to the card you guys can see on the
back here we have standard quarter inch
headphone jacks
there's been previous generation cards
from Asus that have had sent Iser
headphones I have those I plan on
testing those out here as well here are
the two ports that I'm going to be using
those are these two right here I'll just
plug right into here nice and simply I'm
not going to do it and like I said if
you're going to use the optical cable it
plugs in right down here at the bottom
take a quick look right here PCIe quick
look at the back now I'm going to take a
quick break off here folks I'm just not
going to do the total thing in the
cameras it takes too much time but there
are four screws in the back of here
so real quick folks I will show you guys
everywhere on the card where I have
taken the screws out there's one here
one here one here and there's going to
be a final one right here which I'm now
going to remove I'm going to take the
card over go ahead and remove this so
let's take now a closer look at the card
now that we've strip it down to its
naked form now this card's broken up
into two sections this is the power
section of the card and this is the
audio section of the card we're going to
start here at the back we can see that
we have a single power connector right
here then through here we have two more
capacitors that are right here these are
actual for power conditioning then we
can see we have all the Nietzsche con
these are all their gold-plated parts
like we talked about before if you have
your old-school CD or whatever and you
want to hook it up directly into here
you have the option to be ability to do
that as well we're going to flip it back
around here now there are two chips on
here there's the a Zeus right here this
is a combined with C media they helped
design this chip and then right here is
an additional chip and this is basically
the power translator which helps
transfer all the power stuff into the
audio section to make the clean audio
now let's jump over to the audio section
of the card one thing I want everybody
to take note of is right here there's a
little copper thing right here you can
see this this is actually a separator
for the sound from the power I know that
you guys might think wow a wall but
that's actually what it's really doing
this is actually a copper wall
separating the power from the sound part
of the card now this card features hyper
routing circuitry design this is
something exclusive to a Zeus where they
utilize the PCB design to separate
signal and noise ensuring only the
cleanest signals that are passed to the
sensitive components this one's actually
ensures your headphones sound really
clean don't hear any hissing or any that
go into it once again we see the new
chicon Feingold professional audio
capacitors these capacitors use
state-of-the-art edging technologies
nietzsche cons feingold capacitors
deliver rich bass and crystal-clear high
frequencies this is why this card is
basically an audiophile cards not using
any low-end components whatsoever
another thing that separates the zone
our essence STX from its peers is it
uses superior decks use the beurre Brown
PCM 1792 a now these are the best
digital to analog converters you can get
in the market they convert signals at
127 DB signal-to-noise ratio
I've turned the card around folks so we
can look at some of the other features
about this card it also features
independent power sources for the line
and headphones out those are these right
here and then we also have the swappable
OPA sockets these are the opamp sockets
these are the ones I was telling you
about before that you can remove on here
and change them to get different types
of sounds on the card that's this little
chip right here now that's going to be
very interesting JJ from Asus has
actually said that they have another kit
they can send me I'm actually going to
remove this and change the sound out in
the future but that'll be another really
cool review the card also features a
perfectly sealed audio analog path you
can see that is the clearness all the
way around the card all the etchings
actually kept closed and by each other
so the kimonos don't have any electrical
leak on the card at all once again
providing clear and low noise sound
earlier we talked about the independent
power sources for the headphones but
there's also something that actually
helps the headphones sound really good
is the built-in headphone app the
essence XCX uses a high quality TI TP a
6-1 208 ooh headphone driver which
supports headphones to up to 600 ohms of
impedance drive your headphones is
intended without additional application
what this really means when they say
that is that there's enough power on the
car driven by the chip that even the
cards that have very very high ohms
which are the very highest ones you can
get out there like Denon bear all those
they're going to sound perfectly clear
in here and the headphones will be able
to drive them hence why this this thing
is called a headphone amp for
audiophiles
so folks that's pretty much all of the
great features of the new essence STX
zone art from the people over at asu's I
mean you guys can just see from the
layout all the goal components from the
way the power comes in its power
conditioning this is not just your
run-of-the-mill sound card if you take a
plate off any other sound card you're
just going to see a few little
capacitors here and there they're not
going to be gold or anything else like
that so hey folks I hope that you like
this I tried to bring this a much more
in depth unboxing and first look at the
features of this card so I'll be seeing
you guys back here is I actually hooked
this card into my system back there and
will show you a video first we'll show
it as we install the card then we'll
show you sound using the old on board of
the board that I have over there which
you guys know is the rampage for extreme
and then we'll show you what it sounds
like with the new zone our essence STX
thanks for watching I'm Eric and I'll
catch you guys back here on deck or
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
