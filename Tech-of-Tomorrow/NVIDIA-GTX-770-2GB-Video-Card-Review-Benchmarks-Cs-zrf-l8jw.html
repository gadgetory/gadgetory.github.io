the channel on launch day of the gtx 770
now i know a lot of people have a lot of
questions about this what is this thing
all about how fast it what are its specs
well pretty much this card is still
based off the GK 104 chipset it's still
the same as the GTX 680 now the Titan
and the 780 they were all based off the
gk110 now there's a lot of cards that
are going to be released some will be
referenced design which are the cards
that are design inspect by Nvidia
themselves and there will be the non
reference based cards which of the cards
that actually have completely different
PCBs and cooling solutions on that for
today's first review we'll be talking
about the reference Edition which I have
sitting right here so that you more
further ado let's jump in and let's talk
more about the new geforce gtx 770
taking a closer look at the gtx 770 i
want to once again reiterate that it has
the GK 104 core it's based on the 28
nanometer process it has 1536 CUDA cores
just like the GTX 680 now unlike the GTX
680 the core clock of the nvidia gtx 770
has a thousand 46 megahertz core clock
unlike the thousand six megahertz in the
gtx 680 it also has a boost clock of a
thousand eighty five megahertz versus a
thousand 39 mega seen on the nvidia gtx
680 one of the biggest differences
however is the memory clock the gtx 680
came in at 1500 and 2 megahertz while
the nvidia gtx 770 comes in at 1700 and
53 megahertz and is actually the fastest
memory clocked to date the memory
configuration on the card that we
receive which is the reference model
features 2 gigabytes just like the gtx
680 but there will be 4 gigabyte cards
available both cards feature a 256-bit
memory interface and the TDP and the
cards is slightly different with the gtx
680 coming in at 195 watts and the gtx
770 coming in at 200 watts another
difference is how the power requirements
go while the gtx 680 requires two 6-pin
power connectors the new gtx 770
requires a single 6 and a single 8 pin
power
connecter so you guys can see in many
ways the new gtx 770 highly resembles
the gtx 680 one of the major differences
about the card though is going to be GPU
boost 2.0 GPU boost 2.0 actually works
on how cool your cards running so the
cool your card is running the better boo
speeds you're going to get so some of
these cards that i've aftermarket
cooling will actually be able to achieve
better boost clocks another big
difference between the previous
generation gtx 680 and the new geforce
gtx 770 is the way it looks at its
cooling solution the previous
generations used a big plastic house
with a big old blower on that kind of
sounded like a lot more in some cases
now the new gtx 770 uses the same type
of cooling solution as the 690 the titan
and the 780 and hey Who am I kidding
this thing just really looks badass a
pair of these with nice glowing green
GeForce logo on the side of it looks
really really cool let's now take a
quick look at the rear i/o you guys can
see that there are two DVI connections
an HDMI port and a standard display port
you can also hook up four monitors
simultaneously
all right folks now before we actually
jump in and we talked about the
benchmarks and everything a lot of you
guys leave things I'm below saying hey
didn't leave us enough information about
the test system we'll check it out if
you guys happen to miss the video on our
test station check that out right here
it'll also be in the description down
below so with that said it's time to
rock out and let's go check out some
benchmark
all right folks so there you guys have
it all the facts figures and benchmarks
of the new nvidia geforce gtx 770 now
this card really is pretty much a
boosted up re Revd gtx 680 gather a few
changes it's got much higher clock
speeds much higher memory and it has GPU
boost 2.0 along with all the better
cooling and all that stuff that comes on
the card now a lot of people are going
to ask well how does this compete
against the competition we want to
clarify a couple of things because the
comments sometimes get confusing there's
a big difference between the 7970
standard edition and the 7970 gigahertz
edition now the H is gigahertz Edition
that we use sells for about 460 dollars
and you guys can see in the test that it
went back and forth back and forth with
the 770 in some cases it beat it in some
cases it didn't but it is a little bit
more expensive making the big selling
factor overall about the new 770 being
the price seeing that it's coming to
market to the reference edition for $399
and some of the aftermarket ones are
between 409 and 420 I feel this is a
very solid deal and very competitive for
this range so taking all that into
consideration the price the performance
the new geforce experience 1.5 there are
a lot of really cool things about this
card and its software stuff about it now
before i bounce out of here we did a lot
of coverage today we did three different
unboxings we did the asus direct cu2
version we did the gigabyte windforce
overclocked version and the EVGA SC
superclocked version as far as unboxings
we've got overclocked videos using the a
Zeus GPU tweak and one of the biggest
videos that you guys have always been
requesting is sli performance and we
have that so all that stuff is up here
behind me in the screen so you guys can
click on any one of these things and go
over the video if not you guys can click
on the link in the description below
that's down there by that like button if
you guys liked all the coverage please
make sure you pound the hell out of that
button and if you're not subscribed hey
make sure you do so you don't miss out
on any of the videos here on tech of
tomorrow I'm networking we'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
