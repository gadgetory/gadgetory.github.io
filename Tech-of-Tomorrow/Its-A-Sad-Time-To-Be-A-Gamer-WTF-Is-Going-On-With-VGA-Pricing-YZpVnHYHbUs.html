one of the crappiest times in the entire
history of gaming due to not only the
miners which this has just become a huge
thing every miner out there is trying to
buy every video card on the market and
in all honesty I've have a lot of people
contacting me asking me if I have
contacts to get them a hundred video
cards 50 video cards I'm not joking here
at all people have been content and just
because I have a reviewer and going hey
can you get me these cards well that is
one part of the problem
miners are buying up every card that
there is so for gamers hmm pickings are
very very slim now that's one bad aspect
to the market honestly these companies
are making head over foot money because
everybody is buying these things up like
crazy I've kind of even slowed down even
asking for video card review samples
because I figure I'm gonna get probably
told to chill out because there's so
many of selling they can't keep and keep
these things on the shelf but what's
actually worse about this and this is
the part that really really sucks is now
there's tons of price gouging going on
that's right
price gouging even on Newegg even on
Amazon and lots of other places out
there are gouging prices is unbelievable
a gtx 1050 going for $1,000 come on
that's a $300 card another place there's
another different card same type going
at $600 the 1080i is there people
selling these things for unbelievable
prices out there twelve and thirteen
hundred bucks of these cards which makes
it if you're a gamer you can't get ahold
of these things that sucks but all this
price gouging and asking more money than
what the face value of the video card is
I just honestly it disgust me
I look at that a new wig and I think to
myself man I don't want to buy from
these people I really don't cuz price
gouging to me really sucks it's like
taking advantage of somebody that's the
way I feel that really is about it sure
like Jesus said this morning in the car
guys I was talking about it he was like
oh let's supply and demand so you just
have to deal with it but you know what
it's not about just supply and demand
supply and demand is one thing you know
being able to get the prices that the
cards are worth without a problem is a
good thing you know if nvidia releases a
card and that card supposed to be five
hundred ninety nine dollars that's what
it's maximum like really cost is going
and selling that card for nine and a
thousand dollars is just totally
ridiculous the same thing on the AMD
side of things with the mining you know
when the RX vega came out you could even
get it the frontier came edition out you
couldn't get it cuz everybody bought it
up and they wanted to do their mining at
at the same time then we saw that price
gouging and honestly I probably will I
hate to say this I mean I'll probably
end up buying something from Newegg or
Amazon but it it's gonna be with kind of
like a bad taste in my mouth doing it I
will admit this because when I see
companies doing this price gouging it
just seems to me like a thief a thief
who knows you got it to you over the
barrel they know you want it so they're
like you know what hey man there's only
this mini Apple so we're gonna charge
this much money and yeah I mean hey I
understand the concept of making profit
and everything but regardless of
understanding the situation and being
able to stomach it and and and be able
to say okay I'll put my rubber stamp on
this and say this is a freaking good
thing absolutely not so right now if
you're a gamer trying to build yourself
a gaming system with almost any card out
there now they're getting harder and
harder and harder and harder to find and
that's just totally utterly ridiculous
now the reason I made this video I
wasn't even gonna make it because I saw
the chance when the people have made
similar type videos when people just
kept emailing me and say Ulrich you've
got to say something about this man this
is just ridiculous so therefore you know
I was like alright fine I will go ahead
and I'll make this video so gamers huh I
don't really know what to say right now
luckily I have cards that I that I'm
using in my own systems for my gaming
stuff but right now if I was to go out
and try to build a system and everything
as soon as I wanted to get to a video
card section I'd be halted or I have to
spend a shit ton of money just to get my
video card because you know somebody's
gonna be selling a GTX 1080i they're
gonna be asking twelve and thirteen
hundred dollars for it come on man you
guys bitch it me when I build 500 hour
systems about using certain parts so
using a video card that's gonna be
thirteen hundred bucks is going to be a
real
determined to building that dam system
and I want to know what you guys want to
think as we'll do you guys think that
the price gouging is really shitty or do
you guys like you guys think it's hey
that's totally ok man like you know it's
cool like you know it's supply and
demand like G says you know is that what
it is and do you guys accept that and
and as you accept it do you go to the
market like a sheep and just buy
whatever stuff is going on there for
these high prices because honestly if I
was just right now going out to build a
gaming system I would probably be sorely
disappointed I feel sorry a lot from
people out there who have children and
they're on budgets and they still want
to be able to get their kids a nice
gaming PC so I kind of hard right now
honestly I know you guys are gonna want
to slap me when you see this but at the
moment man the brand new Xbox this you
know isn't sounding like such a bad
thing in fact I ordered one myself you
know just so I could play fours on it so
if you can't get in to a gaming PC
because these out raves as prices you
really only bet it's to do two things
either by really outdated stuff that's
really cheap that's barely gonna play
anything or if you really want your kids
to have fun with gaming you're just kind
of gonna go with a console because at
this moment right now right now and I
say this you know the grain of salt
right now you can't go ahead and mine
with those but the second that you can
mine with a Playstation or you can mine
with an Xbox boy you can tell me xbox is
will be the old no longer see those for
$1.99 there'll be $7.99 for an Xbox so
let's just hope things do not get there
so thanks for watching the channel guys
I always want to hear your guys opinions
out there as a gamer right now do you
feel like your situation is very screwed
because you can't buy a video card does
that piss you off let me know down below
if you think it's totally cool the
tharok price-gouging also let me know if
you think it's total BS let me know as
well because I like to interact with you
guys and I want to know your opinion so
I'm mark
this is Tekken Amaro we'll see you guys
back here for more videos next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
