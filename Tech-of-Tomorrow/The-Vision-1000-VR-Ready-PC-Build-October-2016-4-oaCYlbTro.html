fans welcome back once again to Tekken
tomorrow I'm Eric your host today we're
gonna be taking a look at a killer
little system we called the vision which
is an AMD based system it's a thousand
bucks basically it's a little bit under
$1,000 and this system kicks ass and
1080p 1440 and we'll play VR no problem
what so ever now Before we jump in
though I talked about a few things like
I got this headset and everything we
were like alright cool man like you know
like 800 bucks you know for these things
and we get it and it comes in like we're
on Cave cool will gallo all these VR
game to start playing VR and it's like
as soon as you get it's like no you
gotta invest $200 more for the piece
that can do all your motion sensing so
even if you go out and you buy this
thing why don't I think about this make
sure you get the other part otherwise
you end up with this you know great
oculus rift headset which is pretty cool
cuz the speakers and everything are all
built in and it looks great but if you
want to play first-person shooter games
you're gonna have to buy that additional
part so with that said though this
system really kicks ass it looks nice
all the parts inside of it are very nice
the build is totally clean it's running
behind me right now so you guys can hear
the system runs very very silent all the
fans actually come inside the case you
need to worry about spending any extra
money investing on that and this time we
bring the entire system to you including
the OS so for those people that are
looking to buy a total tower from
scratch obviously you're going to buy
the US if you're somebody out there you
already have the OS you're not gonna
give a crap but I just got to say this
everything that has to do with Vulcan
and all the things they AMD fans are you
know totally embracing has to do with
Windows 10 and the DirectX 12 features
and all those things working together so
if you want the absolute best out of
your system you're gonna need to get
Windows 10 and then unfortunately that's
a very hard one to pirate these days
Mazal just buy it and be done with it
though so with that said though let's
jump in real quick though let's check
out those parts then let's check out the
system let's see the gaming and then
let's talk a little bit about the VR
experience let's rock
for this build we use the corsair
carbide for the case now this thing
looks pretty killer it's got lots of
room for expansion it's a great price
and best of all it matches the theme of
the colors for this great AMD build for
the motherboard we have the gigabyte 970
gaming SLI board this thing will do
crossfire and it's a very very nice
product powering this system is the
course there are CX 550 m the CPU is the
FX 63 50 from AMD featuring their new
Wraith cooler and for the video card we
used an RX 480 by the people over at
diamond multimedia it's basically a
reference design card but works well in
this system for our storage we have the
backup plus from Seagate this is a 2
terabyte USB 3.0 drive that works
perfect for storing all your games on we
have a 240 gigabyte force le SSD from
Corsair and last but not least we have 8
gigabytes of Vengeance memory ddr3 once
again from Corsair you guys can see that
everything fits very nicely inside the
corsair Carbide you can't see any cables
the cable management was done very very
well on this so all your airflow flows
right across all those parts keeping
your entire system nice and cool and for
those people who hate clutter hey no
matter how OCD you are you'll love this
we forego the option of installing a CD
player because almost everything that
you install nowadays once you install
Windows 10 you'll be up and getting all
the rest of your drivers off the
internet but for those people who
actually absolutely have to have a CD
player you can always just get an
external one install your drivers and
throw it back in the dusty drawer where
you got it from another great thing
about the vision build is that you have
the opportunity for plenty of expansion
you can throw in more video cards for
crossfire you've got plenty of room for
more drives so whether it be more video
cards more drives and just more more
more there's plenty of room inside the
Carbide for you to expand real quick
before we jump into the performance
analysis I want to talk a little bit
about the VR experience now like I said
it takes an additional 200 hour part
which we order we're just waiting for it
to get here but we were able to play
things like ninja VR and stuff like that
where you guys can actually see my
daughter and her friends playing around
this you have to jump around and do a
bunch of stuff it actually wears your
ass out with a bunch of exercise so not
only do you get to play the VR game
which looks really cool I honestly
which I could bring the VR experience
right across to you unfortunately all
you can get is my verbage but let me
tell you this stuff is really cool the
first time you experience VR and this is
my daughter's first time ever experience
it and her friend you guys can see that
people really love it you can see the
expressions on their face you can see
the excitement and their movements and
this is great now there were a few
things though that we weren't able to do
there were some games that when we tried
to download them they said hey this
system does not meet the minimum
requirements to do that so there are
some VR things out there that take an
even more powerful system than this and
I think that a lot of you folks out
there who understand you know what's
going on a new technology realized this
even at $1000 in stuff that's still kind
of his semi budget system there are
systems out there I've seen for forty
five hundred dollars five thousand
dollars all completely tricked out
obviously you can build low-end systems
but super duper low-end systems
obviously aren't going to be you know
geared for a VR experience now once I
get this a little component we'll come
back to you guys we'll talk a little bit
more about the system but just initially
our VR experience was really fun and the
system can obviously handle almost all
the VR stuff that's out there like I
said there may be a few things out there
that require you know a little bit more
of a buffed out system but hey our
experience so far thumbs up now let's
check out some performance scores
all right everybody so there you have it
the vision at under thousand dollar VR
system that totally kicks ass in gaming
if you're doing 1080p you're doing 1440
you guys can see it kicks ass and best
of all if you have a free sink monitor
you can lock that up at 144 Hertz
and all your stuff looks beautiful
that's why the monitor I have back
behind her by the way I will have a link
to all the parts in this video including
the monitor that I have behind me the
oculus rift including the extra 200 on
our part that you need to get up and
going to play all those third-person
shooter games and all that other fun
stuff that'll all be down below that
like button so hi mark
you guys been watching Tekken tomorrow
like I said VR is the future and for
$1,000 being able to play all of your
games plenty of expansion in this system
you guys saw paint VR can be fun it's a
little bit of investment right now still
a little bit pricey
since the oculus is like eight hundred
dollars and you guys buy the other 200
are part two so it's like seven arms
sell Legum okay I'll just be honest
that's why I don't have any feet I sold
them for an oculus rift no I'm just
 with y'all but it's pretty funny
though right they see an arm and a leg
nobody to sell my two front feet and I'm
a two front teeth but my two fun feet to
get myself some oculus so anyways check
it out guys have a lot of fun to this
video the build is awesome we're gonna
be building some cool gaming areas and
doing a bunch of more fun on the
channel so follow along we'll see you
guys back here for more tech more VR and
just more fun stuff here on Tekken
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
