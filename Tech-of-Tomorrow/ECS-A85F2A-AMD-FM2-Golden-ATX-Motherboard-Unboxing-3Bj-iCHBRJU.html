Thermaltake makers of the TT eSports
line the level 10 and many other mice
keyboards and peripherals
what's up tech fans welcome to tech o
tomorrow today we're looking at the EC
es a 85 f2 - a golden motherboard now
this is a badass motherboard base for
the AMD fans out there supports
piledriver all their latest CPUs and one
thing these guys want to push is gold
now this got the bling man I mean
this thing flava flav could wear and
he'd be on his neck but that's some of
the main things about it it's a golden
board which means a basically an entire
board is going to be gold we did a video
on this earlier for the Intel series of
CPUs now let's look at the AMD version
first off let's open the box and let's
check out the features that they're
bragging about on their inside cover
alright folks I open up the front cover
right here they have their non stop
technology this is basically all the
different ways that they've tested this
motherboard made sure that it worked
correctly they have five star stability
over here they have thx audio here once
again they say friendly design three
times the extra gold I think that
gigabyte had 2x2 the copper on the board
now these guys are having three times
the gold so that's pretty trippy stuff
over here we've got the other inside
cover where you can see it's the a85 f2
- a golden supports the AMD a-series apu
in the FM 2 package so down below that
we have the extreme performance for your
gaming station they have - a GPU CFX
says 75% boosted ddr3 2600 overclocked
140 percent boosted here it says once
again three times the extra gold over
here we have their hyper alloy choke it
says hyper durability 1.5 stability you
can see down here they show all their
caps and chokes all having gold and all
that good stuff on it so I won't bore
you if this stuff anymore we'll go ahead
and unbox this bad boy on the other side
if you have to purchase the board though
they do show it like this
so I'm also show up for you folks you
guys can see here's a picture of a
knight right here ECS golden board the
first and only shows golden USB 2.0
eSATA golden VGA DVI golden display
HDMI golden USB 3.0 golden LAN USB 3.0
and golden audio ports and even a golden
IO shield so that's the rear i/o shield
but that you guys can see you can see
right here down here it has all the
different things emeralds let's bring
this up to you guys and some of it you
can't see but it does say it supports
the a-10 a 8a 6a for all of the socket
FM to CD is so let's go ahead and bring
this thing out of the box so I'm going
to go ahead and pull this thing out once
again we have the Box ception box Luna
box
yeah I'm spinning around spinning
blackbucks no all right it's not so
inside you can see it's all in its
little cover there you find with a
little thing pops open here back it up
we'll pull the motherboard out of the
way first off let's take a look at the
accessories pack you pull this box out
of here on the lid up here
let's talk accessories flip the cap here
spin it around here we see two four six
seven SATA cables seven alread SATA
cables we see the golden rear i/o
the manual the CD all your drivers and
all that good stuff is gonna be on here
and then we have the EC s elite group
this is like their installation guide
and all that stuff shows you all the
basic stuff I know you guys all want to
see the board so I'm trying to get there
as fast as possible for you folks all
right so that looks like that's all that
comes in that so we'll move past the
accessories paddle light there but hey
you're looking for the board right
packaging here and now let's start
looking at the board alright folks so
here she is in all of her glory let's
start up right here we can see the first
of the eight pin power connectors to the
right of that we see the first CPU fan
now you guys can see that all the
capacitors and everything all over are
made of gold over here we see all of our
chokes and everything and you can see we
once again have a gold heatsink right
there makes a nice little musical noise
I hope you guys can hear that actually
I'll bring it up to the mics to you guys
and hear it so it's the music gold
golden board over to the right of that
we have the memory you have four
channels right there for ddr3 it
supports 2600 overclock we saw that on
the outside the box here is the ZIF
socket you guys can see that all the way
around there's actually pretty good room
for using in the aftermarket solution
like a water cooler or anything like
that which was what I think most people
are gonna use over here to the right
once again we see more golden components
and we see the 24 and power connector
right here as well move down we see some
more golden parts down here it's all
gold like they were saying down here we
see another gold little heatsink now as
far as the PCI we have two of them
they're both 16 x1 is located here one
is located here they're actually spaced
far enough apart so that you can use
many of the larger cards that are
variable on the
right now especially like some of those
a giant card that you see that a soos
makes their giant size we see one two
three of the PCI 1x slots and then two
of your standard PCI slots I'm going to
move the board over to the side a little
bit
none of the right of the board we see
the SATA ports there are six of them and
they are all based on the latest status
six right above that we see the eSATA
port and you can see once again says
serial ata six gigabits a second board
around again the battery says easy
charger USB 3.0 what that means that
this will basically charge here down
here we see the easy charger USB 3.0
what this means is that when you use
this bracket right here you can plug
things into it they'll charge your phone
and all that other good stuff here's all
your the rest of your external headers
it's a USB 3.0 external we see two more
system fan ports right here we get
s/pdif comm ports a lot of stuff you
won't use an audio port most people
won't use that they'll flip the board
around to this side here we can see some
other function of the board low EMI HD
audio giggle and another thing it says
it says ESD protection
now what ESD protection means when
you're plugging things in and out of
your board you won't get an electrical
shock and blow those things out they're
usually located right below it me one of
the port's that you're using and it's a
good thing to have I'm gonna flip the
board now filing to the rear i/o where
we can once again see that everything is
based in gold DVI VGA HDMI I Triple E we
have our little reset the CMOS button
here then we have eSATA two regular USB
ports and then we have one two more sets
of the USB 3.0 ports offering you four
on the rear i/o the land port and
finally the audio including
Digital all right everybody I hope you
guys enjoyed that this is a pretty nice
looking board it's really geared for
like the boutique type user though who's
looking to build something to make it
look like bling I mean obviously if
you're gonna have somebody who has their
case closed on the side I mean this
boards not gonna be a little appealing
but if you're a guy like this guy not
they're named Al he does all his Purple
Heart veteran stuff he built the system
all in gold you guys might have seen
that floating around Facebook you guys
might want to support him as well we'll

bullcrap that happened last week between

of people out there gave me hate because

trolls and stuff like that I apologize
