tomorrow you guys know why I'm if you
don't I'm Network your host now we post
a video a couple of days ago talking
about this giant giveaway that we're
doing in conjunction with our music and
there were a lot of questions about
what's going on in stuff so I thought I
would once again reiterate and make an
update video telling you guys exactly
what is up so let's start off first of
all by addressing the questions what you
guys are buying is a music pack and by
buying that music pack you guys qualify
for a drawing that we're going to have
to give away massive systems we're
giving away the Tron we're giving away
the samurai we're giving a dark raven
we're given the mini and we've got some
other AMD systems including GTX 970 s
and there's some options if you're a
European winner and you win and you
can't afford shipping on the system you
can get a 970 card we will ship that to
you at our cost you not to pay for
anything as far as the music goes a lot
of people that ask and hey do we get the
download instantly does it come to us
well it will come to you as soon as we
are done mixing and mastering the music
should be by next weekend no later we're
just taking our time to make sure
everything's totally tightened up and
sounding awesome for you guys the fans
that's what we want to do currently
right now we have about 230 openings
still left so there's still a chance for
you guys to jump in on it another
question that keeps coming up all the
time is I have people send me the thing
they're saying hey am I in am I nmin if
the video is going open and we're
accepting your money then you are in as
soon as we reach our 750 entry level we
will cut it off and start refunding
people their money so unless you're
seeing a refund in the next few minutes
on your thing you can know that you are
in now one more thing before i go out of
here i'm even going to sweeten the pot
even more so there'll be a main prize
and there'll be a secondary price
secretary prize will be something like a
motherboard headphones mouth something
really cool but this way they'll be
actually two winners per hundred your
chance are pretty good there you can say
oh there's some of that but that's still
great odds for something this awesome
one of the main reasons that we're doing
this is that we get a lot of complaints
from people saying hey you have 400,000
subscribers and my name just getting
lost in the mix so doing something like
this it actually helps us and it helps
you as well it helps us keep the music
going to bring
back to you and it also helps you guys
get a better chance at winning these
awesome systems I got plenty of more
free giveaways coming up but it's going
to be the same thing subscribers and
stuff like that and your chance they're
going to be four hundred thousand to one
I mean that's just how it's going to be
that's the way the cookie crumbles so we
do things like this to give you guys a
much shorter chance to win a prize and
also help support the channel and keep
us going a lot of people out that I
wanted to say thank you very much the
comments tower positive much much much
totally build away all the negative
comments and I love you guys for that so
many of you people really seem to
understand what we're doing here and
love us for doing it and you were the
folks that we love the most for you guys
are complaining hey I don't know what to
do we're trying to do our best for you
we keep trying to change things up we're
an ever-growing ever-evolving company
I'm Elric thanks for watching tech
tomorrow if you happen to miss the last
video make sure you check that out plus
all the information once again will be
down below in the description next week
we've got awesome stuff coming up apple
just came out their new imacs we're
going to have one of those bad boys in
with the new retina 5k display that's
going to be totally badass the only
thing I'm hearing funky about that is I
don't think this thing actually works is
external monitor also that'll be kind of
weird so if you have like a mini mac or
whatever you want to get up to it I
don't think you're gonna be able to do
it but that's the only thing so far that
I've heard about it we've also got a
brand-new eight-hundred-dollar AMD
system coming up you guys are going to
totally dig it's what you've been asking
for low price AMD system so hey I'm off
to have some fun with a buddy the dog I
love you guys thanks for watching the
channel hey thank you so much for
supporting the music you guys don't know
what that means to me and the team we do
this stuff for you and hey we love you
for being here once again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
