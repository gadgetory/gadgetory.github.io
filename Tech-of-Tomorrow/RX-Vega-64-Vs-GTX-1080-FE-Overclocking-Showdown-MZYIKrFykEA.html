by the courser one pro gaming system get
your game on okay are you guys ready for
a challenge
how about overclocking with the GT X
1080 fountain edition versus the RX Vega
64 but this time the liquid cooled
edition of the Vega and the founders
edition which is an air-cooled card but
crazy overclocking we tested like 28
games all overclocked and so those the
results we're gonna be bringing you guys
today now we used wot man for all of the
AMD overclocking and then we used
afterburner from MSI for all the stuff
on the GTX 1080 side of things so for
those guys wondering what do we use to
do the aura clocking well those were the
two tools that we use but we've got a
whole lot of games and I think at the
end of the day you guys are going to
look at the results to go wow I think
this is actually pretty interesting
because really the results thing today
are very very interesting it's a very
very swap off thing between the two
cards I mean I think you guys will
totally agree that the things that kind
of balance out between them make them in
a way pretty equal you know there's
we'll just we'll just jump right in
first let's first talk about the test
system the drivers were used then let's
get in there let's check out those
benchmarks so the parts that we use in
the test bench that you're seeing in
today's video consists of an Intel Core
i7 6700 K at 4.0 gigahertz which turbos
to 4.6 gigahertz now this was done in an
asrock z170 motherboard 16 gigabytes of
HyperX ddr4 at 3333 megahertz the driver
that we used for the gtx 1080 was the
whq l3 5.41 and for the Vegas 64 we used
the 17.8 2 driver all results in today's
testing show average frame rates but we
also include the minimum frame rates as
well alright gamers Before we jump in
and conclude the video let's check out a
word from today's sponsor Corsair the
Corsair one pro is the perfect compact
gaming PC standing at just under 15
inches tall with a depth of 7.7 inches
it features a liquid-cooled GTX 1080i so
you know you're going to get amazing 4k
graphics it also has a liquid-cooled i7
CPU on a mini
ix motherboard and you can get up to 32
gigabytes of ddr4 DRAM memory with a 4
and 80 gigabyte m2 SSD which is 5 times
faster than a SATA SSD the one pro also
supports up to 2 2.5 inch drives at up
to 2 terabytes and best of all it's VR
ready with HDMI and USB ports right in
the front and you also get three USB 3.0
ports a USB 3.1 type C port the system
also comes pre-installed with Windows 10
so you can be up and going immediately
check one out today all right so that's
the Corsair 1 pro now let's check out
those benchmarks
now as far as the overclocking win on
the Vegas 64 its overall average was
1716 megahertz but the memory clocks
from the overclocking were pretty nice
from 945 megahertz to 1080 megahertz and
the temperatures never reached over 70
Celsius even under full load
now the overclocking results of the GTX
ten-eighty were pretty nice that as far
as the GPU boost goes we got nineteen
hundred and thirty-five megahertz and
the memory wasn't bad either
when we added three hundred and
seventy-five megahertz we were able to
achieve a final stable memory clock of
five thousand three hundred and
seventy-five megahertz and even though
the GTX 1080 did run a little hotter
than the Vegas 64 and obviously this
should actually be expected since it's
an air-cooled card it still remained
relatively cool in the mid 70 seats
throughout all of our testing okay now
don't throw rocks at me because I'm just
bringing you guys the information one
thing I want to say I know a lot of
people leave comments that always like
hey need to disable this and disable
that when you do the AMD card I'm gonna
be honest to you maybe that like might
be like in some people's book like an
even a way to do stuff but I don't
really feel so I'd have to really go
back and retest everything and turn all
those same features off on the Nvidia
card so for turning off all those extra
things you guys are saying hey man don't
test an AMD card with this thing I guess
in the future all experiment with that
but honestly I want my game to look the
best so I'm using the best you know I
want to have the best anti-aliasing all
that stuff when I'm watching games and
to me disabling that stuff it's kind of
you know making the card not all it can
be now obviously we're doing 4k testing
a lot of that anything-anything stuff
that really doesn't mean jack cuz
you got such a huge resolution but at
1080 and 1440 oh don't tell me that that
anti-aliasing stuff doesn't help because
the hell sure does it gets rid of all
those jaggies and just makes your game
look a lot smoother when you're going
through it so with all those tests and
all those things at the end of the day
we all know that right now you know
getting a hold of a water-cooled
rx Vegas 64 is kind of still kind of
like picking through a haystack and
trying to find that needle prices are
slowly starting to get there so wrapt
about we know that that card is a lot
more expensive now
one thing it's kind of nifty though is
that even with all that power that we
had to give that AMD card to reach those
results it still ran really cool and
that's kind of a really nice thing you
know and it actually isn't that loud
either so in those respects it's really
nice but at the end of the day
overall the $549 you know that the gtx
1085 is edition it actually does win in
the overclocking department between
these two cards right now now in the
future obviously new drivers thing
change we'll go back to it and those
things you know might change but as you
guys can see right now obviously the
memory cue can clock the out of
with you apply that power on the AMD
card but you're still getting almost
those same kind of numbers on the Nvidia
card with that f2 and you know crease
all that voltage up so for some people
out there increasing the voltage and all
that you might want to think about that
because it does lower the lifespan of
your card so you know if you really are
a person and overclocking is all that
you're interested in how well you guys
can see the car really doesn't you know
it doesn't overclock you know it's super
wily it does okay but it's not great
hopefully in the future the AMD rx 64
and the 56 will both do better but for
right now you guys can see from the test
the efi man it's it's it's just winning
and that's just the way it is those are
the numbers like always I want to see
you guys's comments down below I love
you guys and thanks for watching the
channel me but the dog and G we'll see
you guys back here in the channel for
more tech tomorrow please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
