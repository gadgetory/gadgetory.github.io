mechanical keyboards for under $60 I
tried to keep this shizmik under $50 but
man a mechanical keyboard $450 like
we're going for a needle in a haystack I
actually started doing a bunch of
research so I started reading the
comments lightweight saying it says
mechanical but it's just not even a real
mechanical keyboard so we were able to
pick out some really cool ones for under
60 bucks that's right cool mechanical
keyboards now some of these are actually
from $30 all the way up to $60 so let's
jump in and let's check out the very
first one which is by a company named
canang sounds something you chopped up
some like Chinese night sit or something
but I don't know let's check it out so
the can sing is an LED keyboard with
blue purple red color changing
illuminated backlit yes it's the
ultimate elite mechanical USB wired
ergonomic gaming keyboard for your
laptop or your PC and for those of you
folks out there who like you know color
changing in their keyboards all you got
to do is hit a couple of keys and then
the colors will change on this bad boy
and it's fully mechanical and it looks
pretty cool and I don't want people out
there going hey man who the hell is this
company it doesn't really matter this
thing's only about $30 so just you know
like eat a cheaper lunch or something
for a couple days you get this thing I
mean the ratings on it are pretty decent
I think for people out there who are
looking for mechanical keyboard but they
don't have a lot of money and they still
just want to have 130 bucks isn't a lot
of money so you might want to check out
this one from canang now it's next
keyboard I'm sure you guys have seen
either when I was running motherboards
at Oregon Tech tomorrow forgot which
channel we actually did it this is
actually the Roseville mechanical
keyboard I still have this keyboard it's
in my test room it's been banged up
smashed beaten on it still works this is
the Roseville RK 6000 mechanical gaming
keyboard with programmable keys
anti-ghosting features and laser printed
keys this bad boy has rubber-coated WASD
and arrow keys a braided cable USB
connector has a switch lifetime of 20
million cycles hmm and it's got 104 keys
so you're looking for something that I
have used I've used this particular
keyboard it's still working it's 49
bucks it's under 60 bucks if you want a
mechanical keyboard that doesn't have a
hole
a lot of bells and whistles but it's
basically programmable and is simple to
use paid this Rosewill is hard to beat
the RK 6000 is a solid piece of
equipment now this next one I can barely
pronounce it sounds kind of cool though
it's kind of like an indian name it's
like how you walk
it gets how you pronounce anyways if I'm
wrong I'm sorry but hey if you're
American young people I think it's a bad
name and that maybe you might want to
consider like you're changing it I know
we're now the Iowa Tribe crowd I love
you guys notice with look but check it
out this is the iowa FL esports
mechanical armor pro RGB colorful
rainbow smart backlit LED mechanical
felling gaming keyboard with 2
millimeter trigger stroke and 0 MX
switches for laptop desktops and pc now
this one looks really really cool you
can adjust all the colors you can adjust
the height there's all kinds of nice
features about this keyboard that's only
49 bucks once again under that 60 bucks
this is some of the ones I had on my
under $50 one but some of the ones we're
looking at the future here just a few
dollars more or so playing do you know
Kings a title god dang it
but anyways if you're looking for
something cool that looks nice and for
certain bills I think this Iowa is
something you're going to want to check
out now if you're somebody from the
company out there or you guys out there
say I'm saying this wrong please leave
me a comment down below and tell me how
to correctly print helps this thing
because I I'm barely talking to anyway
moving on now this next one sounds very
patriotic
it's the a low swings of Liberty the a
little wings of Liberty is a mechanical
keyboard that offers blue switches 104
keys and is actually waterproof now the
wings of Liberty is kind of a throwback
to the old days because this keyboard is
white and black with an extremely simple
style design pure white color with
mirror glass panels and a bottom cover
with a white matte finish it also offers
an elegant palm rest 26 q rollover on
USB gold plated USB connector and best
yet this thing says it will last for
over 10 years we'll see about that
anyways is a keyboard that's at a great
price once again this keyboard is only
$49 once again under that $50 ratio I
was trying to keep it too bright
continue now this next one is actually
one of the more expensive ones I have
two here that are actually $59 and this
is one of those two let's check it out
okay now this next one's gonna make your
lap I know as I'm looking at it it's
kind of making me laugh it's called the
the the nope ooh ya know pool so there's
no in this one at all it's no pool
I gotta move on I'm just laughing now
the note pool leader is a spider 87 and
it features the Keeley blue switch ASB
key caps with pad printed Legends Cape
mechanical switches full and key
rollover dedicated multimedia keys and a
USB interface and like I said this bad
boy is $59 which still under that $60
range it's actually got some pretty cool
latex now last but not least another one
of these are having trouble pronouncing
the name of I think it's like the a Lou
I hope it's the correct naming some of
these are crazy name today right you
guys agree but hey they're all well
priced so let's check this one out this
is the alien 2014 mechanical
keyboard now as a fully gained
mechanical keyboard with blue switches
USB wired with laser carved keys now the
few of us are kind of crazy because it
features a humanized keyboard does that
mean it's made with actual human parts
no but anyways hey it's 58 bucks you
guys looking forward some more keyboards
that are cool under price that you can
afford hey here's the last one on the
list folks so that's pretty much it guys
I thought about doing the one front or a
hundred dollars I'll probably bring that
next cuz there's actually some really
cool ones but I think I'm gonna have to
do it like around 125 dollars $130
because some of the real keyboards that
are really awesome are price right in
that fashion so it might be had to be
the top keyboards under $130 I'll try
for the hundred dollars but like trying
to shoot for this 50 it seems like I'm
gonna get caught with a few keyboards
that are just over that price range so
I'm Eric thanks again for watching taken
tomorrow I knew you guys liked this kind
of crazy stuff and by the way it's kind
of weird because like when I tried to
find $50 keyboards there really is not
very many at all that are mechanical
that was a seriously hard playing field
to try to play on but still we got him
here like usual download like button
hopefully you guys will go crazy on it I
don't know what's the craziest thing you
could ever do evil Knievel style Chuck
Norris style your choice of style but
anyways you guys won't want to buy some
of these things or check them out for
yourself
hey all the information will be down
there peace out I'm Alaric you've been
watching tecar tomorrow and uh I know
nobody the dog or the cat they actually
sat quiet didn't you nothing in this
video I guess their paws don't work very
good with keyboards whatever it's their
deal see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
