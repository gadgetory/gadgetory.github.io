tomorrow Elric fairs here now today
we're gonna bring you guys something
special from the people over at Amazon
this is their new Kindle Fire HD it's
coming to market at about two hundred
dollars it's got lots of new features
including a very high resolution screen
has really new speakers supposed to
connect to the internet just faster
better for those people who out there
who have Amazon Prime and use their
Amazon Kindle this is going to be a
really cool update for you folks with
that said let's jump in let's do the
unboxing and then talk about some of the
features of Kendall's latest product
all right folks so here we have it the
Kindle Fire HD you can see it's showing
some of their apps in the front right
there and seven-inch display this is a
16 gigabyte model show you guys the
front sure you guys the back HD color
touch screen high-definition 1280 by 800
custom Dolby audio now the speakers that
are inside this are really custom made
there's gonna be two little small
speakers they're actually supposed to
sound really super good one of the other
major features is is built-in Wi-Fi and
HDMI out which means the Wi-Fi in this
believe it or not is supposed to
actually be better than an iPad that's
what everybody's rumored to say and with
HDMI means you can take this unit and
hook it directly to a TV so let's go
ahead and start pulling it out just the
back there the shipping information I
may get something here to open this up
with so I got a little thing right here
go ahead and use this to break the seal
you simply done here think this is mine
my glass repair kit thing but hey it
worked right whatever works in the eve
of the moment so let's see I guess it
was actually more like meant to break a
tab so I'm gonna take this up here so
you guys can hear the camera I'm gonna
see you guys can actually hear the tab
ripping sound it's live it's not Memorex
so alright gotta rip that tab off we're
then we'll go ahead pop the top you can
see up here in this front thing right
here we have a little Kindle thing and
saying pull me out so we will go ahead
and we shall pull this out this is the
getting to know your Kindle it's showing
you where the power button up volume up
and down where your headphone is where a
USB charging and the HDMI now the HDMI
on this is a micro HDMI so it's gonna
leave you a little bit something
different so let's start out right here
we all think we're a little paper this
is the USB charger so this parts going
to go into the Kindle this parts going
to be in your USB there's no big blocky
thing here so you're not gonna have to
use that you can plug it directly in
your computer or whatever a lot of the
new motherboards actually support that
kind of thing and then we've got the
unit itself it comes completely sealed
in a package now some of the things that
are different between this I know you
guys
like what is in between this and the
Nexus 7
well this uses what's called a skinned
OS it's not the exact same jellybean OS
that the other one had so it looks like
it's already come charged up Tuesday
September 18th 749 has the date we're
doing the video
unlock it right from the front
welcome to the Kindle Fire you can see
my motherboards that work right up here
I'm not gonna give you guys my password
but all I basically do is I enter my
password here for that and then we'll be
up in the Internet so I'm gonna step
away from the camera for a second all
right now it's ask me for the time I've
already logged in so I'm in Pacific time
zone I'm gonna go ahead and hit that hit
continue
so I'm Dee registering my Kindle I guess
from my friend who actually bought this
for me it was registered to his name so
now it's asking this will show you some
of the stuff so wrap the bat when you go
in its gonna ask you to register your
Kindle
you'll fill this stuff out you guys can
see the screen is very clear I'm gonna
go ahead and just pop out of this so
right off the bat we see we take the
cover off you can see that it says get
started with your Kindle Fire HD now
there are a lot of different things you
can do with this it's going to ask you
to register it's also going to ask you
to log on to your network if you have
one you just basically follow all the
steps through it
you can use all kinds of different
devices you can stream movies Prime
instant video z' now here going to be
some of the things that are gonna be
different about this if you're somebody
who reads a lot of books you do Amazon
Kindle you watch a lot of the Amazon
Prime instant video z' then this is
going to be better than the Nexus 7 if
you use none of those features
whatsoever
the Nexus 7 action the OS on is actually
a stronger OS but this one for the
people who use Kindle and all that kind
of stuff well it's gonna be a very good
thing you got all kinds of apps they've
got a store you can log into the store
but guess you have to register the
Kindle first but the basis is that
register page so here's what you're
gonna register your Kindle you just go
in and fill this information out
register and then everything's yours now
on the side of the unit there are two
connections right here I'm gonna try to
move these up to the camera so we can
see them one of these is connector one
of these is the HDMI so you can take
that micro HDMI cable plug it directly
in your TV and the big question I have
though is what's the resolution on my TV
going to be because they don't actually
say that in any of the specs so one of
the things I'm actually wondering about
is will this actually provide me with
like 1920 by 1080 resolution on my TV or
will remain the same that's gonna be one
of my biggest questions rest the stuff
over here some of the controls are right
here on top right here you can see we
have a headphone jack we have the
controls for your volume and all that
and your on/off switch right here all
conveniently located units very very
thin it's very very light you guys can
see on the back side it says Amazon
Kindle
some of the other really cool things
about this thing is it has exclusive
Dolby audio with dual driver stereo
speakers for immersive virtual surround
sound it's the world's first tablet with
dual band dual antenna Wi-Fi for 40%
faster downloads and streaming compared
to the iPad 3 it's got a high
performance 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor with imagination power VR 3d
graphics core for fast and fluid
performance so that's the stuff that's
gonna really help you with all your apps
and stuff so there you go folks I mean
it's the new Kindle HD fire the big
things about it are really going to be
its new processor it's faster does the
internet better it's gonna stream movies
better can connect to your TV there's
just all kinds of things about it coming
in at $199 it's really set to compete
with the other products out there like
the Nexus 7 the choice with this being
between that and that is the
applications that you use for me
personally I think this is gonna work
out for me just perfect I read Kindle
books every day I have the Amazon Prime
account I stream the movies I watched in
my living room so this will be a really
cool device that can pass around to my
family everybody can use it and have fun
with it so $499 I think it's gonna be
really great product we're gonna bring
you more videos where we actually use
the thing more and we connect it to our
TV and see how it does so thanks for
watching we'll see you back here on tech
