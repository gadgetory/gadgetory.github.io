giving away 5 of these bad boys and it's
really easy to win all you have to do is
go over to our tech of tomorrow on our
Facebook and over on the facebook
channel for the people over course there
and leave a comment saying hey give me
the cave full of raptor I'm a dinosaur
no you don't say that but just say you
know give me the keyboard or give me the
Raptor we're going to choose from those
people in 14 days and you can win one of
these keyboards five lucky people will
get one so luckily I happen to have a
knife all right now luckily I'm lying
but I had the Cameron go in the house
and get one but what the hell luckily I
like the way it sounds anyway that's my
story I'm sticking to it so there we go
a nice little flick of the blade there
can I make a little incision right here
like a doctor cut for the very first
time not like a virgin and no it's not
urgent but there we go I'm trying to get
this
slid in here there we go I'm going to
hand and I thought very gently the
camera you guys want me to throw a time
I see all right hold on oh that's got
heart no just kidding aren't so check it
out a little tab right here it's going
to pop the tab here trying to keep in
camera range here for you folks it's a
little bit difficult outside I don't
know exactly a framing inside it's a
little bit easier but I'm gonna try to
keep this in camera range for you guys
so we can do a decent little unboxing
here outdoors pop this little cap here
ba blum blum up the top here and Babu
there is the keyboard can pull that
little bad boy out the box first though
we got a little manual here take for
your rector right here get bit by the
Raptor baby Oh like that if you use that
I want money pull the keyboard out the
rest of it oh alright well it's up in
the ground but that's no big deal
because that we can actually do
something called pick it up to me hugs
don't cry don't cry daddy's just
unboxing down all right here we go look
creepy there honey all right hold
keyboard get it out of there and then
what did i do do do do do do do do
without the cables long it's obviously
I'm touching the ground and to me so
it's a at least a six foot cable because
it's as long as my entire body so we can
clarify that right now six foot cable
here's the end USB plug a little red
thing they're all right folks so here we
see the firm the keyboard here are our
six programmable G buttons here we have
some of our profile buttons you can see
all the keys are nice and gray and one
thing interesting i want to show you
guys look to the side all the keys are
kind of a little bit more exposed than
usually see them these are differently
designed all the way it's going to be
pretty interesting to see how it feels
in real life but it actually feels
really nice and very comfortable just up
there touching it the keys are very nice
and soft to respond is good I think it's
going to be really cool now over here we
have our like button then we have our
audio controls right here you got all
your number buttons over here which is
cool because I hate when people put that
thing way off to the side I never liked
that I always like when it's all on one
keyboard not like when it's included no
wrist rest that I see though so this is
the keyboard right here on the back I've
got two little things right here
to bring your cube rub depending on how
do you like your wrist ago we got two
little rubber pads right here I don't
want to do the traditional type unboxing
folks for you guys I think like doing
the news videos you guys like to see
these kind of products a lot better and
since this time we're actually giving
away five of these bad boys away I
thought we'd give the presentation just
a little bit different than that so
we'll break up you guys a full review
that's actually probably kept in Kevin
be bringing you guys a full review of
this thing because he likes playing with
gaming stuff a lot and so I'm going to
hand this thing over to him and let him
do his thing but that's it man news
stories three of them it's a beautiful
day I hope you're having a beautiful day

description or down below the like
button actually is all the information
