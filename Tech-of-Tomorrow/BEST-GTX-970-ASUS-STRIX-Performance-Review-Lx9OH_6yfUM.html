another edition of tech tomorrow I'm
Elric your host and check this out most
you guys all know that the reference 9
series cards came out a couple of weeks
ago to a very well-received audience and
it seems like the 970 card at this
current time is the actual sweet spot of
the entire launch with that said though
the non-reference cars haven't hit the
market and we have a really cool and
from the people over at asu's now this
is their Strix and people are going what
the hell is Strix
well Strix derives from the Greek and
Roman word for out so that kind of
clears that up and they've had a few
cards like this in the past as well so
this isn't actually like anything too
new what is really cool about the card
though is the zero decibel cooling now
what is that you guys are saying well
zero decimal cooling means the fan does
not move until you actually set the
threshold for when it begins which means
a card will run completely quiet with no
moving parts until it hits that certain
heat threshold also great things are
there DC YouTube cooling which means
they got their direct copper there are
two fans and all that other stuff other
points about the card are total quality
components all the way around you're
gonna see the cards very well-made it's
not flimsy or anything like that at all
it's just a solid well-built
well-performing card with that said
let's take a look at the specs the Strix
970 features four gigabytes of gddr5
memory and this stuff's actually really
high-quality Samsung memory it features
an eleven hundred and fourteen megahertz
base clock and a twelve hundred and
fifty three megahertz boost clock it
features sixteen hundred and sixty-four
cuda cores and has a 7010 megahertz
memory clock the card size is in at 5.5
inches by 11 inches by 1.5 seven inches
a true lady pleaser the card also
features an upgraded 6.1 phase digi+ vrm
power delivery system with super alloy
components instead of the reference
cards for phase power supply using
standard components if you guys happen
to watch us on launch day you've seen
that a lot of the reference card
featured two six pin power connector the
Strix features a single eight pin power
connector as far as the outputs of the
card go it's pretty much the same
song-and-dance we've seen before display
port HDMI DVI and DVID so the specs and
obviously this is a damn good-looking
cart but hey how does the card run with
that said let's check out the benchmarks
and rock out to the benchmark song
so that's it all the specs all the
scores you guys can see this card is a
really good performer and I feel that
the nine sent me right now is the
absolute sweet spot for 9 series
performance as well as price versus
performance this card's price right and
it actually kicks a lot of ass now I
know a big question on everybody's mind
out there is like hey man how hot this
card run okay under idle forty nine
Celsius under full load 69 Celsius a
couple things to note the zou Tech card
its competitor the 970 series under full
load the azouz card ran much cooler but
in her idle
it ran hotter now you guys are asking
why this is because of that zero decibel
cooling unless you set it to come on
that fans not moving so it runs a little
bit hotter when it's not doing anything
like I said earlier in the video though
you can change the settings on this so
you have to make a choice do you want to
be silent or do you want it to be cooler
now for those folks out there looking to
buy a car down below like button we will
have pricing and availability so if
you're a user out there wanting to get
their hot hands on this card you'll be
able to do so by following those links
down below also if you're a builder
looking to do multi card SLI with the
970 series you can only do triple SLI
setups for quad you're gonna need four
cards and they're gonna have to be 980
Americare on Tekken tomorrow if you guys
like what you see sub the challenge you
guys can see more reviews from me here
on Tekken tomorrow peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
