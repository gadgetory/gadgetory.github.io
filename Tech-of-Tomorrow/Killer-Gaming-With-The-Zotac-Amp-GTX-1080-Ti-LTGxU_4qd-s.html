to you by the Corsair k63 gaming
mechanical keyboard get your game on
with Corsair
okay so I've seen the comments in almost
every video it's like dude where are the
amp extreme TI scores oh okay I'm going
to be straight up with you they only had
a couple of those cards and they
basically let me to card for like a
couple of days so I didn't even have any
time to do the testing we basically got
the card did the unboxing they asked me
to ship the card back that's so we
didn't get to do that but we actually
have the straight-up amp Edition right
here and that's the card that we'll be
showing you guys today so just take it
with a grain of salt though the app
extreme is probably going to score about
five to seven frames per second more
than this card if you go out and do your
numbers and look around you'll come back
oh yeah I do you're you're right but
with that said let's check out this card
today because this is another badass
card from ZOTAC the 1080 TI amp Edition
I mean you guys know these cards they're
fast this one's fast and let's check it
out so if you happen to have the box in
front of you first thing you're going to
notice that there's a lot of things in
the back that just tell what they have
on the card some of their stuff like
that ice storm stuff for cooling their
spectra for doing all the different
colors and stuff you want to do freeze
which means the card ones that you know
with the fam not running it's completely
silent and then they're fired storm
stuff for doing all your fine-tuning for
overclocking now beyond that when you
open up the box you get the card itself
two 6-pin tape and adapters the user's
manual and the drivers CD but in all
honesty don't ever try to use the
drivers off the CD unless you just not
connect to the internet because you want
to get the absolute latest drivers that
you can for your card
the only real important thing other than
a card when you get the package is those
two 6-pin taping connectors because if
you don't have a power supply that has
it you'll appreciate the hell out of
having those at that time cuz you fail
to go I can still use my card
otherwise you'll be going ah but anyways
here's what's important the card itself
now let's check it out real closely
because this thing looks really cool the
color that it is like the gunmetal gray
this will fit in any different system
and match the color scheme pretty much
like black it can be used in any type of
system it will matches
Skol it's a great neutral color for
doing builds for those people look into
a build and like the color scheme it's
neutral but then hey you're going to
really like this card on top you can see
there are two 100 millimeter fans these
are used to help dissipate all that heat
away from the card now underneath that
there are a lot of loom heat things you
can also see the copper heat pipes down
there as well and as you take a look at
the bottom of the card there's obviously
the PCI interface down there but the
rest of the card is kind of covered with
the shroud usually you can see more the
cooling apparatus but with this it's
pretty much covered all the way around
with only a slight space for viewing on
the end of the card you guys can see
that there are four heat pipes emanating
from the aluminum heat fins
there's also where the power fan is
plugged in so this is where all the
electricity is going to be going on for
your fan stuff and in addition to the
power fan connector right next to that
you can see there's another header on
the top of the card we can see the
GeForce GTX nomenclature then the zotac
name now that so tech name that can be
changed it pretty much any color you
want for the color scheme of your bills
if you're going to build it's black and
white you can make it white if it's red
you can make it red blue etc etc going
along the card you guys can see there
are two eight pin power connectors now
this card is recommend that you have a
minimum power supply of 600 watts and it
does draw 270 watts from your power
supply take a look at the back of the
card you guys are going to notice up on
the top right there are two sli fingers
so obviously you can do sli up to four
cards with this damn thing if you want
to go crazy you can do it there's also
two power booms chips on the back of the
car now the base clock of this card is
fifteen hundred and sixty nine megahertz
they claim that the boost clock is
sixteen hundred and eighty-three
megahertz but we were seeing boost
clocks up to 1700 quite a bit now what a
little strange thing wee bit strange is
why is the zotac logo going a different
direction than the power blues chips I
mean I thought they should all been go
in the same direction so you could check
them all the same time ago yeah that's
cool now you guys obviously know low low
low low low low low I love the back
plate they're tough they're durable they
keep your card running great there are
slots all inside of here which is also
allowed for the heat to dissipate way
from the card I know some people out
there say oh man it doesn't matter
whatsoever if it's trapped the heat in
there but trust me it may not be no be
like you know reinventing the wheel or
anything but it definitely does help to
have another place to get that heat
venting away from the back of the
chipset
it gets hot and there's some place to go
away from the heat and get blown out
from the system you know exhaust in your
system then I think you're going to be
better off with a card like that I know
it's not like you know the breaker you
know make or break thing but it's still
it's pretty nice to have last but not
least checking out the input you guys
can see it there three display ports and
HDMI 2.0 port and a single DVID port one
thing I just thought that was kind of
really nifty of Nvidia to put in all of
their 1080 eyes is the fact that you get
11 gigabytes of RAM with a memory speed
of 11 gigahertz tricky alright gamers so
there you have it the card itself what
comes in the box now let's check out our
test system before we rock out to the
benchmark song since we're going to be
jumping into a lot of SLI and crossfire
testing we decide to build a system that
there'd be absolutely no problem of
getting bottleneck to next 99 system for
gigabyte g1 gaming x99 motherboard 16
gigabytes of course there's vengeance
memory 5960 cpu we got a great hard
drive a nice power supply in a nice case
and overall just something really
bitchin to do our testing in alright
metalheads get ready for a fricken ride
because here comes the benchmark song
along with those benches if you don't
like metal turn on your mute button or
plug you'll is because it's time
to rock
Oh
you
now as far as the heat goes when using
the card when it was just on idle it was
43 Celsius but we were in gaming on for
about an hour and so the highest that
ever got was 80 Celsius really not bad
for a high-end card
alright gamers so you've got your video
card and you're ready to get your game
on
well you obviously know that you're
going to need a keyboard to kick some
ass so let's check out the Corsair k63
the Corsair k63 is made for the gamer
who needs a minimalistic keyboard that
has a lot of features on it but doesn't
take up a lot of dead space the k63
features perky red LED backlighting and
large font keycaps you can see
everything perfectly clearly even in a
dark room the keys are also fully
programmable and you can do this using
course there's cue software it also
features dedicated volume in the
multimedia controls to totally control
your gaming environment the k63
features a very small footprint due to
its compact 10 keyless design and best
of all in my opinion the k63 features
cherry MX red switches these are fast
accurate and they feature a really great
linear response time alright Tech fans
so there you have it the zotac GTX can a
TTI amp Edition which is really only a
wee bit slower than the amp extreme
edition if you're expecting to get the
amp Extreme Edition and expect the same
things from like a 1080 to attained yeah
it ain't nothing like that baby and I'm
sure if your house is cooler the model
over the desert you could probably hit
almost the same exact scores for a
little bit lower price now this card's
coming to market about six hundred and
seventy nine dollars but that's kind of
the same price you're seeing on
everything that's breaks play yours
they're all coming in to market and to
be honest with you between all the
different cards the features and
everything are really really close
the only difference you're really going
to see is a little bit of the cooling
apparatus you're going to see a little
bit of a design implementation about the
looks of it and that's pretty much it
because let's just face it most of the
guts of these cards are exactly the same
Nvidia makes them you know the chipset
and all that from Nvidia you have your
boost clock stuff on this other guys use
different techniques but at the end of
the day if you're looking for a fast as
card that will work in any type of
situation will do SLI although we'll
talk about it's all a little bit more
later this card's a really bitchin card
obviously it's expensive because you're
trying to get the
you know bad ass card you can get in the
single card division and this is it now
once again I'll say when Vega gets here
we'll see a lot of people saying oh my
god it's going to come out it's going to
kill it we'll see I mean I'm open I'm
open mind is the fact but I think it's
going to come out vague comes out and
it's probably going to be close but
it'll be a little bit cheaper and that's
Justin of how things go but we'll see at
the end of the day so I'm Eric you guys
been watching teka tomorrow once again a
special thanks to our sponsor from
Corsair if you guys want to check out
the k63 or anything about our test
system or pretty much anything about
this video or maybe buy this card or see
more stuff hey down bullet like button
will be all that information so check it
out if you like the video hey you know
what to do I'm Eric you've been watching
ticker tomorrow peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
