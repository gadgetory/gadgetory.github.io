youtubers welcome back once again to
techyv tomorrow now in the past we
brought lots and lots of audio reviews
on all kinds of different stuff from
headphones speakers microphones all
kinds of crazy stuff now most of the
headphones that we brought to the table
have been usually very very
budget-conscious because we know that
people don't like to spend a lot of
money they'd like to get something if
they lose it they don't want to be like
oh my god you know I just lost my but
like losing you know this item so a lot
of stuff that we focus on is very budget
oriented but the last ones that we did I
thought the headphones centered pretty
good the features were okay but that's
like I said that kind of really just
sums it up they were oh okay so I wanted
to actually get five sets in here that I
thought were much better quality
headphones now we're gonna take a look
at five of them today each one of these
headphones is actually under $50 they
start at $35 and go to about $50 now a
lot of things about these headphones are
similar now I admit when I was buying
these headphones I was trying to get
headphones that were similar but at the
end we actually got them all in and we
started doing we found they were
actually very very similar now one thing
about all five of these headphones I got
all five is right in these little boxes
right here in front of me they all have
very very similar things about them for
one thing every single one of these sets
of headphones is bluetooth 5.0 all of my
bluetooth 5.0 all of them come with the
charging box and you charge your
headphones inside the box they all come
with a USB cable and honestly as far as
just sheer like sound goes I don't know
if I would really say that any one of
these particular headphones actually you
know stands out as being so much
superior than the other the main thing
that separates these five different
headphones are basically the specs the
warranty and that type of stuff but just
as far as audio sound goes very very
close so with that said though
let's jump in let's take a look at these
five and see why at the end of the day
you might want to consider these
especially if you're somebody who works
out goes to the gym does a lot of heavy
exercise another thing I believe that
every single one of these has they all
have like some kind of like sweat proof
or water type proof resistant things so
if you're in the gym and you're sweating
you're not going to ruin these products
but with that said though let's take a
closer look
so first up on the table we have the
taotronics bh o 53 wireless earbuds now
these particular products come with two
different sized ear tips so no matter
what size ears that you have they'll be
able to fit your is that a problem the
case has a battery capacity of 650 milla
our amps it takes two hours to recharge
this particular product it has an ipx7
rating six millimeter dynamic speakers
it's got a built-in mic for both earbuds
and you get up to five hours of play
time on one charge and up to forty hours
with the case now these things also work
right out of the box that are
automatically connect to each other and
to your last Bluetooth device used they
feature a buttonless design just tap on
the earbud to function double tap either
earbud to play pause and answer calls
tap your right ear but three times for
next track and the left ear but three
times for previous track now for me this
particular product felt very snug in my
ear it's slightly uncomfortable but not
unbearable it doesn't feel like they
would hold on with stimulus activity
like mountain biking or something like
that but if you're running jogging or
working out at the gym they actually
worked pretty good they have a nice
stereo sound they're not too bassy they
have good highs and lows and the EQ is
pretty even over the only caveat is it
really doesn't get too loud which might
be good for some people because it means
you won't blow your ears out one nice
thing about this particular product is
it does have an 18 month extended
warranty and a 60 day free return when
you register the earbuds so if you don't
like them you can return without a
problem and they come to market at about
forty $4.99 now next up we have the mpow
bh3 2 to a once again true wireless
headphones and also the cost on these is
exactly the same
the headphones we just looked at a
minute ago at $44.99 like I said
previously all these headphones have
bluetooth 5.0 this particular headphone
can be used up to 49 feet away from
whatever your source you're using it has
up to 7 hours of music played on the
charging times for the earbuds is 1.5
hours and the charging time for the case
is 2 to 3 hours now one thing that's
pretty cool though is if you have the
case fully charged up you can actually
get seven more recharges out of the case
before you actually have to replug in
and replenish that juice now there's
also a built-in mic for both earbuds
this is great for you're going to be
answering our phone and stuff like that
now the sound inside of these headphones
is called optic HD sound and it's kind
of interesting now they claim that
that's equipped with high professional
CSR support and like I said before if
you're at the gym and stuff like that it
does have an IP x7 rating so if they do
get wet or anything like that out in the
rain you don't have to worry about it
just like pretty much all the headphones
that we're going to be looking at today
these work right out of the box they
automatically connect to each other and
the last Bluetooth device used they
feature a single multifunction button on
each year but a single click for both
earbuds to play pause and answer calls
you double click the right earbud for
next track and left your but for
previous track now one thing I have to
say though is that these earbuds
definitely feel more secure in my ear
than the taotronics they are super light
and they don't make my ears feel sore
anything even after extended use I still
know if I'd really recommend these
headphones for high-intensity activity
but like I said running gym workouts
other stuff like that it's totally good
now there is no volume option however on
the earbuds all the volume is actually
controlled from the source device now as
far as just plain sound goes these
headphones are slightly heavy on the
mids and lows there are a little bit
more bass in the other headphones but
it's not totally unbearable if you like
electronics music and like heavy bass
that you might definitely want to
consider the impalas one thing about the
m pal that i found a little bit kind of
strange though is that i couldn't find
any warranty information on them
so i'm wondering
Amazon give the warranty netha let's fit
d3 to true wireless earbuds these are a
little bit less expensive than the other
two we looked at these are only thirty
seven ninety-nine
they come with a 12 month warranty and a
45-day return policy which i think is
pretty good now these are also bluetooth
5.0 up to 33 feet of distance now
instead of having an IP x7 rating though
these have an IP x5 rating the earbud
charging time is 1.5 hours the case
charging time is one hour you get about
3.5 hours of talktime and playtime and
about 20 hours of use with the case now
the earbud battery capacity is 60
milliamp hours and the case battery
capacity is 500 milliamp hours just like
all the other headphones these also have
a built-in mic for both earbuds but
these headphones feature a five point
eight millimeter dynamic speaker just
like all the others they work right out
of the box and automatic hood connect to
each other or whatever Bluetooth device
was used before they also feature a
single multi feature button on each year
but single click for both earbuds to
play pause and answer calls press and
hold right here but for next track and
it's the same with the left earbud for
the previous track and you press twice
for the volume up and down now this
particular design makes it feel more
secure in your ear now these are perfect
for hiking or gym workouts the volume
doesn't get really that loud and it does
favor mid-range a bit but it has a
pretty strong bass sound without being
really overwhelming overall I think the
sound is really good for any type of
music especially though if it's bass
heavy music now this next set of
headphones you're gonna say to yourself
boy I'll work those headphones looking
awfully a lot like the other ones we
just looked at and you'd be correct
because the sound beats true wireless
earbuds these look a lot like the
taotronics headphones they have
bluetooth 5.0 up to 33 feet you get four
hours of talking playtime 24 hours of
playtime with the case which is about 5
recharges the charging time for each
year but it's about 1.5 hours the case
charging time is 2.5 hours the earbud
battery capacity is 43 milliamp hours
and the
battery capacity is 650 milliamp hours
now the IPX rating is a little bit
different though the IPX rating is only
IP x5 on these one the taotronics it was
ipx7 now these do have a 12 month
warranty and like all they work right
out of the box now the only real
difference between B's and the
taotronics hour is the way that they're
controlled they feature a buttonless
design you just tap on the earbud to
function you double tap to play pause
and answer calls tap and hold the right
ear but the next track and you do the
same on the left ear but for the
previous track like always got a
built-in mic for both earbuds
now this particular headset however uses
a professional real tec chipset and a
biological diaphragm for superior sound
now you might be thinking yourself what
the heck is a biological diaphragm well
the sound that's being produced by your
body is actually being produced from
your diaphragm you're pushing that stuff
out it makes a sound so when they're
talking about a biological diaphragm it
just means that it's made more like a
natural type of thing now even though
these headphones do fit in your ear
pretty nicely and they're not really
uncomfortable I wouldn't really
recommend heavy intense activity because
they do have a tendency to kind of fall
out of your ear if you get too crazy
they fit snug and they're only slightly
uncomfortable I mean if you're wearing
something inside your ear for hours and
hours on end I think that pretty much
anything eventually is going to become
uncomfortable but these aren't
unbearable now the worst thing really
about these is is you can't change the
volume there's no volume direction the
guide nor any combination or touches or
effects playing simply if you want to
change the volume you're going to have
to do it through the source device now
as far as the sound goes the EQ on these
particular headphones sounds pretty even
throughout everything they have clear
highs good meds and the lows are pretty
strong but they're not tube AC
whatsoever so if you listens like rock
music pop music that kind of stuff
I think these headphones really sound
good and that type of music for the
electronic music and stuff that has
really heavy bass you might want to
consider some of the others that we
talked about today and the price of
these particular headphones is about
$39.99 now last but not least we have
the Exmouth v5 wireless earbuds like I
said before all of these are bluetooth
5.0 once again these are bluetooth 5.0
up to 33 feet that kind of seems like
it's the average I think there were one
set of headphones that had it a little
bit farther but it seems like the
average is about 33 feet for the
Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity
now each earbud battery has 65 milliamp
hours each the charging time for each
earbud is one hour and the case battery
is 500 milliamp hours and this is pretty
much the same on all these headphones I
think that only one of them had a
stronger case battery of 650ml amp hours
now it takes two to three hours to
charge up the case but once you charge
up the case you can actually use the
case for multiple charges to the
headphones so you don't have to worry
about it you just charge up the case go
on the go and you can charge them up
many times until you act right to
recharge the case itself and if for some
reason you don't want to use the
charging case to charge your headphones
it also comes with a little USB adapters
that you can charge each headphone
individually now one thing different
about the charging box and this is
different than all the other headphones
that we've looked at today is this
particular box actually has an on/off
switch once the headphones are actually
charged up you get six hours of talk and
playtime but you get up to 26 hours with
recharges using the case itself before
you need more power like all the
headphones we've looked at today these
have a built-in mic for both earbuds and
they work right out of the box now to
control these headphones they feature a
single multifunction button on each
earbud now they feature a single click
on both earbuds to play pause and answer
calls double click for BA and control up
on right and volume down on left now you
triple click for the next and previous
tracks right for next and left for
previous these headphones actually feel
really secure in your ear out of all
these headphones if you're gonna go
running and doing stuff that involved a
lot of serious activity I would say that
these will probably stay in your ears
the best out of all of these they have a
really nice even EQ good clear sound
they didn't have anything overwhelming
like not too high of a
not too high of anything really
everything just sounded right in the
middle and they sounded good with pretty
much all types of music you get a one
month money-back guarantee in case you
don't like them and a 12 month
replacement warranty and best of all
they're only $35.99 alright so there you
have it five different sets of
headphones and like I said many of the
features about all of these headphones
were identical now me personally if I
was going to choose one out of all of
them it would be the very last set that
we took a look at and the reason is is
that I think the price at $35.99 is a
good price these particular headphones
like I said they stayed in my ear so you
know if I'm bouncing around or doing
stuff they didn't feel like they're
gonna fall out of my ear and get lost to
the gym or get broken I like that the
fact there's not too much base too much
mitts too much anything makes it a good
set of headphones for all the different
types of music like we said some of
these headphones like the sound beats
and stuff some of these headphones have
a lot more bass on them so if you're
into like electronic music or pop or
stuff that like you know has that real
booming bass type stuff some of the
other headphones in there might be
better for you I happen to be a person I
listen to a lot of like 80s music and
rock and NuWave and that type of stuff
and I thought that these overall just
sounded best for that type of music also
like I said the price isn't bad the
features and all of these are pretty
similar like I said you heard the
differences as far as the control goes
that are all pretty easy to control I'm
not really you know the greatest fan of
not having volume control it all in your
headphones I mean it's not the end of
the world but I mean if you're at the
gym and you're running and someone's
trying to talk to your whatever you
don't really don't have to stop you know
get off and get your device and adjust
the volume on your you know your the
playing device in order to turn the
volume down that's just kind of a pain
in the butt you know you want something
that's gonna be very simplistic so for
me the ones we control everything and
the headphones which means you control
the ball and you control everything
those would be the ones that me
personally I would pick first now like
usual all these particular headphones
will be down below just to let you know
