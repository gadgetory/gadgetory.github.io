around the world welcome back once again
to another edition of tech of tomorrow
now a lot of people out there have been
asking me hey man more 4k stuff more 4k
stuff so I've actually got a nice 4k
monitor right now and I'm looking to get
myself another one right now I've got
the xB 280 HK this thing is an amazing
thing from Acer but the problem is it's
only 60 Hertz so g-sync monitor is
pretty cool but I actually need
something from my personal gaming to be
a 144 Hertz otherwise I honestly seem to
get headaches honestly I just do I get
really bad headaches with anything
that's less than that I got really
spoiled on my previous a Zeus monitor so
we built a couple of systems one of them
is based on the hugest tapas cards you
can get from Nvidia these are the Titan
X cards so I slept two of those into my
personal system back here and we have
another system coming which is a blue
fury that one's totally based on
obviously two Furies and it'll be the
four cases and for the AMD fans so today
we're gonna be showing you this system
back behind me and I have to admit I
omit or at the bat it is freaking
ridiculously priced you could probably
build a system for much cheaper and get
pretty similar results I will say that
right the bat but there are some people
out there who just want the absolute
best of the best they want to be able to
buy it put it together themselves and
move on now this system the beauty of it
is no mods whatsoever not at all didn't
have ten ball Anthony this did not to
drag them over here making build a
system this one we just put together
it's a very nice system but the cost of
the video gonna go how much don't wreck
that's right that's just the system
including the monitor and play my out
tech speakers on my desktop and
everything I'm trying to think but the
price is they're going to it's probably
honestly close to at least almost six
thousand dollars worth of stuff for a
gaming system it's over-the-top
outrageous
I'm just want to thank right off the bat
all the beautiful sponges that we have
out there who make this thing happen
as we go through the parts I will thank
you guys personally as we go through and
show you the parts so instead of me
running my trap anymore let's jump in
let's talk about actually that parts
users in the build then let's rock out
to the benchmark song see the scores and
at the end of the video just have a
little chat about the 4k and what the
possibilities are of this system even
more so let's go let's talk about that
since
on the outside we start with a silver
stone tech this is an extended ATX ATX
full tower case with a ninety degree
motherboard mounting now this thing's
really cool because it comes with its
own side panel right now we have the
side panel pulled off though just so you
guys can actually see the inside of the
case but this is a pretty cool damn
thing
next up the motherboard the Asus Rampage
for extreme LGA 2011 motherboard now
this thing's an intel x79 platform
motherboard and it's pretty cool but the
only thing is I feel this motherboard
offers very limited PCI slots and you
guys will see what we're talking about
as we're showing you here there's only
actually three PCI slots that are worth
talking about and with the two video
cards that we have in here it's
completely filled now as far as the
video cards go obviously it's to nvidia
gtx titan X cards running this whole
thing though is an i7 49 60 X CPU
incredible thing this thing is the top
the line CP that you can get from the
people over at Intel there's a new one
out for the X 99 but for the X 79 this
was the top of line very beautiful CPU
to get your hands on cooling down the
CPU is the cooler master nekton 280 L
now this is an all-in-one kit with a 280
millimeter radiator and to jet flow fans
for the memory we have the kingston
hyperx genesis now this stuff's silver
it's the 10th anniversary series this
particular kit is a 16 gigabyte kit 4 by
4 gigabyte sticks and it's 2400
megahertz
not for our storage and for our gaming
we have two different drives we have the
corsair GT 240 gigabyte this is an SSD
that comes into the market at about 191
bucks it's very fast and just a great
drive for putting the OS on now for the
main gaming hard drive I went with the
Kingston HyperX savage
now this is a blazing-fast 960 gigabyte
SSD and I'm just telling you guys this
thing's a really incredible fast product
I know a lot of people are thinking hey
man for this system you're gonna have to
have some thousand or 1200 watt power
supply not true at all
I'm using of course their 750 I and it
works absolutely amazing powering
everything with no problems although the
system doesn't have a lot of fans to be
controlled we use the lambtron FC 10
there's a total steampunk fan controller
that looks
cool after installing the OS we used an
old-school 24x cd-rom that's right we
could have used some external little
stick but nope we went old-school on
this one and we also included in the
system for all you guys out there who
might want to build one Windows 8.1 so
that's all the stuff so on my desktop
over here I'm sure you guys will see it
this is the monitor I talked about that
earlier it's a 4k monitor it's g-sync
but it only does 60 Hertz sometimes 75
but it's not with the g-sync thing going
on I actually want to get like I said
144 Hertz one that would be much
preferable to me especially at a system
cost like I said it's like you know
really expensive so with that said
though let's jump in now let's see these
scores we've used a lot of the top
Hawaiian cards I think you guys are
gonna have some questions and stuff
about the scoring so with that said
let's rock out to the benchmark song and
see how to tighten X's do an SL
so check it out folks I'm not going to
like run the fraps thing is that I want
to slow the game down it's not really
fair so what I'm gonna do though is show
you guys just how cool Grand Theft Auto
does look in 4k I'm going to show you
guys all the settings I'm gonna turn
this thing up as high as it can go
no one's it would take a spin and see
how it works so you guys have the screen
in front of me I've got to the ignore to
get to the next that's right no this
thing is badass it'll go we got full
screen 3840 by 2160 the aspect ratio is
on auto because it automatically goes to
the type of Swedish you're running
refresh rate is 60 Hertz like I said
that's the Hyatts this particular
monitor goes to alpha monitor is just
one I've got the FX a on MSAA 8 as as
high as it'll go so I'm just gonna keep
on going down vsync is on keep scrolling
you can see everything sentir can this
get any higher very high normal high
very high very high normal high very
high much the swing to get keep
scrolling down reflection MSA and turn
that on
either the bill right there one or
quality high very high it's not really
affecting you memory very much at all
you guys can see up there these cards
warning uh in SLI mode offer immense and
I do mean immense quality so Nvidia P
CSS Oh alter here we go post effects
okay that's right folks that's pretty
much it I turn motion blur off because I
hate that crap I don't want to deal with
it at all but you guys can see I've got
this thing set as high as it can go and
4k you can see my guy he looks totally
badass I didn't turn the sound on his I
didn't think you guys really wanted here
sound but this is in total 4k glorious
for cage you guys can see everything
looks simply amazing like the real deal
grab the apartment here since Dept kind
of this side so it's kind of cool for
like indoor thing into the bathroom
looks like if you see another in
there no one's sexy look
 sexy man this character
kind of looks like me too handsome devil
like me it's pretty get out of here and
go find the big garage get a call real
quickly I was really just pretty much
just showing you guys how coalition
what's in for okay the thing we're gonna
get to all the scores and all that this
second tip I got some pretty cool ass
cars here take this little cookie this
particular so the quick stroll down the
road check out the beauty of the
landscape and the beauty of my terrible
driving on the keyboard we do they don't
have my controller took some City
relying on the people and let me tell
you any fun
let me show you look at this there's 4k
the same week stood in 10 any people in
4k it's this is McMahon just look at the
beauty of the game that the moon if
there looks so nice the sky the lights
of the cars and people in the world one
McCree he asked me driving but I'm not
gonna keep you guys too much in there I
just want to show you guys a different
game cuz I really like this game like i
said before i play this game quite a bit
pretty fun got a lot of aspects of
things you can do on it and in 4k you
know it looks the
alright so there you guys have it now I
know these scores are kind of crazy
because you guys concede that the zotac
that damn 980ti
it's really really fast I think if I
actually put two of those cards in SLI
it would be even faster than two of
these cards I don't know why it's
happening but it just seems to be the
way that's happening as it is though
these cards never got really really hot
you guys saw the temperature stuff these
cards never really ran really hot at all
these are just reference model cards I
know they're pricey like $1,000 apiece
but these things are not only meant for
a game as when it says straight out the
bat these things are meant for more than
gaming and a lot of people go oh you
know invidious top-of-the-line gaming
card you know the 980ti beats it well
I'm gonna be honest with you I think in
gaming the 98 Ti is actually geared to
be it because this card's more expensive
because it's meant to do not only gaming
but to do all kinds of things beyond
that like doing 3d stuff and all that
type of stuff there CUDA stuff all kinds
of different stuff other than just
gaming now before I want to get out of
here I want to thank a lot of people I
want to thank Dan Schneider for Intel he
kicked down the CPU I want to thank Rick
Allen from Coursera the dudes totally
cool man he found the water cooler the
power supply and he kicked down one of
the SSDs so that's totally awesome David
from Kingston hey brother thanks a lot
for the memory and for that SSD that's
amazingly awesome and also our friends
over at Silverstone thank you very much
we don't hear those folks pretty much
anymore we'd like to hear more from you
folks and from the motherboard thank you
very much to Raj over at hey Zeus and
for the video cards obviously mr. B from
Nvidia thank you very much sir he also
gave me the monitor so we love you thank
you very much like usual all these parts
we listed down there below if you guys
like this video then hey you know go
Chuck Norris tile on that like button I
know like I said before the system's
really outrageously priced you could
probably build one for a lot cheaper I
said that before but there are some
people out there who just want to have a
nice simple system they're gonna see
this video and go hey I got the money I
liked what it's put together and the big
thing about this I think before is like
I said and they didn't have to get
involved in this bill usually I think if
somebody does all these mods all these
technical things there's absolutely no
mods in this whatsoever
anybody at home wants to take the time
and build this system you could do it
and that's the really cool thing I think
about it all and all you could obviously
build a system for a little bit less but
we're going for like trying to get the
bed
and 4k gaming so if you guys want to see
us do a 980ti sli review leave comments
down below saying hey ZOTAC provides the
card and i will call my friend Chinni
and she will probably lend me the card
and we will bring those scores to you so
that's it folks I love you thanks very
much for watching the channel peace
we'll see you guys background teka
tomorrow for more awesome gaming
