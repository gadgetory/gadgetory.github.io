Kingston's MobileLite Wireless g2
wireless media reader hey friends and
family glad to see you guys back here
once again the Tecna morrow youtube
channel i milk your host and today we're
going to be taking a look at something
very interesting for the people over at
gigabyte
this is the new gigabyte Brix Pro so
what is the Brix Pro well basically it's
a nook on steroids now this thing's not
quite a gaming machine I mean it'll play
games like wow and stuff like that ok
dota 2 it'll play games like that any of
the extreme first-person games it gets
too hot does it really game but if
you're looking for a media computer and
you want something really small compact
and powerful and something that can slap
just right in the back of your TV I
think this is something that you're
going to want to be looking for so with
that said let's jump in and let's check
out the Brix pro by gigabyte the bundle
in the gigabytes Brix Pro box contains
the manual it also includes a metal
plate from my into the back of your TV
to a wall includes the power cable the
power brick and the unit itself and last
but not least the driver CD now as far
as the specs go let's start out by
taking a look at the outside of the unit
and how big it is now this thing sizes
in at 62 by 111 by 4 by 114 by 4
millimeters which translates into two
point four by four point three by four
point five inches the motherboard size
in at 100 by 105 millimeters and it's
considered to be an ultra compact PC
form factor the CPU running the Brix Pro
is the Intel i7 4770k or CPU running at
3.9 gigahertz which is pretty impressive
for such a small little unit and the
graphics are provided by the Intel iris
pro 5200 graphics chip which is embedded
into the CPU as far as the memory goes
you get two sodium's slots which can
support up to 16 gigabytes of 1333 or
1600 megahertz ddr3 memory for surfing
internet and getting all that important
information LAN is provided by the
gigabyte Lam
the realtek RTL 8 8 1 1g chipset audio
is provided by the realtek ALC 269
chipset as far as internal expansion
goes you get a single M SATA slot a
half-size mini PCI slot which is
currently occupied by the Wi-Fi
Bluetooth card and a single SATA slot
forget up to your monitor there are two
types of connections there's the HDMI
and the main display port the HDMI has a
maximum resolution of 4096 by 23:04 at
24 Hertz the main display port supports
resolutions up to 3840 by 2160 at 60
hertz so that's what's on the inside so
what do we get on the outside well we'll
start out in the back first you can see
there are two USB 3.0 ports the LAN port
the main display port the HDMI port and
finally the power connection on the
front there are two USB 3.0 ports and a
single spit of connector for your audio
now when the gigabyte Brix Pro ships out
to you it ships as a barebone unit which
means you have to add a few parts unit
to make it go you have to have the OS we
use Windows 8.1 you have to use either
an MSA 2 or SSD or regular 2.5 inch hard
drive we use a 240 gigabyte 530 SSD from
Intel now as far as the memory goes that
obvious takes up to 16 gigabytes of
so-dimm ddr3 we used 8 gigabytes of
kingston ddr3 memory alright folks so
those are all the specs now you guys can
see though this thing is so ultimately
tiny I mean it's literally smaller than
my hand and is about as thick as both of
my hands put together so it's actually a
very very small unit so with that said
then now let's rock out to the benchmark
song and check out how it does
all right folks so there you guys have
it the Brix Pro now obviously for any
kind of intense hardcore gaming this
thing's not going to handle it at all
for playing dota 2 and original sin
stuff like that it does okay you guys
can see it's bopping over 30 frames per
second so that's not bad at all but for
media streaming thing hey this thing is
really really cool now before we finish
up the video I just want a real quick of
a special shout out to Kingston for
making this video possible so now let's
check out the MobileLite g2 the
MobileLite g2 is a very interesting
product you can not only stream media
you can extend your storage charge your
smartphones read media and stay
connected to the Ethernet - it's
included Ethernet port the card reader
supports SD SDHC SDXC and micro SD SDHC
SDXC cards and USB flash drives
everything you need to get started
except for your actual media is included
in the box alright folks so there you
have it everything about the new
gigabyte Brix pearl like I said this
thing is not geared for hardcore gaming
but for media streaming thing this thing
is pretty damn cool now obviously
because it's so small it is pretty
priced this thing's about $600 now I
know a lot of people are going to want
to leave their comment below going oh
screw that
I can build a PC for better than that
yeah I'm sure that you can but now
answer this glass sleep can you build a
PC this small because if you can't
seriously shut up like because like I
know you can build a giant Tower for
cheaper but when you can build a system
that's this tiny then that's saying
something like I said earlier in the
video the parts that we use inside of
this we use a 240 gigabyte intel SSD the
530 series and we also used 8 gigabytes
of Kingston so-dimm memory so I'm Eric
