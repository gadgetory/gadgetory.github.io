again to the channel today's video is
really about how Apple seems to be
really losing their shine ever since
Steve Jobs passed away it just seems
like the company's focus and innovation
has just taken a real dip the only real
technology I seen anybody really
competing with now is how much better
the camera is you know and that's really
about it and there's just been some
really strange things going on in the
Apple camp that just make me want to
scratch my head and go just what the
heck is going on over there now the
first store we're going to be talking
about today is about a guy named Jean
leva now this dude used to write all of
the literature regarding internet law
which means that basically anything the
head to with the SCC copyright all that
kind of stuff this guy was the attorney
and he knew all the ins and out now this
guy has just been busted for doing a
bunch of insider trading craze the
insider trading when the market kind of
dipped and he knew the mark was going to
come back in he started selling all
kinds of stocks he made like almost four
hundred thousand dollars in this and now
he's finally been prosecuted they let
him go in 2018 but it just seems really
weird that Apple would even allow this
and this kind of actually goes into our
next story as well as because not only
has Apple let one of their employees or
former employees at this point get away
with doing a bunch of insider trading
even though they fired him it really
looks bad on the company and on the flip
side of things now an investigation led
by TechCrunch has discovered that Apple
has had a few leaks inside of their
software development side of things and
they have allowed a dozen different
porno sites and a bunch of real
money-making gambling apps which is
really just completely out of wine it
seems like Apple doesn't even really
care about what's going on with their
apps and stuff they mainly just care
about making the haul mighty dollar at
the end of the day
now these app developers they passed
apples week Enterprise certificate
screening process and some even
piggybacked on a legitimate approval
allowing them to sidestep the App
Store's traditional
guards designed to keep the i/os family
friendly the enterprise certificate
program isn't even supposed to be for
customers it's for companies to
distribute apps to their employees but
the main problem is Apple's lacked
standards for accepting businesses to
the program the policy explicitly states
you may not use distribute or otherwise
make your internal use applications
available to your customers but as you
can see from today's news Apple is
definitely not protecting these things
adequately at all which is really quite
a shame because it points to Apple
really just being greedy at the end of
the day instead of really caring about
customer protection and children and
stuff out there it just seems like Apple
cares about money so from really bad
employees stealing money through insider
trading to really relax the daisy'll
innovations and stuff like that to this
latest thing that's going on where
they're letting all kinds of weird apps
get out there which you know a lot of
children and stuff have these phones
which means about a lot of people that
shouldn't be looking at pornographic
stuff and let's just face it a gambling
app that takes real money and takes it
away from you that can really hurt a lot
of people if your child accidentally had
your credit card on there and started
gambling you could find yourself all of
a sudden in a hundred thousand dollars
in debt just assume your kid gambling
online and thinking that he wasn't you
know reusing your real money so these
are serious concerns a lot of people may
say hey you know Eric you know these are
kind of disliked things but they're
really not really light things I'm even
to be honest with you it seems to me
that Apple was pretty lazy even buying
beats I mean why do they have to go out
and buy a headphone cut made I mean they
couldn't develop the technology
themselves so instead of developing
technology and being ahead of the curve
they actually bought somebody else's
technology that kind of me just speaks
volumes to so my eyes it does seem like
in the last few years
Apple is definitely losing its shine I
know a lot of my beauties are the PC
master-race guys and they just hate
Apple anyways I myself I do have Apple
computers we use IMAX inside of our
recording studio and for editing so
these kind of things do affect us as
well at the end of the day though I just
really wish that Apple would pick up the
ball and do a lot better things in the
even though some of their stuff was
expensive it was still kind of cool to
see somebody pushing the envelope and
weird technologies so there you have it
folks
Apple is definitely losing its shine
hopefully things will be fixed over
there and we'll see new innovative stuff
because right now I feel like phone
technology in general is pretty stagnant
I mean let's just face it what more can
do on a phone if you can hear somebody
you're good to go
I'm Eric we'll have links down below if
you want to see more about these stories
you can dig in more in depth but that's
pretty much it man
a guy embezzling close to $400,000 and
this guy cannot say that you know oh I
didn't know that was the law because
this guy actually grew wrote the law
lacked security features allowing weird
stuff to hit the internet which could
affect people in a lot of really bad
ways
bad stuff we'll see you guys back here
on the channel but for now things seem a
little bit shady on the Apple side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
