once again to another edition of tech of
tomorrow I'm Miller cure host and today
the co-host says once again JJ mr. a
sues himself now what are we gonna be
taking a look at today well today we're
gonna be taking a look at the Tough
Series of motherboards that's right the
truck Norris series of motherboards now
Chuck Norris has been to Mars that's why
there's no life on Mars also you guys
know Chuck Norris one time got into a
battle of Superman with a loser I'd to
wear his underwear on the outside so you
know it's not but that one
so anyways with that said we've got
these cool new motherboards in front of
us and JD's gonna tell us all the new
specs and cool things about these boards
so what's up what's up boss thank you
for having me and like you talked about
Chuck Norrises as a it's a hard car
character and we've got a series of
really outstanding motherboards it did
you know that Chuck lost his virginity
before his father
yeah it's true so getting back to the
board's a day when Alexander Bell
invented the telephone three missed
phone calls by Chuck Norris I'm just
sayin just sayin all right I'll keep
that for food-for-thought right on man
you know all right so we've got two
boards here and that in itself is of
course really interesting because
historically when we launched the Tough
Series of motherboards we've only had
one skew we've had the sabre-tooth so we
previously have the sabre-tooth z77 now
we've got the saber-tooth z87 but we're
also actually gonna be introducing an
entirely new skew this is going to be
the Griffon this is going to be a micro
ATX version for the ultimate force or
the Tough Series motherboard line so um
there's gonna be pretty much a high
degree of consistency in terms of all
the feature set the functionality the
new design features that are part of the
thermal armor system and they're pretty
much going to be represented on both the
main differentials this is going to be
is one that's a micro ATX board and the
other one is an ATX board so with that
let's go ahead and first take a look at
what we have on the sabre-tooth c87 and
see how it differs from the previous
generation one last question
sure were these boards designed to take
karate chop from Chuck Norris I'm pretty
sure I'm pretty sure I G we haven't
integrated that yet into our qvl but you
know we're working to be the frequently
asked questions yeah yeah we're working
on that so we can go ahead and take a
look at the board here and of course
right off the bat
it's gotten to kind of got the classic
look that you would expect in terms of
the sabre-tooth feature in the internal
thermal armor design but we have gone
ahead and made some updates to the way
the thermal armor design works so the
first one is going to actually be these
flow valves that we have integrated
within the BRM section for the thermal
design so you can see here that we can
essentially go ahead and move them up
and down and we can essentially close
them on or off and this allows us to go
ahead and control the airflow as it's
either being distributed through the
internal vrm assembly in its heatsink or
maybe if you have your vrm pulling in
air so you have maybe your top pins or
in chasity serving as an intake as
opposed to an exhaust and you want to go
ahead and help to bring in that air to
be able to cool the additional vrm
further at the end of the day pretty
much what we're trying to provide you
here is more flexibility control about
how the thermal armament system works
you remember in previous generations we
have kind of a shut design so
essentially there's angled molded paths
underneath here that direct airflow to
key areas of the motherboard we even
have convection holes so there's
actually holes that are physically
inside the PCB that allow air flow to
directly pass through the motherboard
and exhaust through then the back of the
chassis and it come in to the back of
the silicone in between all the layers
of the tough armor and keep the
motherboard running cool correct and so
that adds us also an additional layer of
cooling so when you combine that all
together with of course the previous
aspects of the thermal design it helps
to really give us more functionality
versatility at keeping your board cool
and enhancing the reliability and
stability
now generally tough isn't segmented or
focused for people that are overclocking
but the board is definitely capable in
terms of overclocking the same degree as
our rog or our mainstream series but you
know first and foremost the focus is for
people that are generally looking at a
longer term lifespan you know the board
comes included with this certificate or
reliability for recently we have our
tough rated components of our such as
our tough choke are tough MOSFETs and
are tough capacitors and the capacitors
actually have been updated these are
using the same capacitors that are on
our rog series so the ninja con GT 10k
capacitors so when we integrate these
components one thing that's very
important though is that we don't want
to just talk about the components being
the improvement here anybody can go out
and pick quote-unquote good quality
components the key differential is going
to be that the overall board has been
validated with that design specification
and those components so we take a lot of
time to actually take these boards and
run the
for concurrent stress testing over a
very long period of time where we're
simultaneously using the USB the PCI
Express the SATA the memory the CPU all
of its getting put under load and
literally we're running it for you know
sometimes 14 15 16 17 18 20 days at a
time to test to see how the board
operates under these so really existing
intensive testing goes into these areas
and there's a lot more validation and
reliability testing that goes into that
and that's part of the reason why the
cyber 2 series of motherboards offer
five-year warranty now I'm going back
terms of what we have here intelligible
in terms of thermal armor it's pretty
consistent from the previous generation
we have the to assist fans that we go
ahead and coorporate where we have
what's called the GPU zone and the CPU
zone so one would go ahead and go here
and another one's going to go ahead and
go in this section what I'm gonna go and
do is I'm gonna bring out another board
where I already have them mounted and
you guys can check this out so you can
see right here in the centralized area
we have this set up so that goes that
helps to bring air flow that will go
ahead and cool the board additionally so
that in this section where we of course
have our graphics cards as well as our
PCH area which is providing all the i/o
and the information delivery to the SATA
ports we can go ahead and bring in more
airflow and in the vrm section you can
see right here that we go ahead and have
another fan which you can serve as an
intake or as an exhaust so you got a lot
of flexibility and of course these just
like every single fan header on the
board are fully controllable not only in
our software but in the UEFI environment
now there is an entirely new thermal
radar system if you remember before
tough has always had multiple sensors
sprinkled throughout the motherboard to
give you a full real-time kind of
thermal map of how the temperatures on
the board are working in response to
your system configuration and how your
system is responding under load so we
still keep that but we've added a brand
new thermal assessment tool so what it
does it will actually measure the
thermal response in specific zones and
tell you how good your board is actually
cooling that specific area so it'll say
this area down here is actually getting
this much this area's getting this much
correct and I'll actually show you kind
of like in a graph format hey you have
optimal cooling or maybe you don't have
as optimal cooling as you like so that
maybe you can go ahead and add another
fan and help to bring down the
temperatures overall improve performance
one thing I really like about is that
you really don't touch any of the
silicon at all
she really did on purpose the entire
board is totally protected yeah
and in that respect let's go ahead and
touch on one of the other new aspects
which are entirely new and I'm gonna
pick up the Griffin board for this
perspective you can go ahead and set
that guy down if we take a look right
here
looking at our Griffin the Griffin
features an entirely new design to the
Thermal Armor where we've gone ahead and
extended and even advanced it further
and that's so actually going to be this
right here which what we call the
fortifier so the fortifier one it looks
cool right but there's actually some
specific functionality benefits that
you're gonna get with it it's going to
add rigidity and minimize torsion on the
board so if you've ever taken like a big
heatsink and tried to install it you
could sometimes over torque the heatsink
and this can cause sometimes minor
flexing or bending to the board over the
long term that's not healthy because
there are traces on the motherboard that
can sometimes be damaged and if shorted
out exactly so with this you're adding a
bit more rigidity and a bit more torsion
resistance to the board as a whole so
that's going to be a nice improvement
now all our PCBs use very high-quality
PCB substrate material so there's very
little flex as compared to competitors
where they're a lot thinner and in
certain situations but this just gives
you kind of that other layer of
confidence if we go back to let's say
the ATX version which out course also
preaches the fortifier design we you can
even have this serve as an actual
heatsink you're going to see right here
that it's actually making direct contact
with the vrm heatsink so it's giving you
additional cooling on top and below
under the arm yeah correct
the hottest part of the BRM is your
MOSFETs and your drivers and this is
directly making contact with that to
help to go ahead and pull heat away from
that and actually disperse it across
this actual entire section so that's
another benefit that the fortifier gives
you another one is just from the
physical hanging perspective like you
talked about there's a lot of direct
solder points that you have here that
get created during the production of the
motherboard and sometimes when you go
ahead you make contact with that you can
Nick you can cut you can scratch your
fingers so it just makes it easier to
handle so when you've got us more
ergonomic yeah when you factor that all
together you know not only does it look
cool but actually provides some really
nice benefits now in terms of what we've
done with rounding out aspects to be
able to provide additional reliability
and durability to the product is we've
extended on what we refer to as our dust
defender design if you remember in the
previous generation we added
these cool covers to be able to go ahead
and protect your slots and this was
important because sometimes over time
people don't realize that you get dust
debris dancers up in there yeah it can
actually fill up in there and you can
short out your ports if you go ahead and
install a graphics card sometimes it can
actually conduct static electricity
you can get a number of different
variables so this just hopes that not
only one look at your protection but it
helps to just provide that additional
layer of security in terms of making
sure that all your ports are protected
and so we have that for all the PCI
Express slots we even have it for the
front headers if we go to the back of
the board you can see that we even have
dust defenders for every single back i/o
port even including your audio so you
really only need to go ahead and remove
the ones that you're actually going to
utilize and if you're not utilizing that
port you can go ahead and just cover it
up and keep it dust free and make sure
that it's entirely protected so we think
that that's another nice point we of
course continue to provide it for the
memory and overall that gives you a
great form of protection when you talk
about thermal protection protection from
the you know different types of
particulates our elements that are
floating throughout your chassis and
building up that could compromise the
integrity when you then factor that in
of course with all the high-end
component quality and everything else
that tough brings to the table in terms
of advanced monitor and cooling really
special board now rounding things out of
course we keep all the standard design
ASIS design points that we'd expect so
we got you know the USB 3 boost
technology we have the USB charger
technology we've got our fan expert so
all those things are going to continue
to be there plus some awesome new UEFI
options which we want you guys make sure
to check out the video that we're gonna
do in terms of ufi options now lastly in
terms of the thermal armor you're gonna
see that we have these cool little
thermal probes so the motherboard itself
has a whole bunch of fixed thermal
probes that give you real-time
temperature mapping but for this
generation there's going to be three
thermal probes that you can also a fix
to the motherboard and you can go ahead
and position these anywhere you want you
can put them maybe over your hard drive
inside your chassis on the back of your
graphics card and you can always have a
real-time baseline temperature for that
device or wherever you have this thermal
rose how many of those in there are
three of them included so that's another
nice value point for people that really
care about kind of monitoring the system
making sure they're getting optimal
cooling in performance then you can go
ahead and utilize these and there's even
nice little touches like this where for
the i/o shield right we have of course
the classic q shield which is pad
which helps the block electromagnetic
interference plus it's softer to touch
so it's easier to install but we've even
added a cool little fab filter so that
if you want to go ahead and more easily
service this when you have it installed
you can go ahead and take the little fan
filter out clean it off and you don't
have to worry about having larger
built-up particles actually when you're
on the back of the board on the back of
the board so nice little touch
now for the Gryphon skew for you guys
that are going to be interested in this
micro 2x version you do want to keep in
mind that here we're showing it to you
with the entire thermal armor design
already in place but when you do
purchase it it will just be the board by
itself to hit a more aggressive price
point we're going to be offering the
board without the thermal armor design
but we're gonna actually be offering
this really cool armor kit so the armor
kit will come included with everything
you would need to be able to equip your
board fully with the fortifier the armor
all these key accessories to be able to
take advantage of it you can just go
ahead and purchase this and then
integrate that onto your migrate to
exhibition so JD the sabre-tooth board
that it will come with all this
pre-installed and everything it's it's
only the Griffon board that you need to
buy it separately correct that's correct
the Griffon board will come without the
thermal armor without the fortifier but
you can get the actual Griffon kit here
which will include everything as you can
see right here all the covers in terms
of your dust defenders for your PCIe
slots they'll have all the covers for
all the dust defender for your i/o ports
the fan even include this little screw
driver so you can go ahead and get
everything all installed for you so
that'll all be included inside of a box
that you can go ahead and purchase as an
option for the Griffon SKU so overall
you know if you're looking for a really
great board you know and you're looking
more towards generally a longer-term
build right you know not necessarily as
focused at overclocking you just want a
great solid board you know you do a
little bit everything you know you kind
of maybe do some gaming maybe you do
some general productivity you're online
downloading music you just kind of want
to solid a good quality desktop but you
want to be able to take advantage of
monitoring advanced cooling technologies
you know that's where tough is going to
be in mind for you not to mention that
for those people out there who are
looking to build a custom build unlike a
military-type theme this board fits
right in on that with the colors game
yeah short I mean definitely there's
always been a complimentary kind of
ethos in terms of you know a military
vibe with the tough series especially
with the military components that go
through that validation process but you
know at the end of the day we feel that
the features
said on here is always first and
foremost target at users that are
interested in reliability monitoring and
cooling and of course they're looking
for that extra layer of Asus
functionality whether it's in the fan
controls the UEFI are the great power
delivery options that we're offering
right on just all kinds of good stuff
coming with this I can't wait till these
things come out like I said before our
tech camp team announced he really loves
all of the Tough Series that's like he
always builds every new new set that
comes out he builds a themed model off
it so I'm sure we'll be seeing a system
built off one of these real soon as well
so alright folks that's it we've got a
lot some more stuff coming out at the
house will release I'm Mel Rick this is
JJ and we'll see you guys back here on
Tech tomorrow
