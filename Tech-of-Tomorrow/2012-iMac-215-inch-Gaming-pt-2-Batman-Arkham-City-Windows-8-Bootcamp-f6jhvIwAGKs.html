tomorrow I'm Eric your host now today
we're gonna continue on with showing you
gaming on the new 21 inch iMac that's
right this is the I 5 to point 7 8
gigabytes of ram 640 m video processor
that's by Nvidia by the way if you guys
don't know that and today we're gonna
bring you hints this that affectionately
we're gonna bring you Batman toys one of
my favorites and it's a really good game
so with that said let's actually jump in
and see the gameplay of Batman Arkham
City here we go
all right folks so there you have it
obviously we ran the benchmark because
we want to see the physics and all that
kind of stuff that the cards capable of
so I hope that you guys did like that
now obviously you guys know that like I
said before playing games on this iMac
isn't like the first thing it's for it's
geared for productivity but the fact
that you can do a dual boot use the Mac
OS and use the Windows OS at the same
time makes it pretty flexible and pretty
cool pretty much what this 21 iMac is is
pretty much a PC laptop stuck inside of
a very nice screen that's what it is
like I've said before I have a laptop
for maybe a direct that has the exact
same specs down to the wire other than
the operating system that comes with and
the screen but it does play games you
guys can see it it's not great but it
still does plan so if you occasionally
want to go and play those games they'll
be pretty good now one thing to take
note of - so far both the games that
we've played are like high in spectrum
games you know what I mean
Batman Borderlands 2 these aren't the
meek of heart games for anybody out
there who plays just standard games this
thing will actually kick ass if I went
in here and played any of those dungeon
dragon type games Diablo anything else
like that this thing is gonna totally
smoke and kick ass so take that in mind
obviously it's not gonna play the latest
3d shares with the ass-kicking of a
higher end card but any of those simpler
games it's gonna play without a snap and
one thing to take note of as well steam
now supports many many many mini games
that are compatible to play on the Mac
these days and they're geared to play
with the specs on ones like this so with
that said I hope you guys like this
video hit that like button and show me
some love and keep subscribe so you make
sure you can win some see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
