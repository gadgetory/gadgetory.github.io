quite a bit in the last few videos
mainly about the prices of video cards
how gaming is really overpriced in
general right now and how kind of
pre-built have become the go-to if you
want to be able to afford a system until
the video card prices drop now at CES
last year I ran to a friend of mine
Shannon Robb he used to work at thermal
take after ransom but now he works at a
VA direct I knew he moved but I didn't
know he went to this company so we
started talking and everything and at
that time he said hey you know would you
like to review some systems and I was
like yeah that'd be really cool and by
the way I don't get to keep this system
and paid no money there's nothing
involved in that he sent me the system
as a loaner so I could check it out and
bring it to you folks now this thing's
completely decked out pretty much now I
gotta say there are a few things about
it though that I'm unhappy with and I
think are kind of silly and probably
when Shannon watch the video and Shannon
I guess they're both named Shannon and
they'll probably agree with me when I
say this and so let's first off let's
take a look at this system now this is a
beautiful case right here this is the
corsair 570 it's a beautiful case all
glass all around if you guys haven't
seen it before the controls are all
located on top on the left hand side
it's just very very beautiful
aesthetically this is one of the nicest
cases i think that there is out there
and it actually has six fans including
it three in the front two on top and one
in the back to keep all of that hot air
circulating and blowing up the back of
that system also this system comes out
of the box already overclock so when the
notes they sent me it says that you're
going to get a 10 to 20% performance
boost depending on the application and
what you're doing so that's pretty cool
right abox comes overclocked now the cpu
i7 8700 k perfect for overclocking
motherboard the ASUS Maximus hero board
very nice board lots of features 32
gigabytes of Kingston HyperX memory the
latest ddr4 really nice stuff also it
says that inside this system there are
two 250 gigabyte nvm ray drives are an
Evo nine six
I couldn't find you through the Evo 960s
and looking around the flashlight I've
been open the whole system up yet
I didn't actually see those drives and
then for the other hard drive it's a one
terabyte Seagate Barracuda like what
what I did actually Oh worked because
it's like okay we got this system also
sli to 1080 eyes EVGA with their super
bridge on there so you know those cards
right now are probably pretty expensive
I'm sure for these guys they probably
get them at the normal market price
unlike us who are trying to buy from
third-party sellers but still pretty
expensive now if you're gonna have a
system with all these great features
it's got a liquid cool or it's got an H
100 i from the people over at Corsair
just like the case so it matches up and
fits in there really nice you're going
to all this trouble and if there are two
of these to 250 gigabytes uh um
nvm drives or SSDs some weirdo that I
just can't see and they're in raid
that's gonna be pretty awesome but so
then at that point why a one terabyte
Barracuda I mean we're at 4,000 bucks
what's thirty more dollars I mean that's
the only part about the system I really
don't get because if I was building this
system you guys know how much space
today's games take I mean come on final
fantasy forum will sucks up your whole
hard drive I mean you know I mean so
having a one terabyte hard drive makes
no sense at the very minimum I think
this should have had a three terabyte
fire CUDA at those particular drives are
like a hundred bucks so why couldn't
have it in it I mean obviously you can
pull the drive out and you can change it
yourself that's not a problem you know
and also I talked about the power supply
850 watt EBG a power supply
gold-certified all that good stuff so
what you got here is a 4k totally custom
built system now real quick when the
system arrived at my door it actually
came in two boxes there was a big
external cardboard box then inside there
was some packing material and then the
system inside of this box so we opened
that up
took it all out and even though there
was a big dent in the side of the box
the system had no damage whatsoever
every partner it's still complete and
intact and I'm sure when I go plug it in
and turn it on it's going to be
fine now my question is $4,000 that's a
lot of money would any of you out there
honestly pay 4,000 for a system even if
it's this nice because I'm Mara before I
brought you guys another system in the
past I was like a really expensive
system for man gear and even though you
guys all cheered and said hey that
system looks totally badass most people
out there were like wow there's no way
I'd be able to pay for that you know in
in one spoonful you know I mean you'd
have to either make payments on it or
just buy it in parts and build it
yourself but systems like this coming
pre-built and everything like that are
kind of easy for you you know I mean it
comes it's done if you want to change
the video cards out there's you know a
couple cables in there you can unplug it
bring your next video cards in right now
there's currently really no CPU you
could upgrade so this thing right now is
probably as far as you can get I mean 32
gigabytes of RAM is quite a bit of RAM
especially if you're just doing gaming I
mean this will do actually much more
than gaming also this will lead into
another story that we're doing as well
I've been starting to mess around a lot
with using PC's to do music recording I
know you guys might say what no yeah but
traditionally I've been using my max I
just kind of I started off with my Mac
using my Mac and even though I have Pro
Tools I use logic quite a bit but as
soon as Universal Audio came out with
these things said hey it they'll work
with a PC I was like hey I had to get
this going that's been kind of a hard
road for me but I got it going now I
want to see what this PC will do but
using a different device I can focus
right one of those types and by the way
the focus riots and the Moto's and all
those brands a lot of them have some
pretty cool features but when it comes
to Universal Audio versus those guys
Universal Audio nine times out of 10 is
going to be kicking totally ass the only
things that are really better are
something that has burr brown inside of
it as far as the inputs go and stuff so
if you had burr brown inside of it it'd
be a little bit better than the ones
that they have inside of Universal Audio
but beyond that it's the best so
hopefully I'll have the system up and
running it will totally game it'll
totally do music I'm gonna change the
hard drive out if I send it back I'll
put their hard drive in it but we have
so many games and stuff that we're
testing
so I put the 1 terabyte hard drive and
all Jesus the cameras gonna be telling
he's like dude there's no room on the
hard drive what do you want me to do so
the first thing I'm gonna do is pretty
much remove the hard drive now if it is
the only thing in there and I've got a
reformat and do all that stuff it's no
big deal it's a hassle but we're but
we'll still do it I don't really care
about that but it's good-looking it's 4k
next we'll see the performance we'll see
how they're overclocking does we'll
bring in the numbers
I'll even probably bring everything back
down to normal just so we can see what
normal performances versus the
overclocked performance plus the
temperatures because in some places
that's very important so thank you
Shannon and Shannon the people over at a
VA direct for breaking the system to us
we appreciate it like usual I will have
a link down below that like button I
hope you guys like this video and I
think that you guys would like the
system even if you don't like the price
there's no arguing that everything in
here is really nice this is honestly the
quality of like what Anthony does this
is Anthony quality like everything's
completely in its place there's nothing
sticking out nothing ragged just smooth
total clean build now a lot of people
out there can't do that a lot of people
make comments go oh I can do better but
not you really can't do too much better
than this I mean this is really really
nice stuff so if you got the cash you're
gonna be like this if you don't like oh
my god I'll never afford it but look at
it so if you have the money hey that's
really cool but check this out you can
also make monthly payments to a VA
direct if you want to get a system like
this so if you really want to get one
just saying or you can sit here and do
this all day long and try to get some
cash I don't know what's going on
works for Mario
