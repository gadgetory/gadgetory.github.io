once again the tech Oh tomorrow channel
getting ready to do our triple SLI
review and benchmarks with three gtx
660ti s from the people over at asu's
now the card I'm talking about is their
direct cu2 card you guys can see that I
have three of them back here behind me
as we prep and get ready like I said a
second ago to do our triple SLI testing
now a lot of different things come in
the direct see you too you guys know
it's direct copper it mounts directly to
it it offers much more superior cooling
which actually helps you in the long run
with your overclock since all
overclocking is now done through the
boost the cooler and more stable your
card runs the more Headroom you have to
do this so with that said let's jump in
let's do the unboxing and first look of
this new direct so you two gtx 660ti
from the people of red a a soos alright
folks by now i imagine that most you
people know what the gtx 660ti is it's
been going around for a long time
basically this card is a $300 killer to
AMD solution you guys can see it's the
directs you to version 20 percent cooler
vastly quieter to gigabytes gddr5 memory
it's got digi + v RM their GPU tweak
that's how they do all their
overclocking now as we take a look at
the back of the box you can see these
guys are once again reiterating their
features the direct see you to the Digi
+ v RM with super alloy power 30% less
power 2.5 longer durability which means
its lifespan is going to be longer and
their GPU tweak used for overclocking
monitoring the card works really well
all you do is install it you can look at
the Windows environment and totally
adjust your stuff so here's a tab on the
side it's going to pop back pull it here
I'll go ahead and just remove the box
now from the box nice and simply set off
the side put pop cap has built in the
box we can see right here this is going
to be the accessories box is going to
carry all the accessories for the card
so
just hit this open are now so we can
take a look at that first just get all
this stuff out in here and look at it
one by one and put it back in the back
so we've got speed setup guide driver CD
got feet molex to 6-pin and actually
folks I don't know what happened we've
been going through lays boxes I believe
this one does come with two of these
actually in the Box not just one so I
don't know what happened to it but it
does come with two of them in the box
I only have one then finally we have the
DVI to vga adapter pretty easy stuff but
really all you need then will come down
to it underneath the card now in a zoo
sends cards out to reviewers they don't
put them in the static bag I don't know
why they put the static bag on top and
they put the card underneath so there's
the card we'll go ahead and pull the
card out here you guys can see the top
of the card the two fans solution up
here on top you can see all the heat
pipes notice the heat pipe is one solid
piece all the way around goes all the
way around the card like we said before
the directs you to means direct copper
which means that the cooling plate is
directly to the GPU allowing for better
heat dissipation so it basically goes
into all this metal the fans blow it
away and that takes the heat away from
your card you can see with two sli
fingers here on top two 6-pin power
connectors here obviously the back of
the card
now it only takes four screws to remove
this Rotter reference base cards take 11
screws this one only takes 4 screws to
completely demolish an assembly you can
see the fan assembly extends far past
the end of the card give you guys an
inside view like that flip it around
over here show it to you you can see the
fang connector plugs in the pcie 3.0
interface here's the rear i/o
two DVI DisplayPort and HDMI this is
actually my favorite status before this
is my favorite type of rear i/o alright
folks here you have this is everything
that comes in the box all of the basic
features of the new asus gtx 660ti
direct see you version also I know many
people out there all the time ask what's
really the damn difference between a
reference card and a non reference card
well make sure you check and click out
the link in the description below we
have a video over on motherboards on our
sister channel we completely tear the
cards apart and show you the difference
between the reference and the standard
cards peace out we'll see you guys back
here in Tekken tomorrow as we jump into
triple SLI badass goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
