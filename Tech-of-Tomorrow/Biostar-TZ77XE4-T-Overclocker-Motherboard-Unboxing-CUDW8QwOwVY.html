fans it's me Elric Faris your host here
in the tech of the morrow youtube
channel getting ready for the ivy bridge
launch which is slowly starting to creep
up on us just to let you guys know very
soon here we'll be able to show scores
with first the Sandy Bridge and then
eventually we will move on to Ivy Bridge
back here behind me I've got a major
stack of boards this is pre launch
including the one I'm unboxing today and
I think I'm getting like about actually
ten more so I'm gonna be like swamped
and work for this launch so one of the
biggest launches of all time that said
we're gonna bring you one of our first
series of unboxings here on TECA
tomorrow today we're gonna look at the
TZ 77 xe4 now this is bio stars version
of the board
you guys know bio star there t power
series t power series boards are geared
for the overclocker there have been some
preliminary tests re leaked which showed
this board to actually be right in the
middle of all the boards that are being
released so that's pretty good stuff
because their guys's prices are entry
level and it's competing mid level not
bad
so let's see what comes in this little
box right here so here we go we got the
front of box get the camera to zoom in
there get that nice and close-up citizen
or smart overclocking smart over voltage
smart power savings got the big t
overclockers series on here thx audio
this thing also has really cool graphics
features on it too which a lot of people
may like maybe they won't I think it's
gonna be really cool I'm gonna go ahead
just flip it around show you guys the
back of the box if you're gonna be
looking to buy this online or whatever
you can see right here here's all the
nomenclature code I'll actually hold
them to the Cameron so we can zoom and
then get that real close up so like all
unboxing will go ahead and pop the cap
and begin the unboxing rock the back
we've got the BIOS star installation
guide there driver CD and manual it's
also on here toss that on the side we've
got
one two three four sets of SATA cables
right here all these are the new SATA 3
we have a crossfire connector right here
we have the rear i/o and these guys are
learning it kind of hard to see I'll
tell you this up here what they're
actually putting everything on the rear
i/o so you can see display for it HDMI
great graphics features going to set
that off the side and we get crossfire
bridge sli bridge all that good stuff so
we've got to the heart of the matter
let's dig in and take a look at some
motherboard nice any static plastic
wrapper there you board out now start
off to go to the board nice color
features a little bit kind of Halloweeny
but then not it's kind of weird so it's
orange and I think it's one key burnt
orange color this right here you guys
can see very similar to the sniper
motherboard series that's used by
gigabyte I believe it actually do some
redesigning and other models that are
coming out you can see there's plenty of
room though around the ZIF socket right
here for your CPU needs almost
aftermarket coolers got your memory all
right here and I'm sorry folks I know a
lot of you are gonna fixed I'm not
talking about features I cannot talk
about features I can only do the
unboxing and show you guys basic stuff I
apologize for that
I can't even tell you how much memory
goes in it here is the 24 pin power the
additional 8 pin power CPU fan right
here on top right above the CPU good
placement for that not too crowded at
all we have one two three PCIe lanes to
standard PCI lanes and a single 1 X PCI
la see that little mixer you know all
the new let's
old-school PCI and your PCIe I'll mix in
on one board you can see it's cooled
over here this is a passive there's no
active cooling on this whatsoever right
here's their new sound solution this is
called pure tone 110 DB T 7.1 HD audio I
can talk about that at least cuz that's
just standard stuff here right here all
your reset buttons on reset clear your
CMOS where you connect all the stuff to
your case to your motherboard
flip it around the side one two three
four
SATA connectors so there's eight
altogether flips around show you guys
the rear i/o very interesting rear i/o
some legacy stuff USB 2.0 hdmi
displayport DVI standard little vga
powered eSATA USB three more USB the LAN
the 7.1 now one thing that tripped me
out about the audio on here is that I
know that when you're using the HDMI or
you're using DisplayPort you can get the
sound coming through it but you were
thought for people who aren't using that
they would have had the option for
digital audio as well that was kind of
left off the bore not the end of the
world but oh well so that's about it
folks lots of stuffs coming up the new
Intel releases this is the teeny z77 xe4
power board see you guys back here on
Tekken tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
