probably today are eating until they are
stuff now here in America it's
Thanksgiving Day what does thanksgiving
day well basically it was a celebration
for all of the bounty of the land for
everybody to share it's been twisted and
I'm sure other people in other countries
probably don't care they're like yeah
like who gives a crap about Thanksgiving
right anyways what I'm saying is to you
guys all have a day that's something
like this right whether you're from
Russia of Croatia whether you're from
Mexico whether you're from Brazil Canada
a wherever you're from you guys all have
some type of harvest festival and so
basically today's our day and I want to
wish these same feelings to everybody
across the world a lot of people here in
America will be with their families for
those people out there who don't have a
family I'm gonna be by myself to that
day so you know I'm sending out my love
to you me and Buddy you'll be thinking
about you in fact I'm thinking about
down the street they have this Hong Kong
restaurant that serves prime rib so I'm
thinking about just going down there
getting some prime rib bringing some
home for the puppy and then we're gonna
you know have a little munch out on
thanksgiving day so that's what's going
on here on tech of tomorrow so if you're
out there like i said you by yourself
don't feel lonely there's lots of people
out there by themselves just have faith
in yourself and love yourself and you
should have a good day people are always
willing to share this day like Alex spin
it alone by choice cuz honestly there's
so many people buy these columns at hey
