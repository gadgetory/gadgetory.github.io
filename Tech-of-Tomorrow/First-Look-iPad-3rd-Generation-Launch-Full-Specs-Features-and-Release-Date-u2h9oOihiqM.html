echo tomorrow I'm elric fairest your
host like it or love it today Apple
releases their new iPad 3 one of the
biggest features of this thing is the
new Retina display which speeches a 2048
x 1536 resolution now this has a million
times more the pickles than a standard
HDTV very very cool stuff let's take a
look at this thing now right at the bat
we can see that the new iPad 3 has a 9.7
inch screen it weighs in at 1.4 pounds
and is 0.37 inches thick now the really
cool thing about this that's going to be
running Apple's iOS 5.1 and it'll be
running on an a 5x chip with features
quad-core graphics this is still a
dual-core chip so it gets a little
confusing here because there's a
dual-core chip with quad-core graphics
this also enables the ipad 3 to have
four times the performance of previous
generations the isight camera on the
ipad 3 has the optical system the iphone
4s this is a 5 megapixel camera that
features a 5 lens feature now this thing
also can take movies and 1080p and
another good thing about it is if you
want to do vocal dictation there's a
little button on the bottom of the ipad
3 CH you click on two and you can voice
your dictation right onto it and your
text appears on the screen this is some
pretty cool also included with the
ipad 3 is 4g LTE support as well as
bluetooth support and personal hotspot
this thing still packs 10 hours of
battery life so it should last pretty
long while you're out bouncing around
though it does drop to 9 hours if you
use the 4g technology so check it out
the new 4g versions are as falls
there'll be three of them and you'll be
able to pick these up on March 16th we
have the 16 gigabyte coming in at six
hundred twenty nine dollars the 32
gigabyte coming in at seven hundred
twenty nine dollars and lastly the 64
gigabyte model at eight hundred and
twenty nine dollars so you have them
ranging to just over five hundred
dollars to all the way up to a thousand
so you guys have seen it lots of great
features on this thing i will say that
at the moment there's a lot of
controversy going on with Apple people
are complaining that the workers over in
China are being
totally bad by the people at Apple if
you really want to protest this and you
believe that you have the choice of not
buying this however me personally I feel
it's the government's fault I think a
lot of you probably feel the same way we
know what goes on here it's not the
problem of us the people it's the
problem of the government so that said
folks you guys all know what it is you
guys have seen the features we've showed
you the price for those out there who
are waiting for March 16th to come
around if you like the Apple products
you're going to be some lucky mother see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
