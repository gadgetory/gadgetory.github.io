see you guys back here on the channel
once again I'm Elric and you guys are
going to like what's on the plate today
AMD fans I know you guys have all been
waiting for them to come to the table
and bring something really competitive
against Intel now they've tried to do
that with their new AMD FX 95 90 CPU but
this thing's kind of crazy it's coming
to market at a minimum price of like 800
dollars at stock it does 0.875 volts but
when this thing
turbos up and it goes to it's 5
gigahertz it's at 1.5 volts that means
that no air core that you're going to be
able to purchase will have any
snowball's chance in hell of keeping
this thing cool at those kind of values
this thing is going to be running so hot
you're going to need to put mr. freeze
on it just to keep it running cool now
not only has this outrageous pricing
come out but also benchmarks have come
out as well and these preliminary ones
and they're making me fake eight hundred
bucks really not worth it when you can
buy an extreme series processor for
literally only a few dollars more in
fact some of the extreme processor in
the $500 range
so you can get a CPU that blows it out
of the water from Intel for about three
hundred dollars less like always if you
guys want to check out the full on
article all these scores and see all the
information about this new AMD 95 90
make sure you guys check out the link
down there in the description below the
like button the next story that we're
bringing you guys we're going to have to
do a little bit of time travel
and in the past when Microsoft was
trying to come up with names for the
Xbox they had hired an entire team just
to come up with the naming for this
thing and some of the names that they
came up with were really stupid some of
these names include the max the
Microsoft action experience the AI oh
the mind ooh the Microsoft interactive
Network device the face anybody want to
come over and play on my face yeah okay
and the myth Microsoft Interactive
theater pretty ridiculous right now
those were just a few of the outrageous
names that this team came up with and I
honestly think that Microsoft you guys
wasting an awful lot of damn cash for
nothing I could have got some
five-year-olds come for these names but
anyways for all of the names and all the
information about this you guys can
laugh at it make sure you guys once
