once again to the town not today I want
to talk to you guys about a product
called Nord VPN now a lot of people out
there probably know what a VPN but I'm
sure there's people out there who don't
know what a VPN is now what a VPN is is
a virtual private network and it works
in a couple of different ways and Nord
VPN is totally there to help protect you

virtual private network and what it
allows you to do is it allows you to
have an online presence in total privacy

your information basically the bottom
line here is when you're online you

or about your information getting out
there whatsoever if you have a VPN and
Nord VPN makes it simple now for people
who use their phone and they do a lot of
business on a lot of transactions on

Starbucks and places like that Nord VPN

account you can use up to six devices
simultaneously in today's world online
hackers and pirates and all those people
are just trying to invade your security
Nord VPN gives you that security using a
EES with 236 bit keys in fact Nord VPN
was used by the US government to secure
classified information and by NSA to
protect national security data so you
know you're getting the ideal VPN for
your online security nor VPN recommends
two different security protocols that
provide strong VP encryption between
your device and the connected server
these types are i ke version two slash
tips sec and open VPN by using
next-generation encryption and i ke v to
slash tips ik it encrypts and secures
users traffic by employing high level
cryptographic algorithms and keys even
the
strongest computers couldn't crack it's
military-grade encryption Nord VPN
highly recommends I ke V to slash ship
SEC as it has been adopted as a default
in the Nord VPN apps for iOS and Mac OS
as well open VPN on the other hand is a
piece of open-source software which
provides reliability online security and
a fast VPN experience Open VPN uses AES
256 - CBC with a 2048-bit DHT to
guarantee protection of your sensitive
data it can also be used with tcp and
UDP ports for a more reliable web
accessing option as well as a faster

one of the best features about Nord VPN
is cyber sec you can enable cyber ii or
VPN to block ads and malware from
harming your computer it also blocks
dangerous websites with trackers spyware
or other malicious software by scanning
these sites against popular block lists

you can also use Nords VPNs double VPN
technology for an added layer of data
encryption and security the connection
goes through two separate servers in
different locations the external IP
address is then changed and the traffic
is encrypted once and then it gets
Riaan in the second server in another
location so what this means if you're a
journalist a vlogger a political
activist and you live inside of a
country that likes to censor all these
type of things with this double VPN
