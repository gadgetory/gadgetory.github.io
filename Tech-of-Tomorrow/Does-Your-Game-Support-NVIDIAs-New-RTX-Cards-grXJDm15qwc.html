guys back here lots of stuff going on
over and the Nvidia camp we're gonna
talk about that but before we talk about
that stuff
let's hear word from today's sponsor 0 &amp;amp;
9 it's about that time again folks

and video released all they're brand new
cards and a lot of people are up in arms
about the technology saying you know hey
how many games out there actually use
real-time ray tracing and DLS s
technology I mean how many games out
there really do it and people are kind
of up in arms now admittedly the prices
of these cards especially in the high
end the twenty eighty I are really
expensive I mean it's almost thirteen
hundred bucks for the founders Edition
you can get an on founders Edition with
some little less specs a little bit
slower more power draw this is gonna
cost you around a grand the price is
dropped from there but you guys know
what I'm saying and the reactions these
prices have just really been negative if
you look at a lot of people on the web
they're saying it's a lot of negative
stuff but on video about this and I have
to admit it it does seem a little bit
kind of strange I've liked in video
cards and stuff but these cards are very
expensive and we just got out of a
drought of a bunch of you know not being
able to get all the video cards hoping
that some new technology would come out
so that we could keep the older
technology hopefully at a great price
and I think people were really expecting
something a lot different they were
expecting cards orders can be super
duper faster and they're supposed to be
like really cheaper and that's just not
really what happened whatsoever but a
thing that actually is true is that
there are games out there right now that
support real-time ray-tracing and DL SS
so let's check out those games so you
guys can see that hey these cards
actually do have a marketplace right now
with games out there that are supported
by this technology they're not just
being released only like one game
currently there are quite a few games
that actually take advantage of
real-time ray-tracing
and they'll be actually more games to
come according to Nvidia now some of the
main games you guys are gonna know are
gonna be shadow of Tomb Raider from
Square Enix this is gonna fully take
advantage of that technology so will
project D H Metro Exodus MechWarrior 5
JX 3 justice enlisted control from
remedy battlefield 5 atomic heart and
also assetto corsa which is a racing
game there are also quite a few games
that will use DL SS now these are Ark
survival evolved atomic heart dauntless
fractured lands hitman to justice JX 3
also a big favorite pub G then we also
have Serious Sam 4 shadow of the Tomb
Raider the forge arena and we happy few
lots of games there so there you have it
Tech fans you guys see there are
actually quite a few games that are out
in the market right now taking advantage
of the technology from these new and
vidya cards and like people who play
like Final Fantasy 17 and stuff I think
that you'll be really impressed on how
these cards work and those games I think
you'll be able to enable all your hair
works and all that good stuff and you're
not going to be losing frame rates it's
just gonna be one beautiful adventure
all around now you know these games are
out right now we're just like I think
just under 30 but there's lots of more
titles that are actually coming out so
I'd imagine as the months go by and the
game developers out there you guys know
Nvidia they're pretty aggressive about
working with the game to developers
that's one thing about them you know
drivers and working with game developers
they're gonna be on that will be see me
SLI anymore I don't really know about
that but all the other stuff is pretty
much gonna be right on par so you know
that everything in these cars is gonna
be geared to get you to play games so
then working aggressively with the game
developers will ensure that the games
that come out in the future will support
either DL SS or they'll support
real-time rate racing and if you guys
haven't seen my other video I'll have a
link down below you guys can see my pins
and whether I think you guys should
upgrade right now or not my pins are
kind of mixed on that if you guys want
to see what I have to say about that
I'll have a link down below also I'll
have a link down below do you guys if
you want to check out these different
games that are supported by this we'll
have those as well for you so I mark you
guys been watching teka tomorrow if you
want to get yourself a really cheap code
for getting office pay you have a chance
right now check out 0 &amp;amp; 9 peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
