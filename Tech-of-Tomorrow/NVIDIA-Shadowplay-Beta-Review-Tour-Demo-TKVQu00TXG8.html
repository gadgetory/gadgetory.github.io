tomorrow now today nvidia is releasing
its latest set of drivers which along
with the usual set of upgrades and
optimizations is also including the beta
for nvidia shadowplay now what shadow
play is is invidious free game capture
software for people at own 600 or 700
series cards now what's cool about this
is a it's free and be nvidia cards are
already designed to be optimized for it
and make use of onboard resources and as
a result the impact on performance
should be minimal so let's go ahead and
take a look at that right now
so as you can see here we're running
GeForce experience and up here in the
upper right hand corner we now have this
option for shadow play so click on that
flip on the power button and you can see
they have a couple different options to
mess with first off there's the
recording method the options being
manual and shadow manual mode works like
most game capture software where you hit
a hotkey once to begin recording did it
again to stop and it records everything
in between shadow mode on the other hand
is constantly always recording what you
do in games running in full screen and
saves them as temporary files in 20
minute increments and when you hit the
recording hotkey it immediately saves
whatever period of time you previously
set up right now we have it set to 5
minutes but you can go to the setting
right here and change it to anywhere
you'd like between one minute or the
full 20 so it's great about this is you
can always record those great moments
that happen in games that you weren't
planning on so you didn't have to be
recording in advance now there are a
couple other options as well including
being able to record audio or just mute
it so it's video alone and you can
record in three different video
qualities low medium and high so to give
you guys an idea of how shadowplay
actually looks we went ahead and
recorded the couple samples from batman
arkham origins in the earlier parts of
the game now we recorded the same minute
long scene three times using each
quality setting and then we're going to
show you right now is the high quality
one that we captured using our system
which includes a GTX 780 and an i7 4770k
processor so let's go ahead and check
that out right now
these are black mask's men I'll make
them tell me where I can find black mask
joy so there you have it now what was
really cool about that scene is the fact
that when we weren't running shadowplay
that scene was averaging around 98
frames per second whereas when we were
running shadow play it only went down to
ninety two and a half which is really
only about a six percent decrease which
is really good considering now of course
this video was compressed when we
uploaded it to YouTube so if you want to
see the raw full version of the clip as
well as the low and medium quality ones
you can find download links for them in
an article that we have posted in the
description well that was just a quick
look at the beta version of nvidia
shadowplay there are more features plan
to be released in the future including
the ability to stream via twitch now if
you're in a video card owner please make
sure you get those drivers for yourself
today and let us know what you think in
the comments when you get to try shadow
play out for yourself and as always guys
