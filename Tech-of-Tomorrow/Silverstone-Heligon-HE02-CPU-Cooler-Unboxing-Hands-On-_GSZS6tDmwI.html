back to the ticket amaro youtube channel
i'm Elric your host now today we're
gonna be taking an unboxing and first
look of you got it another PC product so
you guys out there digging on that here
we're back again with it today we're
gonna be looking at the new Silverstone
Heligan hero2 now this thing's supposed
to really work really well handle CPUs
up to 130 watts and I'll actually work
with any type of system out there so
whether you're an AMD guy an Intel guy
it doesn't matter that's all out the
window this thing's for everybody so
let's start out let's just take a look
at the Box like usual you guys can see
that's the nice lovely front of the box
flip it around here I'm at the Karen
freeze on this for a couple seconds this
is probably what's gonna be more
important you guys want to see these are
all the specifications of the actual
cooler so you guys should get all that
down snow let's bring it back over the
table the only other thing on the box
for me that's even worth looking at
there's nothing so there's really
nothing else we're looking at the but
let's set it down right here there's
gonna be a place right down here I'm
going to have to use my trusty knife I
already had flicked out so no reason for
that today I'm just go ahead and make a
quick incision down here on the bottom
and pull the tab under so we'll start to
unboxing take the top off the top we can
see it's part of the nitrogen Heligan
series nitrogen Heligan series like I
said before this is the heo to the he o2
in size just like you know various stuff
on how to put it together again for AMD
or for Intel Intel AMD everything's
inside there like I said before it's
really good it'll work up anything
that's out there so much pull the unit
out not about it that's all there is to
it so here is the unit now this thing
like just a big giant
giant thing of pins and all right pretty
amazingly enough there's no fan and
that's it's in this box so let's see
what this is this the fan or is this
accessories alright leave the chemists
our reason to the table right here these
are all the accessory packages for
everything to mount all your mounting
hardware your paste brackets back plate
everything you need is there so that's
that stuff now one thing that's in use
about this things you're gonna notice is
there's no fan so let me bring this up
here to you guys there's no fan in this
and I'm not seeing any place on here to
mount a fan so it's completely gonna be
a silent cooling solution obviously they
must be feeling awfully damn confident
about that so you see we up here we have
one two three four five six six heat
pipes rang throughout the entire center
of the system well flip it to the bottom
this work mounts up put this on your CPU
along with the paste all the heats gonna
gather in here go up into these chambers
then it's gonna go up in here and then
dissipate through all of these spins now
I gotta say that silverstone is coming
across pretty ballsy with a move like
this you usually do not see a cooler
especially for any of the higher end
stuff that doesn't have a fan at all so
really I got to give hats off these guys
for this now as far as the performance
goes and how well that works
we'll have to hook it up to the test
station I got back here behind me and
then we can throw out some of the
numbers until then though here's what it
looks like and we'll see you guys back
here and take it tomorrow tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
