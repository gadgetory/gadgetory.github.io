our care once again the tech of tomorrow
youtube channel bringing you guys
another unboxing video this time it's on
the 15-inch macbook pro now i know some
people out there going oh my god he's
been a trait that he's bought himself a
mac but alright the truth is and blind
and the retina display on this being
2880 by 1800 makes an old blind guy like
me be able to see things better because
you get double the up and double the
sideways so you get vertical and
horizontal much better display than
anything available on the market we also
run Final Cut Pro to edit all of our
videos and since we're going to CES we
still have to keep the business going so
we got this little thing it's got a quad
core processor two point three gigahertz
it has eight gigabytes of 1600 megahertz
ddr3 memory features a 650 m and video
processor features its own camera pretty
much with this thing is a very very
souped-up ultrabook has 256 gigabytes of
SSD smacked right on the board mostly
ultrabooks out there they come with
either a hundred 128 gigabyte SSD built
in this bad boy comes built in 256 so
that's what I said it pretty much is
just a souped-up ultrabook but it runs
the mac OS and because we have to use
Final Cut Pro that's what we're used to
we're going to do it so let's jump into
the box and let's see what this thing
has to offer you guys I know it's
nothing new but it's still pretty damn
cool so we'll start it for the front now
this particular model is about two
thousand dollars it's a little bit over
me like 2018 something like that I think
is what we paid for this thing nothing
to the box guys I know there's not much
to it at all we'll just hop right in and
get to it take the old trusty knife make
an insertion right here
oh I have to do a little more cut in
there just go ahead and take the whole
thing out of the plastic then this is
actually the very first mac laptop that
I've ever bought in my entire life it's
just because of the 2880 by 1800 screen
that being said the retina display is
just the really to me the most awesome
feature of this obviously you know it's
going to have its dual thunderbolt ports
its other stuff just remove the plastic
off here take that all off of there
first off I'm just going to set it down
and I'll show you guys the accessory
package and then we'll actually just go
ahead on that so I'll bring this over
here we've got the design by Apple in
California open that up around with the
hello hello the little quick start guide
macbook pro and then a couple of cool
stickers and last but not least a cloth
to polish and clean your screen get that
out of the way got the power cable and
the power adapter right here there we go
this little plug that goes in the wall
socket your power cable one that's
pretty much it as far as the accessories
go now let's get down to the unit over
here on the side we see the SD card
reader the hdmi and the USB 3.0 will
flip around you guys can see it's very
thin but it actually is a little bit
heavier than an ultrabook my ultrabook
is actually quite a bit lighter now here
on this side we see the magsafe 2 2
thunderbolts USB 3.0 and headphone jack
so now let's go ahead and open this up
and then not to bore you we're going to
go ahead and do a jump cut and show you
the thing set up okay everybody now that
I have this little macbook pro opened up
let's talk about the retina display now
this looks like your typical 1440 x 900
resolution but it's actually quad times
the pixel rate you get 2 times the
vertical two times the horizont
all creating four times a pixel density
in the same space now you can also make
this green have resolutions that look
like 1920 x 1080 there for doing the
doubling of the pixel rate as well which
makes text look incredibly sharp for an
old guy like me looking at crispix makes
things much easier when i'm reading
writing and just typically using the
thing and that's why i really like the
series of macbook pro the retina display
just really makes it for me so thank you
guys for watching I hope you guys liked
the video I admit I'm still a little bit
 dumb struck from what happened
