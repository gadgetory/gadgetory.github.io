talking about the zero the world's very
first polis cellphone you thinking
yourself holus what does that mean what
means there's absolutely no connections
no outputs no inputs absolutely nothing
on the zero and this is made by a
company I'm not sure if it's mizu or my
eyes ooh it's something like that this
is their very first product and talk
about this product though let's hear a
word from today's sponsor f-secure let's
just face it
nowadays in order to be private
untraceable and anonymous online you
need a VPN and the VPN I recommend is
eff secures of freedom VPN when you turn
on freedom whoever your internet
provider is they can't see what you're
doing and the sites you visit they won't
know your real location either giving
you total freedom while surfing the net
one very important factor when you want
to pick a VPN is that you want to be
able to trust that company completely
running it freedom is brought to you by
f-secure a company that has a 30 year
spotless track record of protecting its
customers security and their privacy and
best of all freedom VPN is exceptionally
easy to use and set up you'll be surfing
the web anonymously in no time so if
you'd like to check out freedom for
absolutely free see the link below where
you can try it for five days without
paying a dime alright so if you're
looking for a VPN check this one out for
five days if you like it you're in if
you don't hey it's free now with that
said this phone coming to market to zero
is twelve hundred and ninety nine
dollars I mean what do these guys think
they're selling a twenty atti founders
Edition I mean come on this phone is
really expensive now before I tell you
why me personally I would never really
be interested in anything like that let
me just talk to you guys about some of
the specs and why I guess they feel that
this advanced technology is worth 1300
of your hard-earned dollars alright so
check this in place of mechanical
buttons you know the power and volume
buttons this phone uses virtual side
buttons these are activated by pressure
sensing technology with haptic feedback
so what that basically means that
instead of having your normal buttons
the buttons just gonna be underneath and
they're gonna be pressure sensitive
because really aren't all buttons kind
of pressure sensitive you push on them
and the pressure makes it do it I don't
know if it's really new or not but
they're claiming it's the newest and
greatest thing let's move on also
instead of a USB port for charging the
zero uses meizu zone Super M charge
wireless technology to fast charge at an
output of 18 watts now on this
particular technology zero says that
they are the very first people to make
this technological breakthrough is it
true it's possible let's see some other
features now check this for data
transfer there's a wireless chip and
this is used for the wireless USB and
this is capable of transferring data
over the air at speeds as fast as a USB
3.0 port okay so my first question is
this USB 3.0 speeds over-the-air do you
guys know of any service out there by
frontier spectrum and you guys in other
countries that know of any provider
service that provides over-the-air
speeds that go that fast for Wireless I
don't so unless the world is really
going to be coming old bluetooth where
instead of having Wireless throughout
your house become bluetooth I don't
really see how that's really going to
pan out I mean it sounds great on paper
USB 3.0 transfer speeds but over the
Internet hmm won't your internet
provider actually had to be providing
you with speeds to match that to get
those speeds if you happen to follow our
channel and saw our videos of CES 2019
we showed you guys a TV that had a
speaker built into the TV no speakers it
was actually built into the screen zero
is replacing the traditional speaker
grills and air places and are using an N
screen audio technology that uses the
screen as a transceiver much like the
piezoelectric tech inside the originals
Oh me me mix now this piece of
technology is two ways to me I think it
is really really incredible that they're
putting this technology and
phone I think it's really nice but
here's the other side of that from what
I've been reading if anything goes wrong
you're gonna have really high repair
cost on this and how strong is a screen
gonna be that has the speaker's already
built into it to me it seems like a
really cool thing you know like on paper
and like the idea but how well it's
going to be executed and how you know
how safe is the phone gonna be you know
I really don't know hopefully we won't
see like unbox therapy doing some bengay
crap with it again and bending the phone
or nap and breaking it but who knows
those guys thrive on that stuff so you
know I think that's a cool technology
but it also lends to the phone I think
having too much technology and one thing
I mean having a screen that's one thing
having speakers and speakers and it's
cool to have two speakers in the screen
all in one but doing repairs is gonna
cost a fortune so instead of having a
standard SIM card the zero uses digital
eat Sims and has an N display
fingerprint reader as well it features a
clean unibody ceramic design and is ip68
waterproof so I admit that the zero does
kind of sound good on paper but it's
$1,300 and right now they're having like
a campaign I guess trying to get up
enough money to make it I think they're
actually a riot right around like
$23,000 they're trying to get $100,000
me personally I would never buy this I
know there's some people out there who
they want to have the bleeding edge
technology so I'll buy anything that's
like that but for me I'm always probably
gonna buy last generation phones because
for me that's just where the price point
break is and I prefer it the screen
having the speakers into it that's a
cool idea there's actually no ports on
it whatsoever so unless you have
technology that matches this you have a
matching wireless set of headphones in
this latter the other which not
everybody does but I suppose that the
people out there who are gonna be paying
$1,300 per cell phone probably have
money for all that crap that's what
they're thinking you know and maybe
that's logic will actually pan out in
the very end I want to know what you
guys think do you guys think that the
technology that we've shown you is
actually worth it for $1,300 for a phone
because I'm gonna tell you for me
personally I am never paying that much
money for a phone unless I can take that
phone take
and stick it into some kind of device
and make it my home PC as well I mean
that's just how it is for me
I mean buying something like that and
paying as much as a video card that's
like we all know it's completely crazily
priced already like nobody can hardly
afford an RT x28 t i-- that's a really
expensive card the founders edition come
on man
only people who really can afford those
are the rich people and lucky people
like me who reviewers who got to have
them in our hands to review all admit
that very lucky to have it you know I
mean and so for me paying $1,300 just
for a phone that in some ways is cool
but other ways kind of cuts me off at
the knees it really does you know it
doesn't have normal technology and I'm
just really wondering how this you know
you transfer rates of USB 3.0 over
wireless is going to work I mean those I
guess those questions will be addressed
and answered when we see the product hit
the market if it hits the market because
right now it's a kickstart and it's like
not even a quarter of its intended goal
of the money so if they don't hit their
goal to money and this product will
never see the light
me personally I wouldn't put any money
this Kickstarter but that's my opinion
we'll have a link down below I wasn't
paying anything for this video we just
saw the story this morning and I was
like thirteen hundred bucks for a
frakkin cell phone seriously like what
is what does it do rub my back made of
gold am I going to be able to like sell
it for food I mean you know I mean I'm
just wondering like you know how it
justifies this price because cell phones
are already like I think at an
outrageous price eight $900 for a cell
phone they're not worth that much just
like you know RTX 20 80 I isn't worth
that much money it just seems like
everybody's just charging a ton of
money these days just say oh hey we can
and is warning the market I feel I
honestly feel there's a lot of things
that are going on the market which are
going to be addressing more here on TECA
tomorrow you're going to see a lot of
changes this year I'm gonna be focusing
on people's I'm just gonna let
you know that right now I've always
tried to be the nice guy and bring the
you know the goodness to the table but
you know what nope people don't seem to
like it and to be honest the I'm tired
of playing the game so for now in the
part of the videos you're gonna be
seeing are gonna be pretty of right down
to the point unless the product is
something absolutely amazing and if I'm
telling you it's amazing that is because
this guy believes
amazing not that I've been paid money
because I'll tell you right now I've
never been paid a cent ever in my life
to say something good about somebody's
product ad sponsors have tried it
they've tried to make me say oh this is
my favorite game this is this I don't do
it and I would never pay like I said
$1,300 for a cell phone that I can only
use as a cell phone to me it's just not
worth it but hey opinions vary let me
hear what you guys got to say peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
