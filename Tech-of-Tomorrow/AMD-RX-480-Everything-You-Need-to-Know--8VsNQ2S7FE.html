TECA tomorrow now you guys know that
yesterday AMD had a giant launch over in
mcallen i want to say very special
thanks to Roy Taylor from AMD for
inviting me to that bent unfortunately
we were just so busy with back-to-back
launches and stuff and my move this is
my last month here that we weren't able
to attend now I guess so this launch
happened and it wasn't exactly as zen as
everybody thought it was going to be but
there were some new products that were
watching the biggest one that's on the
table is a twenty-dollar video card
called the new RX 480 that's right now
the RX 480 is going to be a very very
price card obviously at two hundred
dollars and for what they're saying the
performance levels this is going to be a
card that people who don't have a lot of
money are definitely want to get their
hands on now the facts about it though
are a little bit kind of weird because
like usual AMD's bringing something new
to the table and something old and going
a little bit backwards with this launch
because the 480 is kind of a mixture of
new and old now the way everything's
coming out where everything looks it
hasn't been totally official yet but
it's looking like the chip that's inside
the RX brady is definitely the polaris
tension because the polaris 11 chip is a
much smaller chip and it's geared for
laptop so that's probably not in now
inside this are going to be 2304 stream
processors so that's quite a powerful
car for the price level that it's at
it's also going to have 8 gigabytes of
gddr5 or four gigabytes of gddr5
depending on what model you're getting
for the standard 4 gigabyte are
exploring it's going to have four
gigabytes of gddr5 and only five
teraflops full power now a good thing is
though is that this you know technology
actually in a way is even farther than
invidious because nvidia they brought
their car down to the 16 nanometer few
that FinFET process but now AM he's
taking it to the 14 nanometer FinFET
process so that's even smaller and so
that right there gives a AMD a little
bit of room to play around with for
future stuff that's coming out now going
back to gddr5 oh it's kind of weird
because I would've thought okay well
they at least really use gddr5 X memory
to try to you know pick up the pace and
make it as fast as possible but no
they've taken kind of a step backwards
but at least we're not seeing any
rebranding whatsoever at least this time
the Polaris 10 is a new chip so we're
not seeing a rebranded card over and
over again out there so I know people
like the kicking md how I say oh it's a
rebranded sorry ramble this time it's
definitely not a rebrand now the card
sits though in a kind of weird position
in everything because the 480 isn't
supposed to like blow away everything on
the market this is not Zen and this is
not the biggest player its chipset or
the bullet you know biggest card by
these guys yet this is kind of the very
entry-level car on the AMD sided thing
that's supposed to sit between a 390 out
of 39 TX and if we're talking about
nvidia side of things between the 970
and 980 so it's not anything to compete
with the new 1080 from nvidia it's not
meant to be and obviously at a price tag
of two hundred dollars you know two
hundred dollars being what it is I don't
think it's really meant to compete at
anything it's gonna be costing you know
a four or five hundred our car not at
all and that's a very very sweet spot
for the people over at AMD now I know a
lot of people out there were like
waiting for all these bigger cards more
cpus and there were a few things that
were talked about at the event but the
really big news about everything was the
RX 480
what more can I say now great thing also
about it is is you guys who solved the
1070 and the 1080 cards that we saw from
Nvidia they had a single 8 and power
connector and everybody said hey you
know he could have probably got away
with using the a6 been one and they
could have done that but for the
overclocking purposes they just went
ahead and use a tape and power connector
now the rumors are speculating that this
new card from a and B is only going to
have a single six pin power connector
for as 150 watt you know power
consumption also this is based off their
latest gcn four-point-oh technology I
believe some linear cards are like 11.2
well this is jumped up to 4 so all in
all its new technology for AMD across
the board for this brand new GPU so if
you're out there and you're wondering
hey what's going on what's about maybe
somehow you missed the event i know i
didn't get to miss the event i mean i
missed it i didn't you get to actually
watch it on TV yesterday because I was
so busy working and doing stuff trying
to keep with everything else I didn't
even get to watch the entire launch and
I do all my studies this morning so
that's it folks brand new RX 480
entry-level price is going to be two
hundred dollars 2304 of the stream
processors like i said 150 watts of
power really good stuff right i think so
you'll also be able to obviously use
these things in crossfire mode and build
yourself up a bigger system depending on
how many cards you want to use we were
able to get our hands on foreign a nose
for another bill that we're doing so
it's going to be like a head-to-head you
know battle between green team and the
red team and the VR bill and that's
another thing they're really pushing
they're saying that this core ed can
handle all the Triple A game titles and
it'll handle VR so pretty much if you're
person out there you're looking for that
1080 you're looking for for for TP and
you want a car that's very low price and
it's still going to be efficient I think
that the RX 40 is going to be a really
kick-ass car it's coming to market at
jun 29th so be looking for it I'm
obvious you're gonna have cards here to
test be you guys so we'll see what the
real numbers are then until then I'm our
you've been watching TECA tomorrow and
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
