tomorrow youtube channel live from
planet earth once again we're coming to
you folks now a lot of people out there
know that when it comes to the tablets
pretty much apple has kicked everybody's
butt knocked everybody pretty much off
the map now that said HP did bring out a
tablet that was very popular for a
limited amount of time only and the
prices actually dropped on that I was
lucky enough when the price dropped to
get one from a friend of mine over a TLD
that is pretty cool now I don't really
know that much about the webos at all I
just got this thing a couple of days ago
but I have to say that so far everything
that I've seen about it really impresses
me iona Kendall had a nuk constantly
reading books now we'll just stop right
there any one of those units is between
one hundred and forty nine dollars and
279 dollars none of them contain webos
and even the really best Kendall that
you can get can't even come close to
what the HP touchpad is capable of now
even though it's discontinued you can
still find this product on the market at
about two hundred and twenty dollars in
stock all over the place can't really
find them for ninety-nine dollars that
little limited time window it came and
went I was lucky he's held to be able to
get ahold of one right now I'm just
going to jump in and just show you guys
just a little bit of stuff that I know
on it I know how to read a book on it
I've been on the internet with it I've
checked my email I can do text blogging
I can't do any picture blogging but
beyond that I really haven't dug too
much into it but it's good for listening
to music it's just all in all I'm very
impressed I think for me as a PC user
that I give this thing a thumbs up let's
just jump right in and take a look at
the screen and what some of the cool
stuff about it is so here we're going to
take my first view of the HP TouchPad
featuring the webos right now the webos
is kind of like in a dysfunctional state
really nobody was going on with it it's
so far I've been pretty impressed you
can check your email you can see here go
through on check all your email great
feature you can also read a book the
Kendall features involved really nice
easy very easy to turn the page
if you pick the thing up if I actually
pick it up and hold to my body I can
actually change the angle to anything
that I want if I want to go in the
internet I just click on the internet
internet comes up whatever thing I want
to go in here I just type in i'll just
type in zoo just for the sake of
argument and you can see google go out
and now search for zoo you can't just
type in a regular website and by the way
back here in my very back room my house
so my my reception back here from my
wireless is the absolute worst but you
can still see it works pretty quickly
you can see all the apps here
everything's laid out very well just
very very happy so far what I see for me
this thing that works out very well you
want to store pictures you can store
pictures in here so say you want to
upload some pictures to the web you've
either already got them stored on here
or you've used the snap fitch thing to
go ahead and take a picture of yourself
and do it there's options right here you
can go and you can add more accounts or
you can use the embedded one such as
Facebook photobucket and snapfish
snapfish also works built-in with the HP
software there's a Cameron ball right up
here you can take pictures of yourself
or whatever and upload those right to
the Internet pretty cool feature kind of
like having a giant-sized foam just
without the phone features now if you do
get a phone that has the webos features
you can seamlessly integrate the two
between the two I read about it and if I
had a phone I'd like to do it I actually
have an android phone in between the
Android software and this I would have
to say that so far from what I've seen
this is a lot easier to use it's very
very seamless I like everything about it
I have no complaints it's really just a
crying shame that it's been discontinued
by HP one of the really cool things I
like about this is you see how I have
all these apps open say that you just
want to get rid of a nap you just go
like this just take it slide it on up
get rid of it that apps gone bye-bye app
slide it all over bye-bye app then all
you have to do if you want to open it
and you just reopen the app and then
you're back in easy as pie to click out
of it you just click right here very
simple to use and very impressed I just
got to say it's a very crying shame that
HP has canceled these things but that
said for you pc users where I know just
absolutely hate mac product you can
embrace them in any way
for two hundred dollars this pad
seriously kicks ass I like it you can
read your books you can go on the
internet you can check your email you
can watch movies I don't have any movies
installed I would have gladly shown you
and shown you how good they look at at
1024 x 768 resolution do you realize
that the resolution this thing is
actually higher than the 17 inch CRT is
that were out years ago this has so much
better technology just built into it an
iPad cost six hundred dollars five or
six hundred dollars you can get this for
two hundred dollars so for piece of
users who want to jump in and have a
tablet even though the webos is
discontinued there are enough features
in this I feel to keep this being a
powerful tool for myself for at least
the next year or so two hundred dollar
investment for a couple years I'm glad
last but not least there's only a couple
things that come you get this box that's
what you get you get a charger and then
an inside the box i'm just going to show
you it comes with users guides
warranties kind of stuff and I'll bop it
back out then it has down here some
things on an instructing you on how to
use a touchpad and all that stuff but
that's really all that comes in the box
I was lucky enough to get mine from a
guy over tldtoday you can check out his
website he's also over on youtube and
thanks a lot to him and i'm just glad i
got this thing i'll see you guys back
here and take her tomorrow ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
