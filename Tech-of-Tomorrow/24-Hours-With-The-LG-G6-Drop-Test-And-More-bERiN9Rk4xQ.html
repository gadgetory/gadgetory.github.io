again once again to TECA tomorrow for
another tech video now right now there's
a whole lot of launches with CPUs rising
we've got the 1080 but in the midst of
all that there's also a brand new phone
the LG G 6 now altogether I don't know
if I'd really consider this tone to be a
total upgrade because the features
themselves are going to be like that's
like nothing too great but a lot of new
design implements you make this phone
stand out the very first them is the
screen which we'll talk about also we
did a water test and a drop test this
time so we covered all the things on the
phone so let's check out the specs let's
check out the phone let's check out its
waterproofing and it's dropping and
let's see at the end of the day are you
interested in this I think I am let's go
so let's just start off right on the
front now on the front you can see this
phone supports a 5.7 inch quad HD screen
with Gorilla Glass 5 this thing is
really cool because it's a resolution
that's kind of in between 2k and 4k
being that it's actually 28 80 by 1440
and features 564 pixels per inch for
your pixel density so you know the
screen is going to be awesome you're
going to be able to check everything
else on that screen because you get a
lot of resolution on that also on the
front of the g6 you guys can see at the
bottom is the LG logo then we also have
the top the five megapixel front camera
this features a 100 degree viewing angle
it's pretty nice and then right next to
that we see a speaker one really nice
thing though however about the g6 is
it's bezel it's very nice it's very
smooth and if you look at all the other
models that they've been releasing on
the back they tended to crush and put
everything on the back of the phone you
add your finger reader you had your
camera you had all your buttons
everything was on the back of the phone
well LG's actually changed that now the
designs a little bit different so to
keep the back from being so cluttered on
the g6 they've now moved the volume
rockers to the left-hand side of the
phone and to me personally I like this
feature a lot better so instead of at
the sit here and mess around the back of
my phone to do anything I can hold my
phone in my hand and I can raise and
lower my volume to me that's pretty
convenient let me hear what you guys say
down below you'll also see on the right
hand side there's a storage compartment
with a little dot at the top now this
dot is where you insert your tool and
you open it up and then inside then you
have room for a micro SD card up to 2
terabytes and you also have the SIM card
in there
well it's easy to remove and easy to
replace you can also see on the g6
that there are five different antenna
band one located on the left hand side
two on top one on the right hand side
and then another on the bottom now while
we're on the bottom of the phone you
guys can see the speakers located here
as well as the microphone and you also
get a Type C connection for all of your
charging but what's really cool even
though it's made of metal offers
wireless charging I haven't seen that
any other phone before usually all the
phones that are made of metal you can't
wirelessly charge but the g6 it can be
wirelessly charge as well as being
charged to that type C connection and
you guys can also see on the top there
is a headphone jack so I don't have to
worry about Wireless you can plug in or
be wireless the choice is yours and on
the back of the g6 you can see the
fingerprint reader which also doubles as
the on and off button and located above
the fingerprint reader are the dual 13
megapixel cameras and in the center
there's also a nice life for your flesh
so that's what the g6 looks like
aesthetically I think it's very very
pleasing it's also very ergonomic for
operating I really like the way they
viewed these buttons beside for doing
the volume to me that's a solid plus but
now let's take a look under the hood and
check out the specs powering the g6 is a
Snapdragon 820 1 quad core processor
that also features an Adreno 530 GPU
there are two processes running at 2.35
gigahertz and two more running at 1.6
gigahertz the g6 comes with 4 gigabytes
of RAM and 32 gigabytes of internal
storage but via the microSD card you can
upgrade to 2 terabytes of storage so no
worries there the g6 features a
non-removable 3300 milliamp battery now
some people may balk at it and say oh
that's terrible I don't know for me it's
ok because with the charging
capabilities on the phone that's still
going to be ok because we need a quick
charge you can just use the wireless not
being removable I don't think about them
and go oh my god that's a big deal but
no no is it really let me know your
opinions down below I don't know the
exact length of how long the battery
will last but I'll bring that to you
guys in the full review soon the LG G 6
comes pre-programmed with Android 7.0
nougats so a few folks who want the
latest and greatest it's already inside
like most of the new smartphones that
have hit the market the LG G 6 comes
with some pretty interesting stuff when
it comes to doing all your editing at
all your pictures now we're going to
cover a lot more of that in the review
we can actually touch upon everything
but you guys can see right now for doing
your editing and taking your pictures
this phones pretty cool
it's not as great as a pixel by no means
but it's still pretty decent you get the
things that you want to do done pretty
quickly now as far as taking photos goes
the camera is very very easy to use and
with that giant panoramic view that you
get you can take a lot of different
things and mix a lot of things together
to get cool photography and if you're
wondering hey how does that camera work
in low-light Elric or check it out it
works great in low-light especially if
you're getting attacked by buddy the dog
one thing I think users are going to
like though is that all the features
that you get for taking photos you get
all of those same features for doing
video and as far as the video features
go you can shoot at 4k at 30 frames per
second or at Full 1080p at 60 frames per
second
here is something however that I find
very weird about the g6 now if you look
in the European and Asian market they
have a totally different audio feature
than comes on the American market now
when LG answered this question they
pretty much said that the people over in
Europe demanded higher audio than we did
here in America now I don't know what
you guys think but I kind of think that
particular aspect is some BS why should
we not get the same version and the same
greatest version as everybody else in
the world just like previous releases in
other people's videos I've seen that
sometimes the European models have
better processors they have better parts
LG I just got to say to you this is kind
of crazy
why sells two different phones around
the world give us Americans the same
quality that you're given everybody else
it's only fair the g6 also features ip68
water and dust protection now on your
daily use I don't think you're going to
be jumping into more the 1.5 meters of
water and as long as you don't do that
you're okay so I don't think I'd
actually probably go surfing or go too
deep in my boat and drop it in the ocean
but like if you get it in a sink or
you're taking a shower like I'm doing
here you'll see that this thing runs
absolutely great even after running
water on it even after dropping into the
sink absolutely no damage the phone
turns on and everything works great now
as far as drop testing goes in my living
room we have a nice big area that's
almost pure solid concrete it's
SuperDuper hard and I dropped the phone
many different times on this concrete
floor and there was no damage to the
body and absolutely none to the screen
and I think that's really cool because
it's obviously the new Gorilla Glass 5
is not breaking mini phones their
screens break when you drop them on the
ground or drop them right on their face
but you guys can see the LG G 6 it takes
the lickin and keeps on tickin
all right Tech fans so there you have it
the LG G six and all of its glory and I
don't know what you guys think but just
right off the bat my first impressions
this is a pretty damn cool phone it's
going to come into market about $500 so
it's also going to be pretty affordable
most of the phones I see who the market
lately have been almost from the 7 and
$800 range so that in itself the deal
the screen itself is also something to
behold 28 80 by 1440 with 564 pixels per
inch that's just an incredible screen
and you guys can see the new Corning
Gorilla Glass 5 it can take a beating
and still keep going
most the time you drop your phone right
on its face the screen gets damaged but
this screen it took a beating and there
was no issues whatsoever so that itself
is pretty cool the photo stuff is all
really nice but as far as the general
features go I have to say it's really
not that much of an upgrade in any way
there are other phones that are coming
out to them eight gigabytes of internal
RAM 64 gigabytes of storage so with that
aspect it's kind of a little bit weird
LG right now is kind of in this weird
ground it still seems to me like they're
trying to find their exact niche in the
market but overall I think this is a
very nice phone it's got a little bit of
new a little bit of old and kind of
balance I'm networked down below we'll
have a link we'll have all the specs and
more information about this let me know
do you think this is a good phone or do
you think it should be better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
