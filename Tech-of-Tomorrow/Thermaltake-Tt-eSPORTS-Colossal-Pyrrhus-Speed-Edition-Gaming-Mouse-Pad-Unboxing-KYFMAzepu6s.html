YouTube land all right it's me and once
again buddy the dog here if you guys can
see him underneath me over here maybe
the camera will get him down here okay
see little puppy dog here my little lap
here yep
this is buddy of the dog who refuses to
let me be on camera without him in my
lap but that said we're still gonna
bring you guys an unboxing and unboxing
of what well you had to ask didn't ya
and that said I'm gonna bring you guys
the colossal Pyrus mousepad unboxing
this is the as you guys can see the
speed Edition give me funny ideas out
there
so I guess Spanish it means it's going
to be very fast so today we're gonna
bring you basically the unboxing I'll
set this thing down on a table I'll play
a couple games of it and we'll just
actually do kind of a first look review
all in one of this new colossal Pyrus
from Thermaltake so let's jump in and
see just wTF is in the box so here I've
got it I've got the TT eSports this is
the colossal Pyrus gaming mouse the
speed Edition I mean you guys saw the
box before show you guys the outside the
colossal Pyrus let me get a correction
there it's the colossal buyers there's
the Pyrus colossal here's either side of
the box says that it's four hundred and
forty by three hundred and fifty
millimeters that's the size of it rubber
base design says soft pad for the
hardcore gamer that's basically you guys
can see it through here it says feel the
difference it does feel kind of trippy
I actually have Skye removing a run so
I'll try it afterwards go ahead and just
pull this thing from the box now this is
very very very thin it comes with the
lovely tte sports thing right here I'm
gonna go ahead just pop that off to the
side over there here is the mousepad
it's very very thin it's also very large
so it'll have lots of space for you to
put your mouse on so I'm just gonna go
ahead and set it down here it feels
really really soft and really fast I'm
gonna go ahead and just put the mouse
over here and start moving it around
says it'll work with any type of Mouse
out there especially work here with the
new optical and laser Mouse's that are
out there something it's gonna fast
response times and look it's just smooth
it's large I mean there's not too much
to really say about a mousepad
but I guess it is called the Pyrus and
saying that I mean I'll see you later
though they'll actually go and play this
game again later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
