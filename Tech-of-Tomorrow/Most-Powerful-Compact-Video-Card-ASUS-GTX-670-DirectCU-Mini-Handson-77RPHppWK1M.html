see you guys back here once again on
tech of tomorrow now today what do we
got going on well you guys all love
gaming stuff that's portable and with
that said asus is taking this to mine
and they've created a brand new GTX
that's right a gtx 670 directcu mini
that's right so this card's much smaller
than your average card so it'll fit in
some of those much smaller cases which
in turn makes it very very portable now
asus has all kinds of stuff about their
car that they think is very very
important we're going to first jump in
we're going to talk about the top six
reasons why asus feels this card is one
of their better products and then we'll
jump in take a look at the card itself
its specs and what the cards generally
all about so with that said let's jump
in and let's talk about some of the
specifics of this card the new asus
geforce gtx 670 directcu mini is the
world's first and only small form-factor
geforce gtx 670 graphics card it's
suited for ITX and matx gaming pcs it
also features directcu cooling now
directcu the Cu stands for copper and it
means it touches directly to the GPU
offering better dissipation now it has a
vapor chamber which offers twenty
percent cooler and three percent quieter
performance it also features new and
advanced cool tech fan drives which
offers wider air flow to keep critical
components cool direct power technology
provides high quality and reliable power
delivery to the GPU whether for gaming
or overclocking the card is also made of
superior components it has super a low
power components which increase
productivity by up to two point five
percent compared to reference design
cards last but not least GPU tweak this
helps you modify your clock speeds
voltages fan performance and more via
intuitive interface most gamers out
there have all used GPU tweak it's
pretty easy you install it you just
booted up and it gives you all kinds of
options you can go ahead and overclock
your card you can increase the fan speed
all that stuff all through the
environment in your windows so it's
really really cool stuff now with that
said let's actually jump in and let's
take a look at the card and let's talk
about some of its features alright folks
so instead of giving you
the standard unboxing and all a lot of
people have complained oh man you spend
too much time showing the box so screw
up we took the box out of the equation
but here's everything that comes in the
box you get the card molex connector
speed set-up guide and the driver and
GPU tweak all on that so that said let's
get that stuff out of the way let's set
the car down and let's start talking
about some features now a lot of people
don't know this but directcu directcu to
direct CU 3 which is coming on the
future all designate how many fans are
actually on the card so when this card
says directcu it means it's got one fan
now let's talk about some of the
features now obvious as things in nvidia
geforce gtx 670 pci express 3.0 it's got
two gigabytes of gddr5 memory it's got a
GPU basic lock of 928 megahertz a GPU
boost clock of a thousand six megahertz
as far as good of course it has 1344
it's got a memory clock speed of six
thousand eight megahertz and it also
features a 256-bit memory interface has
a maximum resolution of 2560 by 1600 and
the card sizes in at 6.7 by 4 8 by 16
inches or 17 point 0 1 x 12.1 9 by four
point zero six centimeters which you
guys will see on the screen behind me
alright folks now let's take a close up
look at the card will start after at the
bottom right here we see our pcie
3-pointer face i'm going to flip the
card to the side you guys can see it
takes up two slots here's part of the
direct CU cooling right here these are
some of the aluminum dissipation fins
underneath there you can actually see
the copper on top we have the Asus logo
we have the single fan flip it around to
the backside here you can get another
look at the cooler all those fins going
on there flip it around to the side here
I'll actually actually give you guys
folks a better look will turn this way
first here we see the single 8 and power
connector it's kind of different usually
the power couplings on this art
in this design once again just shows
asus going out of their way to make it
different here we see the directcu mini
now let's flip it around to the back
I'll change the angle a little bit first
here here go the two sli fingers so you
can see this card can be used in a quad
sli configuration I'll flip it over here
you guys can see the direct power
something new there and then last but
not least let's take a look at the rear
io if the camera to zoom in there so you
guys can see that we have DVI one DVI to
standard hdmi and standard display port
and that pretty much wraps it up about
the card alright everybody so there you
guys have it the brand new asus geforce
gtx 670 directcu many a lot of power in
a small package I mean just think about
it it has all the power of the regular
670 all packed into this smaller little
thing so if you're somebody who wants to
build a system interesting take around I
think I'm going to use the BitFenix
that's right there prodigy case I think
this would be perfect for that build
we're looking for something to build
with the steam project maybe it'll go
into that but this car is really good
for people want a really small bill with
all the power that losing anything soul
and boxes those kind of things people
are going to jump on that also at the
