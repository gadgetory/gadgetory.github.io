see you guys back here once again on
tech of tomorrow now today what do we
got going on well you guys all love
gaming stuff that's portable and with
that said Hayes's has taken this to mine
and they've created a brand new GTX
that's right a GTX 670 Direct see you
mini that's right so this card's much
smaller than your average card so it'll
fit in some of those much smaller cases
which in turn makes it very very
portable
now asus has all kinds of stuff about
their car that they think is very very
important we're gonna first jump in
we're gonna talk about the top six
reasons why asus feels this card is one
of their better products and then we'll
jump in take a look at the card itself
its specs and what the cards generally
all about so with that said let's jump
in and let's talk about some of the
specifics of this card the new Asus
GeForce GTX 670 direct Cu Mini is the
world's first and only small form-factor
GeForce GTX 670 graphics card it's
suited for ITX and M ATX gaming pcs it
also features direct Cu cooling now
Direct Cu the Cu stands for copper and
it means it touches directly to the GPU
offering better dissipation now it has a
vapor chamber which offers 20% cooler
and 3% quieter performance
it also features new and advanced cool
tech fan drives which offers wider
airflow to keep critical components cool
direct power technology provides high
quality and reliable power delivery to
the GPU whether it for gaming or
overclocking the card is also made of
superior components it has super a low
power components which increased
productivity by up to 2.5 percent
compared to reference design cards last
but not least GPU tweak this helps you
modify your clock speeds voltages fan
performance and more via intuitive
interface most gamers out there have all
used GPU tweak it's pretty easy you
install it you just boot it up and it
gives you all kinds of options you can
go ahead and overclock your card you can
increase the fan speed all that stuff
all through the environment in your
windows so it's really really cool stuff
now with that said let's actually jump
in and let's take a look at the card and
let's talk about some of its features
punks so instead of giving you guys the
standard unboxing I know a lot of people
have complained oh man you spend too
much time showing the box so screw up we
took the box out of the equation but
here's everything that comes in the box
you get the card molex connector speed
set-up guide and the driver and GPU
tweak all on that so that's it let's get
that stuff out of the way let's set the
car down and let's start talking about
some features now a lot of people don't
know this but Direct see you Direct see
you to direct Cu 3 which is coming on
the future all designate how many fans
are actually on the card so when this
card says direct see you it means it's
got one fan now let's talk about some of
the features now obvious things that
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 PCI Express 3.0
it's got 2 gigabytes of gddr5 memory
it's got a GPU basic lock of 928
megahertz
a GPU boost clock of a thousand six
megahertz as far as good of course it
has 1344 it's got a memory clock speed
of six thousand and eight megahertz and
it also features a 256-bit memory
interface it has a maximum resolution of
2560 by 1600 and the card size is in at
six point seven by four eight five one
six inches or 17 point oh one x twelve
point one nine by four point oh six
centimeters which you guys all see on
the screen behind me all right folks now
let's take a close up look at the card
we'll start off here at the bottom right
here we see our pcie 3.0 interface I'm
gonna flip the card to the side you guys
can see it takes up two slots here's
part of the direct Cu cooling right here
these are some of the aluminum
dissipation fins underneath there you
can actually see the copper on top we
have the e Zeus logo and we have the
single fan flip it around to the
backside here you can get another look
at the cooler all those fins going on
there flip it around to the side here
I'll actually actually give you guys
folks a better look we'll turn this way
first here we see the single eight and
power connector it's kind of different
usually the power couplings on this are
different than this design once again
just shows Asus going out of their way
to make it different here we see the
direct Cu mini now let's flip it around
to the back I'll change the angle a
little bit first here here go the two
SLI fingers so you can see this card can
be used in a quad SLI configuration I'll
flip it over here you guys can see the
direct power something new there and
then last but not least let's take a
look at the rear i/o if the camera does
zoom in there so you guys can see that
we have DVI one DVI two standard HDMI
and standard DisplayPort and that pretty
much wraps it up about the card
alright everybody so there you guys have
it the brand new Asus GeForce GTX 670
Direct see you many a lot of power in a
small package I mean just think about it
it has all the power of the regular 670
all packed into this smaller little
thing so if you're somebody who wants to
build a system interesting to take
around I think I'm gonna use the
BitFenix that's right there prodigy case
I think this would be perfect for that
build we're looking for something to
build with the steam project maybe it'll
go into that but this car is really good
for people want a really small build
with all the power that losing anything
so land boxes those kind of things
people are going to jump on that also at
