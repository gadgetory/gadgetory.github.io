journey we spent almost five days in
Vegas checking out the show and we got
to see a lot of stuff at the show I know
there's been a lot of other videos that
have been out about the show but this is
our complete take on what we saw we had
a really good time walking the floor
we met with lots of cool people in
hotels and stuff at their Suites you
guys have seen those videos but now
let's take a look at what we saw on the
showroom floor and all the cool things
that there were to see at CES 2019 let's
go
one of the very first things we saw at
CES 2019 was a bendable screen from
royal now these guys also have the
screen on speakers a shirt and a hat
these screens were also able to be bent
all the way back if you guys want to
check out more information wobba link
down below to check it out but I gotta
say this is pretty interesting stuff we
all know LG and they had one of the most
kick butt boost at the entire CES 2019
they had an enormous curb screen display
although I don't know if these screens
were able to be you know straightened
out at all they were still pretty
cool-looking
they also displayed a rollable OLED TV
and an 8k nano cell display TV a lot of
cool stuff I have to say the LG booth
just looked incredible all kinds of
visuals as far as the eye could see
and speaking of 8k OLED TVs there's
another small company in the u.s. called
sky worth they also had an OLE a TV
where the sound came directly out of the
screen that's right I said it directly
from the screen and they also had a
see-through glass TV as well so if
you're looking for something really
interesting and not out of the same old
cardboard box you guys should definitely
check out this company's products now
let's roll things back old-school check
it out an Atari pong table that's right
Atari you know the people that pretty
much invented it all now this is the
live version of pong and it uses magnets
to control everything the table includes
lights and an LED display as well as
speakers and USB ports to charge your
devices so if you're into a totally
table of old-school Atari you should
definitely check this out this was the
game that pretty much
got me into gaming if you walk before
CES 2019 you would notice that there are
lots of arcades including
build-it-yourself small kits small
medium and large arcades or displayed
all over CES and here are some of the
coolest ones to show you guys
there was a lot of VR around CES along
with augmented reality demos as well
including painting with AR with an AR
sketchbox
from the company cue pixel this is
pretty interesting stuff if you want to
learn more about it we'll have a link
below for you guys who love to shoot and
blow up stuff this is pretty cool it's a
VR machine gun arcade from the company
VR leo in fact you can actually sit down
and play a beach headlight game in a VR
environment which just looked pretty
cool you weren't actually totally on the
beach but it's still pretty interesting
a lot of people love rollercoasters the
more loops the higher they go the scare
they just love these things but what if
you can actually just sit in your living
room and ride a roller coaster without
ever having to leave your house also on
the floor was a fully built VR roller
coaster which was able to turn the
riders upside down this particular thing
for me got me kind of feeling kind of
sick but a lot of people like this VR
and gentle for me sometimes this makes
me a little bit nauseous and this was
crazy over the top there are so many
gaming chairs out there it's just crazy
but DisplayPort had a full-size gaming
chair rig that actually demoed the HP r3
the high bitrate three so if you're
looking for a gaming chair that's really
over the top definitely take a look at
this portable cameras have come a long
long ways and insta 360 had a 360 action
cam with bullet-time capabilities and an
anti shake feature you could literally
shake this thing and the screen remain
completely level so this is crazy so if
you were out surfing or riding your bike
or some kind of environment that just
totally shakes around you can get a
totally clear 360 picture using this
camera I thought it was pretty damn need
we also saw some cool Holograms using
fan-like devices from companies like
holography and hyper VSN which does 3d
hologram advertising so you've been in
game before you've seen all those
advertisements up in the sky and maybe
someday we'll see that as well for those
of you into robots the company robot s
had small robots out for display able to
sync dance
and maneuver these robots include 3d
printable parts and are totally
programmable
four decks had an autonomous suitcase
that could follow you around as well as
have facial recognition we'll have a
link down below to check out more it
seems like at every CES every year we
see more and more drones and this year
was no exception including an underwater
drone from Nevada X MIT oh I think this
thing would be pretty cool to scare
people in your pool what do you think
talking about robots and drones imrad
had an enormous pong robot called the
four feeis which was actually pretty
good robot versus human we all know the
day's coming you've seen terminator I
know you have I'll be back
3d printers are becoming more and more
prevalent all the time and there were
also a lot of 3d printers on the floor
including a metal 3d printer from
desktop metal we also had a chance to
visit the Inman booth where they had the
905 case out for display as well as the
928 super tower that needs to PS use
that's right two PS use also displayed
was the humongous silver Z tower
constructed of a five centimeter thick
aluminum alloy these guys have some
pretty nice cases we're going to
definitely have to get our hands on some
this year you guys all know the company
razor they make all kinds of gaming
peripherals and they've been around
quite a long time now at CES 2019 razor
showcased their new line of laptops that
include Nvidia r-tx graphics cards along
with the razor phone to the Raptor 27
monitor with cable management and the
tomahawk elite case with tempered glass
panels that close up vertically using
custom design gas piston hinges this
particular part is just like they use on
the back of cars to open your windows
pretty cool stuff this year Intel was
pushing 5g at their enormous booth at
CES and yes I do mean enormous this
thing was huge they were showing the
first-ever 5g Skype call ever displayed
as well as autonomous vehicles and AR
glasses and the last place on our
journey was Sony now Sony had a huge
crystal LED display system set up with
two people racing against each other
along with that they had a couple of
demos showing up their cameras as well
as the PlayStation VR
demos all-in-all Sonia had a lot of cool
stuff at the show to take a look at
alright so there you have it folks our
coverage of CES 2019 we've got another
trade show coming up as well this one's
you know geared towards music stuff this
is the NAMM show which is coming up next
week so hope you guys really enjoyed
this footage we know there was a few
things that we missed like I said we
were really close to gigabyte and
dxracer we wanted to check them out but
for some reason we just walked right
past them because there's just so much
to see at the show but if you want to
get any more information about any of
the stuff that we showed you we'll have
links below down to all that stuff so
you can get more information find out
more about it and see if it's something
that interests you I'm Eric you've been
watching Tekken tomorrow we'll see you
guys back here in the channel for more
tech tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
