tech of tomorrow I Malik Farris with
buddy the dog and we're going to bring
you the unboxing and first look of a
really cool case that everybody's been
talking about this is the NZXT switch
810 now I've heard some people out there
in the reviews call it n Z xt now I've
just got a question for you guys cuz I
understand they do this overseas just
honestly we're in the I'll get the
ed from I mean it's n Z xt right on the
box i'm looking at across the room
where's the ed now either I bike got
lost in the 60s and some drug haze or
something or you guys are just spacing
because over here in the States
everybody calls it NZXT that said let's
get that bad boy set up over on the
table let's look in the box and let's
see what the NZXT switch 810 has to
offer you
alright so here we go we've got the
switch 810 right here on my desk I've
got my giant sword here now this thing
is from Russ Farrell cutlery this sword
is called the frost giant sword it's
right it's cold-blooded cold-blooded
killer sword and we're going to use that
to unbox this thing now in shipping this
thing's been whacked around quite a bit
so I think if I just turn this thing on
its side and do a mighty check this out
and then here we go with the sword
that's right so you saw it here first
the very first super sword unboxing with
the frost giant that's right check that
out it's inside the box now go ahead and
set my trusty sword back here so I'm
gonna go ahead and pour it up its box
onto the old table take the giant boxing
tour right the of the camera Nadia
and then honestly who will fill in the
video if I kill the cameraman buddy the
dog can't do it buddy oh yeah I don't
think he can do it he's not qualified so
this thing out here the giant ain't our
case man this thing is big keep taking
it all out here before even unbox this
thing can you go any further let's just
take a look right at the bottom since
I'm there before I even take it out I'll
go over some features in just a second
here let's take a look right at the
bottom removable dust filters very
nicely done very well made they lock in
unlock rubber feet all the way around
nice looks like you even put some
additional one in there additional one
in there rather so says we already have
their let's go ahead and get it here
remove this all right then kaboom kaboom
got the manual at the case now let's
just talk about some of the general
features of this case so you guys can
see this case is white obviously uh it's
got external 5.25 bays it as for
internal 3.5 days it has nine expansion
slots as far as cooling it comes with
two hundred and twenty millimeter or 240
mm
Peter fans optional depends on which
ones they use the top is supposed to
have 3 x 120 or three by one hundred and
forty millimeter fans or one by one
forty millimeter fan which i think is
included in this one yeah in fact i go
back it says this one has one by one
forty millimeter included on the front
one x 40mm are included for the top one
by forty millimeter included for the
rear and those are the other options on
the bottom it has to buy hundred twenty
millimeter or two by a hundred and forty
millimeters those are also optional and
on the interior it says it as one by one
hundred forty millimeter included fan
from other board support it sports just
about everything eatx XL 80x80 x micro
ATX and mini ITX so lots of stuff there
now we have the case out of the box we
can see here in the front that you see
the five external phase one of them
actually has a front so you could use
your standard CD player and conjunction
with and still maintain the front face
as we move up this piece right hit as
the NZXT logo this piece also pops off
you can see there's a fan filter inside
of this this thing's also removal by
screws I don't really suggest it being
watchful peace and just kind of connect
to your computer we have the first two
fans right here see it's spinning around
in there so this particular front panel
doesn't actually seem like a big fully
pull off I guess it does though I'm
pulling it down in the bottom then we
know about removing it yet you guys can
see there's the on button and something
sliding around inside of there so I'm
kind of leery by pulling the front cover
up and maybe a gamma ship but I guess
I'm scared to the unboxing I guess I
should try to take it apart and see when
you get here so popping piece up there
as you see the whole front piece pops
off given comes with these removable
screen coming out together totally
removable dissect the case spinning
around this is the Bay for your CD
player to make it look flush with the
system guys can see that pretty cool
stuff let's check this out also here's a
removable drive bay right here which can
accommodate your SSD or a standard hard
drive
then we'll move up these are all your
external connections right here you have
one that controls your LED lights you
have your restart you have your
headphone your microphone card reader
dual USB 3.0 dual USB 2.0 and a little
protective cover to protect it all now
let's take a look at the top of the case
their variable little fins here that you
can turn and this thing also completely
is removable now this is an awesome
design for those who are using water
cooling you'd actually be able to fit up
to a triple rad right here in the very
top of this this thing is totally geared
for water clean which i think is just
 cool I really like the way this
case is going so far everything and it
feels quality the plastic is a very soft
plastic there are no sharp edges
whatsoever you can see its quality
painted inside and out very very nice
this is excellent for water cooling so
far so good so now let's take a look at
the way of the case we can see there's a
fan right here there's plenty of
excellent stuff down here for routing
all of your water cooling tubing room to
go n room to go out even additional you
can see you have 123456789 external
bathes so you could probably do 4-way
SLI in this case as well power supply
matter conveniently at the bottom of the
case thumb screws for taking off the
sides we'll go ahead and remove those
now we all the little screws I'm going
to be honest with you folks I do a
little cheating here these things were
not as easy to remove my hand you would
have to probably get a tool to remove
them I am a camera hurt my finger on a
trigger when my trusting eyes and just
use it no big deal they probably put
these things on the tool at the factory
but man where they tell you then let's
take a look at the inside the case and
we move with the case back around by the
way let me hear your pins in the side
window a lot of you guys complain about
we're designs but I think this one's
pretty cool because it's going to show
all your stuff inside of here so you're
not going to really be getting too much
cut off I think it's pretty adequate for
what it is room the side panel very easy
it's not a cheap side pal it's made of
solid metal
very well made now let's get to the
inside of the case a lot of stuff to
look at right here on the side you can
see all of your drive bays just clip and
lock in place with these little goodies
right here Clippy things right here in
the side of each one just pop them put
them back in put a button pop and click
them bring them back in let's say each
one works anyways down here interesting
removable base to the screws they pull
out they also have a little removable
screws right here to do it I'm not going
to just take the whole thing apart
though you guys know what those are then
if I get the camera you get the camera
inside the case we're gonna be kind of a
hard angle let's see if we can refocus
and get in here now inside the case
you're going to see something very
interesting right here we have power for
esata we alter the power for the esata
as well so you can install any say to
drive right in that Bay right there and
all the power in functionality
everything is right inside there you see
we have another fan right here blowing
air up into the system pretty cool
design be cool design I'm liking it now
inside all very very smooth got plenty
room right here to access your back of
your CPU lots of cable routing
management here are all the cables
there's a lot of these here including
the USB 3.0 so like if you're using any
motherboard that didn't come up when a
breakout box you just plug this in and
hey you're up and going flip it around
show you guys lastly the other side of
the case okay now you folks can see that
removing this was a little bit tight as
well but usually from the factory after
all the fresh paint everything that does
happen after that it'll be up to your
discretion now cable management look at
this plenty of room for cable management
can almost fit my whole hand all the way
inside of here plenty of routing
excellent cable service management right
here you just pull your wires in here
and set have to go inside the case and
make messes good cable management you're
not ever going to see this stuff once
you put the back of the side on
your cable management can all be right
effect to the back here on this side you
can see all those removal basehor
talking about right here you can see
there's a flexible membrane no screws
needed got plenty of bays here for all
of your expandability all the way down
and then the bottom drawer there's a
little surprise it's like a cracker jack
no these are going to beat your
accessory products right here your
screws your cables extra equipment all
kinds of stuff they're going to need all
inside this little box so Wow a lot of
stuff here with the NZXT switch 810 so
hey guys you guys see without totally
dissecting this thing and putting a
system it you guys can see this thing
has lots and lots of features this is
actually one of the finest cases I've
ever seen it has everything you need
expandability plenty of room for cable
management lots of bays no sharp edges
ability to get to the back your CPU just
tons and tons of room and also it looks
elegant just from first looks I'm
thinking this is going to be an editor's
choice case here at teco tomorrow but
we'll see once i put a system in here
and see how badass this thing can really
be see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
