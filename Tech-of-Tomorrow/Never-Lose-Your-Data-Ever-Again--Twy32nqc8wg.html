back once again the channel I'm very
glad to see you here now today's video
first and foremost is sponsored by
wonder share and paid by them and it's
about a brand new software program
called recover it now I don't know about
you but I work on my PC and my Mac
constantly back and forth between music
and video production I'm constantly on
my computer and I have a lot of
important files on my computer but every
so often I will make a mistake and I
will delete that really important folder
that I have or document and this is what
I look like and at that point I'm
completely utterly frustrated I met my
ends wedding can you honestly tell me
this has never happened to you before
because happen to me lots of times that
I'm sure for many users out there you've
deleted a file will you just completely
utterly stressed out because the work
that you are doing and something was
important and now it's gone so at this
point you either have two choices either
you you know give up bury your head in
the sand and kick yourself in the butt
for making the mistake or you pay
thousands of dollars to get that
information back from one of those other
companies out there who do that type of
stuff well now with recovery whether
you're on your PC or your Mac with a few
simple clicks of a button you can get
that lost file or thing back that you
lost and eliminate all of that stress so
let's check it out alright Tech fans
right now we're going to show you how
recover it actually works with
recovering a file from an SD card on a
PC it'll work the same way on a Mac as
well first we're going to take a
screenshot so we have something to save
to the connected sd card say jeez Spidey
then we're going to open up paint and
save the screenshot to the SD card
now as we open up the SD card folder you
can see the screenshot is indeed saved
in that folder next we are going to
delete the screenshot entitled find me
again so let's see if we can guys so
long Spidey and for you sceptical fans
out there let's open the trash bin and
make sure the file is in fact deleted
and can't be brought back without
recover it so now let's open up recover
it from wondershare and see if we can
bring poor Spidey back
what I think is cool is that recovered
has various options for different types
of scenarios whether you're recovering
files from a formatted disk your recycle
bin or any other external device recover
it has an option you can also perform an
all-around recovery which will work for
any scenario after you choose a scenario
you'll next choose the drive or SD card
that you want to recover your files from
and as you can see all your connected
drives and external devices are shown
along with the memory capacity of each a
pretty simple and easy to read interface
now that we've chosen the SD card with
one click we can start recovering our
lost files now don't think this process
happens in a snap of your finger because
it does take a while to complete the
process and as you can see we have a
timer about 5 minutes and the time
varies depending on how big the drive is
and how much data you are trying to
recover but you can already see the
screenshot we deleted earlier is showing
up so as we click on the screenshot you
can see recovered has actually found the
deleted picture and we can preview it in
the recovery program on the left hand
side you guys can see different ways of
viewing the files that have been
recovered or whatever files were on the
drive device that weren't deleted as
well
now for the free trial you get 100
megabytes of free recovery memory
meaning whatever you recover you can
save your computer up to 100 megabytes
for absolutely free
now with recover it pro and recover it
ultimate you get unlimited recovery data
and it's really not that expensive
considering its $40 a year or you can
just pay $10 more $49.95 and business
and losing files has cost you a fortune
in the past honestly what is $50 a year
if it can save you all that time and
money and just the absolute stress those
files if you know what I mean like usual
we'll have a link down below hope you
like this video if you've used this
software you've got comments I'm gonna
like to give some feedback please do so
below we'll see you guys back around
Tecla tomorrow for more tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
