didn't think I was gonna be able to make
videos ever ever again but finally after
numerous doctors all kinds of crazy
stuff going on I finally am seeing a
light at the end of the tunnel now let
me just tell you a little story so I go
and see this doctor out here in Moreno
Valley I don't mention his names I don't
him to sue me or anything but I go there
and I'm literally in tears crying
begging the stalker telling him how bad
my shoulder and my neck and everything
is hurting and the guy just basically
takes you know 200 dollars of my money
and says oh hey you know what we'll
schedule for an MRI 30 days from now 30
days from now
so I tell this guy I'm in so much pain
that I just feel like committing suicide
and guess what they try to do they try
to have me committed yeah committed for
insanity so it's okay to leave me in so
much pain that I want to die but the
second that I say I want to die from the
pain I'm all of a sudden this
sociopathic criminal America health you
suck on the big time and a doctor how
dare you threatened to have me locked up
because I'm in so much pain and how dare
you leave me suffering for 30 days with
an MRI I finally contacted a really good
doctor that I have used to see in
Fullerton named dr. Karl has he's a
great guy he scheduled me for an MRI and
that's what I really need
also the diagnosis of Parkinson's
complete BS I don't have Parkinson's
disease so all that stress and all this
stuff that's been going on in my mind is
all for nothing so here's what's going
on I haven't really been able to hold
any food down for literally two and a
half months everything that I've eaten
I've thrown up and in the last 30 days
alone I've lost 27 pounds you guys can
probably see it in my face and my arms
I've lost all my body mass I haven't
been able to move from my bed now the
reason I'm shaking so hard and you can
see right now I'm finally not shaking is
because my blood sugar was down at like
87 and sometimes lower because I'm not
holding any food
so my blood sugar just kept dropping and
dropping and dropping and dropping to
dangerous levels til I was shaking like
a leaf while all of this shaking seems
to have done a lot of damage to my
shoulder and my neck so now they're
thinking that I possibly have a
herniated disc in my neck I finally did
get a shot from another doctor he gave
me a shot right in the shoulder muscle
and it's kind of ease the pain enough
where I can like get out of bed and feel
like doing something yesterday was the
first day that I was able to eat any
food at all without throwing it up and
then today me and Angie the cameraman we
went to be Jason the doctor said you
know what spoil yourself eat really good
food healthy food screw burgers and all
that other crap or anything like that
and believe me my diets completely
changed now the keto diet thing I'm
sorry I'm just not going on it's not my
thing I don't mind dieting I don't mind
eating healthy but I'm not putting my
body through anything else through all
of this I discovered that YouTube videos
everything else in life doesn't matter
except for my health my health is the
number one thing there is and I honestly
haven't taken care of myself very well
I'm always just worried about trying to
pump these videos and do stuff to matter
how sick that I've ever felt right now
is the best that I've felt in
two-and-a-half months and there's
finally a light at the end of the tunnel
because tomorrow I'll be able to get the
MRI I'll be able to find out what's
going on with this shoulder pain what's
going on and get it healed now yesterday
I went to see the foot doctor because I
was really worried about getting my leg
amputated but I went to the doctor
yesterday and this doctor Gaskell it was
a really nice guy as soon as I walked
into his office he told me man you know
what I don't mean to offend you or scare
you but you look like you're dying you
look so sick and I literally just broke
down and started crying again I was
hallucinating and he knew I was
hallucinating cuz I hadn't slept in 11
days I was literally seeing stuff out of
the corner of my eyes it was driving me
completely nuts well he looked at my
foot and everything and I'm not infected
whatsoever I do have an ulcer in my foot
but he's given me some medication and a
new a new type of boot to wear where he
says hopefully with continuous of
treatment I'll be able to heal that and
not
my leg so that is a double thumbs up for
me and being told that I had Parkinson's
disease literally scared the crap out of
me
I cried in my bed shook in my bed and
was just so scared because of that these
doctors out here in Moreno Valley are
honestly the worst I've ever seen and
I'm not directing this towards the
Moreno Valley Family Healthcare Center
where I got my diabetes stuff I've only
seen a guy named Ryan there who's a PA
but all these other doctors I've gone
and spent big money on giving them cash
to find out what's wrong with me giving
me misinformation or not even helping me
I mean literally how would you feel if
you went into a doctor's office in so
much pain that you're crying and you're
begging the doctor to help you he tells
you yeah we'll schedule you for an MRI
for 30 days out so what am I supposed to
do for 30 days I'm just supposed to sit
around and cry and be sick and not be
able to eat or do anything with my body
as I deteriorate because you can't get
off your lazy ass and schedule me an MRI
appointment I made one phone call to dr.
Hess this morning I was crying and I was
upset and I explained my situation and
he instantly got me an appointment
tomorrow for an MRI now it's gonna cost
me close to 600 dollars out of my pocket
which I don't have right now because
I've been working but one way or another
we'll figure that out but finally there
is a light at the end of the tunnel I
don't have Parkinson's disease my legs
probably not going to get amputated and
everything's due to probably something
wrong in my neck or in my shoulder now
another thing that I did is that there's
this this disease out there and it's
called frozen shoulders what the
vernacular is in the diabetic Tim
Babette excuse me the diabetic term but
it's it's has a meta meta medical term
I'm trying to think of as I do the video
without a script I'm just trying to
bring all this stuff out to you but
basically what it is that all in your
shoulder because you're diabetic gets
scar tissue inside of there and when you
get this scar tissue inside of there it
makes it so that your arm completely
becomes eMobile now the only thing is
those when I started talking to dr. Hess
about this he said that wouldn't cause
you to have all the problems you're
having and let me tell you man this is
extreme stuff when
that pain hit I would literally throw up
pee and poop myself completely
uncontrollably because of the pain is
called adhesive capsulitis is what it's
actually called and that and that's that
the terminology for it so what I did is
I went and looked online and the
gentleman out there sir thank you very
much for sending me the message about
your wife going with that procedure well
guess what I did the procedure to my
damn self
my roommate helped me out and it was
probably the most excruciating thing
I've ever done so I got in the shower
I turned the hot water on so hot on my
shoulder that was basically almost like
making me blister and he took my arm and
he jerked it in every different freaking
direction that there is and we pulled my
arm and jerked my arm back and I
literally just threw up poop peed threw
up poop peed until I thought I was going
to die well the next day after that it
kind of moved over so instead of being
in my shoulder it was over in my neck
and I couldn't even move my neck at all
at all I couldn't lay down even I just
sat up in my bed and just sat there like
a frickin zombie literally it was like I
tried reading books I tried watching TV
and something that kind of really blows
my mind too is that I lost total
enjoyment for everything in my life
everything I mean honestly this is the
saddest and most painful time in my
entire life I didn't think that a human
being could be in this much pain I've
had amputations I've had surgeries I
crashed my motorcycle when I was in xx a
to scrape my whole back out nothing
compared to the pain of what's going on
up here
so now they're saying that probably most
likely I have some herniated discs in my
neck and I'm gonna have to start some
some treatments of getting injections in
my neck to get rid of the pain I'm
really hoping and praying that that's
what it is and it's kind of weird as
soon as I talked to dr. Hesse about this
and the MRI was scheduled it was almost
like someone flipped a switch like we
went out we ate I feel a little bit
nauseous but I had a really good meal I
had a really nice meal I had some
grilled chicken I had some other chicken
some veggies and I actually had some
sugar you might say oh my god not sweet
sugar well
your blood Sugar's 87 men trust me you
need to put some sugar in your damn body
and I feel right now
actually more human than I've felt in
the last two and a half months and I am
so grateful to God to all of you and I
want to clarify a couple things - it
seems like a lot of people when I said
somebody aids is that I think I said
that I said atheists don't care about
anything I never said anything like that
of the sort I also never said I hated
AMD people just need to put things into
my mouth and and shove them out there
and try to make them fact what I said is
that atheists really don't believe in a
higher power that's my conception of it
I'm willing to learn atheist usually
believe in themselves and the things
around them it's not they don't care
about anything you guys make it out some
of you anyways making out like oh I said
atheist are just like these cold
uncaring people and that's that's not
the way it is they just have a different
belief system my particular belief
system because of things that have
happened in my life and that I believe
in God and I believe in Jesus that's
just how I am you know whether I'm wrong
right or otherwise that is what I feel
comfortable with and I and I'm not
against what anybody else out there
believes at all you're entitled to your
belief system and who knows I could be
totally wrong you know I haven't died
gone to the other side you know met a
dude named God and came back and said
all right hey here's the proof so how
the heck do I know
that's just my belief system and the
whole thing with AMD I didn't like being
controlled by people they're trying to
tell me what to do because that's just
completely wrong and that doesn't bring
you any accurate reviews whatsoever and
I still we've gone through three
motherboards three CPUs multiple power
supplies I cannot get the rise into
system to go at all I don't know what's
going on with it I'm almost ready just
to like just go uh-huh
we're gonna once again called Peter
Ramos tomorrow over at AMD and Peter's a
guy that I worked with a long time ago
back in the ATI days he's a straight
shooter and a good guy and I'm glad at a
contact there
that I know from the past but there's
just something up with this I know a lot
of people say okay you know you've got
to change all this stuff and upgrade the
voltage or the memory knowledge stuff
well that's not truly an out-of-the-box
experience if I have to get something
going and change everything like an
overclock or just to get it to run
standardly that's a major pain in the
butt because a lot of people out there
excuse me
our complete beginners and don't know
how to do this stuff so it's going to be
hard for them we've been doing this for
years and years and years come on three
power supplies three motherboards three
CPUs different cases in the case out of
the case we cannot get it to go into
Windows whatsoever I know some people
are saying oh you need to buy thirty-two
hundred megahertz memory really I have
to buy thirty two hundred maker it's
memory or my systems not gonna work I
mean come on this is just crazy stuff I
should be able to take any AMD parts
just like anybody else's parts take them
put them together get a system install
Windows and move on about my day now we
have about eleven days of failure on
Sunday anthing geo cider all day long
tearing systems apart changing stuff
trying to get it we change monitors like
you guys said we've tried every single
thing that there is and still absolutely
no luck and if you think I want AMD to
fail you're absolutely totally incorrect
I want AMD to succeed you cannot have
monopoly America I don't want Intel to
be the sole thing that we go to you if
you think that you really have no idea
who I am or what I'm about I'm into
technology and I want AMD to succeed
just as much as all the AMD fans even
though I'm not a crazy fanboy he's gonna
basically throw myself on a stake and
act like I'm a mad murderer over it I
want them to succeed at the end of the
day I want people to have choice and to
be able to buy an affordable choice for
themselves so please quit like feeding
all these things and assuming things
about me that are completely wrong I'm a
really nice guy I know myself I know my
heart I've helped people my whole life
helping them doing things to them and
bending over backwards to help make
other people's lives better
I'm not some evil guy who's over here
plotting against people and hating a and
B it's just not me whatsoever so to wrap
this video up hopefully tomorrow my MRI
will tell exactly what is going on I
will finally get the proper medication
and get myself healed and begin to come
back on a road of recovery where I can
be a normal youtuber again and bring you
guys videos like I was before almost
every day because I really like bringing
you guys videos and yeah I admit
sometimes I make mistakes I'm human I'm
probably gonna make mistakes into the
future I thought we were an online
family we can all learn together I never
claimed
that I am the absolute most smartest
tech guru in the world I've never ever
said that I'm just an enthusiast like
you I like to play games I like to build
systems I really like the way cool
systems look and all the parts of them
the way they glow the RGB just I'm into
all that stuff it's just totally cool so
please chill hopefully I'm going to be
better I will bring you guys an update
in a couple of days I probably will have
to still take a couple more days off
because obviously if they start giving
me injections stuff it's probably going
to hurt me and I'm really hoping that
tonight I'll get my first night of solid
sleep that I've had I do feel right at
this point I guess just because the very
fact that I think I have hope now I feel
better inside I thank all the people out
there who sent me their wonderful
messages you guys are awesome hearing
your personal stories I know for a fact
that I am by no means in in this boat by
myself
there are thousands of people out there
suffering who've had their wives die
their family members died their parents
died and all these bad things that
happened to them and hurt them and I'm
really sorry for you people I really do
I feel bad for you it hurts me to see
those message from you honestly it does
it hurts me to see people talking about
their family members who died and the
pain that causes them and and I hope
that they in through all this I haven't
caused any of you any pain I've been
just struggling so hard to find a
balance with this pain in my life that
it's literally drove me crazy and trust
me if you ever feel so bad you want to
kill yourself don't say anything because
they'll lock you up until you're insane
regardless of how much pain you're in so
you're not allowed to be in pain you've
got to just deal with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
