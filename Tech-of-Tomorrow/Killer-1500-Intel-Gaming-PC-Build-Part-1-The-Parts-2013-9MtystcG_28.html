again on the channel and you know what
you're gonna be damn glad that you're
here where are you well you're on TECA
tomorrow we're bringing you all the tech
all the time and today we're going to be
bringing you a series of videos this
video being number one this is a $1,500
as well system that we're gonna be
building and giving away to one lucky
winner now this system features the gtx
770 and this project is actually brought
to you by myself and duncan 330 303 and
we're gonna be building the system
showing you guys a video of the build
and then actually giving this system
away to one of you lucky winners so hey
with that said let's jump in let's check
out all the cards and let's see what the
system is all about it's madness
so let's start out folks with the case
we got the thermal take the revote gene
snow edition mid tower case this thing's
worth about a hundred and thirty-five
bucks
next up we have the motherboard the
gigabyte z87 x - d3h this motherboard is
coming into town about a hundred and
fifty dollars
next up the Intel i5 46 70 K that's
right this bad boys unlocked and coming
to market are about two hundred and
thirty dollars next up the cooler the
thermal take Frio extreme cpu cooler
coming to market on about a hundred
dollars now we have the video card the
gigabyte gtx 770 windforce overclocked
edition this things come into market at
about four hundred and ten dollars
next up is the memory we have eight
gigabytes of a data XP g 1600 megahertz
ddr3 memory this stuff comes in the
market at $80 and actually really
matches this build quite well next we
have the SSD by a data this is the SP
600 so a hundred twenty eight gigabyte
SATA 3 SSD coming to market about 110
dollars now for the storage drive
we have the western digital one terabyte
black hard drive most popular drive in
the market coming in at about $90 for
the power supply we have the Thermaltake
smart series 650 watt power supply that
comes to market at about $75 next up we
have the optical drive which is the
Samsung SH -
4bd it's a DVD + RW combo this is coming
to market about $20.00 now a lot of
people have debated on this whether the
windows 7 is part of the build or not we
decided we'd throw it in there that way
we just eliminate that altogether so
Windows 7 home premium comes in at $90
for a grand total of fourteen hundred
and ninety dollars now obviously prices
fluctuate the prices that you see today
are based off the market value as of
today they might change as a future
comes around plus if any of you guys

button and we'll know we'll keep doing
things for you guys now this is also
