welcome back to another edition of top
tech under fifty dollars I'm elric let's
check it
with the 12 hour battery life the status
audio bt1 bluetooth wireless headphones
are pretty decent set of cans for under
forty dollars the status BTW ones offer
a very flexible headband as well and
it's very very minimalistic in its
design all the controls are located on
one side which include the power volume
control and finally the micro USB jack
the status BTW ones may not be the
absolute best built set of cans you can
get but they are so lightweight it's
like having a feather on your head next
up is the thing charger now this is a
device I pretty much think anybody can
use inside their home because it not
only doubles as a wall plug it's
actually a charger for all of your smart
devices so let's check this puppy out
it's only thirty nine dollars and it's
very functional with a thing charger you
can charge virtually any device
regardless of the maker the thing
charger offers smart device charging on
the top on the front you see two
standard wall plugs and on the very
bottom there are two USB plugs and on
the back there are two separate tips for
charging your different devices now I
don't know about you folks but I
personally do like the design of the
thing charger quite a bit being able to
charge all your smart device on top you
also the two wall plugs and your USB
charger on the bottom that's pretty
functional for being under forty dollars
I think it's a pretty solid value let me
hear what you guys think whoa everybody
was kungfu fighting those games were
fast as lightning in fact it was a
little bit frightening cuz they fought
with expert timing oh that's right next
up I have the empower tripping yeah
that's right that's the name let's check
it out huh so what's up with the free
bang you're asking all right we'll check
it out it's probably not what your dirty
minds are thinking it's actually a
waterproof wireless dual five watt
speaker that features a 4400 milliamp
external power bank stereo sound and
powerful bass for Bluetooth enabled
smartphones now the waterproof feature
is certified ipx4 what this means if you
take it out in the rain it gets splashed
with water maybe you like spill little
drink on it'll be okay but if you try to
put in a pool or anything like that
you'll out of luck all the controls
are located very conveniently on the top
of the free bang your power you're fast
forward pause skip everything is located
there and all your connections are
located in the very back it also has a
kind of convenient rubber-like purse
thing which means you can pretty much
you know hang the free bang everywhere
and get your thing on the free bang also
offers 10 hours of a continuous playback
time or 120 hours of standby I got to
tell you guys the free bang is actually
made pretty durable it's kind of hard
for me to like to show you guys to it
but this thing weighs quite a bit it's
very durable and made very very solid so
if you're looking for something that's
not a pile of junk that's very very well
made it can probably pretty durable I
think this is something you're going to
look at it actually goes pretty damn
loud and fills the room with sound so
for under 50 bucks I think it's a not
too shabby product whatsoever now this
next product is for those who are into
home security or just plain downright
paranoid it's the e let's check it out
the unit we're checking out today is the
first gen official US edition from ye it
features an HD 720p camera that features
night-vision motion detector and alerts
now the heat connects through the Wi-Fi
on your network all you need to do is
simply download the wrap install it and
you're up and going once you download
and install the app you can view a live
stream feed via the e you can record or
you can communicate through two-way
audio
and with the night vision you can also
record in complete darkness another
thing that I like about the Yi is it's
very very flexible the way at the bottom
moves up and down you can mount it in a
lot of different positions and the way
that it offers monitoring features if
you have a baby or anything else you
just need to like get some of the
tension from another room it can be a
very useful product and right now it's
on sale you can get this thing for under
50 bucks next up Death Star now if
you're a person like me you love wall
mount I do the Iron Man stuff the
Star Wars stuff i frickin love it I
can't get my hands on in fact when we
move and we get our new studio shoot
guys gonna be blown to I'm gonna do
with walnuts I'm add up at all just
totally ratted on that same tone I
actually paid 50 bucks when I got my
Death Star globe that I put on the wall
now I was able to find this for you guys
for twenty nine dollars that's right man
now the Death Star is really cool but
it's a wall mount thing it has all these
little things that you stick on the wall
that makes it like look like it's coming
out of the wall and best of all it has a
light switches offers a couple different
modes of lighting so not only does this
thing look totally badass in a dark room
it even spreads light across the ceiling
across the walls everything just totally
illuminating the room and giving it
 bad-ass ambience and hey if
you're a frickin Star Wars fan like I am
may the force be with you there's a
product you definitely want to get your
hands on now like usual all of these
products that you see in this video will
be down below that Lincoln for you guys

didn't have every single product in hand
