welcome back once again to tech o
tomorrow I'm Miller Karros and I'm here
with buddy the dog my co-host say a
little buddy all right guys so what's
going on all right well we're bringing
you guys some top news stories some
pretty cool stuff and pretty interesting
as well now if you were a kid my age
you'd know exactly what Legos are cause
like Legos were a huge thing when I was
a kid and I guess they've gotten you
know even bigger since they have theme
parks everything all dedicated to Legos
so that's pretty incredible but what's
even more incredible is this guy's
dedication to Nvidia because this guy
has made just a giant size gtx 690
replica completely out of Legos I mean
that's the come on a guy takes that
and almost makes it identical looking to
the gtx 9000 most down to the team how
some fool out there left a comment on
the article saying all the insides
aren't matching okay well exactly yeah
obviously he doesn't have the
electronics since Legos are made of
plastic come on fool everybody knows
that but his dedication I give him a
thumbs up why it's it's a salute
a salute how about I salute thumbs up I
give them a salute and a thumbs up a
combo move all in one we'll call it the
salute thumb all right so that's what he
gets
salute thumb because I think that's
really killer stuff if you guys want to
check out pictures and all that stuff
check out the link down there below the
like button where we have all the
details of this over on our website
www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam ination
everything this is gonna be very very
powerful but it looked at your keyboard
while you're playing and
we'll be really brightly lit now I've
heard some people out there in the
comments say hey well you know for a
game where I'm not gonna look at that
ball okay well I look at the keys so I
mean maybe if you're some Oberer game or
you know you know well if you're that
you know that guy from the pinball
wizard you're blind and you can play you
know by sense of something maybe you
don't see the lights but me personally I
really like the lights I think it's
gonna be a very innovative thing and so
these guys have now teamed up with
Corsair to bring this technology to the
table now December 4th this morning the
story just barely broke out and if this
year's CES these things will all be
making their debut so if you're
interested in that type of stuff you
guys can check it out at this year's CES
I'm really hoping that our buddies will
hook us up and we'll get a really sneak
peek right at the beginning and see us
so we can film that and bring that
shiznit to you by the way this year's
CES who we're all going Jesus going
Anthony's going Jonathan's going we're
all going the entire team is going to
CES last year Linus did 40 videos oh I
hope that guy doesn't do 60 this year
cuz damn he's hard to keep up with but
this year we're gonna try to bring you
that many videos that's right we're all
gonna be busting our butts this CES to
bring you as many videos and as much
coverage of the show as we can possibly
do without Keeling over and died oh yeah
that said now last up don't look to do
have you guys heard about it Amazon yeah
you guys all know Amazon is right you
know landed the tall women with nice
alright nevermind but check it out
Amazon now wants to deliver packages to
you guys via drones that's right they
want to send out this drone army to
deliver your guys's packages that way if
they have locations in certain areas
they're saying that you can place an
order basically and get your order you
know an hour or two later if you want to
pay for the shipping so it'd be like
this you know basically you know you
order online or you call or whatever
maybe love a telephone service probably
not because that inquires people and
they like eliminating that they like
computers they just delete click click
delete click much less manpower keep the
savings down I guess but what do you
guys think of this so we're gonna have a
poll over on our website about this we
want to know what you guys think about
own technology and further you guys
think this is like a cool idea you guys
think it's totally just a totally up the
idea and you guys aren't down with it
whatever you know let me know if you're
like in the mode of like hey give me my
shotgun son I want to shout I shoot damn
thing out of the side boy if you're that
type of person you know hey we're down
leave a comment let us know what you
think me personally I'm kind of weird in
the subject I mean I know privacy is a
big issue and I mean I really don't want
somebody's filming around and going
through in my backyard and doing all
this stuff so I mean that could be
really like weird I mean because you
know to me somebody could totally misuse
what's going on with this you could have
these cameras going around collecting
information doing all kinds of stuff and
with Lily with all stuff that's been
going on with NASA spying on you they
even look at what porn you look at now
so when you're tossing off like they
know exactly what you're tossing off to
which is just a little bit too personal
NASA if you're looking pull your head
out of your ass and put your head back
in space yeah that's what we want we
want NASA in space we don't want you up
our asses why we're looking at stuff but
anyways let us know your opinions guys
also somebody's been asking some
question for the first 14 days of
Christmas so every day we're gonna be
announcing the winner on that video so
you go back to that video and as far as
shipping the prizes ago after the first
14 days we're gonna make a video we're
gonna tell you what the prizes are and
then we're going to be shipping them out
to you folks those people who are in
foreign countries remember you will be
getting game codes or something else
because we're not shipping to Timbuktu

still want you involved
