junkies and those otherwise just
blatantly interested in tech Elric
ferrous hair on tech of tomorrow it
introduced to you folks a brand-new
motherboard from the people over at
biostar now Biostar is really aimed at a
lot of the channel OAM market and they
do have a lot of boards there for entry
level and at a solid price and they're
good for overclocking today we're gonna
reduce them to you a brand new board fin
this is their new hi-fi z77 X
motherboard that has a lot of nice
features has a nice layout and really
just has some really new sound on it
called the puro hi-fi so without any
more let's hop in and let's
take a look at this new board from
Biostar
all right folks so first off we can see
this motherboard is a standard ATX form
factor board it'll fit in probably any
mid-tower or larger case works with all
of the new i7 processors LGA 1155
already for Ivy Bridge is also
compatible with the former at Sandy
Bridge processors as well over here to
the right we have the memory 32
gigabytes ddr3 memory dual channel it's
a certified for up to ddr3 2400 when
you're overclocking that number will
probably go down but I best have
basically say if you have an XMP profile
that you want to go ahead and gauge
it'll do that I'm going to jump back
over here I'm gonna come over here to
talk about the power connectors we have
the 8 pin here above and to the left of
the ZIF socket then over here we have a
24-pin power next does move to this LIF
socket area all around here you can see
there's plenty of room for an
aftermarket cooler including water
cooling here comes my cat I guess she's
curious she's interested in BIOS our
motherboards she wants to check it out
we can see what a solid ferrite choke
Heise capacitors there's some also very
very interesting capacitors that
underneath here it's kind of a little
bit hard to see but you can see these
are all very big this motherboard is
actually very good at overclocking a lot
of people don't really realize this but
biostar motherboards work very well in
the overclocking environment the BIOS
has actually been readjusted on this
motherboard and so it should be very
very stable and great for overclocking
now let's move down to the bottom of
board and let's take a look at our
expansion as far as PCIe goes we can see
we have one two three of the PCIe 1x
slots then we have one two three of the
PCIe 16x slots now these will either run
in 1616 4 or they will just run in
single 16 depending on how you're
running them which means if you want to
stick a card down here by itself or to
run 16 by itself here by itself here or
you can just run two of them in 16 which
is pretty cool
now let's talk about the fan headers on
the motherboard and this is some where I
kind of feel that the people who are
BIOS
have really failed and I think you guys
are gonna agree here there's only two
fan headers one up here above the ZIF
socket we can step one clearly right
here and then we see the secondary one
right here on the others if socket
that's one of my complaints about the
board now one of the other complaints I
have about the board right the bat is
the location of the USB 3.0 header now
you guys can see it's right here why is
the USB 3 header located in between my
video cards now that's terrible design
right there I don't know what these guys
are thinking on that I hate to beat my
buddy Jerry up on his design but that's
just a poor design let me hear what you
guys think I'm not really digging on
that at all now I am liking though
however the color scheme the color
scheme of this motherboard and all the
cooling that you can see right here all
very nice has a really cool blue
anodized aluminum look it's very
beautiful I mean actually the board
layout of that is really nice other than
the fact of the headers and that those
two things about the board are the
negative aspects of the board the rest
of it is still really good now it's more
to the right side of the board and let's
talk about our state of support this
motherboard has support for both the new
SATA 3 and SATA 2 support so we have the
top we have the SATA 6 gigabits per
second connectors then down here we have
the SATA 3 gigabit per second connectors
so we've got them both all located right
here right here we can see the BIOS
clear removal you can pull it off with
an EPROM chip and pull that off down
below that we had the mirror it's going
to give you your error codes so there'll
be a bunch of little signals on here if
you have any kind of failure on the
board a little error code will come up
you look in your manual will tell you
what's wrong with your motherboard then
you can try to fix that problem clearly
everything is nice and laid out right
here you can easily see where all the
connections come from your case and
connect onto the motherboard you have
both of your reset and power button
right here then we have a set of USB
headers these are the USB 2.0 headers
you have a comport header oh and you
know what I was wrong I take that back I
didn't see this earlier I was blind
there are actually three system fans so
I'll just take a little bit about the
heat back on that here's actually a
third system fan right here looking at
the bottom there should be a little bit
more but threes not that bad
so I retract my former comment when I
said that was that that was a bad thing
because I were actually through him that
was my bad not theirs so move around the
side of the board now here's where
things start getting really exciting
over here you guys can see it says Perot
high five or puro high five well that's
something very interesting that's right
here on the board HiFi cap high fire
resistor you guys can see oh this is
totally segregated away from the rest of
the motherboard nothing is connected in
here nothing's in here nothing at all
this helps ensure that none of the
electronic noise that you get from the
motherboard is being translated into the
sound components whatsoever and this is
gonna be something very exciting and
we're gonna be doing another video
strictly on the sound of this
motherboard underneath here is their
chip part of their power now let's talk
about the last thing in the motherboard
the rear i/o I'm gonna flip it around
we have a standard legacy keyboard port
we have two four USB 2.0 two USB 3.0
HDMI DVI standard VGA which is basically
gear because a lot of the horror Asian
countries and poor countries still use
VGA monitors and this is meant to make
that compliant I don't like it I would
have much preferred to see a display
port connection on here especially with
Ivy Bridge so it's another slight little
NIC with me but not the end of the world
here we see the NIC 7.1 analog audio now
I just want to make an exit comment
about this because I mean I have the
package here I know that this is a
pre-release board but I'm hoping there's
going to be some kind of breakout thing
on this that has digital audio because
you can see right here everything here
is completely analog the only digital
you're gonna get at all is through your
HDMI port which not that many people are
going to use some people will but not a
lot but maybe they're still making some
changes this is an early release of the
board let me just flip it back again so
you guys can see it this is the Biostar
HiFi Z 77 X so everybody thanks for
watching
this is the world exclusive remember you
saw it here first on tech of tomorrow
the new bio star hi fight TZ 77 X see
you guys back here with more reviews
later freaking biker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
