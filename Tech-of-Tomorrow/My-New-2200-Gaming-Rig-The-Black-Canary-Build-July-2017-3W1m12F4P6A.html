two thumbs is getting a new PC that's
right this guy right here and it's a
pretty awesome PC now the total cost of
thing is about 2200 bucks I'm going to
say off the bat I'm not going to ever
include windows in any system anymore
because I found it you can go download
the windows stuff off of over at
Microsoft and with that particular thing
you can go buy serial numbers for 15
bucks all over the net at all these
weird places so I'm not going to include
windows you can get Windows for cheap
and if you don't even want to register
it it'll keep running forever so you
don't have to pay for Windows 10 so
therefore I'm not going to pay myself
either except for those guys and you
don't need to pay either you guys want a
link I'll have a link down below with a
couple different places that you guys
actually the fans have turned me on to
over on Twitter like I was looking for a
bunch of Windows keys I want to buy to
do stuff and you guys the fans show me
where to go now this particular system
is going to be two things it's going to
be our Intel based gaming system and our
system that we do all the tests on for
the AMD side of things I have a brand
new 1800 X system coming up as well
leave a comment if you guys are looking
forward to that as well but this system
is pretty gnarly we thought we'd do
something different as well so I have
the system one running right here and
the fans coming on which for dance a hot
ass day to keep me cool but you can also
hear how loud it is inside the
microphone this thing is pretty damn
quiet even when it's under full load the
fans only spin up just a little bit more
so all in all this thing is great for
gaming and has incredible parts all
throughout it I mean one of the things I
want to say about the special thanks
right off the bat to Anthea Reynolds our
guy who put their systems he did an
incredible job with cable management in
front I mean you guys are going to see
this check out the back of this thing on
the back side you guys can see that you
can't even really see the cables and it
kind of looks like you're looking at a
display window at a department store
it's just badass he did such a killer
job on this out they're gone we don't we
listened to you guys we don't use any
standard cables anymore because you guys
bitch was castrated mustard and even if
we were in a hot dog and a hamburger you
guys were still bitching if that knows
but anyways you know we got rid of stuff
so no more of that kind of stuff at all
the case pretty much is amazing plenty
of room inside of it and I have to give
special thanks out to people out there
for the video card very special thanks
to Brian Dale Rizzo
he's my friend Nvidia worked there for
years known him for years all the way
back to forever in a day it seems like
he gave me the video Karpis build so
thumbs up
jonathan morrison from TLD he was
awesome he provided me the cpu for this
build my friend who works at corsair
he's a killer guy I don't really mention
his names I don't know if he'd really
want me to do some other thing but he
knows who he is and special thanks to
him as well for providing all the other
parts on here the only thing I really
paid on here was the Western Digital
hard drive so I bought the you know the
one terabyte Western Digital hard hard
drive excuse me but everything else in
this build was provided by the people
who I work with in the industry and my
friend so thumbs up special thanks to
you and it was kind of draining on but I
want to give a special shout out so it's
another fan named Luke he's a friend of
mine he's a Dutch guy and he just
graduated from his business school so
he's going to be moving now trying to
his PC stuff so congratulations to you
buddy for graduating thumbs up on that
as well now you guys can see the cases
of 570 this is from the course of
crystal series and the case like I said
has plenty of room inside and out it's
very smooth
glass panels absolutely everywhere
around the build and it's incredible the
motherboard inside is the gigabyte Gaz
270x designer motherboard LGA 1151 it
can support two-way SLI I decided to
pass on SLI because I'm only going to be
having a monitors 1440 so I'm not
worried about doing 4k or in that stuff
the CPU powering the black canary is the
Intel i7 7700 K a great overclocking and
gaming CPU all around once again we see
Corsair inside the system with the Hydra
series h-11 v I this is an extreme
performance all-in-one liquid CPU cooler
if you guys know about this product it
works really really well the video card
inside the Black Canary is the EVGA
GeForce GTX 1080 T I found Edition
gaming card and we were getting some
pretty excessive overclocking on this
thing you guys can see that our boost
was over 1800 in some instances so
that's just really killer way more than
it advertises on the box our boot drive
is a corsair force LS series 4 to 80
gigabyte 2.5 inch SSD another product by
Corsair and like I said before I bought
my hard drives as the Western Digital
black 1 terabyte this thing is used by
so many people out there seven to
hundred rpms I will honestly say this is
probably the most common hard drive
in a gamer system now the memory on this
bad boy I know you guys are going to
freak out on the price in the memory
because the memory is actually like $300
it could just absolute best memory that
you can get from corsair dominator
series obviously 32 gigabyte kit I mean
ddr4 is expensive it as is but this is
3000 megahertz C 15 memory and I got to
tell you folks if you guys want
something that is completely stable
looks badass
I mean if you have the cash you can get
it luckily it was provided for me so
that's an additional thumbs up on my
behalf powering up this bad girl is the
corsair r MX series RM 650 X 650 watt
fully modular power supply 80 plus you
guys might ask why did I get a lower
power spot on all the other parts are
incredible Ike I said to you guys I'm
really not planning on doing too much
SLI or crossfire in here and if we do we
can easily just swap out the power
supply it's actually not as hard as you
might think since all these power
supplies are pretty much just modular
you just pull the power supply out a
little bit unplug all those plugs and
plug it back in you don't have to really
do any rewiring whatsoever one thing to
take note of in the build if you guys go
out and you guys buy the 570 x case you
guys will see that it says to install
your rad on the very top but we found
installing the right here in the front
made for better airflow and just looked
better all around you guys can also see
that the cable management in this system
is just incredible everything looks nice
and pristine there's nothing that's out
of place color wise or build wise it
just looks super clean and awesome leave
a comment down below if you agree taking
a look at the top of the case you can
see in the right hand size where all
your USB ports are and all your control
ports are and what's really cool is you
can actually control the color of your
LED fans from here as well you don't
even have to go into the software and by
the way all the fans inside the system
are all provided by Corsair I have to
admit that usually when I get a system I
really like the way it looks like just
looking right into the front of it but
with this system the back is just
incredible I feel like I'm looking at a
display store window with awesome PC
component I mean to me this is pretty
much like this like blue alright let me
know what you guys think am i
overexcited because to me this just
looks really cool now with that said
though we showed you the system we
showed you all that good stuff I mean I
think it's a really really super duper
nice system with clean lines and just
nice colors and everything else about it
I know
some people out there going to differ
but that's only one aspect of the system
now let's jump in let's check out some
benchmarks and you guys will see that
we're getting a great boost clock on the
nvidia gtx 1080i let's rock
all right so there you see this system
runs very very nice as it is I know I'm
going to have a hell of a lot of fun
gaming on it up in my room and another
reason why I got the system too is I
hurt my back really bad and walking up
and down the stairway and trying to come
down here and play at night when I'm
just trying to relax it's become my pass
honestly so this distance pretty much
going to be upstairs with me now you
guys can see the boost clock speed on
the Nvidia card is frickin awesome and
it's kind of crazy because we usually
don't get the best you know boost clock
speeds here living in the desert but
I've turned the air conditioner lathe
and kept in the house burning a little
cooler so in this system build with the
great air phone everything great boost
clocks all around the board now like
usual this is not the build all to be
all I am NOT like you know the saint of
build so like I don't need to hear
anything about how you could build it
cheap or anything that you absolutely
could like I said I only paid for one
part of the system most of it was given
to me by my friends in the sponsors who
I work with in the industry so obviously
you can build a different build for
cheaper I'm never disputing that
whatsoever but it is suggested build so
if you're a guy out there you've got the
money you don't care about price you
just want something that works totally
cool that you're going to absolutely
zero problems with looks bitchin cable
management then hey $2,200 for an
ultimate gaming system really isn't that
much and like you've seen in other
videos we all know that SLI and both
crossfire with DirectX 12 just being
 faded out big time so I'm not
really worried about ringing too many
cards except for when it actually
becomes necessary like when the next
series of cards come out obviously from
both AMD and NVIDIA I'm going to test
and crossfire and SLI just you know
because we're going to but that doesn't
mean that I need that in my system a
single 1080i like we didn't even put in
the 4k stuff cuz we'd really think was
going to really beat that that big of a
deal but 4k you were still getting above
60 on every single solitary thing that
there was but my next vid will be about
where I'm doing this and showing you
guys my setup from where game in my room
so I thought I would include it because
I'm only going to be using a monitor
that only has 1440 so I don't need all
that 4k stuff and if that's really
really SuperDuper important to you I'm
sure that we can make something happen
it and we can post those scores to you
but I don't really think that many
people out there using 4k monitors it's
still kind of you know it's not quite
there yet next gen I think
be there but at the end of the day thank
you guys the fans I think this is an
awesome build I always want to hear what
you guys have to say we'll have links to
all these parts down below and I got one
last question for you guys and this is
where the comments section is most
important to me we're going to have a
video on the top five monitors I guess
under 150 dollars or under 200 dollars
so let me hear what you guys prefer top
five under 150 or 200 and please leave
me a link down below to the monitor that
you're talking about so we think that it
qualifies we'll include it in our top 5
video and give you a shout out i'm Elric
peace out if you want those parts like I
said down there below the like button if
you're not something you want to see
more crazy pistas stuff the pc stuff and
come back</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
