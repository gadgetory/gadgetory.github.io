what up rockstars hope you guys like
that intro I know we sure had a hell of
fun recording it for you folks if you
guys dig this type of style please make
sure you guys pound the Whammy hell out
of that like button also if you guys
would like to hear a full download of
this we'll have that in the link down
there below of that like button and we
also have two versions the normal
version and the Canadian version so make
sure you check that out and with that
said let's jump into the unboxing of the
power color Devil 770 so here we have it
like any good unboxing and first look
we're gonna show you ha the box so here
it is the power color unleash the gaming
power devil HD 7870 because it be able
to devil over there in the center yeah
spin the thing around here's some of the
stuff in the back now the really main
importance of this is the cooling
solution some of the other things about
the card are the same as others but all
the parts and the cooling on this or
what make it exceptional they have emi
shielding you can see down here it says
17% more airflow noise level 80% down
temperatures 25% down offers for heat
pipes expands the surface of action the
car with all the cooling fins to allow
greater cooling then over here this is a
big part of it is the Platinum power kit
it is their OC ability it ups the
stability by 20% and the digital PWM
gets up to 90% power efficiency means
that all the power going to the card its
7.1 plus 1 phase so it keeps the card
running stable and cool continuously
with that said let's just show you the
nomenclature right here on the end so if
anybody is looking to purchase this they
can see this is the exact card they're
looking for so let's pop the cap here on
the side here go ahead and pull
everything out this is the very first
power color card that we have actually
seen here at deca tomorrow so that's why
I did such a crazy unboxing so check
that out go ahead and take this little
top piece off now this thing is cool
it's actually a mousepad
so check this out you get this giant
very thick devil mousepad
very thick neoprene rubber good back for
sticking on the surface and smooth top
for your mouse to glide across so that's
pretty cool not many things come with a
mousepad like that I've dipped to see
that then we've got next up we've got
the devil itself pull the wings right
there
open that up you've got your quicks
installation guide
you've got your CD for all your drivers
and all that stuff don't see a case
badge yet you get that the next step are
some of the accessories I'm gonna go
ahead and pull those out you get the DVI
to vga connector DVI to vga not too many
people here gonna be using that but for
some people it might be valuable and
then right here we have main DisplayPort
to standard DisplayPort I could come in
handy depending on what kind of cables
you're using and then we're gonna come
to the card itself and make sure there's
nothing else in here and no if there's
nothing else in there so we just set
that back and start looking at the card
completely sink a beast a bag little
takedown here I'm going to feel you
break out the devil so let's start off
on the back i and you guys we all agree
the cards that have a nice backing on
them are much better you don't cut your
hands electronics no chance to be
showing the card out whatsoever
I love cards that have this back it's
black so it's gonna go with everything
you guys can see the pcie 3.0 interface
down here and obviously we have the
nomenclature the devil HD 7870 s all
right there up here on top you guys can
see we have a single crossfire connected
here on top let's flip it around to the
rear i/o rear i/o features two main
display ports standard HDMI DVI D dvi-i
now let's get to the top of the card and
here you guys can see they used three
fans on here it's like we talked about
earlier there are four heat pipes and
aluminum heat fins all the way across
the card and actually it goes beyond
what most cards have the PCB is actually
quite large you guys can see down here
through the end you can see one of the
heat pipes some of the other cooling in
there
I'm just going to flip it onto this side
you guys conditionally see cooling
through the fin it's red and black so
it's gonna match a lot of different
themes including the ROG theme in case
you want to throw that on one of their
type of systems you could use it would
not be a clash flip it over here
here we see it again the devil HD 7870
two 6-pin power plus the power through
your PCI and that's pretty much it folks
I mean this card supposed to rule in
really really exceptionally cool can't
wait to get an attestation and check it
out but that's it folks you get the card
and you get this stuff right here and
that's everything that comes in the box
of the brand-new power color devil 78</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
