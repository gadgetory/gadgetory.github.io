plus for a free extended two-week trial
period head over to hulu plus com /t OT
hey what's going on buddy welcome back
once again to another edition of
detective tomorrow we've got something
really cool for you guys today the dark
raven mini PC that's right now this
thing is pretty beefy for what it is and
it's actually really really small now a
lot of people out there are two the
consoles there into the xbox one the
PlayStation 4 all these different things
now those things are cool but one thing
that I've always never liked about them
is that once you buy into them you're
completely locked into it and I wanted
something to put in my living room and
we've actually been tossing this idea
around you guys have seen as we planned
on doing this actually last year and for
some reason just with all the duck that
happened we got sidetracked but now we
were actually go back and build one so
with that sit we're going to jump in
show you guys all the parts of the
system now this system is a few hundred
dollars more than an Xbox or Playstation
it's about three hundred dollars more
but like I said you guys play games you
all note that the graphics are always
better on the pc end of things and with
the open architecture of this system i
can change out whatever i want and
upgrade it as needed if in a year from
now my cpu is not fast enough change it
out video card change it out so now
let's check out the dark raven x tekken
tomorrow none of you guys can hear but
the birds they hear but the dark raven
their chirping all around and that's
pretty cool because our system starts
out with the silverstone raven this is
the RV's e01 now the RBZ 01 is a mini
ITX case comes in and market at 85 bucks
and has these features adjustable
graphics card horn which means you can
use video cards up to 13 inches that's
right up to a 13-inch video card in this
little system there are also additional
holes for a single 2.5 SSD our hard
drive or a lange ddc pump it supports
mini-itx and mini
DTX motherboards next up is the
motherboard and msi a 88 x I this
motherboards based off the FM two plus
socket supports athlon a series CPUs and
it also is based off the AMD a 88 x
Bolton d 4 chipset has support for the
32 gigabytes of 2,400 mega ddr3 memory
has support for 7.1 audio and measures
6.7 by six point seven inches it really
squares off for the CPU we win something
that was budget minded but still had
enough power to power the system now the
CPU is based off the richland chipset
and this is the athlon x4 760 k black
edition now this is a quad core CPU
based at 3.8 gigahertz as far as video
card goes we want one from sapphire the
new r7 265 is a perfect car for this
type of build its below priced low heat
low watts and actually plays games at
1080p at kick-ass resolutions for those
folks wondering about the specs of the
card this card features a 900 megahertz
core clock 925 major boost clock
features a thousand 24 stream processors
a 50 600 megahertz affected memory clock
256-bit memory interface and the rear
i/o features a single hdmi single
display port on both the DVI and dvi-d
connection next up is the power supply
now this thing was a little bit costly
for what it is but because of this it's
actually a very nice power supply but
it's also very small and completely
modular the model number of this thing
for those wondering is the silverstone
tech st 45s f dash g as far as the hard
drive goes we went out and we look to
what came in like the average xbox or
playstation and these things were
usually 500 gigabytes now the seagate
that we use is not only one terabyte so
it's twice as big as most of them it's
also a 7200 RPM drive so it runs much
faster than 5,400 RPM
you're going to be able access
everything a lot faster Aang get to your
gaming quicker as far as the memory goes
we used 8 gigabytes of some memory from
Kingston this is the HyperX stuff this
stuff is actually really good solid
memory it'll work across the board in
any system and it's known to be very
stable now although it's true that
almost everything you're going to do on
this computer once you get is probably
going to come from the internet just in
case you got to do anything and install
the OS we went ahead and put in a cheap
slot drive anyways the one I think that
we use this from LG will have a link
down below with all the different ones
so you guys can choose when to stick
inside of years but that pretty much
sums up the build now obviously we use
windows seven point one in there we use
the test system that we have around for
our house you guys want to include that
out there you can but I mean I see
online all the time where you can buy an
OS to twenty-five thirty dollars and I'm
not even talking about pirated one so
the OS I don't really consider that big
of a deal now real quick though before I
jump into the benchmark let's discuss
the total price everything in the system
is a total of seven hundred and five
dollars which like I said it's about
three hundred dollars more than your
average playstation or xbox but you get
all those features and the freedom to
upgrade whenever you want to like i said
before everything will be down there
will it like button the description so
if you guys want to go down and check
out all those parts for your bill you
can with that said though let's go see
how this thing actually performs in
there you have it you guys can see now
at 1080p this thing does some serious as
gaming not as to compare to like you
know the red donnery the extreme systems
no but those systems like five thousand
dollars super systems this thing's seven
hundred dollars I think it's really cool
you guys can see how awesome the Raven
looks the case is really excellent you
can stand it up on its side if you want
to or you can lay it sideways like I'm
doing in my living room for my system
now before I hop out of here I want to
give a special thanks out to hulu plus
for making today's video possible so I
know many of you pc users out there know
what hulu is but do you guys really know
what hulu plus is because who plus is
