technology you guys all know that
Intel's new has well has hit the market
we guys brought you the full review
we've brought you guys some information
from Asus and now we have yet another
unboxing this time the z87 GD 65 gaming
board from the people over at MSI and
this thing's looking pretty cool so with
that said let's do our first on door out
boxing alright folks so here we are at
the great outdoors with the msi z87 GD
65 gaming motherboard they're gaming G
Series you can see the dragon right
there
and here the dog walking around the
background right here they've got this
recommended by fnatic it's got the
killer e 20 200 Network solution there
you guys have all heard of that you guys
can also see here on the front of the
box it supports the Intel
fourth-generation core CPUs the Intel
chipset z87 will just get past that no
you guys don't care too much about that
but now here's the back of the board
here we see the back of the box again we
see the top the name and all that stuff
but then we have some other stuff down
here there audio boost reward your ears
with true quality says they have golden
audio jacks headphone amplifier also
have high quality of audio capacitors
multi-gpu capable they're using the
Sound Blaster cinema now this isn't
actually a chip this is software
integrated it actually uses the ALC 1154
the sound chip we'll get into that in a
second though military class for
Hardware you know that skits could be
high-quality Japanese components across
the board hopefully they'll be nice
black ones so they look really cool on
the board going here we've seen you know
once again the killer there OC Genie for
this is one-click overclocking you click
it overclock your board it's pretty cool
stuff you guys can see right here a
quick pic of the rear i/o and then
here's something interesting for their
gaming device port they're claiming that
both the ps2 and both the first Jack's
right there they're part of the
motherboard are all gold-plated for
great connectivity so with that said
let's get past the box and let's get
into seeing what comes in it alright
folks so first off we're going to go in
here and I'll go ahead and just take the
motherboard out and let's talk about the
accessories pack which is pretty nice
first off
we'll start off with the rear i/o you
can see it's all black color code and
it's got some red color to match up with
the motherboard we have one to update
SATA cables we have the manual the z87
GD 65 gaming right there we have drivers
and utilities II now this is something
actually quite cool check out this case
badge that's pretty badass it's got that
total Ferrari look it actually looks
like the front car ylim that you get in
a car in fact maybe something goes stick
in their car act like they just the
coolest you know saying so stick that
down there also got some electronic
connectors right here for connecting to
the connectors on the board what you
want to do your overclocking and stuff
like that set that down right there we
also have a sign that says MSI I'm not
here kind of like a gaming thing I'm
sorry busy gaming stay away then we get
a giant like how-to
quick installation guide I like an open
whole thing up you guys know what's up
with that now you get two different
types of things in here you get a
software and applications user's guide
as well as the user's manual so all this
stuff right here is will be the content
if you're looking at a written review
let's get that out of the way and show
you the motherboard alright folks so now
we have the motherboard out of the box
like I said before you guys can see it
has that total Ferrari look the red in
the black one with anything is they have
their dragon down here so it's not a
Ferrari it's a dragon up here on top
eight pin power connection then we see
on the board it says digital power so
the whole board has digital power
throughout the cooling solutions right
here ZIF socket 1150 LGA 1150 like I
said for all the brand new Haswell CPUs
that are out there an i5 and i7 now
right here all the memory slots for dims
32 gigabytes of ddr3 first of the CPU
fan headers up here on top another one
off here to the side now I showed you
those little connectors earlier they go
right here this is for like reading all
the voltage everything off of your
motherboard 24-pin power connection and
then right here on the side imma turn
the board to the side right here they
have their a and B BIOS I'll try to get
this up here so the cameramen can see
that better for you folks so you guys
can see right here this is the a and B
BIOS which you switch that back and
forth to biases are right there I'm
there weld to the board but if either
one of them goes bad you can go to the
other one then flash later went back to
normal here on the side we have USB 3.0
connector and then over here we have all
of our SATA connectors and there's two
different types of controllers on here
there's the as media and the Intel the
until supports up to six the other is by
the as media so these are all Intel this
one right here is as media go ahead just
bring the board around again to the side
right here you guys can see the cooling
solution down here really really nice I
like that the dragon now over here
flip the board around again to another
direction hope they get the Cameron to
get in there use him here on the board
we see the mini SATA connection and
everything right here you can plug a
little card in there and automatically
have your boot drive like we did this in
the system that we're building you guys
will see pretty soon and it's a little
tiny little thing right there sticks in
there the M SATA and it's awesome so you
just stick a little thing in there at
really cool I like it a lot so flip
around here again now this board
supports multi GPUs it'll support two
cards in SLI or three cards in crossfire
so we'll start back up here folks here's
all of our PCIe support we have one two
three four PCIe 1x slots and then we
have one two three of the PCI X for your
video cards and such so all over here we
see the audio solution right here I'll
try to get that back up there again for
the camera and take a look at you guys
can see right here all the audio
solution the Sound Blaster cinema as we
scroll up again we see the MSI military
class 4 and then the killer a 2200 Nick
last but not least folks let's flip it
around let's take a look at the rear i/o
here you guys can see the rear i/o like
we talked about before these connections
alright here are gold-plated superior
gaming response coaxial audio as bit of
audio VGA DVI and then over here we have
one HDMI port which is kind of strange
because usually all the video
connections are all right next to each
other
on this board they're split apart here's
that killer lamb we talked about and
there are 4 USB 3.0 connectors here's
our 7.1 analog audio and inside every
single one of these are gold-plated
alright folks so now we're going to come
down here at the bottom of the board
here are some USB connectors some more
connectors here here right here is your
post buttons these things will light up
in different numbers and tell you for
your having a problem with your system
you'll get the numbers up your manual
say oh ok that's the problem then move
forward hope you don't ever see that
here is your go BIOS button next to that
you have your OC switch and then mix
that you have the OC Genie then your
reset and your power switch all located
down here at the bottom of the board
alright so there you guys have it folks
the first outdoor unboxing here on tech
of tomorrow so you guys see it
black and red Ferrari colors of the new
msi z87 GD 65 gaming motherboard so if
you guys are into this type of outdoor
unboxing thing make sure you guys found
that like button make sure we know it
will do more like this it's kind of cool
it's actually nice out here sunny
weather there's bees everywhere but the
animals are out and they like it so hope
you guys like this this board is looking
pretty cool like I said if you're in
this kind of color scheme and stuff and
you guys are looking to upgrade to a new
hassle motherboard this may be one you
guys might want to be checking out so
I'm mark we'll see you guys back here on
tech of tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
